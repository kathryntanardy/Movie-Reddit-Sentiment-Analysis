First, Hank Pym's disdain for Tony Stark and the Avengers have been made clear in the first film, so there's no reason for him to go actively help them out. Scott fought against Stark in Civil War, so I think he shares similar sentiments and he wouldn't have known what Cap was doing. 

Second, the events in New York and Edinburgh were over within a few minutes and involved few if any civilian casualties. After the Battle of New York, the Dark Elf attack in London, and Sokovia, the events at the beginning of IW might have seemed like comparatively minor news. Since only the core Avengers knew about Thanos's plan, no one else would have understood the stakes of what was really going on. The attack against Wakanda also seemed to have flown under the radar, because Fury only received news of it moments before the snap. 

Third, people don't suddenly drop everything every time there is a crisis going on somewhere in the world. Unless it directly affects your life, you tend to still do your normal routine.

* Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly have a great chemistry in this movie and their team-up added a value that I want after the First movie, especially Evangeline Lilly as Wasp. Her fierceness, swagger, and badassery were delightful

* Hank Pym also got few moments to bust one or two jokes and it was fun to watch him did those. I like that when he joked about ""How is School?"".

* Michelle Pfeiffer has a great screen presence even her appearance was not much in the movie. You know, there is something special that make you admire her character throughout the movie

* Ghost/Ava is better than I expected. She is not Killmonger or Thanos, but we know what has driven her to those things throughout the movie and she has clear pathos. Hannah-John Kamen also performed well in this movie and her performance is better than her character in Ready Player One.

* I like that Cassie's Apperance in here is more meaningful than the first one and I like that she became a moral center for Scott. I like that moment when she, Hope, and Scott watched a movie together and Hope ask her what is she going to be when she's older. Also, she was really cute when she had a big smile while watching her dad on a Live TV.

* X-Con gangs were great as usual, Luis is a human juxebox, and Kurt reciting a baba yaga song was hilarious.

* I also like the running gag with Jimmy Woo that he always fail to catch Scott Red-Handed

* I kinda wish that Sonny Burch got more development and so he isn't much of a hatesink in the movie. The Third act was kinda little busy for me but the Car Chases was one of the most creative things in this movie.

* Also, I kinda wish they spent bit more time in a quantum realm, it feels kinda rushed. But the visual was pretty good.

* In the end, I like the movie and I like it better than the first one because the whole cast did a better performance than the previous movie. Plus, I feel like this movie is more confident than the first one **7.5 - 8 out of 10 from me**

P.S. The mid and after credit scenes are nice thing to connect to recent events in the MCU.

200,"Ant-Man And The Wasp is a fun summer action flick that brings a much-needed lighter tone after the heavy-hitting Infinity War. Though never quite reaching the heights of the aforementioned film, Ant-Man And The Wasp does manage to improve on its predecessor in most regards. 

Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, and Evangeline Lily all return as our main characters and deliver well-rounded and realistic performances throughout. Rudd continues to highlight with a great sense of humor. 

The plot benefits greatly from a more realized villain in Ghost. She’s got a fantastic backstory and a believable performance delivered from Hannah John-Karen. Unfortunately we also get a generic, bland villain in Sonny Burch. The performance isn’t bad, but the character is a walking cliche who would’ve been best served at playing less of a major role. 

The plot feels tighter in this one. We’re seeing ramifications from the first Ant-Man and Captain America: Civil War. It’s nice to see Scott struggling with becoming Ant-Man again versus trying to be a father. There’s some great stuff between he and his daughter throughout the film. 

Peyton Reed returns to direct, and I think he did just as good of a job as the original. Some of the shots, especially when Ant-Man and The Wap are enlarged or shrunken, are great. The moment when Ant-Man rises out of the water as Giant Man is awesome. 

Ant-Man And The Wasp is a great example of how a superhero sequel can keep what works about the original and improve on some key aspects to make it better. The writing isn’t amazing, and it suffers from a bit of a secondary villain problem, but it’s a great movie and I recommend seeing it if you’re an MCU fan, fan of the original, or just want some laughs. The humor is even better in this one.

I think the movie was a bit slow-paced to start with, but starts to speed up towards the end with the car chase. I liked the chemistry between Hope, Antman and Hank. Also liked the small comedic moments with Luis and Woo, however I felt Lawrence Fishburne’s character was underdone a little. 

In terms of the villains, I thought Ghost was an interesting character and her backstory and situation gave her some depth, so we understand her motive. I thought Walter Goggin’s character was alright and solid enough, but not anything memorable. 

Overall, the plot felt a bit all over the place, but it got there in the end, the overall cast was pretty good and I did enjoy most of the humour. I knew this wasn’t going to be a big budget MCU movie but rather a “B tier’ film and I think it delivers a fun, enjoyable, laid back movie.

215,"The operative word when one reviews a Marvel Studios film is “joy”. These movies are joyous. They are designed to make you happy. When the obligatory post credit scene ends, the average theater goer invariably walks through the exit door with a big smile on their face, a spring in their step, and a deep rooted feeling in their gut where they are just glad to be alive. Ant-Man & The Wasp may be one of the strongest examples of this peculiar phenomenon.

When it comes to celluloid sagas that comes in many parts, the sequel is often better than the original, and the Ant-Man franchise is no exception. While I was quite fond of the original Ant-Man, AM&TW ultimately turns out to be a funnier, sweeter, more self confident motion picture, and something which I felt no regret whatsoever in spending two hours sitting through.. The characters are better developed than in the first film(Particularly Hank Pym and Hope Van Dyne), the villain has a more interesting motivation for their deeds than Darren Cross did, and the domestic hijinks and family melodrama feel more organic and less cliched. Most importantly, the pseudo-scientific explanation for the mechanics of “Pym Particles” are jettisoned. This time, the weirdness of being able to shrink and grow on command or marshal armies of ants to do your bidding are embraced for what they are, allowing the weird, quirky, wonderful magic of the House of Ideas to take center stage and just do it's thing. In a sentence, Ant-Man & The Wasp is a genuine crowd pleaser.

Marvel Studios makes this all seem so easy, so effortless. Despite yourself, you still want to deduct a couple of star points from your review of something like Ant-Man & The Wasp no matter how good of a time that you're having, because it seems like a magic trick has just been pulled on you, akin to Scott Lang's mastery of close up card tricks. Something this mainstream, something so light and fluffy on the surface and produced for mass consumption can't be THIS kino, can it?

It can, because Ant-Man & The Wasp really is that good. We the public have been spoiled by so much quality superhero films from the likes of Marvel, Christopher Nolan, Brad Bird, and others that we have forgotten how pitiful the genre used to be. Go back twelve years ago and compare AM&TW against something like X-Men: The Last Stand, and tell me which movie is better. Now don't get me wrong, I like the X-Men movies, but compared side by side, it's obvious which movie was made by a committee of money grubbing executives and which was made by people with a genuine desire to entertain their audience.

On the other hand, despite my enthusiasm, I do have to admit that the plot of this movie while enjoyable isn't one of the best things to have ever come out of the House of Ideas. There are certain things about the nature of Pym Particles and the Quantum Realm that still don't make complete sense even going by its own internal logic. There are certain things about the motivations of our heroes that don't make complete sense upon examination either, and there are certain side characters whose motivations seem a bit sketchy as well. These particular characters aren't incomprehensible, they're just not fully realized. In the end, none of it really matters, though, because what AM&TW lacks in cohesion, it more than makes up for in laughter and imagination, two things which we are never in too much supply of.",2018-07-23,"{'neg': 0.032, 'neu': 0.793, 'pos': 0.175, 'compound': 0.9974}",0.032,0.793,0.175

I love that the writers have not tried to make Scott get back together with his ex-wife. Rather, everyone is fine and healthy with the arrangement. Sonny and Maggie are an extended family to Scott rather than, ""This is my ex and her...boyfriend."" It gives Cassie a weird but stable foundation. She loves her dad but loves her mom as well. There is no, she is stuck in the middle. 

The one problem I had with this movie were a couple of jarring edits. For example, one moment, Scott, Hope and Hank are fighting Ghost and Foster. They beat them and the next moment they are back in the lab. No running out and gunning it in the van. No making sure Foster can't follow them. No making sure Ghost can't follow them. Just a very jarring cut. 

What I really did like is how they used the layout of the city fantastically. This story wouldn't have worked in New York or Los Angeles or anywhere else on the planet given the way the car chases went.

The film kind of has less of a focus than the first film but still had most of the same charm. Most of the charm comes from Peña being amazing and Lily and Rudd's relationship, which was great to see growing from begrudging to caring and flirting.

Walton Goggins is fucking brilliant despite having a one dimensional character, makes me really hope that Tarantino is using him as Charles Manson for Once Upon A Time In Hollywood (But probably not). 

I love how generally the Hope is a better fighter than Scott but she doesn't take the whole picture and in many ways you can tell she needs him around. 

Generally the characters are more fleshed out in this film and much more welcoming developed but the plot isn't as strong and confident as the first one. 

My issue is how Ghost is fairly underdeveloped. Her plan seemed pretty silly, and I get her brashness but she could've easily been working with Pym to fix herself up. And she's been this way for a long time, so why now? And sure she's not the villain, more so just someone in opposition to the protagonists with superpowers, but they kinda shove her whole backstory in a one-scene exposition dump. The fact that everything got resolved so smoothly and easily is a bit convenient but it did overwhelm the fact that the start of the film struggled to get momentum a bit.

I was so excited for the sequel that I purchased tickets to the Double Feature Fan Event. As I was watching the first Ant-Man, I remembered how great the characters in the Ant-Man films are. I was filled with excitement knowing that I would soon be able to see the great characters on the big screen again. Needless to say, I had just as much fun with the sequel.

I think my favorite aspect of the Ant-Man films is that they are their own small-scale, (no pun intended) fun adventures. The stakes aren't universal, just an exciting adventure we get to watch our heroes embark on. I enjoy seeing Marvel experiment with unique sub-genres. The first film was a great heist film, and this film is a fun, action-packed chase film. With the film revolving around a chase, we get to see interesting plot points that haven't been explored in previous Marvel films. There wasn't necessarily a villain, but obstacles that blocked our hero's path. It was refreshing to not have the goal of a Marvel film to revolve around destroying a powerful force, but instead rescuing a loved one.

As expected, Ant-Man and the Wasp is a fantastic comedy. There are so many great gags and jokes which make this a fun, lighthearted adventure. The comedy aspect works as a nice refresher to relieve the pain left from Infinity War. All of the characters in this film have unique personalities that all work so harmonious with each other. Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lily have fantastic chemistry. Seeing them work together is an absolute blast. As always, Michael Douglas does fantastic, portraying the wise mentor who still likes to have some fun. Michael Pena and his crew are hilarious, and it's fun to see a group of average guys working with scientists and superheroes.

The film is bright and colorful, the locations are fun, and the costumes and suits look epic. In conclusion, Ant-Man and the Wasp has a unique story which makes for the perfect, fun summer film.

282,"After the rush of elation I got from my initial viewing, just going to recap my thoughts on the movie:

\-Certainly a change of pace compared to IW, but it was needed. The comedy was pretty expected for a Marvel movie, some didn't like it, I certainly enjoyed it, but just my opinion.

\-Ghost was definitely an upgrade over Darren Cross, just much more understandable motivations. She just wants to stay alive. Though I can't help but wonder, did Bill Foster really resent Hank to the point where he was willing to fight against him and possibly kill Janet? (until he realizes the consequences of that later) Couldn't he have put aside his differences with him to save Ghost? I mean, it still worked out, but that kind of bugged me.

\-FBI with Randall Park was good comedy relief.

\-Sonny Birch was a bit over the top and cliché for an antagonist, but he served his purpose.

\-I wish we got to see just a few more Wasp action scenes, the ones we had were fabulous.

\-Speaking of which, I was really pleased with where they took Hope's character this movie. Still cool as a cucumber, but a lot more personable and compassionate when the time comes. I smiled every time she and Scott interacted with one another, and the buildup towards her meeting her mother was great.

\-Hot Wheels car. Ah childhood...

\-Again, Michael Peña is a national treasure.

\-Paul Rudd really nailed his scenes, especially when Janet was channeling herself through Scott. Just superb acting.

\-I enjoyed seeing the asshole side of Hank we saw in the comics, but glad they didn't overdo it.

\-Janet healing Ghost felt like a cop out, given how Hank just told Foster ""we'll find a way"" a few minutes prior, as if there was no other feasible solution other than Ghost utilizing the quantum energy.

\-I was surprised that Janet actually seemed to age in the quantum realm, given how Hank distinctly stated that it ignores (or can at least alter) the fabric of time and space.

\-Is this movie foreshadowing Cassie eventually becoming Scott partner in A4 if he somehow travels to the future via time vortex? She likely wasn't dusted, so I'm guessing she was just out of the house at the time of the snap.

\-If they go the route of the time vortex, maybe Scott will encounter some ripples within the space-time continuum, given all of Dr. Strange's time loops and how ""the bill always come due"".

\-I really wish just one of the Pyms survived that snap, either just for Scott's reaction once the one remaining pulls him out to a sea of dust, or they could have both Wasp and him trapped in the quantum realm. Scott may end up more traumatized than Stark and Cap. What a thought.

\-The post credits scene left me shook, with the ominous silence of the house, the ant going through Scott's routine, unaware of the chaos around him, and the television showing the state of emergency. I brushed it off on my first viewing, but now I definitely appreciate the way it was able to convey the gravity of the situation at hand.

Overall, a good, light-headed, comedic movie that was definitely needed after IW, with a nice callback in mid credits scene to remind us of the state of the remainder of the MCU. 9.2/10 for me.

I though the scene of Scott and Cassie playing together was adorable and wanted to go down that slide myself. The Don't laugh Scene from Cassie broke me. I knew someone was going to get dusted in the end credit scene after Infinity War came out I just didn't expect it to be Hope, Hank and Janet.

The only thing I really want in the third movie, is for them to deal with the loose ends like Mitchell Carson the Hydra agent who stole the Pym Particles and whoever Sonny's buyer was.

I really hope Michael Douglas get's his Ant-man prequel. As long as they use the other characters who should be around during that time period.

A few missed opportunities, I thought. 

There was a really ridiculous “as you know, your father, the king...” exposition at the beginning and I kept expecting the ridiculousness to be acknowledged and kicked into something more interesting, but no they just literally explained to each other what their motives for the last two years had been, and how they knew each other, and nobody onscreen seemed to find it odd. 

And I thought for quite a while they were doing a kind of interesting beat-the-clock thing because they’d mentioned being back by lunchtime, and we got lots of subtle time cues (the X-cons eating breakfast, Cassy’s school having morning recess), and I liked the idea of the entire adventure being fitted into a morning.

Firstly I like how the Ghost isn't a 2-dimensional villain.

Choreography was great,  jokes HILARIOUS(that damn ant eating Fruit Loops) and of course the stingers. Man let me tell you, I cried HOLY SHIT at the top of my lungs when I saw Scott was stuck in the Quantum Realm with the Pym's disintegrated due to Thanos. Then we see the ant playing the drums from the trailers and that quote at the end with a question mark...damn Disney you can really tug at those heartstrings.

351,"Just got out. My first impression: very solid MCU film just not one of the absolute best. I’d say it’s middle of the pack. This opinion could change after subsequent viewings, however. Still very enjoyable overall. Now some notes/highlights for me.

- Wasp was badass and I’m glad she got plenty of time to shine.
- HOWEVER, I also wish we could have seen more of Scott in actual combat instead of just running/chasing things and being used for comedic effect. The whole “suit/powers/whatever not working” plot point I feel like has now been done to death in MCU. I was totally cool with him being sidelined a bit in favor of Wasp, just wish there had been a better reason. 
- Really like that Marvel has been going in the direction of more sympathetic and “human” villains recently. Ghost wasn’t an amazing character imo but she also wasn’t just a generic revenge/power-hungry antagonist so I still enjoyed her more than a lot of MCU villains. 
- Once again found myself laughing quite a bit. One of the reasons the Ant-Man franchise is becoming one of my favorites in MCU. Michael Pena was comedic gold every time he was on screen. Man needs to be in more movies. 
- Both credit scenes were great even if somewhat expected. The second one in particular I enjoyed. I got somewhat of a Fallout-like vibe from it in the way it mixed the humor and absurdity of the film with an undertone of post apocalyptic horror. 
- Cassie was absolutely adorable and in general I loved all the family interactions.
-Woo was an unexpectedly great character

Evangeline Lilly was my favorite part of the movie. She did a fantastic job as The Wasp and I hope we get to see more of her in the MCU. I also appreciate the scope/scale of the conflicts in the Ant-Man movies so far. The first being pretty much a heist movie and the second one being a rescue mission/understand the Quantum Realm by Dr. Pym. Kind of a refreshing departure of the ""Stop the villain from taking over the world/destroying the Universe"" trope that every other MCU hero has to deal with.  


I really only have three main gripes about the movie:

* Did not like how the trailers used every single action scene in them.
* So were they unable to perform some of the quantum tunnel experiments while the building was shrunk down or something?

[Which honestly makes it seem like there will be no Ant-man or Wasp in the upcoming Avengers film. And that Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly will only be in the 3rd Ant-man movie. Because Rudd being stuck in the quantum realm and being rescued could be its own movie, instead of a small part in the bigger picture.

Personally, I think the acting was great, this has a great cast IMO. There were plenty of jokes and the danger wasn't world breaking, in fact it was actually pretty small and personal. The story was short and simple. In fact with the jokes, I felt like this was possibly the funniest and lighthearted Marvel movie to date. Michael Pena and Paul Rudd are just hilarious. 

[Moreover, I was pretty surprised that the side villain was more like the actual villain in the film. While Ghost was more of a 'Loki' type villain. Except of wanting to be appreciated, she just wanted to save her own life, and was also more sympathetic too as well.](#spoiler)

Having said all that, there were a few plot holes in this film and a lot of unexplained things that happened. But for the most part, they were minor and didn't really affect the story in a major way.

I always like how grounded the Ant-Man films are. There are tons of people in the MCU(films and TV shows) with daddy issues, but here in this movie you have Hope and Hank working side-by-side in the film, which is refreshing. I was surprised by the screen time Michael Douglas has, but he has great comic relief especially with Paul Rudd. Hope is also interesting because of how she's part of a family of superheroes... well until that mid credits scene. 

Scott Lang though is arguably the most relatable, grounded Marvel superhero and that's thanks to Paul Rudd's ""everymaness."" Scott's fit for sure, but nothing like Thor or Captain America. He's also smart with his electrical engineering background, but not to the extent of Hank Pym, Bruce Banner, or Tony Stark. Guy is also an average fighter compared to all those martial arts masters like Black Widow, Cap, etc. He's also isn't some quipping machines and a lot of time his humor comes from stating absurdities(baseball cap disguise) or being the butt of jokes too.  

Really like Evangeline Lily's chemistry with Paul Rudd. All the jabs she frequently gave him were great. How did she change into her Wasp costume so fast after the first meeting with Sunny? 

The villains were weak though. Sunny kind of felt like a joke villain, which work I guess given the movie's tone. Ghost was more of a misunderstood villain who just wanted to live. Her powers were interesting though and the co-op attack with Wasp and Ant-Man to defeat her was cool. 

Also the product placements kind of felt obvious in this film especially with Hyundai? That said, was hoping for a return of Baskin Robbins as a joke.

481,"Pros:

-  Paul Rudd is the highlight of this movie and brings it down to Earth. Scott Lang is some average guy who just happens to have access to a shrink suit, Rudd does a good job of bringing out this side of the character.
- Despite the movie taking place BEFORE Infinity War, I did feel some sort of tension when they were rescuing Janet. Which I didn't expect to have since the stakes shown in the movie trailers seemed pretty low and uninteresting to me.
- I found myself laughing a bit more than a usual Marvel movie, which I usually don't do. That was likely thanks again to Paul Rudd and some humorous running gags throughout the movie. 
- I like how Ghost's motivation was not to take over the world, make money, or to just cause mayhem for the heck of it. Not to say those motivations are always bad for a movie, but I do like a break from that.



Cons:

- A lot of the important plot details were just sci-fi mumbo jumbo and it kinda took me out of the movie at some points. That's probably why the ""Do you guys just stick 'quatum' in front of everything now?"" remark stuck with me a lot.
- Ghost's motivations weren't terrible but her blaming Pym for her dad's death seemed like a stretch.
- Sonny (the other antagonist) just seemed like a nuisance and I never felt he was ever a threat to any of the protagonists. Plus his character essentially being unethical, shady business man #198456 is really going to make him forgettable like a lot of other Marvel villains.
- This is kind of a nitpick but Ghost's costume just rubbed me the wrong way. It looked cheap and really uninspired. There was something jarring about seeing it when Ghost gets back to her chamber after stealing Pym's workplace. No idea if anyone else shares that same feeling though.

Overall:

I would recommend seeing this movie. If you just wanted a Marvel movie to ease you back in after Infinity War, this does the job.  If you wanted a Marvel movie that keeps up with the serious tone of Infinity War (or a movie that ties into it ) you'll probably be dissapointed but might get a kick out of this anyway.",2018-07-08,"{'neg': 0.142, 'neu': 0.723, 'pos': 0.134, 'compound': -0.9099}",0.142,0.723,0.134

Overall, lots of hilarious banter from Paul Rudd and Michael Pena as well as plenty of easy to follow and consume action sequences. A few concerns:

1. How did Janet Van Dyne survive in the Quantum realm? What did she eat and drink? How did she speak perfect English after that much time in isolation? (No mental degradation or trauma?) - It felt a bit too much of a suspension of disbelief.
1. Too many flourishes of sciencey gibberish to explain things in the quantum realm - in the end, we weren't learning a great deal other than whether they could progress the story.
1. Ghost was not a rational villain and didn't feel important to this story. It would have been better if we saw more redeeming qualities for her character to allow us to sympathise with her. At the end I didn't really care if she died, she was getting in the way of the main plot.

On the positive,
I loved the dynamic with Scott, his daughter and ex-wife & partner. The CGI for young Hank and Janet was exceptional. Post credit scenes were great and put it back into the context of the whole MCU. The truth serum storytelling scene by Pena was a nice callback to the first and was hilarious this time as well.

When she was talking to Scott when Hope and Hank were still knocked out, to me she was extremely intimidating in that scene with the way she was speaking and acting.

This was the funniest movie i've seen this year hands down, the jokes landed more this time compared to the first one.

One thing I didn’t like was the whole deus ex machina at the end of the movie where Janet simply heals Ghost with her hands but since it’s a family movie I guess they didn't want someone dying (No one died in the movie I think, unless you count the end credits). It felt like Janet was hinting towards mutants with her little evolution and adaptation talk with Hank when she was rescued.

I get that either Marvel, or their hardcore stans I dunno, aren't over The Avengers yet, but change the humour game already lol. Nice change of pace in that regard. 

The dramatic elements to this movie were okay, felt like they were kind of there for the reunion scene. Like the scene where Hank has that existential nightmare thing in his house was interesting and could've really been something, but it felt more tacked on than anything to me. The relationship stuff with Scott and Hope was cute. Ghost was fine. The Luis story thing was cool, but it also felt like ""We gotta get all these done now, people loved it in the first one so one BIG SCENE NOW!"" It was cool tho, Rudd and Lily had fun with it lol. Agent Woo was rad as hell tho, Randall Park is THE best. 

Oh, I guessed three people were gonna be dusted for the post-credit scene - Hank, Janet and Cassie. I would've guessed Hope but I was totally betting she would've been in A4.

-Overall even better chemistry between all the characters- Hope/Scott/Hank and Cassie. Really good scenes between Scott and Cassie in particular. Cassie's mom and stepdad didn't have a ton of screen time, but I love all the family scenes, not just the ones between Cassie and Scott.


-The kid playing Cassie became a much better actress in such a short amount of time. In the first movie a lot of her lines sounded like she had just gotten an off screen parent to prompt her 10 seconds before saying it, and not terribly convincingly. In this one, not only was she convincing, but her facial expressions had a ton of pathos. Her performance was good even by adult standards.


-No origin story frees up a ton of time. The training montage of Ant Man 1 was necessary, but felt so rote, even if they did try to infuse it with as much character as possible, with Scott starting his trend of naming ants there.

-Michael Pena and Co are hilarious as usual, but they were smart enough not to overdo his fast-talking bit even after how popular it was in the first movie. It was great that his sidekicks saved the day at the end, and got them some financial success.

-The humor was always on point, and Ant Man being more of a comedy in the first place, it never felt like there was too much (like with Thor 3!) even though there was more humor compared to the first one.

What I didn't like much was everything to do with Michelle Pffeifer's character. She was a big macguffin to keep the plot moving, but that's all. Everything she did was basically a magic handwave.

Stray Thoughts:

* Marvel’s actor de-aging software is getting better and better.

*  How his being locked up in The Raft (A high security prison maintained by S.H.I.E.L.D) during **Captain America: Civil War** was commuted to house arrest in this film is never explained.

* Bobby Cannavale returns as the husband of Lang’s ex-wife, and his character nicely bucks the trend of asshole movie stepdads.

* The movie could have used a bit more Wasp action, what we got was fantastic, I just wanted more.

* Having enlarged ants as laboratory assistants was bloody brilliant.

* That Janet Van Dyne managed to stay sane while being trapped for 30 years in the Quantum Realm is quite impressive.

Here's my theory that's probably already been said somewhere **(EDIT: THIS IS NOT CONFIRMED, BUT IN CASE THIS COULD BE TRUE, DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT POTENTIAL SPOILERS)**:

>!While Scott is trapped within the quantum realm, he will eventually fall into the abyss of the time vortex. While there, he'll notice there are numerous tears in the fabric of the space-time continuum mainly due to Dr. Strange's time loops. Given that Avengers 4 is potentially casting an older Cassie, it is plausible that Scott will travel to the future via the time vortex, as the ripples suck him into a post Thanos snap world where the effects of it still remains, let's say 10 or so years from the current timeline in the MCU. When Scott arrives, he discovers San Francisco to be in tatters, and when he sees the date of 2028-ish, he is horrified. He seeks to find Cassie, who fortunately survived the snap along with her step father. The three of them are of course overwhelmed with emotion, as Scott explains his predicament, and etc. Maybe Cassie goes to join Scott, rejuvenated that her father is alive, given how Ant Man and the Wasp does have her ask Scott if she can be his partner. Whatever the case, Scott will eventually head to New York to seek out the remaining Avengers, where he finds a dejected Tony Stark, who appears to have aged far more than the 10 years that past, moping in the Avengers HQ. Eventually, Scott is able to convince Stark that the war with Thanos hasn't ended quite yet, and they gather the remaining Avengers to travel back to the battle of New York before the Infinity Stones were located. This would explain why Stark's hair appears to be graying in this picture. Perhaps Bill Foster will aide the heroes in helping them with the mechanics of the quantum realm as they travel to the past.!<

Thus, when Scott is in the Quantum Realm and Hank, Hope, and Janet are on Earth, there's a split second where their radios go out but they regain communications with Scott. Then from Scott's perspective, he loses contact with Hank, Hope, and Janet completely because they're part of the half that Thanos destroys. I think that the split second in which the group on the outside loses contact with Scott is a time paradox that occurs due to Thanos using the Time Stone to ressurect Vision, and that paradox had a direct effect on the Quantum Realm because as we know, the Quantum Realm is subject to the time/space continuum in a different way than the regular plane of existence.

I enjoyed this as much as I enjoyed the first one. I do think the writing is weaker in spots, and some of the humour feels too forced. But structurally it's more interesting, and feels more unique in amongst the Marvel movies than the first *Ant-Man* did. It feels a bit like a caper film of the 90s.

I like how they split up the storyline so the movie didn't really have a villain. There are three separate antagonistic forces, plus Scott's conflict trying to balance the mission with his own life. I enjoy how after *Infinity War*, they decided to go small with the conflict (in more ways than one). It's a very contained story, just trying to save one person and get their family back together without tearing themselves apart in the process.

I loved Eva. Partly I'm biased just because I love Hanna John-Kamen, but also it was really nice to see an antagonist who is purely focused on personal survival. No other Marvel movie has done that. So you don't want her to fail, you're just concerned about how far she will go.

671,"This is definitely not up-to-par with the recent slate of fantastic Marvel movies, nor is it in the same league as the first Ant-Man. The main weaknesses are:

- All the coolest moments in the film are in the trailers! Nearly every interesting size-shifting set-piece, you've already seen if you've watched the trailers. And there's very little more to the action scenes than those size-shift gimmicks. They felt like the center of the action in the first movie, and here they feel like after-thoughts. 
- Most of the humor in the movie is that sort of lazy style of improv-y awkward conversations. You know, when characters just talk to each other kind of awkwardly? And it goes on for like half a minute too long? And it's mostly just funny because of how long it takes? They rely on this waaay too hard. 
- The villain(s) are really underwritten. Especially Ghost. It doesn't help that the plot tying it all together is pretty thin, and pretty much every hero main character is at their weakest. They all had arcs of some kind in the first film; Scott learned to be a hero, (classic but effective) Hank learned to let his daughter grow up and be less over-protective, and Hope earned the opportunity to be the Wasp. Nothing like that in this film. 

There are things that the movie did well: 

- The soundtrack was really good, and on a few occasions I really _noticed_ it and thought, ""wow, that's a really cool way to score this."" 
- The after-credits scenes tying in to Infinity War were really good, and I didn't expect it to happen the way they did it. So here's to another reason to be hyped beyond belief for Avengers 4!
- Michael Pena is still a delight and national treasure.

- The FBI made some pretty dumb moves, especially at the end. [When Scott goes mega at the docks, he's plastered all over the news, so what do you do? Obviously send everyone to catch him in the act, instead of you know, sending just one guy straight to his house to get verifiable proof, and then arrest him.](#spoiler) That said, Jim was amazing and I really enjoyed his character. 

- As much as I love Walton Goggins, I wasn't a fan of of his character. He existed solely to be the fly in the ointment. Yeah, criminals are dumb but clearly this guy is doing really well, what with being able to clear out fancy restaurants with an army of minions and all. After his first ass-kicking by a superhero (where he still got to keep the money FTR) he should have just bailed. Especially when it turns out that there's also a supervillain/ghost women after the same thing. Take your money and run, dude. 

- Speaking of supervillain/ghost women, I wish they had spent more time fleshing out Ghost and the whole dynamic between her and Pym. It was just the whole ""one minute spent talking might clear up a mess of problems"" trope, which I personally find annoying. Hank Pym, while arrogant and selfish, was also the OG ant-man and has shown pretty resolute morals. [Ghost hates him though because she thinks her father's ""unjust"" firing led to her father becoming a black market scientist and exploding. I just don't understand how they couldn't actually go into that more. The one line I remember, Pym was talking to Foster and says that the dad was a traitor or something and then they never bring it up again. Pym doesn't even tell that to Ghost at all. That probably would've been a fun conversation starter while tied up from some who (probably) shouldn't hate you after all.](#spoiler) Still, I liked Ghost, just wish they would've gone over her back story more instead of the walton goggins gang. 

- The overall pacing of the movie felt really off. It just didn't seem like them doing all of that could actually take place over ~3 days, even in movie time. I really wanted to yell at everyone for taking the time to stop and have a conversation when they supposedly have like 2 hours to accomplish their task... Multiple times. 

- Regarding the stinger: [Okay so in IW the aliens show up over Manhattan well before everyone gets Thanos'd. How does that go unnoticed/unaddressed by literally the entire city of SanFran. At least it still should've come up before they had time to make a mini-tunnel and the gear to collect space healing lasers.](#spoiler)

- I fucking love Michael Peña and the X-Con crew. Paul Rudd was great sure, but those guys probably made me laugh the most. They definitely helped making the Walton Goggins Gang okay.

The positive is I loved Peña. The whole X-Con plot line was done spectacularly, and Luis (and the rest of the security business gang) were hilarious. I'm glad my favourite part of Ant Man came back.

Similarly, the whole ""defective suit"" bit was really well done. As was the ""get big get tired"" thing (which was laid out in an early scene and then became relevant towards the end).

Everything else didn't come close. The whole subatomic quantum thing didn't make sense. I have no problem with them not following science (Dr Strange is about wizards and I thought it was awesome). But from a story perspective they just made things up as they went along.

The mom having magic quantum powers and ""evolving""? The ship being able to send signals to the surface, but then not? Putting an antenna on Scott? Being eaten by a protist? That whole part of the movie was a clusterfuck.

I also didn't like how the main conflict was basically sidestepped. The basic premise was Eva needed to kill Janet to survive. This is totally fine, and the building block for everyone's character motivation. And at the end they save Janet and... she magically fixes Eva. No build up, nothing. One second they essentially defeat Eva and the next a magical solution comes through that fixes everything.

There was alot a lot of moments characters just made dumb mistakes (the whole car chase scene, the FBI was incompetent, etc), but the above 2 (the quantum stuff and let-down climax) were the biggest.

The mom having Quantum powers coming out her fingertips came off as EXTREMELY cheesy/eye-rolly. I get that they're setting up for something, but in my opinion it was done very sloppily.

731,"I kinda liked it, and i kinda did not like it. Feels like it had some very wasted potential and the movie just ended up stumbling to much over it self, definetly some flaws with the script and the phasing of the movie. I lost track of all the times they lost the building, paul had to go back to the house, go here, go there, back and forward, made the movie feel very..i won't say confusing, but unnecessarily convoluted in a way. At the same time  the constant re-use of the same locations made it feel a bit bland. I kept waiting for the movie to kick - off and give me that ""okay, here we go""- feeling, it never really did. 


A lot of the jokes did not land (a lot did as well), some felt forced and out off place. Luis voice - over for instance, was once again hilarious and amazingly done by both him and the other actors. But the execution and setting of it fell a little flat since they just shoe-horned it in the middle of the movie, and then jumped in and out of his story and kept the truth - serum joke going for way too long. 

Ghost didn't have a enough time to shine, the actress did great and there was so much potential for a cool winter soldier - esq character here, she looked like a total bad ass, yet we only got a couple of fight scenes with her. Could have made her way more intimidating. 

All in all the actors carried this movie so hard. Amazing chemistry between them, can't think of a single actor i had a problem with, just sad the scrip and directing wasn't as good as they deserved, this could've been the next Guardians of the galaxy. 

Edit: just have to add that this one definetly suffered from the ""Marvel humour"" formula a bit. It wasn't as bad as the worst ones, as i personally found the some of the jokes pretty good anyway, but yeah there was a lot of bad quips / humour in dramatic situations here. That's what made Spider - Man so great, the humour felt on point and natural when it was there, yet it wasn't shoe horned in when the movie needed to be serious.

732,"Miscellaneous thoughts on this movie:

* This is pretty much exactly what you would expect from an Ant-Man sequel. The action was escalated a bit, but it's still more or less the same as the first movie. This isn't the Winter Soldier or Ragnarok of Ant-Man movies, but it's warm and entertaining nonetheless.

 * Villain is created by Hank Pym's past mistakes, but doesn't serve any purpose in the story except to be an obstacle.

 * Scott, Hope, and Hank Pym are still taking the bulk of the screen time and carrying the film with their performances. Scott's daughter also has a small role.

 * Luis is doing the same routine as before. The same joke isn't really as funny the second time, but seeing his perspective of the Scott/Hope relationship was a great moment.

 * The balance of humor, drama, and action is unchanged, but we skip most of the introductions and the training montage to get right to the juicy stuff.

* Quantum physics are magic. There's really no attempt to be realistic here. They just make up the rules as they go, to maximise drama and visual flare. The whole ""Finding Janet"" subplot is riddled with nonsense. Ant-Man had suspect physics and logic in the first movie, but this is kind of getting out of hand.

* I noticed that while shrinking, Hank passed through a barrier similar to the ""mirror dimension"" from Doctor Strange.

* I see a lot of discussion about this movie in relation to Infinity War in this thread, but the Avengers are tenuously relevant to this movie until the post-credit scene. It's a very self-contained story, and the only important tie to the rest of the MCU is Scott's house arrest. The Pyms are also in hiding, but that's not a major change of the status quo for them since they were already conducting their research in secret. Their research is valuable and they have many enemies.

* It's pretty amazing that the 1st post-credit scene is a massive plot twist and must-see sequel hook, while the 2nd post-credit scene is a complete waste of time. I'm getting the feeling Marvel doesn't want to put anything worthwhile in post-post-credits scenes anymore because hardly anyone sticks around in the theater that long.",2018-07-15,"{'neg': 0.113, 'neu': 0.76, 'pos': 0.126, 'compound': 0.7586}",0.113,0.76,0.126

734,"Most people here are talking about the post credits scene and just quoting lines from the movie. Probably because the movie itself is nothing to write home about but anyone expressing that is getting downvoted. 

Randall Park was funny as Woo (although comic book fans should he upset that the MCU has decided to take a bad ass character and turn him into a joke. Classic Marvel). Lilly had the most to do and she's very likeable so that's a wise move. The father-daughter dynamic between Hank/Hope and Scott/Cassie was nice. Paul Rudd. 

Those are the only positives I can think of. The amount of exposition dumps in this film rivals Guardians of the Galaxy 2. And they use the tiresome strategy of splicing in some forced humour so it doesn't get too boring or obvious. The Prologue was needless and an anti climactic way to begin the film.  The amount of times this movie came to a halt to deliver some shitty exposition was frustrating. They completely ignore the ""show don't tell"" rule, just like every other MCU movie. But I guess people are okay with it because of the jokes and it's super FUN! All of these films literally spell out what's happening to the viewer and it's lazy. 

Then you get to the story itself. What the Fuck was the point of Walton Goggins? His character was pointless. He seemed shoved in because they needed more story. He was just a lame, inconsequential character who didn't contribute anything of value in the jokes department as well. Ghost was a shit villain, though I like Hannah John-Kamen. The reason she was shit is because they decided, for some reason, to develop a c-story with Goggins instead of developing what could have been a way more compelling villain.  Janet comes back and I don't even give a shit. She's literally the whole point of the film, but the movie spends so much time focusing on other shit outside of the main narrative that I just don't give a shit about the woman they are all fighting for. Scott, who was a competent character in the first movie, gets the Thor treatment. ""I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THIS CHARACTER SO I'M GOING TO MAKE HIM FUNNY! Because the Marvel universe needs more quip machines. Scott is a bumbling child in this, doing stupid shit at every turn. Why should I root for him? The only reason is his daughter and the way he treats her. Nothing to do with him as Ant Man.  

I'm getting tired of Marvel humour. It's fucking terrible on a second viewing because all it is is quips, awkward exchanges, or a character talking really fast with a straight face. Every character in this universe is just Tony Stark lite and there's no fucking variety. This is a **universe** for crying out loud but it feels fucking tiny when every character has the same goddamn personality and every film ties into the next. It's no wonder the only thoughts people can muster in this thread are to do with the mid credits scene, because they were momentarily reminded of the only movie in this universe that did something slightly different. 

Also, why are people okay with how visually bland this movie is. Or most of these Marvel movies? Comic books are a visual medium and so is film. Why the fuck is it okay that they are continuing to deliver bland cinematography. I guess when a movie is FUN all is forgiven.

I liked the characters, I liked Michael Pena being Michael Pena, the Wasp kicked a lot of ass as well she should, and it was nice to see Hank suit up. they did great stuff with the powers and it was nice to see Scott have more than 2 sizes.  His getting stuck at three feet tall was pretty great.  I'd like to see him use that size more.  

that said, was this a good movie?  Not really.  the opening dialogue was super flat and the whole intro was a bit ham fisted.  /u/fogal__ was perhaps a bit harsh, but they had it just right when they said that making Janet the emotional core of this movie was a mistake.  I literally grew up reading about her, so I had a but more invested, but even I had a hard t ime caring about her till the very end (and if I'm honest giving her first real lined to Paul Rudd, while funny and a little clever was a mistake).  

Basically, there was a lot of design and directorial mistakes (TBH in a movie this big it's hard to say whether that is the director or a producer or whatever, but they were poorly made decisions).  

We didn't really get to see Scott being as clever or useful as he can, which would have been nice.  I'm a big fan of giant-man, but in a movie called Ant Man and the Wasp, i'd like to see them work together at least once without it being a gag about Scott's  new suit.  that felt like a joke that went on too long because it created lazy flaws. 

Basically, the stakes just never went anywhere. the big bad was a guy that either character could have beaten down in half a second and his only real move was running away.  

That's not true.  The REAL enemy was time, but I never really felt like it WAS the enemy because they didn't manage it well.  I never felt like Hank might run out of time (and in fact, he DID run out and still found Janet and it was only about ten seconds later).  I never felt like they were in any danger of missing their chance to get out because it was never really well established what would happen if they didn't.

795,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is probably a kind of weird opinion, but I think this one was actually kinda better done as a movie than Infinity War in a lot of ways. In terms of scope and impact, it's obviously not going for the same thing, but I felt it was structured better and the action was better. Most of the fight scenes in Infinity War were basically ""Hey, the're Thanos, let's run at him"" and then they get swatted away, and when it's not that it's usually some big cgi sludge being pushed towards some other big sludge (like Thor trying to start the forge or the Wakanda Battle). This movie on the other hand, had some actual choreography to it's fights. There were a lot of neat tricks being pulled off with the shrinking/growing stuff and a lot of moments of improvisation or general cleverness that made me go ""oh, that was neat"". I felt the only particularly cool or memorable thing that happened in an action scene in IW was the actual snap (and maybe when they blew Squidward out the air lock). 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as the actual plot structure, IW also had the problem of jumping across like 5 or 6 very different plotlines, which made it feel very choppy, especially at the beginning when it essentially has to start each group's story and get them up to speed with what's going on. It felt like that movie began several times before actually getting going, and each plotline was pretty distant from the others until everyone got together for the finale. Ant-Man on the other hand, set up it's premise very efficiently in the prologue and more or less stuck with it's main thread. You do have it jumping between Scott and the Pyms, Goggins, and Ghost/Fishburne, but each of those three threads is tied very closely and they intersected very frequently, which I felt made this movie flow better. That it wasn't jumping between like 30 different avengers also gave each character more time to shine and I felt like the cast played off each other very well and they certainly got their money from the cast they chose.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I had to pick a weak point, I'd definitely say the villians felt like a bit of a fall-back to some of the less developed ones we've had in Marvel movies, especially the Walton Goggins character. Thanos and Killmonger were great and had very compelling arcs of their own, but here the villians are mostly ""good enough"" to fill their plot purpose. With that said, I actually felt Ghost managed to have some fairly good stuff going on, despite not having a ton of time for development. Her backstory was really interesting and sympathetic, and I liked the different perspective that she brought. She's not trying to take over the world or even do something particularly bad, she's just hurting and is trying to get better the only was she knows. That they actually help her at the end (and seemingly make an ally of her) was a sweet touch and fit with the theme of family. I just wish she had more time to shine. As for Goggins, he was funny but he felt kind of extraneous. That said, it was nice seeing two villains who actually were working against each other from the start instead of the usuall team-up, which I felt gave things an interesting dynamic.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as the humor goes, it's pretty subjective but I felt it worked better here than in Infinity War as well. The humor in IW felt very forced during some of the Guardians Scenes and tonally at odds with what else was going on, but here it came about very naturally and gelled with the lower stakes. I liked the delivery a lot and most of the jokes, be they verbal or visual, worked for me.

Other random observations:

* I wish T.I. had more to do. He's generally a very charismatic presence and I think that transferred well to his acting in this film, but he only had a few lines. I'll definitely keep an eye out for him in further acting roles

* I noticed Ant-Man mention his ""Pep-Pep"" and thought ""hey, that's a Tim and Eric word"". Then I remembered the Tayne sketch. Then Tim Heidecker himself showed up. I liked that Tim's character name in the credits was a typically absurd T&E name

* Michelle Pfieffer needed way less touching up to look young than CGI Michael Douglas in the intro

* I loved what they did with the post-credits scenes. It's so cruel, but I was wondering the entire time how it would fit in. That we finally see the Emergency Broadcasting signal on the screen has me really wanting to see Infinity War part 2 to see how society responds, which I think will be the real spectacle.

Overall, I had a great time. It definitely wasn't trying to re-invent the wheel, but it was a fun action movie with good comedy that flowed well, and I had more fun with it than IW, even if it wasn't as ambitious.",2018-07-14,"{'neg': 0.078, 'neu': 0.715, 'pos': 0.207, 'compound': 0.9992}",0.078,0.715,0.207
796,"My second post on this thread, elaborating a bit more.  

Some background: I liked the first Ant-Man but thought many of the jokes and sequences fell too flat, and the first half of the movie suffered the most from that.  The first half of the plot also seemed too convoluted and silly to me (Hank intentionally seeking out Scott, the training sequences' jokes), but was redeemed by a fun and exciting second act.  It was clear to me the first Ant-Man focused more energy on the second half.

For me, Ant-Man and the Wasp was a major improvement in that the whole film felt like the second half of the first one in energy, spirit, and writing.  This was the funniest Marvel film for me, personally, as I'm not a fan of Thor: Ragnarok's more goofy type of humor that relies on out-of-context one-off gags and jokes.  I loved Guardians of the Galaxy, but that film basically started a trend for sillier, cheap jokes in the MCU, so it was nice to see Ant-Man and the Wasp with jokes that I felt relied on clever running jokes and contextual, relevant plot/character details.  I think much of the disappointment that is coming from this film is that the scale of it isn't as grand as previous Marvel films, especially since this is a follow-up to Infinity War.  The film is (literally) small in scale, and I like that it's able to standalone in the MCU without having to rely on the MCU (Civil War did not feel like a Captain America film).  It felt like a proper Ant-Man and the Wasp film. 

The story definitely felt like it was focusing on The Wasp's character story arc and Scott was left as a plot device as Janet's antenna in the film, but I was OK with this direction given the first Ant-Man was focused on Scott's completed redemption arc.  The first Ant-Man was definitely setting up the plot of this installment, so it was only natural for the story to shift focus.  

My minor gripe with the film that I seem to agree with most critics is that the character development could have been better.  Ghost's backstory was under-explored and seemed to cover the bare minimum with her motives without going into any depth.  The flashbacks and background were cliche, and the film honestly should have opened with her story a little more instead of the flashback from the first Ant-Man.  I thought the film did a decent job developing Janet Van Dyne's relationship with Hope, considering the fact she's mostly off screen and her dialogue is loaned to Scott Lang.  It's difficult developing a character not present on the screen, but I think this film managed to do enough to make the characters feel connected to her.  

As small scale the story was and as bland as the character development was, I was pleased with this film for its entertainment value and how it has the perfect blend of being a standalone film while being connected to a bigger universe.",2018-07-13,"{'neg': 0.052, 'neu': 0.715, 'pos': 0.233, 'compound': 0.9987}",0.052,0.715,0.233

The action scenes were pretty suboptimal too, especially with the car chase being super CGI dependent, even beyond the growing/shrinking effects. There was one scene where Unnamed Southern Tech/Arms Dealer's car whisked around a corner, and it was blatant CGI. It sucks that a big budget movie would cut corners like that.

1.Natasha was aware that they couldn't contact Scott or Clint because they had families that relied on them. Even if they knew Scott was free, they wouldn't ask him to help because if Scott was seen associating with criminals like Cap/natasha/falcon, he would be a wanted person again. those 3 guys can be on the run forever but they know scott can not live that life with a daughter and wouldn't ask him to risk that. besides in the first battle scene in civil war, it was shown that cap/natasha/falcon/wanda were on a mission. where were war machine and tony and vision? no one said anything back then. there is no need to bring every avenger involved for a small task. caps side already had enough firepower in infinity war

2.Another point, Natasha and the squad wouldn't even know that scotts house arrest is over. not to the exact day.

3.Another point, Hank despices Stark and the Avengers. Also Hope and Hank were pissed at scott in civil war for interfering with the avengers and getting those 2 characters on the run. Scott has a close bond with those 2 characters and wouldn't dare hurt them like that again.

4.Another point, the attack on New York during infinity war was pretty short. In comparison to events that occured with Loki or Vulture in NY, sokovia in age of ultron, or first battle scene in civil war, or the first battle scene with hydra in age of ultron, that new york fight was over in minutes and as far as scott was concerned, it was over. tony was seen going to outerspace and there was nothing that scott could do to help him. occurrences in the mcu world are pretty common. there are probably way more battles that are not on screen that the avengers faced.

The film establishes the consequences early when some father-daughter antics results in Lang getting his ankle monitor stuck in the fence alerting the authorities who come to check on him. Randall Park as Agent Jimmy Woo (FBI rather than SHIELD) comes across as sympathetic, just doing his job rather than maliciously hounding Lang. Hopefully we'll see more of Park as Woo, as Park has substantial screen charisma. Michael Pena does the same shtick again, while the other two pals get even less to do this time around. Evangeline Lilly gets to take center stage in the best action sequences of the film (especially the salt shaker bit).

Meanwhile Walton Goggins plays another piece of shit (something he is fantastic at pulling off) adding another layer of pressure to the Pyms hectic lives.  

Finding Janet Pym is the 'goal' with all the chaos providing obstacles to achieving it. Janet gaining 'Quantum Realm' powers seems like a way around calling her a mutant and allowing her to use her energy manipulation powers to cure the villain (why not). 

Overall it felt a little too 'by the numbers' even as the plot zips along at a quick pace. This is perhaps because while I watched the first film without any expectations and was pleasantly surprised, this time around I had some hopes for this film. While an enjoyable film none-the-less, it didn't quite reach the bar. 

If they make another one, they need better villains. Darren Cross was  basically a facsimile of Obadiah Stane (worked out alright), but going forward it would be good if the villain was something other than another jackoff wanting to steal what Pym built.

819,"So, some thoughts about the movie:

* A lot of the cast works fantasically together. The whole school break in and Scott Tot sequence was adorable, even when Hank joins in on the ribbing. And lets not even get started on Paul Rudd acting out Michelle Pfeiffer.

* Any scene Cassie was in was a treat. The beginning was one of the most wholesome moments in the franchise, and ""Don't Laugh"" practially melted my heart, the same way it melted Scott's.

* Hank gets some more good moments, showing his character. His interactions with Bill Foster and Ava definetly showed who he was before, and throughout the movie, you see these two realize that Hank is trying to be better.

* The dynamic between Ava and Bill was nice as well. It was a great way to subvert expectations, with Bill vetoing going after Cassie, and then later refusing to Abandon Ava after all she did.

* This whole film subverted my expectations. I was waiting for the other shoe to drop with Janet coming back. I was expecting her to sacrifice herself for Ghost, or to get stabbed the second she got back, or for Hank to take her place in the quantum realm, but no! Scott gets his freedom, the Pym/Van Dyne family is reunited like the Lang family. The X-Con business is booming, the criminal is taken down, and even the supervillain is cured and redeemed with someone she loves. As The Doctor would say, ""Just this once, Everybody lives!"" Until....

* The post credits scenes were jaw dropping. I saw someone in the /r/movies thread think of it like a Vietnam flashback, and thats certainly what it felt like. It was like watching all the horror of IW all over again, with the added eerieness of seeing an empty house with the emergency broadcast on, with sirens and screams in the background.


There is one big thing I feel though that detracts from the movie, and thats the action. It's not that it is bad, far from it. It's just that its, well, safe.


The first Ant-Man movie had a *LOT* to prove, only doubled by 1. It's production dramas with Edgar Wright , and 2. Ant-Man is the Aquaman of Marvel. The oft ridiculed hero of the bunch, despite being the founding member of their respective premiere superteams. Plus, Shrinking seems like a silly power to a lot of people, and Ant-Man a silly character becuase of it. 


Ant-Man 1 circumvented this perfectly I feel, and helped get the audience on board to the concept of shrinking as a viable tool and power, and buying into these characters. So much so that it made me mad to see so many praising all the best moments of the film, like the Luis narration, as ""Classic Wright"", when it was Peyton Reed that came up with these moments, and pretty much the only Edgar Wright left in the film were the Action Scenes.


This made me really excited for the Sequel, because Reed wouldnt be in the shadow of Wright, and now that people bought the premise and viability of the concept, they were free to run wild with it, and I don't think that happened in this movie.


There wasn't a single action scene or shrink/grow scene that wasn't in the trailers. I kept waiting to see something I hadn't seen before, something that would make me say ""Wow, that was a really cool use of their powers!"" But it never came. There was nothing I didnt see coming.


For the combat, it mostly revolved around Scott or Hope shrinking to avoid Ghost's punch, regrowing behind her, and then having her phase through the punch, for her to counter, and repeat ad nauseum. A little bland compared to the suitcase fight, or scott running up the gun barrel to punch a dude and then hightailing it through a diarama battlefield.


The action did nothing to elevate the unique concept, when it could have synergized with it a lot more than it did. For example, how cool would it have been if, in order to fix/defeat ghost whose powers come from the quantum realm, Scott had to grab her and grow and grow and grow to the point where he reaches the Macroverse, the opposite force to counteract her powers?


All in all, I would compare it to Doctor Strange. A film with a lot of potential for cool, cinematic moments, but they played it too safe.  I feel like Ant-Man and The Wasp is one of the safest Marvel movies out yet. That doesn't mean it's bad, though, just that it's a good, fun film, but it could have been so much *more.* 7.5/10

832,"Among the bottom of the MCU I'm afraid. (Which to be fair, is still not that awful.) I like most of the characters and the expansion of Pym's tech into more shrinking / expanding. The plot needed major work though.

Normally I like when MCU movies are continuous with the others, but Hank & Scott rehashing a fight over Civil War was not good. Mostly because it reminds me of how little sense it made in the first place! Scott is NOT impulsive (despite them saying he was) and would not have risked access to his daughter on a whim. (And Pym, who hates the Starks, would likely have been supportive.) It was a negative to that movie and kicked this one off badly as well. But it was minor.

The first thing that really bothered me was the time coincidences. Janet Van Dyne has been in the quantum realm for 30 years, connected with Scott (via retcon) 3 years ago, but now they have 2 days to find her? The same 2 days at the end of Scott's house arrest? Simultaneously an enemy they never heard of has only a week to live? 

And at the same time, generic mercenary bad guy decided this was his time to get involved for no clear motivation. His presence with the other coincidences felt like random complications to fill the movie.

And speaking of random complications, there was no reason for Hank and Hope's initial response to Ava to be anything other than ""We'll totally help you"". They avoided saying that until 5 minutes before the end so there's something to fight about. (At the same time flipping whether she was confused and Lawrence Fishburne lied to her, or she was violent and he tried to lead her to good.) 

Another thing I had a hard time with was the magic of technology. You need a pretty big threshold to enjoy a superhero movie, so I think I'm fairly generous. But two sub-atomic entities who were nowhere near each other at size can randomly find each other in a moment without trying? But then need coordinates to be found on purpose? And it's timeless but she did age but she didn't need anything to survive? And also she has the power to put an antenna in Scott's brain and to create energy with her hands?

I'll accept if if they try to be consistent or offer more explanation than ""recalibrate the deflector relay"" or other technobabble. But they need some effort beyond whatever helps the plot at the moment. As far as I'm concerned, if Ava magically knew that Janet existed and could be killed for benefit, she should have also known Janet could help her directly. Instead things did what they did and people knew what they knew purely to advance the fight.

Not to end on a negative note though, Paul Rudd nails the character and the car scenes were a lot of fun. I liked that his ex wife and her husband were more supportive of him now and even thought the FBI agent was kind of funny.

Honestly the movie I'm having trouble deciding if I liked it better than is the original Ant-Man. I really loved that movie, it was sorta the overlooked Marvel film I liked a ton. I probably liked this better, but I dunno. I'll hafta watch it again after it gets on HBO or Netflix or whatnot. That end credits scene was such a (somewhat predictable)dick move though. My 11 year old nephew especially hated it. After everything they went through it's snatched away again, just like that.

The things that keep this away from being one of the better marvel films and instead sit this in the middle of the ranks of marvel films are the issues that have similarly dragged down iron man 2.

Ghost would have worked better as a nonvillian sympathetic character rather than being a villian throughout most of the story. It feels like had hank just said to ghost that janet could help her, the conflict would be resolved immediately and would give more incentive to find janet.

At the end of IW, it looked like Fury was driving was driving in San Francisco, so I imagine that'll play into IW2, like Scott is the one that finds the weird Captain Marvel pager, or he calls the surviving Avengers who come to SF and see the pager and meet her, etc.

I thought Ghost was decent but underwhelming. Not a big fan of the whole ""let us explain our entire life stories and evil plan while you're all sitting up tied"" thing, it would have been more interesting to find out who she was in a different way. Also how many secret operatives can SHIELD have? 

Beyond that, Ghost just didn't do it for me. Scott and Hope could really stop her at any time if they team up: she walks through walls, they walk over, under, or kick through them, it just didn't feel like a threat. Then again, this was more of a heist movie with multiple teams going after the same target, not so much a battle, so I can see why she was executed that way.

There didn't seem to be much character development, everyone is exactly the same at the beginning and the end. The only thing is the ""rivalry"" between Michael Douglas and Morpheus, and Hope and Scott not liking each other (for a relatively dumb reason) and then getting over that. But there wasn't any major emotional arc changing them as people, everyone got everything they wanted without having to make any sacrifices or change along the way. It was less a movie and more an episode of an ""Ant-Man and The Wasp"" TV show, where everything gets resolved all nicely in a bundle with your favorite characters remaining their same old selves for next week's episode.    
     
Was also kind of annoyed that Michelle Pfeiffer didn't seem to change at all personality wise from being down there so long, I think it would've been more intriguing that she forgot them initially but then remembered at a crucial moment.

The jokes landed, the action scenes were just the right length without getting stale and were creative (the kitchen scene, the car chase with the pez dispenser are the two that immediately come to mind). I could have done with less of the Sonny/FBI sideplot and more of Luis and Co, and maybe more of the professor that Laurence Fishburne played. The mid-credits scene packed a punch. I wondered how long after Civil War this one took place and how it would tie into Infinity War.

910,"Here are my thoughts after seeing this movie today.

I would describe this movie as a collision course movie.  You have 4 disparate groups on a collision course that culminates in the finale.  Scott, Hope and Hank want to use the lab to rescue Janet.  Ghost wants the lab to save herself.  Mobsters want the lab to sell.  FBI wants to catch Scott violating his house arrest and to capture Hope and Hank.  A very keystone cops scenario of yesteryear.

For the most part, I enjoyed this movie, but everything in the first movie landed better.  I found the first movie to be funnier.  I bought into the relationship between Scott and Hope more in the first movie.  Their sexual tension and chemistry felt more genuine to me in the first movie.  I also felt the relationship between Scott and his daughter felt more real in the first movie.  Scott's entire house arrest montage played like a sitcom to me.

Additionally, I found this movie to be very exposition-heavy.  There were a couple of scenes that were straight up explanovision.  I think the script overall was mediocre.  I even felt the actors at times had a hard time selling some of the lines.

Now for the good parts.  Evangeline's Wasp kicks much ass.  They really made her a bad ass.  Her ability to fly, her grasp of shrinking and growing, her martial arts skills, and her overall competence as a hero really shined in this movie.  Michael Douglas was fantastic as usual.  He didn't have a front-and-center role, often on the edges of the frames, but in what opportunities he was given, he took full advantage.  Michelle Pfeiffer in her brief appearance was amazing.  I can't wait to see more of Janet in future MCU movies.  David Dastmalchian gave me the best laughs.  He was the best comic relief in my opinion.  The trio of Pena, T.I. and Dastmalchian have been used really well in both movies. 

Action was also amazing.  Shot amazingly well.  I especially appreciated Peyton Reed's and the visual effects team's ability to seamlessly shrink and grow Antman.  Whether it was a 3-foot tall Scott running in oversized clothes or a 65 foot Antman in the bay, the visual worked naturally and seamlessly.  Wasp's fight scenes were fast but not frenetic.  I was able to follow exactly how she was executing her skills.  Although we lose sight of her, we never lose sight of what she is doing.  This couldn't have been easy for Peyton to achieve.  He deserves a ton of credit for this.

Within the pantheon of MCU films, this is definitely the most comical, a purposely campy and jokey movie.  Surprisingly though, I actually had more laughs in movies like Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor Ragnarok and Avengers Infinity War.  Too early for me to rank this movie within the MCU.  Presently, it isn't a top tier Marvel movie.  It sits between the middle tier and the bottom tier for me.  I enjoyed it, but I think it could have been better.

925,"In many ways Ant-man and the Wasp was a breath of fresh air. Much of the reason for it being generally well received has to do with the context within which the movie has released- it follows the socially conscious morality tale of Black Panther, and the emotionally draining show down of Infinity War. The welcoming light heartedness of the Wasp is its biggest pull.

Do you remember audience reactions of MCU movies prior to 2018? There were a slew of youtube videos and comments decrying the lack of ""stakes"" in the MCU, complaining that the franchise relied too heavily on quips and gags failing to actually conceive a resonant story. Taking this into consideration, imo Wasp would not have been received as well as it has, had it been made and released earlier, 2015 say. The same complaints about it's lack of stakes would have left it lower in the pecking order.

I'm a big fan of the original Ant-man. It took a goofy preposterous concept for a hero and coupled with narrative warmth and innovative action set pieces, crafted one of the most entertaining movies in the franchise. In its wake, I think Wasp retains the warmth and innovation, even overdosing on both. While the original had a straightforward narrative and served as a clean origin story for the titular character, Wasp has just too many characters to remain cohesive throughout. The plot is very loose and weaves its way into and out of tight spots and deus ex machinas, with warmth and breeziness given first priority.

The concept behind the villain Ghost was a fresh one. She's given a compelling backstory to boot. However her supposed means of resurrecting her normal self was weak. It's stated that Janet having spent 30 years in the quantum realm has somehow gained its powers, but the other characters have no sensible way of knowing this with any reasonable amount of certainty so as to concoct a plan on it. Also they claim that they'll harness her power and save Ghost whilst killing Janet. There is a neat moral conflict created but it does feel highly manufactured. It was also slightly underwhelming to see Janet simply revive Ghost on her return. It stays honest to tone of the film, but to have the pioneering conflict of the movie resolved so clumsily was unconvincing.

Also, Laurence Fishburne is a fantastic actor and any movie is better off with him than without, but I felt his character was unnecessary. While his character definitely does things, the most notable of which is his admonition of Ghost's proposal to kidnap Cassie, a more efficient screenplay would have done away with him and incorporated his actions with the plethora of other characters. This in no way diminished Fishburne's work with the character but he was never an integral part of the story.

One of the most inventive aspects of the first Ant-man was its all out inclusion of ants as a focal point in the superheroes arsenal, him teaming up with the ants in a variety of ways. The sequel has a notably reduced role for the ants, and also does not feature any actual wasps(though I do agree those insects are too damn nasty to be playfully included in the story). The fun action set pieces could have benefited further with creative use of the little critters.

Given that Janet spent 30 years in complete isolation I was hoping they'd explore her experience their in better detail. They could do so much with this old Janet. It would be entirely plausible if she in fact had forgotten the language, and a host of socializing skills that go with it. All the complexities of spending 30 years in isolation are dismissed casually, instead of perhaps capitalizing on it to provide a new character dynamic. Ofcourse any such decision would have again gone against the carefree tone of the film.

It's damn near impossible to dislike Wasp though, simply because of how inviting it is. There are so many light jokes peppered throughout; the movie doesn't have a mean bone in its body. It coasts along on sheer goodwill alone. Yes, it might not be the complete superhero movie experience, but given the gamut of movies the genre is inundated with, each movie can appeal to a different aspect of superhero lore. I know some of you might take issue with what I've said, but I truly believe it is possible to love something while acknowledging that it isn't perfect.

The best parts of this movie are:

- a character quirk that's a callback to the first movie

- an after-credits scene that just reminds us of how good Infinity War was

- the acting performance of an actual 10-year-old

- Paul Rudd pretending to be Michelle Pfieffer

That's pretty much it. Ghost's first scene set her up as like a deranged, desperate individual but once Laurence Fishburne shows up at the house she's just normal again. The big emotional anchor of the movie is supposed to be the mom but we've never seen her before and Hank and Hope are still cracking wise when they have 2 hours until they never see her again. It never feels real to them so why do I give a shit? And Scott is the main character we got to know in the first film and he doesn't give a fuck either. I was wayyyy more emotionally invested in getting Scott back home before Asian Jim could catch him so that Cassie wouldn't lose her dad than I was in Hank and Hope's plot.

And then we're supposed to just accept that Janet can touch Ghost's head and cure her? What the fuck? Hank said ""we'll find a way together"" to Laurence Fishburne and so I was expecting some big reunion sciencey plot beat where they save Janet and the old gang gets back together and experiments with the quantum energy to fix Ghost or something but no, just touch her head.

Some of the acting is really shaky at times, it feels overacted or unbelievable to me, particularly with Hope/Scott's ""relationship"" and Michael Douglas being angry or protesting in any moment. The antagonist situation in the movie is insanely messy. It's very clear that two characters we have on the table aren't cleanly cut villains when they're revealed but the film doesn't go as far as it should to let us understand Ghost for everything they say about her. The entire premise of her is cool and interesting, being perpetually in pain and on a timer to die, and having been a Shield operative assassin? That was something that sounded BIG when they mentioned it, but we just get a quick exposition montage instead of really being shown things that could've fleshed out her character more. It feels like Ghost is supposed to be important at the end of the movie but everything before that felt like some of the typical vanilla MCU villain stuff that people don't like to see. I feel like they could've made her a clearly detailed villain but even if they wanted to keep her how she was, Ghost needed more.

Because of the film's connection to Civil War and the lack of actually showing us much regarding Scott being on bad terms with Hank and Hope after the last movie ends with Hope and Scott kissing, I don't feel like we had a believable enough reason for their tension. Hope especially after coming off the first film where she stood out as being interesting seems overly grumpy and in bitch mode here. There's a lot of messy/lazy hand-wave storytelling, tons of technobabble mumbo jumbo that just had me losing attention. This really felt like a movie Marvel Studios probably wishes they could have put out earlier. Had this come out around Guardians Vol. 2 or Spider-Man time I think it just would've worked better. The bar has been raised so much in the MCU that right now Ant-Man and the Wasp just feels like a step back for quality that you can't make. It's hands down the weakest and least ambitious Phase 3 MCU movie. I don't hate it or anything, I think Paul Rudd's charming and the relationship with his daughter is very endearing in these films, but as far as a story and characters go it felt like Hank Pym was the only person really served in this story and it just doesn't work well as far as entertainment with the amount of screentime that's not executed as well for everyone else.

One issue I had with the movie was the constant exposition. Five people worked on this script and none of them could find a way to weave the information into the dialogue without making it so painfully obvious?

The post-credits scene was so damn creepy. Various shots of an empty townhouse, emergency alert on the TV, and a giant ant playing the drums? Horror movie stuff.

Solid ""B"" movie.

EDIT: Reading through this thread, I see a lot of negative opinions. I can totally understand why people might not like this movie or aren't completely satisfied with it. Especially when compared to the first one. Ant-Man - as a said - is not one of the bigger Marvel characters so that's why I didn't care too much about the quality. It's not great but I don't consider it a bad movie.

There are no memorable action sequences. The first film had a ton of cool moments: they didn't always make sense, they sometimes contradicted previous plot points but they were dramatic and stood out. This film had nothing memorable.  If you're tired of Marvel humor, this movie has a ton of it - which I found forgivable in this case because Ant-Man is heavy on comedy. It's not Civil War or Ragnarok where the story is serious but characters are constantly quipping and being silly. Nothing major is at stake here. The antagonists are more annoying that threatening.

Overall: it's incredibly, incredibly average. It brings nothing new to the table. It's very forgettable. But - for me  - I didn't leave the theater thinking I wasted my money on a bad movie. I laughed at a lot of the jokes, I thought the sentimental parts were touching, the cast has great chemistry, and I thought some parts were cool, but I wasn't blown away like I was after Black Panther.

* Scott interacting with his daughter is still a major part of his character, carrying over from the first movie. So that's great
* Scott's banter with Woo is probably gonna be people's one of two favorite scenes
* The other scene would be Janet possessing Scott's body and interacting with Hope and Hank. Funny as hell.
* Luis and friends coming back showing what they've been doing/plan on doing with Scott running their security business and as expected with their scenes are still funny as hell.
* Hank Pym and his daughter Hope are revealed to be on the run and in hiding but also finding a way into the Quantum realm after Scott managed to get out of it

It was WAAAAY more jokey than the first movie and some jokes dragged on for a couple seconds too long. That's probably my biggest, and maybe, only gripe with the movie.

There was two ""kinda"" villains in the movie: Butch and Ava

* I enjoyed Butch's attitude and personality quite a bit and since he didn't die, i'm hoping to see more of him since he's just your typical black market dealer instead of an irredeemable killer

* Ava was quick to use violence and threats throughout the movie so it was a bit strange for me to see her feel sorry for herself for killing people in the past after she get's fixed (although they did explain she was in constant pain)

Two after-credit scenes:

* The mid-credits scene is the important one and one we all expect after Infinity War. [Where Janet, Hope, and Hank send Scott after quantum healing particles to continue helping Ava heal (probably implying Ava still has her Phasing powers).

So because they became Quantumly Entangled, Janet was prepared, just in that brief exact moment Hank and Hope fired up the Quantum Tunnel, to communicate through Scott? They said time worked differently there, so I may be mistaken.  

So how did they program the Ant to follow Scott's meticulous house-arrest activities schedule?  

Poor Judy Greer and Bobby Cannavale - they're like the Warriors Three of the Ant-Man universe; unnecessarily big faces in small roles.  

So why was Sonny Burch in this story? He would have been just a Chekhov's Army character to just appear and then reappear later had he not had a connection to somebody in the FBI to further the reoccurring theme of Phase Three. Poor Walton Goggins is just typecast as a sleazy dirtbag in every role now isn't he?  

So Hope meets Burch dressed casually, and ten seconds later is suddenly dressed in a brand spankin' new suit just in time to fight? No big reveal of her, or of what is clearly the better suit??  
Hank seemed okay letting her deal with Burches mooks all alone, but got anxious when the Ghost arrived? If my daughter were surrounded by gunmen, even with a super-suit, I'd be worried.  

Is there any backstory on the lab? Pym's last lab imploded. How did he get this one? For a man who lives in an old 'Adam's Family' house, he can sure afford a lot of buildings and vehicles to shrink.  

So they can take off their helmets at different sizes? I was under the impression it worked like a spacesuit with its own atmosphere inside, and that they couldn't breach it at different sizes without being effected / dying? Why am I bother asking this in an Ant-man movie?  

Oh, so Bill Foster, the guy they just happen to be asking information from on their Ghost troubles, is also coincidentally behind the Ghost troubles they are investigating? Well how about that...  

So the expensive tech they got off of Burch just fits into their machine like a big keycard / harddrive? That's convenient.  

I love Stan Lee - but this has to be his worst cameo in a Marvel movie. It was a slow humorous moment totally crammed into a fast-paced action scene. It stood out like a sore thumb.  

Just like half of the laws of physics in Ant-man movies, the physics of the quantum realm are left ambiguous, but it would have been nice to explain why Hank needed to suit up if he could just survive in that environment without it, or how Janet managed to survive several decades there, or how it 'changed her'.  
I get the feeling this will be expanded on in the sequel the same way it was before. Was there a city in the Quantum Realm or was I seeing things?  

Bill Foster gave Ava a matter of weeks to live. So why did she get so desperate as if she had hours, even enough to kidnap Cassie or kill Janet?  

Janet is such a huge part of the plot of this movie, but we barely scratch the surface of her character at all. Call this a criticism if they don't plan on expanding on her in the sequel.

There's Jimmy and the FBI but I'm guessing that's more for comedy than an actual threat to the mission to save Janet.

There's Sonny, the black market arms dealer, who doesn't really seem to have any motivations other than money. Is he working with someone? Is he just trying to force Hank to work for him? His FBI liaison just dies(?) but he continues the chase anwyay.

Scott had a new suit in Civil War. They made a big deal about him scuttling the old suit, but weren't there two Ant Man suits out there? 

Why were Ghost and Bill Porter openly opposing the Ant Family? Their end goal was to enter the Quanum Realm and find Janet. Wouldn't a last-minute-double-cross been infinitely easier?

Just what are the rules for shrinking? The lab was shrunk, but then shrunk again while inside a getaway vehicle. Why not just double-shrink it and keep it in a pocket?

My favorite part was the mid-credits scene. It was brilliant. It raised the stakes very high and very quickly.

I liked the characters, including Sunny, despite him not being much of a threat. He was a nice and entertaining addition that showed the lengths the Pyms were ready to go to to get Janet back.

Pena stole his scenes. And his chatter-boxing flashback was brilliant. I guess the production team saw it as a hilarious comedy routine and decided that they must have it in the second movie.

Sadly, there wasn't enough Wasp + Ant-Man action, for which we can blame story reasons. [First of all, Scott was reluctant to help the Pyms until Cassie convinced him to. At first, he had to get back to his house arrest. Once he realized that's not happening, he excused himself, saying ""I screw everything up"" and ""I have no idea what you said"" (referring to all the science Scottie has no idea about). Then his daughter literally tell him to help the Pyms and Scottie can't use any excuses anymore.

Then, we have the Pyms and Lang not talking to each other for two years problem.](#spoiler) What do you think this does to trust and teamwork? It's a marvel the three were able to make it work, especially considering Hank's ego issues.

Another problem I have with the movie are the generic forest sounds. We have James Gunn with his two volumes of Guardians, and now we have generic forest sounds. Ugh. Just record the actual sounds in the forest in the scene or forego the sounds altogether!

[When Janet took over Scottie to fix their algorithm and tell them how much she loved them, the Pyms' reactions and Rudd's performance were brilliant.](#spoiler) My second favorite moment in the movie, all pure acting.

Yes, Scott's malfunctioning suit wasn't explained as well as it had to be. Yet it provided two decent scenes of Scottie as Giant-Man. [First, when he uses a truck as a scooter. And second, when he, - finally! - retrieves the lab from Sunny and makes a spectacle of it.](#spoiler)

Ultimately, the acting was the best part of the movie. Sure, there was writing, which, though not yet at the desirable level, was improved. I saw the feedback from the actors and the lessons from other movies right on the screen.

What really bothers me were the forest sounds which hint at bigger issues. The movie conveys that it's Ant-Man's improved sequel and that it's a kid-friendly superhero comedy. But is it good enough to be a Marvel movie?

No.

This movie's closest comparison are the Guardians of the Galaxy. Guess which franchise is more fun? Yep. The Guardians.

Foregoing special effects, because space is not Earth, and ants aren't aliens, we have to consider three differences: the music, the writing, and the pacing.

In the Guardians, the music isn't a plot device or a comedic device, like the Cucaracha in Ant-Man and the Wasp. In the Guardians, music is an experience. It's there to entertain the viewer and do that on its own. Essentially, with the Guardians, we get the family/team component in the story, the comedy in the writing and acting, and a party in the music. Not so much in Ant-Man and the Wasp. Lesson: treat music as a companion experience to a movie.

The writing and the pacing could have been better. The pacing to me wasn't that much of a problem, as I was struggling to keep up with the false plotholes. [Why wasn't Scottie's suit functioning? How did Ava/Ghost know how to drain precisely Janet's energy and not Hank's?](#spoiler) Who knows. And if those explanations were clear in the story, I'd be bound to have issues with the pacing. The writing should explain each possible plothole at least twice. The science talk should be more conversation-like. And the movie was almost funny. Not as funny as it could have been due to cliches. Yes, the actors' funny ideas are great, but the funny stuff has to belong to the lore of the story and the action on the screen. Lessons: learn different types, styles and genres of comedy, read the dialogue aloud multiple times in different inflections (you'll surely find a better way to say things) and don't use anything generic, as it devalues the movie and the viewers' experience.

As a final note, I'm happy to say that the movie is, all things considered, a success. I doubt it will cash in as much as Thanos Pt.1 did, and definitely not as fast. Ant-Man and the Wasp is a movie worth watching and rewatching for the story, the acting, the progress, the lore and truth serum.

Pretty much the only positive things I can say about this movie are that I loved seeing more of Hope in this installment, and that they thought of some really fun and creative applications/action scenes invloving the size-changing technology. Other than that, the story was basically a rehash of all the jokes and shticks from the first one, but with less humor and a sense of boredom hanging heavily over all of them, centered entirely around the one little detail of the first movie that I found the worst: quantum bullshit pseudoscience. They introduced a super cool antagonist, with an insanely awesome (visually, if you ignore the pseudoscience explanation behind it) power, only to completely squander her by not investigating anything but the most rudementary cliche back story (that honestly only half makes sense as a motivation for her disliking the main characters. Like you've gotta squint your eyes and tilt your head *just* right to see how she could see it that way). Over all, I'd give this movie maybe a 5/10 only because I like all the actors and the basic premise, but honestly it just feels like a real waste of a story that I thought was one of the less-appreciated gems of the marvel universe. At least the cut scene was exciting.

1236,"Recently, I graduated high school. And, of course, I’ve met and have become close friends with many different people within that span of 4 years. For complex reasons that I wont bother disclosing here in a review for some stupid superhero movie, getting the chance to see those close friends of mine at this time is not very easy. But we managed to set aside this day to hang out, and we went to see Ant-Man and The Wasp. Being with these people makes me happy, and we joked and laughed together while watching the movie and it all felt bittersweet because, although I was having a pretty good time, I didn’t know when I was ever going to hang out with that group of people again. It kinda helped that we were all nerds, since it was pretty fun arguing about the movie after the end credit scenes that come inherently with every Marvel film. We walked out, still arguing and joking over movies and pop culture, we ate ice cream, walked around the stores surroundinng the theater, it was nice. You see, maybe in a few months from now, I might still be able to remember this day. The specific movie we watched, however, I’m currently having trouble writing this review due to how quickly it fled my mind as soon as I got back and walked through my front door. And this may or may not have something to do with why I’m stalling you with this paragraph as I’m trying to remember something worth talking about in this movie.

Ant-Man and The Wasp is the 20th film in the Marvel cinematic universe mega franchise, and a sequel to the 2015 film Ant-Man. I surprisingly enough, enjoyed te first Ant-Man MCU film very much, and I remember it as one of the funner times I’ve had in the theater with a group of friends. I say surprisingly because later on when I started to develop an interest in writing and art criticism, I was surprised to see how many people HATED the movie. I on the other hand thought it was an awesome smaller scale heist/adventure action-comedy. As much as I enjoyed the first film, I REALLY did not want this sequel to me made. I wanted this film even less than I wanted the unnecessary Solo: A Star Wars Story. It would be an obvious and effortless cash-grab. And due to the fact that it takes place before the events of Marvel’s previous movie, Avengers: Infinity War, there’s nothing that could have happened in this movie that could have ever affected the future of the MCU series. That would have been the saving grace, that would have given me more of a reason to go out and see this movie as soon as I could. But I didn’t. I would typically watch new releases on a Thursday, but this time I simply didn’t feel like it. And I don’t regret it. The only two reasons I went to see this movie is because I feel like I have an obligation to see every superhero movie that comes out, and because I needed a movie to see with my friends. Ant-Man and The Wasp is about our main protagonist, Scott Lang, helping out some uneasy allies to save someone...out of some weird quantum dimension...and then try really hard not getting killed by some antagonist...I think. Ant-Man and The Wasp is easily the most forgettable movie in the entire 20-film-long run of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Alright lets get a few positives out of the way. Sure, maybe a few action scenes here and there were a bit entertaining, there was a decent amount of creativity to the whole shrinking and growing mechanic in action scenes. But the main positive standout for me was how much I laughed during the movie. I laughed quite a bit actually. I actually feel comfortable classifying this film as a comedy, among some other adjectives. If there is a reason to see this film at all other than being a Marvel completionist, its the comedy within the second and third act. There weren’t many audience members there watching the movie with us, but some puns and one liners caused a laugh that would sound like it came from a crowded auditorium. I have to admit that I had a couple hardy belly laughes myself. The comedic nature of the first film carried onto the second film very well. Scott Langs sidekicks, played by Michael Peña, David Dastmalchian, and T.I, would steal the show whenever they were on screen. Every character in this movie was brimming with charisma and likability, and I couldn’t help but have a smile throughout many parts of this movie. My smiles, however, were hollow. And sometimes the comedy could get to be a little too much, especially when coming from anywhere that wasn’t Michael Peña’s, Dastmalchian’s. and T.I’s characters.

The first act was quintessentially mediocre. The humor was frankly the opposite of clever. Any bit of emotional weight that could have possibly been developed was tampered down by continuous jokes. They were jokes that were at times quite hilarious, but detrimental to my investment in the story nonetheless. And when they weren’t funny, when they were just shoehorned in and felt like they were thought up of in a matter of seconds, it made the movie a lot less enjoyable. Fortunately that didn’t happen much. But I’m only talking about the comedy, what about the story? The story felty like it came out of an episode of a CW superhero show, like The Flash or Supergirl. They’re suitable for those disposable and cheap superhero shows on cable television, but not for a $162,000,000 budget wide-release Marvel blockbuster. The villain in this film had lackluster writing, easily one of the more forgettable marvel villains, which is a problem that Marvel has been having for a while in a lot of their films. The story about saving a family member after being lost for thirty-something years had little to no emotional weight. And the movie was strangely littered with several little plot holes and inconsistencies. For example, when someone that has been living in a dimension where they’re smaller than an atom comes back to the real world, she comes back with a Jedi robe that she didn’t have originally when she entered in the first place, and there is no sign of any rudimentary material to make any clothes out of. Or when our main character was told that he can’t legally be in contact with a specific character while he’s in house arrest, accepts his inconvenience, yet calls him anyways, and snaps his phone in half so that the movie can tell you that he took precaution from getting caught, yet the call still went through and can still easily be traced by the police if need be. And since they're seemingly tracking his every movement anyway, I guess the writers forgot that the police will probably be tracking calls from his own house too? I mean if the writers thought that through, I didn't see where they explaining how he DIDN'T get caught doing that, or how the person from that weird dimension just magically conjured up a Jedi robe out of thin air.

I didn't have a bad time though. Hell, I had a good time watching Rampage (2018) and that movie was pretty bad. Although it is completely forgettable, although it is dumb, although it does not do Hollywood's superhero fatigue any favors, it is still light-hearted and full of charisma. So while I never, ever want to see this movie ever again, nor can I think of any reason anybody would think it's interesting enough to see a second time, what it all comes down to is whether or not I enjoyed it, whether or not I think my experience was worth more than it took. Not whether I'm gonna enjoy it the second or third time, but my one time watching it in the theater. And in that one time, I think I did have a decent experience. If you don't have that same attitude in which you feel obliged to see every Marvel movie, then I can't recommended this movie to you. But if you are, then do yourself a favor and bring a few good old friends along. It might just make the movie for you.

Marvel had to release *Infinity War* in the early summer but it definitely hurt this movie. And the last post-credit scene was really fucking stupid.

If I were to push your head underwater, what would you do? As far as Ghost was concerned, Pym had the means to save her life but wouldn't.

As for her outlook, she was used as a weapon against her will for years. Do you know what happens to a kid in real life if you treat them as a tool and have them commit atrocities for your own agenda? It gives them mental health issues.

Bill Foster was the closest thing she had to a real parent since she was a small child, and he was bitter about how things played out between him and and Hank. It makes sense that she wasn't entirely empathetic towards whom she believed had betrayed the *only* person in the entire world who seemed to care about her.

All this considered, she believed in Foster, and was working under the assumption that their plan wouldn't be lethal.

So let's go down the list:

- She was frightened for her life.

- Given her upbringing, we have no reason to believe she thinks like you or I.

- She was taken under the wing by somebody who let resentment get the better of him.

- She was not led to believe her actions would be lethal.

Her motives are probably one of the most normal things in the film, which I guess isn't saying too much since it's a sci-fi action comedy, but still.

Ant-man and the wasp hints at callbacks to old school comedies where we're introduced to different groups early on and as we approach the climax all these people are invariably brought together for hilarious results.

Unpopular opinion though, but I believe more than Ghost and Burch being unnecessary Laurence Fishburne's Foster was ultimately the expendable character. His biggest role in the movie is moral policing, refusing to help Ghost if she kidnapped Cassie and attempting to convince Hank to help Ghost. Moreover his issues with Hank are suggested early on but we don't really see them come to terms with each other in a meaningful way, their truce seems circumstance driven more than anything else. I feel a more efficient screenplay would've done away with his character and incorporated his actions within the other characters.

Perhaps instead of giving Ghost that assassin back story, she could've taken after her father and become a reclusive scientist fighting to save herself. Intelligence could've been added to her list of virtues. It could also have suggested that she'd contemplated every possible solution before surmising that she had no alternative but to sacrifice Janet.

I think the way the story rolled out was markedly less tense than the usual Marvel movie. In fact, thinking back, AMW was kind of a subversion of the Marvel formula in that there wasn't really a sudden escalation of danger at any point, and the villain wasn't motivated by greed/sociopathy.

It reminds me of why I disliked Final Fantasy 12, where the main character is also completely superfluous and just a background character in someone else's important story. They tried to give Ant Man some kind of urgency with the house arrest subplot, but that subplot was dumb and more of a mostly-ignored annoyance than a substantive plot point. 

I think they could've been bolder and just made this movie The Wasp, and written Scott as the side character that he should've been based on the plot. They'd have to make Hope a more likable and interesting character to do so, which would also be good. ",2018-07-24,"{'neg': 0.075, 'neu': 0.834, 'pos': 0.091, 'compound': 0.5647}",0.075,0.834,0.091

Overall, I felt emptyish with this movie. Like in hindsight, I'd relate it to Iron Man 2. It had a lot of nothing in it in the sense that the character's actions never really move the movie forward or at least theres pauses and then it jumps their story forward all of a sudden. Many scenes were just for fun instead of having more purpose which I don't have a problem with but get if someone else does. 

When it comes to villains, I liked Ghost. Her powers were cool and her motivation made sense. She was dying but she needed Pym's science to help her survive. 

Goggins on the other hand I completely agree was pointless! Take him out of the movie and you'd pretty much have the same thing. The only reason hes in the movie is to tease some guy pulling strings behind the scene whose probably his supplier or something. 

Oh and I completely agree with Scott's change in character so dumb. He was smart but goofy in the first one. His main shtick wasn't being useless in the first one, he did stuff! In this one he was the butt of a lot of jokes and that wasn't cool. The fact he never really had control over the suit sucked! It was really for comedic effect, but it wasn't fair. They should've fixed it halfway through that way, he could do some badass shit.

I liked Woo too, and im not sure why people should be upset hes not a badass.

The exposition dumps i understand the issue there, i just dont think it really affects the movie. I had to think about them to recall them, they dont stick out to me, so for me personally i didnt find them so blatant or tedious.

I dont know why youre so upset by the prologue. I didnt mind it bc i didnt know what the movie was about other than ant man so i felt it set the stage.

The splicing in of jokes, as you put it, i find to be realistic because people do it in real life. Thats how people act. Idk what to say other than that. 

People like marvel movies for multiple reasons, and you dont even seem to try and understand why. I like the silliness in the ant man movies because as an every day dude and dad, it helps me connect to paul rudds character more, not because i like a laugh. Honestly, a lot of your gripes sound like they come from someone who thinks movies are art and shouldnt appeal to the masses. 

Your post is rather long, so ill just say this: ghost shouldnt be seen as a villian, thats why the character seems like a bad villian to you. The colors in the quantum realm are unfuckingbelievable, loved it! I never once forgot what they were trying to accomplish in rescuing janet, so when the moment came i enjoyed it thoroughly. I thought the lack of a villain fits well with the mood of the movie and what ant man and the wasp are trying to do.

2824,"It would be interesting to see what they even did with an MCU Thunderbolts.  Comic book Ghost, especially after he started appearing in Thunderbolts, is such a wildly different character.  

Half of what made him so much fun in Thunderbolts was the way that his crazy conspiracy theory obsession clashed with the other Thunderbolts.  He was too crazy for Moonstone to manipulate.  He was so crazy that he creeped out Crossbones.  What made it even more hilarious was that he was, surprisingly, one of the most useful members of the team.  He would rant about chemtrails and CIA sensors being implanted in his food, but he never had any trouble understanding the mission at hand or his role in a given plan.  Everyone else could act sane but they'd always try and backstab the team or have a psychotic break at the worst possible moment, but Ghost was the opposite.  He acts like the least reliable, most obvious traitor on the team and then he was perfectly competent on a mission.  I loved that after a while the long term members just kind of learned to roll with it.  New guys had no idea what the shit was going on and old guard was just like, ""Yeah, he's like that.  It's fine."" 

MCU Ghost is so different.  She's barely crazy at all.  Sure, Ghost wasn't always as crazy as his Thunderbolts characterization, but he was obsessed with wealth and corruption going all the way back to his debut as an Iron Man villain.  MCU Ghost is starting from a very different place.  She'd interact with the other team members very differently than comic book Ghost does.  Heck, most of the Thunderbolts don't exist yet in the MCU, or they're as different from their counterparts as Ghost is.  How does MCU Ghost interact with MCU Zemo?

We've seen that Scott has a problem with doing things that are equally good and bad which gets him into trouble. The original crime that put him in jail. Taking on the mantle of Ant-Man and many things in this movie. Impulsive is the wrong word.  He just has trouble weighing the good and bad of his decisions. When Cap calls it's in Scott's character to answer.

As for coincidences, they aren't really a problem in fiction unless they solve a dilemma for a hero. And if they do add pressure can they be traced to the actions in the movie? So finding Janet before loosing a lock is the main pressure. Scott's house arrest doesn't really add pressure since he would have to get back to his house and fool the FBI even if he had a year left. And the Ghost's demise may have been sped up by her actions in using her suit and powers to steal things from the heroes. She is out of her 'safe room' longer.

2951,"I agree that the movie wasn't that great, but I disagree about why.

Allow me to make a case here.  The first problem is that the movie would lead you to believe that the protagonists of the film are Ant-Man and Wasp but its Hank Pym.  The entire plot of the film follows the 'sins of the father' trope and we are always catching up to mistakes and righting the wrongs of Pym's past.  In fact, it is Pym that resolves the main conflict of the movie by bringing back the McGuffin (Janet Van Dyne) and it is Janet that pacifies the antagonist, Ghost by healing her because reasons - an anticlimax which left me wanting more from the story.

Another issue I had was pacing and story structure.  I'm used to most Marvel movies having a recognizable 4 act story; Problem, Rising Action, Emotional Climax, and then the final climax revolving around a physical confrontation.  I could not identify  breaks in the acts and the pacing was wonky - quick cuts that jump the timeline forward when some sort of transition would have been nice.

My next issue was with Ant-Man himself.  What was Ant-Man's character arc?  What did he take away from this experience?  In my opinion, he had little agency on the plot at all and his arc (if you can find one) is shallow at best.

I think, in the end the movie suffers for two reasons.  First, because it appears that the ideas and concepts presented in the movie must carry over to the larger MCU - likely to help explain and push Avengers 4 forward.  Secondly, it also suffers because of the fact that it is the 2nd entry of a trilogy that needs more lore to justify the 3rd movie.  We don't learn anything new about Scott Lang and that's regrettable.",2018-07-06,"{'neg': 0.14, 'neu': 0.787, 'pos': 0.073, 'compound': -0.9758}",0.14,0.787,0.073

Plus, the doubled elephant would collapse under its own weight, assuming it was proportional to the regular elephant. In other words, it would need disproportionately thicker bones to prevent it from breaking its legs whenever it walked. 

It's the inverse of the same principle allowing ants to carry multiples of their body weight. Smaller creatures will always be proportionately stronger. So if you make a goliath ant, it won't be a super strong monster, it'll just be a super weak giant ant.  

Antman gets around some of that because - you know - Pym Particles. But maybe there are still similar forces at work when you goliathize a creature. 

Pym particles don't seem to influence muscle strength relative to body weight. For instance, the gigantized ants aren't super strong - they can't lift 10x their bodyweight.

First off, how many secret operatives could Shield have? Lots. It’s Shield. That’s kind of what they do. 

Your point about Scott and Hope being able to take down Ghost at any time if they just teamed up, sure. But Scott hasn’t been Ant-Man for two years. And their relatively dumb reason for Hope being mad at Scott? You mean the fact that he went behind her and Hank’s back, stole the Ant-Man suit, and made them enemies of the state? A little more than relatively dumb if you ask me. 

I do agree that there was a lot of exposition. I thought Randall Park’s Agent Woo’s exposition of why Scott was locked up on house arrest was done well and humorously. But Ghost’s unfortunately back story was lazily done. But sometimes that’s what you gotta do to keep the story moving forward. 

I think that Janet Van Dyne’s personality not changing was fine. She points out that in the Quantum Realm she went through evolution. That can easily explain why she didn’t go crazy because of isolation over 30 years.

- Thor is a leader. He's desperately trying to keep his team's morale up. His jokes are different. They are usually trying to make light of a terrible situation they are about to be in to make sure everyone will go through with it.

- Rocket is damaged. He believes nobody out there can love him. As a response, he tries to push everyone away to prove his subconscious point. His jokes are cruel. They are targeted at people to try make them feel as bad as he does.

She isnt exactly busy/distracted  and has had loads of time to contemplate and prepare for future possibilities.

&nbsp;

>So how did they program the Ant to follow Scott's meticulous house-arrest activities schedule?

Theyve had ants doing everything from household tasks to assembling complex machinery/components, im not sure why you would choose here to end your suspension of disbelief (also recall from the first movie that the ants can be instructed to do virtually anything via thought/stimulation)

&nbsp;

>So Hope meets Burch dressed casually, and ten seconds later is suddenly dressed in a brand spankin' new suit just in time to fight? No big reveal of her, or of what is clearly the better suit??

Remember how small a size the suits are shrunken to when not in use? Its easily within the realm of possibility that she simply shrank and swapped outfits in a few secobds before dramatically reappearing in full costume.

&nbsp;

>Hank seemed okay letting her deal with Burches mooks all alone, but got anxious when the Ghost arrived? If my daughter were surrounded by gunmen, even with a super-suit, I'd be worried.

A healthy portion of her arc in the first movie revolved around hank not wanting to allow her to rusk her life - he is afraid of losing her like he lost his wife. Hell, the reveal of the wasp suit at the end was the culmination - Hank finally accepting his daughter's will to act and effectively giving his blessing. if he reverted to panicking at the sight of her fighting some goons, telling her to run or something, it would totally undermine both that key theme of the first movie AND a main theme of the second movie (selflessly helping others despite personal risk - contrasted by Ghost selfishly, albeit sympathetically/understandably, risking others to save oneself)

&nbsp;

>So they can take off their helmets at different sizes? I was under the impression it worked like a spacesuit with its own atmosphere inside, and that they couldn't breach it at different sizes without being effected / dying? Why am I bother asking this in an Ant-man movie?

The helmet protects from adverse effects to the brain caused by exposure to pym particles. AFAIK they are HIGHLY recommended for prolonged exposure but not totally mandatory at all times

&nbsp;

>Oh, so Bill Foster, the guy they just happen to be asking information from on their Ghost troubles, is also coincidentally behind the Ghost troubles they are investigating? Well how about that...

Is it that absurd though? He is pretty much the only other expert on the subject and Hank was likely indisposed when they searched for someone to help her. That + his ties to hank and shield make this not that far of a stretch imho

&nbsp;

>I love Stan Lee - but this has to be his worst cameo in a Marvel movie. It was a slow humorous moment totally crammed into a fast-paced action scene. It stood out like a sore thumb.

Subjective taste. I thought it was hilarious and if got a  huge pop from the packed theater I was in. Actually might be my favourite Stan Lee cameo so clearly we had a polar opposite reaction lol.

&nbsp;

>Just like half of the laws of physics in Ant-man movies, the physics of the quantum realm are left ambiguous, but it would have been nice to explain why Hank needed to suit up if he could just survive in that environment without it, or how Janet managed to survive several decades there, or how it 'changed her'.

Again the suit prevents adverse effects of exposure to pym particles. Not mandatory at all times but prolobged exposure without a suit has serious repurcussions (see: how cross/yellowjacket went unhinged in the first movie)

&nbsp;

>Bill Foster gave Ava a matter of weeks to live. So why did she get so desperate as if she had hours, even enough to kidnap Cassie or kill Janet?

He gave her 2 weeks to live and offered no concrete alternative, telling her nothing beyond ""hank and his wife are smart maybe they can help you"". As far as she can see the only tangible/actionable cure is healing herself at janet's expanse - and the window to do so while she is in the quantum realm ia rapidly closing (along with the window to rescue her). She grows to think that bill is going to let her die by refusing to act. IMHO this is all perfectly in-character for a woman who was used as a cold blooded assassin, coerced with the promise of a cure, then betrayed and abandoned to die when SHIELD collapsed.

Like maybe make Hank actually 100% responsible for the death of Ghost's mother and father then I would totally buy why she didn't want Hank's help and her hatred is a little more justified but Hank kind of hand waves it away and then it's never really brought up again.

I haven't laughed this hard in a while. If this movie doesn't prove that Marvel are completely untouchable, then nothing ever will.

The reality is, all people care about is humor and cool visual effects in action scenes. They don't care that this is a cookie-cutter, thin plot. They don't care that Marvel must have purposefully tried to make two villains that turned out this bad. They don't care that not a single character had an arc or any real development so much so that they end the film as the exact same people who began it.

Marvel has no obligation to craft meaningful stories, which they have proven they can do but only when they want to. People just want popcorn flicks now with cool references and over the top comedy.

>  I thought they were collecting the healing stuff to rematteralize ppl who got taken by Thanos's snap but nope

this is just dumb to think.  even post snap, unless they had met the avengers and went through everything with them they would have no idea what is going on

> So he was free from house arrest for months or a year after it took them however long to put the portal in the back of a car. Yet Captain America says he was still under house arrest I think in Infinity war which is less than a full day b4 the snap happens

i doubt it was months or years, probably days at most.  they probably don't know the exact date of the ending of his house arrest and even if they do, scott is still under probation for 3 years after.  otherwise it's just a very minor mistake in continuity

While I had fun with this one, I felt it was missing something that I just can't put my finger on, but I think it deals with the pacing of Scott's character arc.

Throughout most of the film, I just kept thinking: ""Huh, no real arc from Scott. I don't really know what inner demon he's trying to overcome and how he's going to evolve."" 

Then, after that conversation with his daughter where he breaks into the FBI cell to rescue Hope and Hank, I thought to myself, ""Oh, here's where they're trying to give him an arc,"" but something about it falls flat.

I'm not sure that this is it, but Scott's daughter basically gives him a lesson of needing a partner, but I'm not sure that that's the lesson he needed to learn since the beginning of the film? Like, he's never much of a lone wolf, and if anything, he's the one who's been a bit ostracized from Hank, he's not doing any ""macho-man, I can take care of myself, shit.""

Long story short, I feel like re-evaluating that character arc would have made the movie stronger, and it could have still served as a perfect post-Avengers pallet cleanser.

There's actually a very good reason for this. DC has the benefit of many of their characters wearing half masks or no mask. Unfortunately for Marvel, a lot of their characters have full face masks. 

This means to get reaction shots during big fight sequences, the filmmakers have 2 options: 1. Animate the mask to show reaction (what they did with the new Spiderman mask) which runs the risk of it looking really cheesy, or 2. Find some reason for the mask to come off. One of the best examples is in the Spiderman trilogy when Peter Parker's mask ends up torn or ripped in almost every big fight. 

Marvel has gotten pretty created with how they handle this, especially lately. Mechanical mask for Spiderman, phasing masks in Black Panther, but sometimes the easiest and best solution is to just have them take off their mask.

That's why I liked the first Ant-Man villain, new guy new agenda, didn't have a grudge against the Avengers or Stark or wanted to take over the world/universe.      
      
I guess you could argue that Scott not being Ant-Man for two years would make that more suspenseful/intriguing, but being Ant-Man doesn't seem to be something that's relatively hard to be. You get small, you get big, occasionally throw a punch or two. Flying like the Wasp though seems much more difficult. 

Yeah still a relatively dumb reason, at least the way they portrayed it. Hank and Hope seemed to treat them being enemies of the state as a mild inconvenience, they were already pretty secluded and under the radar before all that, and there was really nothing stressing just how desperate their new situation had become, i.e. something like a downtrodden Hope having to wear disguises just to buy groceries, or Hank frustrated about being cooped up all day. 

Still, we see Hank losing his mind the first few seconds he walks down there and it's hard to imagine that she didn't suffer some sort of damaging long term effects or changes from that. Sure, you could say Janet survived that same experience with her mind intact because of 30 years of evolution, but that honestly just felt lazy writing, like the Quantum Realm is just a giant storytelling McGuffin that does whatever it needs to do through needlessly overcomplicated scientific explanation.

Final, real, gone-for-good deaths are coming in A4. That was the beauty of the IW ending: the three that everyone swore would be the ""big death"" at the end (Tony, Cap or Thor) were among those spared.  Feige has said repeatedly that A4 will not only close out Phase 3 of the MCU, but the MCU itself will be changed after it (personally, I think they should call it a ""Volume"").

Case in point:

* FBI agents are dumb as a brick. They're incredibly tunnel visioned on the whole keep antman arrested but there's way bigger things happening. The way Randall Park's scenes went he looked like a moron and comedic relief.

* You're telling me this gangster who has made a ton of money and has lots of contacts is also a moron who could've ended his arc the second ghost shows up but instead contributes nothing to the movie while adding to the mess that was the plot.

* Ghost's motivations and conflict with antman made no sense. But what REALLY made no sense was the finger healing.

* Talking about things that make no sense... This woman was trapped for 30 years in a place where time works differently. But she ages. But she's alive. But she's legit been there alone for 30 years. But her hair is perfect and she made herself a shirt out of... human hair? And they need a tunnel to go pick her up because it's impossible to get out of the quantum dimension... Except it isn't.
* And this is the biggest problem with antman itself: this is all supported by the fact that their made up science works, but it doesn't. I can accept thor flying around and throwing lightning bolts because he's a god but if you're gonna change how basic physics works and you're not even gonna make sense within your own world then how do you expect me to get invested? Antman is a 80kg man who shrinks and SOMETIMES weighs 80kg and SOMETIMES he weights 2 grams, depending on what the plot needs. And that is only the tip of the problems with their logic.

BIG IF. Lets get some things clear. Natasha was aware that they couldn't contact Scott or Clint because they had families that relied on them. Even if they knew Scott was free, they wouldn't ask him to help because if Scott was seen associating with criminals like Cap/natasha/faclon, he would be a wanted person again. those 3 guys can be on the run forever but they know scott can not live that life with a daughter and wouldn't ask him to risk that.

Another point, Natasha and the squad wouldn't even know that scotts house arrest is over. not to the exact day.

Another point, Hank despices Stark and the Avengers. Also Hope and Hank were pissed at scott in civil war for interfering with the avengers and getting those 2 characters on the run. Scott has a close bond with those 2 characters and wouldn't dare hurt them like that again. 

Another point, the attack on New York during infinity war was pretty short. In comparison to events that occured with Loki or Vulture in NY, sokovia in age of ultron, or first battle scene in civil war, or the first battle scene with hydra in age of ultron, that new york fight was over in minutes and as far as scott was concerned, it was over. occurrences in the mcu world are pretty common. there are probably way more battles that are not on screen that the avengers faced.

It was the difference between him doing what was safe (not violating house arrest so he could be there for Cassie), and doing what he felt was right, (helping the Pyms and stopping Ghost/Tech Dealer even at the risk of violating his house arrest). 

It was a little sloppily communicated (especially with the emphasis on him needing a partner),  but overall I thought it was a good continuation of his arc to be a good father from the first film. Besides being a little more comedy driven than the other Marvel movies, I think the big message behind the Ant-Man movies has been promoting a strong message of family and the lengths that people will go through to protect them.

Or maybe Harvey Dent probably couldn't live without Rachel in the *The Dark Knight*? Does that make it a lesser movie due to not having a definite statement?

Bullshit. Leaving things to speculation is realistic. 

But anyways, as I was saying, her motives were normal. She wanted to survive. People have done far worse to guarantee their survival.

The explanation that ""after the whole Accords situation, [Hawkeye] and Scott took a deal"" because ""it was too tough on their families"" and they're now ""under house arrest"" explains why they haven't been around much lately, but it doesn't explain why they couldn't be called on at the last minute to help defend their planet. Even if The Avengers thought Scott was still under house arrest, he's been busted out of prison for less, and he'd happily go to battle if there was a 50/50 chance Cassie could die.

So it is a problem. But there are two possible ways around it.

Possibility one: few people on earth, including Scott, have any idea how serious the problem is until it's too late.  

Infinity War co-director Joe Russo and writer Stephen McFeely said [Infinity War took place over two days ""at most,""](https://fanfest.com/2018/08/03/avengers-infinity-war-took-place-over-two-days/) adding that:

>Nobody gets to rest in this film. They literally get Strange, Tony, Banner and Wong get about two minutes of exposition out before the story comes to them, and now they’re in motion. Inciting incidents happened and the characters are in motion

Maw's spaceship hovers over Manhattan and a lot of bad stuff goes down - which Scott would definitely have seen on the news later that night - but then Tony Stark, Peter Parker and Doctor Strange fight them and the spaceship leaves, which may look like a problem solved to most people. Maybe no one knows what's happening up there and how close the universe is to serious peril. 

Later in the movie, just after Thanos clicks his fingers, Nick Fury and Maria Hill know *something's* up, but they don't know what. They haven't heard from Stark, and don't know where he is.  [Edit: Pepper Potts knows Tony is in space, but she lost contact with him, and Maria Hill observes that they're monitoring all available satellites, but have had no luck finding him. That suggests few people on earth have a good understanding of what's happening up there]. They appear perplexed by ""multiple bogies over Wakanda."" And they're as surprised as everyone else when people start vanishing. 

Possibility Two: Ant-Man, the Wasp, et al *do* know the universe is in serious peril, and entering the tunnel to harvest quantum energy has something to do with their efforts to help.",2018-10-02,"{'neg': 0.169, 'neu': 0.754, 'pos': 0.077, 'compound': -0.9943}",0.169,0.754,0.077
5712,"This is my problem too. IW happens in like, a day. A REALLY bad day. This means that they saw Giant ring-like spaceships in New York around lunch time (Wong and Strange were getting lunch when Banner crashes in) and decided that would be the best time for a science experiment. My guess is that Ghost couldn't wait any longer.  


Food for thought though. How much time has passed on earth? The snap happens with daylight in both San Francisco and Wakanda. If we assume it's noon in NY at the start, Then the sun is over the middle of South America

5725,"Quotations aren't only used when quoting a person, and a comma is only necessary when a pause is needed, like when delineating a list, or transitioning between thoughts relevant to the same sentence.  

In this case, the quotation is needed because you are titling a concept that isn't already established. 

For example, if referring to the concept of ""Chekov's Gun"" in a sentence like yours, you would say 

>There is no Chekov's Gun.

But if we were referring to a new concept, one that doesn't have an established name, or as in your example a storytelling element that doesn't have a distinct agreed-upon name, but exists as a trope nonetheless, I could say something like

>This isn't a story of redemption, there is no ""change of heart"".

Putting it in quotations denotes it as a trope I am referring to rather than the individual event. 

It's even more necessary when your example makes no other grammatical sense. You are using ""she is stuck in the middle"" as a noun, which is appropriate when it is in quotes to show the whole phrase is one thing, the storytelling element of a kid whose parents are fighting amidst a divorce, rather than a part of the sentence. That is different from my ""change of heart"" example, which can refer to almost the same thing and make grammatical sense (without a comma even).


And no comma is nessecary, because you are referring to ""she is stuck in the middle"" as a noun. Gramatically speaking, if you replaced it with something else, like ""there is no banana"", you wouldn't need a comma, because then it becomes ""there is no, banana"".

To put this in more specific syntactical context, this is a use-mention quotation, one where the quotations gramatically separate the word or phrase as being the object of the rest of the sentence.

5737,"I haven't seen any DC movies but I've seen lots of different analysis on them and it seems that they went super dark, like with BvS to maybe try to give their franchise more purchase, but when that didn't work they tried to furiously bail themselves out with JL, which seemed a lot lighter and had a lot less weight behind it/the characters.

On the other hand, Marvel movies deal with those self-serious/grimdark subject matters, but they don't let that weigh down the movies. Sometimes that does reflect on the overall tone, like with a darker film like IW where it's more appropriate, but they can also turn it around and make the tone slightly lighter and less heavy to balance it out the idea and the tone, like with the Guardians films.

And the quipping thing - yeah, it's a pretty sharp juxtaposition to, you know, half the universe dying, which probably isn't always the best choice tonally, but it's how the characters react and cope to new environments and new situations. So while the quipping doesn't work everywhere, I think we sometimes have to see the situation from the characters' POV, where the world is ending and these super-powered strangers are suddenly dropping out of the sky and really the only option for them is to turn to their defensive default, which is joking/quipping to cope and make themselves feel better and to show their colors.",2018-07-08,"{'neg': 0.032, 'neu': 0.819, 'pos': 0.149, 'compound': 0.9837}",0.032,0.819,0.149

Killmonger actually had a point, he just had terrible execution. And Thanos (don't get me wrong, he's a terrible guy) had a pretty compelling backstory, and if what I heard was correct, he's actually the main character of IW, which is an interesting take on the normal villain formula. Ghost was a little more iffy: yes, she did have a hashed-out motive to her actions, but apart from looking a little creepy she never felt truly dangerous. Even though Janet's life was on the line with Ghost's plan, it always felt like they would find some way around it, which they did. So while Ghost didn't carry a ton of weight as a *villain*, I can see her returning on the other side as another stealthy Black Widow-type, as her phasing power is gone.

And I like that this movie didn't involve the ""cliched save the world trope.""

All the Action Sequences in the first Ant Man film:

1-Scott Lang stealing the suit.

2-Scott Lang testing the suit for the first time.

3-Scott Lang training to become Ant Man.

4-Scott Lang stealing the suit. 

5-Scott Lang vs Yellow Jacket in the room of Cassie with the Thomas the Tank Engine toy clashing in the middle of the sequence...

All that stuff was develop, design by Edgar Wright. That is why when you see ""Ant Man and the Wasp"" you clearly can feel a difference...

Marvel did cut if i understand right 4 key Sequences:

-Old Hank Pym and The Wasp againts Fidel Castro, this intro action sequence was mean to explain how the Wasp die while trying to stop the missile. 

-Scott and his friends using the suit to steal a bunch of shit: To steal money, to steal from a Casino, to steal jewels...

-Ant Man vs Cross Fire, in one point of the movie Scott needed to steal something from Cross, so Hank sends Scott vs Cross Fire, so i guess they replace his fight with the one he had with Falcon in the movie...

-Hank vs Scott, it was say that in one of the early drafts Scott become crazy thanks to the use of the Pym Particles and this let to him fighting againts Hank who then needed to put again the suit.

So yes, the one big key change they did was to give Hope a bigger role in the movie and they also erased Cross Fire from the script and give Darren Cross a bigger role, they also stop Scott from becoming crazy thanks to the pym particles, the main reason why Hank really didnt wanted Hope to use the suit, because then she could have become crazy like Scott...

I am also a huge fan of all the Marvel movies.

Aside from the crazy logic of this film (Ghost’s suit helps her control her powers? What?) it was also just kinda slow as well, and the characters didn’t feel like they grew at all like they did in the first Ant Man.

Anyway, ignore the downvote party. It’s their loss for not even trying to appreciate your honest criticism of the film. No movie is perfect, and we don’t need to act like it is just because it’s Marvel.

The unmistakable whirring calm of a sprinkler amidst it all. 

**FADE IN:**

EXT. CLINT’S HOUSE - DAY

An extreme closeup of a target in the foreground, angled just flatly enough to be recognized, sharply enough to allow the blur of CLINT’S house in the background. 

This is our entire one-shot.

The target has an arrow splintered inside another one in the bullseye. 

Clint’s KIDS are two small blurry figures are playing in the sprinklers in the background. They’re laughing. It’s going to be a great summer. 

Another blurry, undoubtedly an adult female, emerges from the house, appearing to bring two drinks with her. 

**THUMP**

Another arrow splits the two. In the foreground. 

LAURA keeps walking closer to us. 

CLINT walks up to the bullseye and begins pulling out arrow by arrow. We are only at mid-torso level. We are staying here. 

LAURA (mockingly like a narrator)

> *Hawkeye* (sarcastically) even retired, still doesn’t know where the Avenger ends and Clint Barton begins. 

CLINT (playfully)

> You know I hate it when you call me those names, right? 

Clint removes the second arrow. 

Laura arrives at Clint with two glasses of iced tea. 

We still just see the torsos of a man and woman in focus, conversing. 

Kids still in the background playing, their laughter challenging the bird songs and sprinkler spurts for the title of soundtrack for the intro to summer. 

LAURA

> And that’s why I say it, babe. Even you could use some iced tea. 

CLINT

> I’m *retired*, not a retiree. 

LAURA (mildly chuckling)

> Yeah, ok whatever you say, hon. (More serious) Just as long as you remember that when you’re here, *you’re here.* Here you go.

Laura holds a glass for him and it comes into focus. Clint is focused on something else. He doesn’t grab it. Not yet. 

Clint’s body leans into the background. We hear a kiss O.S. He retreats back to the bullseye, body facing us. 

CLINT 

> Hold on, just let me ...

A bare, toned arm enters the foreground to twist the final arrow out. 

The birds stop chirping. 

Laughter is dead silent. 

(Cont’d) has 

> get this last arrow out and (voice fading, suspicious) I’ll join you guy —

Laura is just black ashes in air behind him. 

The two glasses drop heavily into what sounds like lush grass. 

We quickly tilt up and around to C.U. on Clint’s face, the camera spinning around him as his world is spinning. 

The face of a heart ripped out, mind gone. 

A panicked face as HAWKEYE’S eyes scan everywhere on our C.U. shot of his face. 

**FADE TO BLACK**

All we continue to hear are sprinklers. No sounds of life anywhere.

It was so bad it caused Mickey Rourke character to become a one note villain instead of the ludicrous hard work he put into bringing Vanko to screen (he picked the tattoos his character would have, he created the idea for the bird, he trained physically to wear that 40 lb suit and actually crack whips in it, he visited Russian prisons and worked on the accent, character motivations and ideas he would fax to favreau all cut or neutered by the executives). It caused Favreau to step away from directing another iron man or marvel film. He finds acting in it much easier. Also like iron man 1 it had no finished script and lots were adlibbed.

Then he has his wise cracking villains or big bad of each season. In this case, not season but movie - Ultron.

Ultron shouldn't have been as likable or relateable. The problem is he tried to make him both and failed. Nothing was scary  or foreboding about him. Ultron's lack of relating  to other characters was what caused him to want to 'kill everything'. The problem I think was we as the audience didn't relate either to him either.

I like it more than Iron Man 2, Hulk, Both Ant-Man movies, Thor 2, Captain America 1, Iron Man 2, probably Black Panther, and Spiderman Homecoming. I like all those movies though. Avengers 2 to me was the avengers in action movie. You had 1, where they team up for the first time and its insane cause thats never happened. Then 2 was (mostly) just a self contained story line of them being the damn avengers, and 3 was the end game... or the start of it at least. Like when you watch a buddy cop movie, in the middle they are getting along and kicking ass. It also did a great job setting up future shit, especially retroactively knowing the future shit. It definitely had issues, one major one being an aformentioned setup when Thor fucks off to a magic pool and decides to make vision... but still. I liked that movie a lot.

The last they probably heard was that he was on house arrest and wouldn't be available so they didn't try and bring him in on anything. I doubt they were counting down the days until they bring Ant-man back into the fold. They may have also wanted to respect his commitment to his daughter and not put that in jeopardy.

As for Scott's side of things. The MCU is full of dangerous and strange things happening all around the world on a fairly frequent basis. I don't think it's too surprising that EVERY superhero doesn't go to EVERY event. The fight in NY was pretty far from him and was over within minutes. The fight in Wakanda was probably completely off the world's radar except for all but the most advanced organizations so it's not surprising Scott/Hope wouldn't just show up out of nowhere.

Also, even if Scott/Hope somehow knew what was going on, how was he going to get there? Hank Pym has some pretty good resources saved up, but I don't think an ant is gonna' fly across the ocean in just a few minutes and they don't exactly have their own jet to take.

Like sure - Antman doesn't like Ironman. Maybe he and Hope missed the news report of an alien ship. Maybe they also missed any sort of push alert, social media post, text from children/family who'd reach out to him etc...

Sure there's also a world where he and Hope just ignore it - but I don't think that makes up for the tone - which is really what bothers me. He's like cracking jokes as he jumps into the quantum realm. They're all having a good time. 

Antman's whole shtick is that he always wants to help and loves his daughter more than anything. The two worlds keep colliding and he realizes that the Avengers and being Antman can keep him away from his daughter. 

but like - very caring concerned father, sees an alien ship appear in his country and sees Ironman vanish (even if he hates the dude. He's gotta know that means trouble) and then he just doesn't care?

I liked the movie, but I'm a bit surprised to see this in the comments. This is one of the most convoluted plots in the MCU imo. The story followed five to six separate groups with separate interests, three of whom could be considered antagonists, all colliding unpredictably and influencing each others' stories.

* Ant-Man
* The Wasp and Pym
* Ghost and Foster
* Luis's group
* Black market guy
* FBI

One of the later sequences was especially wild in this respect. Rudd tells Luis where the building is, Black Market guy interrogates  him to find out, Ghost was hiding there too, Ant-Man leaves his group, the FBI gets the building, Wasp and Dad get arrested, a traitor steals the building for the black market guy, Ghost steals it from him, the FBI checks out Rudd at his house...

Obviously it wasn't a *crazily* twisted plot, but I wouldn't call it straightforward either. To me a straightforward superhero plot is like the first Ant-Man.

Kind of a re-hash of the original Blade Runner movie in that the replicants were like 5 or 6 years old so they didn't know how to do the feelings thing. It was done before, ya know?

I don't think Ultron was trying to save humanity. He was trying to replace it. ""World of metal"" ""Making a new Vibranium body"" (That Thanos later plucked apart.) That was kind of the thing though, to me the 'destroy the world' felt too cliche and forced.

Also the typical Whedon references were too much for me ""Let me take the time to explain my evil plan..."" Annoyingly self aware smug writing. Was okay in 1998, not in 2015. 

The best part of the movie I think was the setup for civil war and Thor Ragnarok.
And seriously, the maximoff twins accents? Coulda very much done without those. 

To me it like the best part of the movie was the transition. 
Captain america getting upset at Stark for making Ultron. Stark's character development for trying to make a 'shield around the earth' (and adding to his personal failure plot).
The government getting upset because the avengers caused a huge international tragedy with the accords. Hulk/Banner leaving because he lost control. 

The best part of the movie was what was setup to be in the next movies. 

TL;DR 
Didn't like it because it was too cliche.

And both movies suffered greatly from it. Let's not pretend Age of Ultron was some greatly praised movie in the series, and more and more people are seeing the flaws of Civil War once the hype of Spider-Man being in the film died down.

Infinity War is really the only one, in my opinion, that has gotten things right, and that's largely because they focused on the character of Thanos and only really stole the Infinity Gauntlet from the comics and using it to bring together all the MCU stories instead of trying to force the Infinity Gauntlet story into the MCU. 

But even then, I think they need to start doing more of their own thing, including not trying to name the movies after major comic events. Just let the MCU be the MCU.

7298,"I'm not upset in the slightest, as I said in my main comment I'm bored of it. I'm bored of the press ignoring the fact that yes, there are other women in the MCU. The comments that I've seen haven't been anything to do with her being the titular character, but ""Some people still don't get that women can be powerful too, and be powerful characters.""

This to me, is forgetting the rest of the women in the MCU and is pretty gross honestly. It wouldn't be the same with Falcon being the first African American hero because there's been other Female characters already. She isn't the first character, she's the first titular one.

Also, Black Panther was the first African American MCU superhero to get a titular film. I don't recall seeing many questions focused on that, honestly. 

The entire press run for this movie has consisted mostly, at least from the articles I've seen, as; The male characters have been complaining about their costumes (Silly men!) being uncomfortable. Women CAN be powerful superheroes too! (Ignoring that I don't think many people interested in the MCU think otherwise) and stuff about the main poster (With the ""Male and Female"" stereotyped poses being reversed.)

Bar the idea of women being superheroes, I'm not sure what any of this has to do with the actual film itself. Why is the focus on this movie more to do with things surrounding the movie rather than the movie itself. 

And what press am I supposed to be remembering for Wonder Woman? I don't recall anything particularly that stood out to me but I didn't pay much attention to it either. I recall Patty Jenkins being praised for being a women director which is nice but I didn't look at much about it really.

I'm not undermining the main point, I believe that the emphasis on ""Titular characters"" is completely overrated. Is a comic book less interesting because it has Spiderman on the cover rather than Black Cat, even if she's involved heavily in the storyline too? I don't believe it is. So why is it that Female characters are less interesting unless their name is in the title of the movie too? Is GOTG and the Avengers, both being names of the group, not another example of Women being in main roles? Both Gamora and Black Widow, and to some extent Nebula and Scarlet Witch are all main characters but because they're not in the name, it doesn't count?

If the thing that makes this particularly special is because of the character name being in the title of the film then I think it's a bit weak, personally.

Now don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to say that this isn't impressive that it's the first titular female character and stuff, but at the same time I just don't like the press run for this movie. I don't even hold it against both Evangeline Lilly, or the movie itself, I've just grown quite bored hearing the same things being repeated in news articles and stuff. Maybe I've just seen quotes taken out of context or something but I'm not sure.

Onto your thoughts. I think them making their own story runs the same risk honestly. Look at all the spiderman movies for example. Adapting or taking ideas from the comics isn't a thing that's holding the mcu down. It all depends on how they take these ideas and use them. Some times they don't do it too well and you get age of ultron. Sometimes things really work out well and you get infinity wars. Iron man 1 took a lot of license from the comics and adapted it to our time and launched the series in a big way. Film makers just need to keep looking at what does and doesnt work. 

Ant man and the wasp didnt work for me honestly and I think I finally figured out why. It's a relatively low stakes story and has what feels to me a relatively week villian (ghost wasnt really a villian in my eyes just an antagonist so when I say villian i really mean that guy in the suit)
The enemies were more akin to factions rather than true villians. With the stakes being so low though, I honestly cared very little about the outcome of the movie. The movie tried to get me to care about old wasp but I ended up caring more about if ant man was going to survive house arrest or not.  That was the largest thing at stake for me in this movie which in thought just becomes laughably silly in a good way. 

The problem for me was this movie was definitely a comedy but a lot of the jokes fell flat for me. If I had been laughing more I could totally see my self getting over the weaker plot hooks.

7452,"I don't think much of the point stands with Spider-Man movies. The Raimi trilogy is an example of pure love letters to the character and are still regarded as some of the best super hero movies, with a third in the trilogy that goes to show what happens when a film studio with no clue what it's doing tries to heavily shove its hand into the pot of gold. The Garfield movies were like the third Raimi film, but to the max. They were movies made more from what the studio thought would make money rather than adhering to the comics, the character, or decent storytelling. And Homecoming, at least in my opinion, was an example of a perfect MCU movie, or at least darn close to it(still wish there wasn't so much Iron Man in the first solo movie). And it did exactly what I said, took elements of Spider-Man/Parker and adapted it into the MCU instead of trying to do something like make Spider Island happen in the movies.

As for Civil War, at least for me personally, I'd gladly go into detail about what I thought made it so strong. I honestly felt it was kind of weak from the get go, and went downhill from there. Starting with the inciting incident which just felt... Anticlimactic for heroes used to working on grand scales of saving large cities and even the world... And what puts them in legal trouble with the UN is the destruction of a single floor of a building with relatively minor casualties.

Them they tried to tie in all the movies, but had to heavily retcon the movies by ignoring whole facts about them. The Accords were all about making sure there was oversight for the Avengers, the major events being Avengers, Winter Soldier, and Avengers 2(and I think Thor 2? Which is a moot point either way because it was a fight of gods that the UN has no jurisdiction nor control over). Without Avengers 1 the world would have seen its end, and the Avengers DID have oversight by people who just wanted to nuke all of NYC to solve the problem which would have been a way worse outcome assuming it even solved the problem(and if anyone should be speaking up on this, it's Tony who risked his life averting the nuke). Winter Soldier happened EXACTLY because they had oversight and it was easily corrupted from the inside, and is an example of the exact opposite that the Avengers work best without oversight. Ultron is literally 100% Tony's fault. If Age of Ultron proves anything, it's that Tony thinks he's a god and needs oversight(especially since he's literally passing the buck by being on the side that thinks it's the fault of the Avengers as a whole).

A lot of character motivations seem murky at best, the worst of which being Hawkeye and Ant-Man. Both of whom have established in their previous movies that family is more important than super hero/criminal(in Scott's case) life... Yet they both show up and completely disregard this and just kind of roll with Cap, because... Reasons.

Then you had Tony who really didn't stick to his convictions. Every other second he was going behind the back of the UN to do stuff(include kidnap a 16 year old kid across international waters... But he's rich so laws don't apply to him anyway I guess). Including at the end where he can just never forgive Cap again... Then releases Cap and friends from prison(again, ignoring the oversight he so desperately claimed the Avengers needed).

The tone was way too jovial at times, and didn't take itself seriously when it needed to. You had friends fighting friends in heated battles, yet still found time to quip way too much like nothing was wrong. It makes sense quipping at enemies, which happens often in comic books, because there's nothing personal. It feels off when it's haha fun time between two sets of friends/companions that are at each other's throats. I'll give it to Spidey, though, as he didn't really know anyone on a personal level and just seemed to be along for the ride. 

Pretty much all of the scenes felt like their entire purpose was too build to the next action scene. It didn't feel like there were any scenes designed for character building or anything else. Just what can move us towards the next action beat. Even the stuff with Bucky/Tony's parents felt like it was there to build towards the end action sequence when Tony finds out the truth. Which is not necessarily wrong, scenes should help move along the story to get to where things need to get to. But there needs to be scenes that involve character development, help us understand the characters better, build the world, etc. And if a scene does multiple of these then all the better a scene can be. 

And at the end of the movie, personally, the whole thing felt like it was a setup for future movies. Like there was some checklist for future movies. 'Get Cap into Wakanda, check. Introduce Spider-Man and get him close to Iron Man, check. Spread the Avengers out a bit, check.' etc.

With Ant-Man and the Wasp, perhaps the stakes take different forms for those familiar with the comics. For Hank, there's usually no greater stake than Janet. Although the stakes of a story are a hard thing with Marvel movies. If you have high stakes it seems half of people get upset about it, and if you have low stakes than the other half get upset at it.

Then the rest of the episode it's about *knowingly* lying and living with your sins. For example remember she confronts the nun over sleeping with that guy, and she *knows* the nun is lying, she caught her red-handed, but the nun knowingly lies. Plus the themes of that episode, IIRC, is about how knowingly lying. IIRC the doves represent wishes or something, or hopes, and Nora is the one who collects the doves after and she talks about how it's all just nonsense. But remember the bride and groom speak to them and basically relay a message about how it's good to make these wishes and being free of sins or secrets or something.

I'm tired but basically, tl;dr, the entire episode is about letting go and lying. Plus Nora's story doesn't *completely* add up. For example, *why* would she just leave her kids and then come back? She does give you a justification, but if you notice you never see anything in this other world she said she traveled to. You just take her on her word.

But at the same time there's equal evidence that she's telling the truth. The way the scene is shot when she tell the story is ***exactly*** the same as a different character who told a true story a few episodes before.

Not sure what that has to do with what we are talking about?

It's not opinion Steve made decisions outside of his character in Civil War or the Zemo's plan was convoluted, unrealistic, and relied on coincidences he could not predict or know about.
