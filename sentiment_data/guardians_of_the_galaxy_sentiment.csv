b mantis  die   film      heros death    well deserves    die  death would add  much   film especially   keep   fake outs first   start  think  dont   balls  actually    bam mantis  dead

 gamora obviously     gamora  vol 1 vol 2  infinity war       time period   peter steals  power stone    would     head space   vol 1 gamora    wasnt   far far  savage  angry  get    dumped  another universe 

  would 100 stick  nebula  vol 1 gamora loved nebula  least initially    clear  didnt  endgame 

b    moral heart  vol 1 making    right thing whenever possible     angry needlessly violent 

c  believe  would  least hear peter      nebula told    life    gamora shared rather     without giving   chance  explain  honestly    biggest issue   film  character  completely    ruined  character arc   sense

 leading   gamora  peter   actually love    end separated    got    wrong peter held      time   gamora    beat      shouldve fought back  least  words telling     going  save  friend       stomach    done 
 also believe  shouldve made    photo     mum  grandpa  whole arc   film shouldve  tossing  whether  chase gamora  go back  see  grandpa   least pay  respects     mothers grave obviously   play  part   film   main plot   wouldve preferred gamora  peter slowly coming closer   course   film culminating   scene   almost dies     totally join   hug    two     kiss   either  romantically  simply   experiment    
    realise     gamora  isnt  gamora    gets closure   gamora  dead gamora   go  whatever  wants  seems like zoe saldana wants    mcu    stay  help nebula  drax perhaps  neither   seem eager  return either    go back home    woman  loved   sister mantis   gone   makes sense    head back  earth  leave   guardians  especially  gamora stays



 finally  rockets arc  superb  rest   main characters especially peter  gamora  suffer due         minor quibble
