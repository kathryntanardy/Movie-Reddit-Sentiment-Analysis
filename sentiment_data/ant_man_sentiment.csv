nbspnbspnbspnbsp  far   actual plot structure iw also   problem  jumping across like 5  6  different plotlines  made  feel  choppy especially   beginning   essentially   start  groups story  get    speed  whats going   felt like  movie began several times  actually getting going   plotline  pretty distant   others  everyone got together   finale antman    hand set   premise  efficiently   prologue    less stuck   main thread     jumping  scott   pyms goggins  ghostfishburne     three threads  tied  closely   intersected  frequently   felt made  movie flow better   wasnt jumping  like 30 different avengers also gave  character  time  shine   felt like  cast played     well   certainly got  money   cast  chose

nbspnbspnbspnbsp     pick  weak point id definitely say  villians felt like  bit   fallback     less developed ones weve   marvel movies especially  walton goggins character thanos  killmonger  great    compelling arcs       villians  mostly good enough  fill  plot purpose   said  actually felt ghost managed    fairly good stuff going  despite    ton  time  development  backstory  really interesting  sympathetic   liked  different perspective   brought shes  trying  take   world  even  something particularly bad shes  hurting   trying  get better     knows   actually help    end  seemingly make  ally     sweet touch  fit   theme  family   wish    time  shine   goggins   funny   felt kind  extraneous  said   nice seeing two villains  actually  working      start instead   usuall teamup   felt gave things  interesting dynamic

nbspnbspnbspnbsp  far   humor goes  pretty subjective   felt  worked better    infinity war  well  humor  iw felt  forced     guardians scenes  tonally  odds   else  going     came   naturally  gelled   lower stakes  liked  delivery  lot     jokes   verbal  visual worked

 liked  characters including sunny despite    much   threat    nice  entertaining addition  showed  lengths  pyms  ready  go   get janet back

pena stole  scenes   chatterboxing flashback  brilliant  guess  production team saw    hilarious comedy routine  decided   must     second movie

sadly  wasnt enough wasp  antman action     blame story reasons first   scott  reluctant  help  pyms  cassie convinced    first    get back   house arrest   realized thats  happening  excused  saying   everything      idea   said referring    science scottie   idea    daughter literally tell   help  pyms  scottie cant use  excuses anymore

    pyms  lang  talking     two years problemspoiler    think    trust  teamwork   marvel  three  able  make  work especially considering hanks ego issues

another problem     movie   generic forest sounds   james gunn   two volumes  guardians     generic forest sounds ugh  record  actual sounds   forest   scene  forego  sounds altogether

 janet took  scottie  fix  algorithm  tell   much  loved   pyms reactions  rudds performance  brilliantspoiler  second favorite moment   movie  pure acting

yes scotts malfunctioning suit wasnt explained  well      yet  provided two decent scenes  scottie  giantman first   uses  truck   scooter  second    finally  retrieves  lab  sunny  makes  spectacle  itspoiler

ultimately  acting   best part   movie sure   writing  though  yet   desirable level  improved  saw  feedback   actors   lessons   movies right   screen

 really bothers    forest sounds  hint  bigger issues  movie conveys   antmans improved sequel     kidfriendly superhero comedy    good enough    marvel movie



 movies closest comparison   guardians   galaxy guess  franchise   fun yep  guardians

foregoing special effects  space   earth  ants arent aliens    consider three differences  music  writing   pacing

  guardians  music isnt  plot device   comedic device like  cucaracha  antman   wasp   guardians music   experience    entertain  viewer       essentially   guardians  get  familyteam component   story  comedy   writing  acting   party   music   much  antman   wasp lesson treat music   companion experience   movie
