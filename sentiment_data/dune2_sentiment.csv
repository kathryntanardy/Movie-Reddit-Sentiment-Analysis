 javier bardem  stilgar   highlight   movie hilarious  soulful  equal measure     dour character   first film  im  glad   given        writing incorporated   bardems natural charisma   role

 rebecca ferguson  already  favorite performance  part 1     good  fantastically creepy   reverend mother   first film   told   shown     bene gesserit    thrilling seeing   full cultpriestess mode  movie

      took  get austin butler  finally stop behaving like elvis   magnificent performance  gave   found  interesting    chose  go  stellan skarsgards accent   voice   worked im sure  role   upon  time  hollywood prepped  well  playing another sadistic psycho dude  amazing range

 zendaya also got  show   incredible acting talent throughout  movie   betrayal chani felt  paul got deeper  deeper   messiah role  beautifully heartbreakingly portrayed   emotionally impactful moment   movie     paul told    duel    always love   first  sounds like  simple reassurance   realize     preemptive apology    asks   princess hand  marriage  front    fremen jawdropper love   movie ended   shot

  feydrautha gladiator fight shot  infrared   rad loved everything     transition  black  white   triangular arena   ocean  people   crowd 

  final duel  paul  feydrautha  even better  thought  fight  paul  jamis   end  part 1   tad anticlimactic    visceral   one   outstanding   two movies  bloodless pg13 violence im glad villeneuve let  bleed  bit  leaned   brutality   final fight certainly made  feel  climactic

  havent read  books   twist  jessica  harkonnens daughter   real shocker didnt seem    much bearing   wider story though    character level  could say paul  jessica unwittingly emulated  harkonnens  becoming increasingly ruthless throughout  movie

 im watching game  thrones   first time right    found loads  parallels   movie  course grrm    likely inspired  herbert everything  paul   fremen felt exactly like jon   wildings    shade   daenerys mhysa worship thrown  paul like jon  even got spoilers given  plot twist   true lineage  stilgar like melisandre  cheering  pauls messiah status  entire time feydrautha reminded   ramsay bolton even     paul jon getting  final duel though  one   morally grey  duel scene  course echoed  famous trials  combat  got  chani like ygritte becomes disillusioned  paul  straying   indigenous peoples best interests even  bene gesserit scheming   feydrautha   control felt like   tyrells  trying  initially accomplish  joffrey   psycho

note    read  books    huge fan  denis villeneuve  scifi

negatives
 first 15 acts appeared quite slow
 third act  rushed  ended abruptly
 dialogue  quite
 hardly  memorable lines opposed  first film theyre brutal
 characters besides paul seemed wooden  pointless 
  example  thought austin butler’ character would play    role   films   way   talking    basically died semi  screen
 hans zimmer score     nothing revolutionary   score  absent   lot   film  wish jóhann jóhannsson  alive  produce  score instead  oh well
 christopher walken    place  overall underwhelming
 gravitas  scale   universe   empire appeared small
 character motives  decisions ’ explained  seemed confusing     chalk     book  told potentially  internal monologues   hard  translate  film maybe
 zendaya’ character   third act

positives 
 chalamet’ performance  absolutely phenomenal  carried  film
  rise  paul   speech   south along   new authority   rises  emperor
  huge wide cgi shots   dessert  impressive
  sound design   machinery 
  artistic design  creativity   harkonnen planet

  sense denis dune part two joins  club   basically dune    good

maybe  wasnt fond  part one   tried   faithful   source material  appreciate  movie   vibe piece   epic spectacle  vivid sensation sort  trick people  believing    watching  better   really 

 judged    story  faithfulness   book  poison    heros journey  know  sequel book says  isnt  judging  first one  isolation    heroes  bores  dont make choices   messy  meandering  focuses    nothing character like paul instead  duke leto      protagonist  would    game  thrones season 1s protagonist   ned  bran relies  heavily  prophecy ala  writer inserting  story notes   fourth wall  contrive  characters  behaving  way  want    storytelling sin lucas   wachowskis ripped  aspect    films  thats also  ruins  film

 desert adventure   latter half   complete tone shiftall  plot momentum dies  movie reboots      different film   journey   already overstuffed movie also means  film cannot spare time  make  two characters suffer    oppressive climate imaginable  never felt   planets heat   danger   characters 

part two diverges quote  lot   latter half   book   way  fixes  make   actual story  fixes    complaints  part one  plot   lot  cohesive    clear goal   beginning   end  despite  slow pace  keeps  momentum going  tries  visualize   book told  viewers arakkis actually feels dangerous rather   telling us   dangerous   way  tensions  twist  turns alias presence  way  terrifying   fetus   ridiculous ninja baby

paul   actual character    agency  actually gets  make  choices  contrast   book paul  basically rode   plot went chani also gets     character   actually   chemistry  whereas   book    girlfriend   jessica  also  proactive instead   reactive      book   manipulations  downright terrifying villneuve channels  inner lynch   bene gesserit scenes

 gives  cast characterization   missing   book  part one  containing   books weirdness thematic implications  religious exploration  times  felt like   watching  sort  biblical epic hollywood used  produce   50s  massive budget three hour long religious epics  transported  audience   sights  couldnt experience elsewhere 

 story  still  lesser version  laurence  arabia    dialogues  hokey  love confession   marriage   pure cringe   didnt buy chani would kiss paul   first act  princess   bene gesserit subplot feel  like  distraction   main narrative  like   syfy version handled  princess character   heavy reliance  dream  foresight  still  narratives weakness      fake way  driving  story  seems  one  david lynch knows   make  work

 nuke comes across  deus ex machina   makes  climax  easy almost like  victory  handed   fremens  one swipe rather   gradual strategical agglomeration   course  war   capturing  literal emperor  space harder  goal  harder everything     dont get  difficulty    imperial  hakonnen forces   gathered   protect  emperor   didnt even try   worms attack  next scene  paul arriving   throne room  sloppy  doesnt feel like  fremens  outsmarting  villains       villains  dumb
