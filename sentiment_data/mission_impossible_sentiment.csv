     510     live  breathe  mi franchise  everything else like star wars lotr potter whatever  also love  admire tom cruise   incredible work    male   thirties   seen every mi movie   big screen   came  except   first one   nineties

    new installment   franchise  falls flat let  explain 

first    far  comical   always small jokes  light moments   franchise   whole beginning part   movie felt  like  marvel love  thunder dumbness  car chasing scene   first half  incredibly hard  watch complete opposite   one  fallout  paris  example  many times   recycle  woman cant drive joke  movie theater laughing  10 minutes straight     expect  going   mifilm    already  wrecked  completely   point  almost started crying     done   part   favorite franchise

 dark enough goes along   first point    feel  real danger  menace like  mi 3  fallout  example ethan  always ahead   situation  everything turned  great  every scene  scene  fallout   heist  solomon lanes truck  catch  right  front   police eyes planned  done perfectly

  dark moment   gabriel kills ilsa    happened    plots sake  tear   emotion   audience  course   ilsa  die  wouldnt care     would   grace instead

 theme gets even worse   main villain gabriel   wet towel compared  owen davian  solomon lane esai morales played well dont get  wrong   character    shallow  guys   real threat  ethan   imf   whole  contrast   ethan plays  gabriel  whole movie  defeats  twice  part 1 already one    opportunity    easily    gabriels plot armor    stealing  key   end    tension going  part 2   main villain   threat    joke   played 

 whole ai thing  also  hard  grasp  get   theyve chosen   give  story  70s vibe   analog technique   used   nod   original mi series  ai going rogue  people trying  abuse   power feels   dry  seen millions  times already

   real mission impossible moment  one   biggest one    suppose like  moment   movie lets  sit   edge   seat watching ethan   crazy stunt  activity  minutes  tension every movie   kind  momentmi server room scenemi2 entry  biocyte tower exchange  chimera  bellerophonmi3 ethan interrogation  davian  death  electrocution resurrectionmi4 burj kalifa climbmi5 underwater server roommi6 halo jump solomon rescuemi7 tried    bike jump    already dead  arrival seen   often  instagram trailer general movie pr also    like  seconds     imagine  hard  stunt   pull   watching  felt meh whatever

 didnt even see  flying towards  train  aiming    would  provided  tension  least also  cgi   rocks  meant  hide  ramp  done incredibly poorly

also  opening   movie   submarine stuff felt  like  james bond instead  mi  every film   franchise  opening would include ethan   team  things  kick   plot  screen time  luther  benji felt  short  especially love luthers character

easter eggs  recalls plot repeats

 many especially  mi 2

 gabriel shouts ethan   end like sean shouts hunt  sean finds   replaced  right hand billy  got  killed
  parachute    one thing  straight  repeated form   plot line   end  mi 2 biocyte tower   leaves nyah  sean  escapes     parachute
 whole train sequence felt like already seen   actually  see  exactly like   mi

 dialogue hear    content   dialogue  times   little dense  even convolutedbut  pacing  found interesting  intelligence meeting  fun  watch even though    lot  take     scene   party  really enjoyed  back  forth   involved

 characters  ensemble  fantastic   delivers    right im  sad  ilsa  really thought  character brought huge presence   franchise   team shout outs  kittridge widow  paris  enjoyed every minute   time  screen 

 action sequences  felt  little sparse throughout  film imo    arrived  thought   great 

  desert sequence   fun watch 

  
 venice  great   really enjoyed  bridge fight sequence    tense also   
 alley way fight  first   putting   came  appreciate    end 

  
  car chase  incredible   back  forth   comical sounds    
 fiat   deep guttural growls   police truck  incredible
