 villain  kind   interesting idea  brie  shows    planet  destroys  economy  refuses  elaborate honestly kinda crazy   wasnt captain marvel 2   feel like  really set us    major annette bening villain   yadda yaddad    movie   villain isnt given  time   writing  stand   anything    ronan clone

 main problems   movie    feels  pasted together  really feels like   marvel  set  long term precedence  also used   recognizable brands   arent calling  shots  well anymore    movie like    two tv shows  backstory   also setting  major plotlines   future suddenly feels less like   thing   like   service   big picture   plot   specific thing takes  backseat    feels like things  cut  rearranged  added  people  arent  creative force behind   thats  distracting

overall    perfectly good time   movies  got   laughs  nice surprise         top half  marvel content   feels  bit disposable 610
