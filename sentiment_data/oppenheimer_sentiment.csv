 narrative structure    film  nolans nonlinear storytelling  unnecessary  doesnt add anything   film   audience id prefer  film   chronological   way  accessible   audience especially   biopic   still present  points  view  strauss arc  think  actually  strengthened    part   pacing issues   largely     time jumps without  specific   theyre happening arent respecting  audience   theyre  annoying  piece together

trinity countdown 
speech  people banging  feet 
interrogation   way  start speaking louder  louder

   struck 

1 trinity testing

          see oppenheimers experience     way  repeats  phrase    become death  destroyer  worlds indicates   realized  power theyhe unleashed   world  also represents  start   guilt  torcher

  suddenly everything changes     main guy   military took  bombs away   needs  wait  see   military  use   knows  destructive capabilities     see   troubled waiting   night  6th  august    bombing  successful thats   nobody   shock  feeling remorse instead people  congratulating   idk  felt like   got praise instead  judgement thats  things went wrong  

2 speech   hiroshima bombing 

          speech scene   actually hear  violin melody       trinity testing   visuals distort    see bright flashes  light symbolizing  explosion   see oppenheimer saying  things  doesnt feel   moment like hes     body    screaming   end   speech  people clapping  represents  explosion      way even though   oppie didnt experience  hiroshima bomb little boy   us gets  feel    moment 

even years  oppenheimer obviously still feels guilty  see  first   meeting   president   says  feel like   blood   hands second time  see  feeling guilt    midst   unfair hearing   voluntarily accepts   kind   martyr   moment  wife confronts   sentences    fight back    think    let  tar  feather   world would forgive  


3  hearing  oppenheimer representing nagasaki bomb

       hearing oppenheimer  actually  silent  whole time  refuses  fight back  climax   hearing   roger robb  think interrogates oppenheimer   scene starts   violins playing    camera distorts  flashes show    whole scene   actually talking   moral   atomic bombing   oppenheimer declined   involved   development  hbomb    climax   tensions    start screaming    representing   sound    bomb explosion    way   actually feel  nagasaki bomb  man   second real bombing  happened  oppenheimers perspective   didnt actually get  feel  bombs   created   heard   horrors   caused 

4 build  representing  possible nuclear war apocalypse

       skip  trials   way   ending   see  ending scene  oppenheimer talks  einstein   chain reaction   might  started nolan shows  whole disturbing arsenal  modern atomic weapons earths atmosphere  collapsing  burning  see  horror   might happen   happens   fourth time  violins start building   tension    middle   convo   hear loud bangs  represent   bombs dropping   climax    oppenheimercillian closes  eyes expecting  hear  loud boom  instead  movie ends  leaves us without actually hearing  fourth explosion   last build  represents  tensions   world  build  towards  apocalyptic nuclear war  absence   boom represents  hope  humanity isnt dead    wont let  happen

2 along  lines    weaknesses   plot development  first 45 minutes seems  suggest strauss    defend     positive relationship  oppenheimer…  suddenly  tables turn  hill  apparently sole witness  testified  strauss…       movie sure  poked  head    twice     minor character    sole downfall  strauss seemed silly

 heel turn  strauss’ aide  also rather absurd

 generally strauss    “villain”  15 minutes  exposition   end   movie  required  explain  bad guys motives ’  poorly written bad guy  ’ exactly   got

3  entire third act  drags way  much exposition way  much “finishing scenes  earlier    unexpected twist”

 read  lot  history books anyway   decided 6 months ago  read american prometheus  book   film  based   might    mistake  read   seeing  film

 already read  fantastic  making   atomic bomb  figured  american prometheus would  somewhat similar    similar  noticed   full half   book  spent   political witchhunting  plagued oppenheimer   much   life  thought     nolan handle    film clearly  3 hour epic   father   atomic bomb would   tad boring   people   spends half   film   political stuff

  began  worry     still onboard  seeing  film  course christopher nolan could release  film   blank wall  2 hours   sound   would probably buy  ticket     one    maybe 3  4 directors   carte blanche    buy  ticket  whatever  put    theater

710 overall score

matt damon  continually distracting   always aware    watching  actor named matt damon although   somewhat embody  character  described   book

 story seems like  would  incredibly hard  follow  someone  hadnt read  book  almost    film    ad   book    need  read  book afterwards  understand everything   saw  found  film confusing    read  book recently

 film assumes   audience knows  lot     characters already especially  lot  oppenheimer  dont feel   film adequately explained oppie   charactermotivations   hit  ground running   guy   barely know

cillian murphy  get  best actor nomination   role   deserves  win  oscar   role

robert downey jr  get  best supporting actor nomination   role   also deserves  win

random note almost everyone   theater  male  disappointed    female   maybe 46 women   entire theater  2   spent  entire film   cell phones texting  looking  clothes anyway  thought   interesting

final note  think nolan   adapted  making   atomic bomb instead  american prometheus

pro

 cillian murphy  dr oppenheimer  great great performance     wanting  see cillian murphy   lead role   delivered   expectations   sky high  begin   imho murphys cerebral performance fit well  nolans penchant  directing movies   content

  dramatic takes balanced  adding sensation  thus excitement   movie without going   rails  creative license    understand peoples gripes   sanskrit scene  seemingly unnecessary nudity  imho  played  well   security clearance screening   relations   pugh character became  sore spot   mean security clearance screenings  supposed    boring lol

  liked   bomb scenes  handled    indeed  supposed  immediately  soundthe shockwave   concomitant rumbling  debris    sound comes  play   contrast   silence   shockwave   well done

 similarly  gym scene     louder   bomb scene resonated   notion   true impact  scope   bomb  less    wwii     became  far larger phenomenon  changed everything  war   

  thought  moral implications  well handled  yes  people  los alamos cheering  bombs  dropped  historically significant given  scientists  devoted several years   life  developing  weapon  ending  war    indeed  lot  antijapanese sentiment  america   time    hate culminated   gym scene  oppenheimer   crisis  conscience   saw peoples faces peeling   front    well done    significant discussion   movie  exactly  horrific  weapon oppenheimer  helped  develop   practice versus  theoretical challenges   thrill  discovery involved  developing   weapon   first place

cons

 minor gripe   sure  rami maleks role    movie  didnt even know    phd    introduced   final hour   movie  front   senate hearingi thought    best  lab tech   wondering   gave   screen time     probably follows   fact   significance  tied   strauss character   also felt  wholly unnecessary
