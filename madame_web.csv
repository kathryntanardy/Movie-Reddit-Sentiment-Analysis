"I asked ChatGPT to predict the end of movie, and it still sounds better than whatever they're going to come up with:

  
As the climax builds, Cassandra Webb and her allies face off against the vaguely Spider-Mannish villain in a dramatic showdown in Central Park. The villain, cloaked in shadows, cackles maniacally, revealing his master plan to use a giant sky beam machine to merge all realities and rule them as a tyrant. As the skies tear open, a plethora of spider-themed heroes and villains from various dimensions begin to pour into New York City, including a talking spider with a top hat and monocle.

  
With each of the heroines knocked down, Cassandra scrambles towards a mysterious amulet that had belonged to her mother, hoping it holds the key to their victory. In a flash of desperation, she activates the amulet, which emits a blinding light. When the light fades, the villain is inexplicably immobilized, frozen in place by an unseen force. Meanwhile, the young women discover they can now communicate telepathically.  


The final scene is a musical number where the entire cast, including the villain, performs a synchronized dance routine to a spider-themed parody of a popular song, laughing and forgetting their on-screen conflicts. The film ends with Cassandra returning to her paramedic job, winking at the camera after saving a cat in a tree‚Äîa task she performs by shooting webs from her hands.  
  
A post-credits scene shows the villain waking up, revealing everything to have been just a dream. He‚Äôs actually a Spider-Man impersonator at a children's birthday party, and Cassandra is just the party planner, looking on in disbelief.",2023-12-12 16:11:33

She seems to be a plot device, simple as it is, a excuse to connect the ""spiderverse""... and the timing is weird, Sony is currently making a spiderverse animation already, somehow it worked. Now it's spiderverse again, but with female versions of the character instead, is that it? I guess the general audiences are as confused as me, lol this movie feels so random, unnecessary",2023-12-13 00:21:50

They are really trying hard to drive the superhero movie genre into the ground. I hate that Sony is moving ahead with these Spider-verse characters that don't deserve their own flick. It's going to perform horribly and to keep us from getting movies of characters that the fans actually want as the studios back away.,2023-12-12 16:38:21

I also suspect its partly due to the desexualization of women in Hollywood by major studios, the most obvious examples are typical sex symbols showing less skin (men are excluded from this i.e. Thor). Think of every gradual female costume design change in every Marvel or DC movie over 10 yrs as examples. There are dozens of other examples that demonstrate this trend clearly over a decade in entertainment, regardless of opinion for or against it.

"It not uncommon for movie writers to not actually‚Ä¶you know‚Ä¶write the plot at all. 

Plot is often already decided by producers, execs etc. and gets handed to the writer. Writer cranks out the script.

There‚Äôs a lot of writers Reddit seems perplexed they still have a career after a lifetime of stinkers. Of course they have a career. They‚Äôre good contractors. The producer hands them a plot outline. Said writer keeps his opinion to himself, cranks out dialog and scene transitions the best the can. If it‚Äôs wonky and needs ‚Äútouch ups‚Äù (because of course it is, the outline isn‚Äôt good) they hand it to their next contractor to fix up some bits.

And that‚Äôs how you have 4-5 writers all of which have nothing but stinkers on their resume. It‚Äôs a stinker resume *to us*. To producers they‚Äôre contractors that do what you ask of them.

It‚Äôs like‚Ä¶we don‚Äôt really get mad at the sound engineer on Metallica‚Äôs St. Anger for the drums sounding like trash cans. We can understand that was probably a decision he was told to do by the band or Lars or their producer.

Also, every writer has a dozen unproduced screenplays for every one that made it to the big screen; the best ones are what they use as writing sample to get jobs.

It's possible these writers saved *Morbius* from being even worse, or even did amazing work on movies you love, but didn't get screen credit.

"""I don't need it to be good, I need it on Thursday."" 

Hollywood doesn't care if the material is good, and the people that keep getting jobs are the people that understand this. Hollywood needs things on time, cheaply, and consistently. The mediocre writers that keep getting work are the ones that show up, do what they're told, hit their deadlines under budget, and cash the checks with a minimum (preferably no) fuss or controversy. 

I worked let's say ""adjacent to"" Hollywood for a while as an editor, given that I have a BA in communications and an AA in english studies. What I quickly found is that producers and writers in Hollywood don't really want critical feedback - they want to pay someone to say ""yup, this is great"" and go make it anyway, so they can have a chain of people to spread the blame around on if things go poorly. I had one script where all of my changes were rejected, the film came out and did poorly, and I got ranted at for forty minutes about how I ""should have fought harder"" for my edits and corrections...then we all went to lunch, came back and were working on the next script and it was never mentioned again.

"It's also often an important stepping stone in your career. You do the shit jobs with very little creative output where you follow the studio's plan for ten years, then you get enough leeway to make the film you really want. It's an obvious example but I've seen people on reddit genuinely shocked that Craig Mazin wrote Chernobyl and The Last of Us after starting his career on Scary Movie 4 and Superhero Movie. But it's not like these are equal creative ventures in his eyes. It's like being a session musician and writing your own album. You do the soulless contract work and build a name as a reliable, likable screenwriter that writes scripts that make money. Then you get the blank check to make the show or movie you're really interested in. Many auteur directors got started on car commercials, you know?",2023-12-12 17:25:19
"Yeah and also it's easy to us, as consumers, to look at our personal taste and opinion to dictate and find what's wrong with a movie - Morbius? I mean, it's the writing the issue, right? The direction and even acting were... well decent, passable, but the plot outline and writing were atrocious. 

But for producers, it's... - and I really don't mean that to defend them, I fucking wish I could shake them up to sense - ...a bit more complicated. You're not making movies out of your own personal preferences, people's jobs depend on your decisions and you can't be emotional and egotistical about it, you have to try and be more rational, look at the numbers, weight different opinions, etc. 

Well, how many *absolutely great scripts* flop at the box office? A lot. So flopping cannot be simply a matter of well-written/badly-written, sometimes so many other factors are weighting in (marketing, actors, politics, time of release, general interest in a subject, etc) and the sad reality is that holy fucking shit is it dizzying to try and decipher reviews and criticism coming at you from hundreds of thousands of different sources. Again, for us it's easy, we'll connect with criticism and reviews that reflect our own, we'll have our own biases towards this. We'll point to the ones we like and say, ""that, that's the reason it failed."" But from an outside point of view?

People saying the issue is because of the actor, others because there was a scene with a donut in it, others because it was cold outside. Some might say it was the writing the issue, but some people also said Inception was too confusing and that Blade Runner 2049 was too boring so what do people know about writing? Should you really pay attention to them?

But for a producer? It's overwhelming, it's way too much data to process, people stating their opinions online aren't to be trusted because most of them are fucking idiots. But these fucking idiots are the one with the money, so which idiots do you listen to?

The only thing they know is that a finished product makes more money than an unfinished one, so yeah these scriptwriters gets hired again, because their stupid script is 99% the same as many other stupid scripts that somehow, for some reason, rack in the cash - because that's how fickle this industry and the audience are, change a line or a scene in Morbius and suddenly it's a box office success for some random esoterical reason. I'm sure someone could tell me the difference in quality between the script of Suicide Squad, Venom and Morbius, but I can't for the life of me. I have no fucking clue why one failed where the two others magically made money. 

So why blame the writers?",2023-12-12 16:57:14

Everyone who wonders why Rings of Power sucked rotten ass should look at the writing credits. No career writers among them. It's a team of tv producers who thought ""It's Tolkien IP, how hard could it be? You just put the pieces in the right places and stitch it all together."" Even if they had managed to conjure up some Tolkien-esque prose (which they clearly couldn't), the plot was bad, the pacing was bad, the characterization was bad.

"Even if you boiled it down to the response & performance of one movie, your aim shouldn‚Äôt be to emulate anything Morbius did.  Instead, someone  decided to steer into the skid and become another Morbius.  The even dumber thing is that they probably have a good idea in here somewhere, getting Johnson and Sweeney is a casting coup, but the execution looks to be utter garbage.",2023-12-12 14:42:23
It's a big company. Plenty of room for geniuses and morons,2023-12-12 14:53:10
Sony Pictures and Sony Interactive Entertainment/PlayStation Studios are two different companies. They're both under the umbrella of Sony the conglomerate but their both independent of each other.

basically separate companies with the name Sony on them.,2023-12-12 19:01:21
It's weird how good their animated Spider-Movies are compared to how bad their live action Spider-Movies are (when *Marvel Studios* isn't doing the heavy lifting),2023-12-12 15:00:53

"While the Playstation is, in fact, an Intellectual Property, when someone uses ""IP"" in this context they're almost _universally_ referring to _characters and settings_, not hardware.

In this case referring to the fact that Sony owns the rights to movie/game productions that contain the Spider-Man IP, which has generally been one of their primary cows for quick cash in recent years.

Then the Morbius duo wrote the script, from that story they wrote with that random dude, with the director, who's previously made an assload of TV, and some random chick named Claire (fun fact, that was the working title/code name for the movie during production) Parker, who hasn't done diddlysquat.

"As far as I can tell, this director has never made a movie before (though she does seem to have quite a bit of experience in TV). It is unusual for someone's first feature to be a big budget studio film. That would lead me to believe that she doesn't have a ton of creative control and the studio is going to really dictate what this movie ends up looking like.

"Mazin is a good point of reference because it‚Äôs notable that in film writers generally have less control over the rest of the process after turning in a draft, but on television writers sometimes run the whole show and even choose directors. So if you associate a writer with a terrible film but they wrote a whole series that you liked, it‚Äôs possible the film‚Äôs lack of quality isn‚Äôt their fault and the tv series is more representative. 

Actually in film they might have turned in a draft and then never heard from the studio again, meanwhile a bunch of writers were called in and made new revisions and punched up the script, but since they didn‚Äôt fully change the structure and plot or some percentage of the thing the original writers got credit of the barely-recognizable screenplay through WGA arbitration.",2023-12-12 22:03:13

"Back in the old days, you worked for cheap on crap movies because that's what those projects could afford. Now it seems like the big studios are cutting costs by hiring the cheap writers for their major projects, and that's why we're getting underwhelming crap. I can't tell you how many movies I've seen lately that have so much potential to be great, but the dialogue is so terrible that it sounds unnatural and ruins the experience. Maybe I'm a snob, though, who knows?",2023-12-12 22:05:13
"I totally agree with you on most points, but I do note that Suicide Squad and Venom marketed to showcase the humanity and humor in their movies, while all the ads for Morbius seemed like ""We're going for a dark and psychologically deep horror thriller about... bats? Vampires? Idk, Jared Leto is in it and we know he's a creep but his eyes give sick contrast!""

Morbius seemed to be aiming for the... angry teenage boy audience, which is a solid audience- it worked for the Dark Knight, but didn't showcase the buddy cop aspect of the other two, any romance, any physical or metaphorical light... plus, Jared Leto is icky imo. So that's why I didn't see it, but watched the other two. I still don't know what it's about, despite having seen several advertisements for it, just have a vague concept of Jared Leto and maybe bats. 

So it's not the writers so much as the producers and marketing people probably being like ""it's a comic book movie (I think?) so we're gonna really try to get that angsty 12-22 year old boy crowd and any Jared Leto fans still hanging around. Make it *mysterious*."" And the writers did their jobs.",2023-12-12 17:18:26

People need to be able to set and commit to schedules so that they can commit to other areas of their life and coordinate. That's how the grown up world works. Movies take a lot of people to make them and it's unfair to keep all of them in limbo waiting to know when to go or having their schedule pushed back/rearranged while the creative soul artistic writer shirks deadlines because that feels too much like an office job. A lot of these people need to finish this job on time so they can make the beginning of their next one so they don't lose it so that they can pay their bills.",2023-12-12 17:47:01

"A lot of the big franchises are hiring 'yes men' that just follow the studios to a T because they see the films less as individual works and more as TV episodes, or more cynically, content for the profit engine. Marvel is more focused on their overall game plan than letting the actual films and shows breath as standalone artistic products, so they hire people that just follow the studio/producer directions. Back in the day, franchises had more flair because they let the directors make the films they actually wanted to make. That's not to say there are no franchises today that allow director freedom. For all its shortcomings, DC very clearly has let the directors pretty much run amuck with less vision of a franchise game plan.",2023-12-12 22:13:58

This in addition to the subjective ways storytelling and writing have suffered.

"Yes, it's pretty much always been the case that for every good movie that stands the test of time there's 100 dogshit movies which are soon forgotten. Same as any other creative media from TV shows to music to theater productions to novels, etc.

The thing with movies, though, is that their production and distribution has always been dominated a very big, very centralised industry. For a long time, the quality *at the top end of that industry* has been consistently quite high. Aside from the occasional bomb, most of the low-quality stuff comes from the middle or bottom of the industry, or from outside the industry mainstream entirely.

But recently this situation has basically reversed - the proportion of good-to-bad movies hasn't changed much, but how they're distributed relative to the *subset of releases most people are actually exposed to* certainly has. And while this kind of thing has actually happened a few times in cinema history, it's the first time this situation has arisen in living memory for anyone under the age of about 50 or so, so it seems unusual and it's not surprising that people feel like ""all movies suck these days"".",2023-12-13 00:00:28

They're making movies to make money. They have a stable of Spider-Man adjacent characters and want to make movies with them. Netflix paid them a bunch of money for content to stream (I think Amazon did too), so these movies are all pretty much paid for.

Sony doesn't own merchandise either, even if it's merchandise related to a Sony film or Sony/Insomniac games. Marvel/Disney does.

"$50m in 2008 is equivalent to $75m today. These are what mid-budget movies cost these days. Especially considering Disney throws $200-250m on the average MCU movie, and $300+ on a handful.

Netflix paid Sony for Morbius streaming rights and it topped for the period of time where it was brought to the service, to the point where Netflix signed a deal for future Sony movie streaming rights. From what was discussed about the financials of it, it seems like Sony makes money from the Netflix deal, makes money from the box office, and Netflix has prepaid for the production of these movies.

It doesn't hurt that they've made a bunch of money on the Spider-Verse and Venom films. They pretty much have free reign to keep throwing things at the wall to see what sticks.

"I don't mean the animated movies, I mean whatever this live action universe they are trying to create with venom, morbius and madame web is called.

Also it's not about whether it's doing good or bad 'right now' the question was can the brand be damaged? I'm saying of course it can, if it couldn't then Andrew Garfield would have gotten another movie.",2023-12-12 18:23:38
"False. Guardians 3 was far better than any spider villian Sony movie.

Edit: should clarify, spiderverse 1 and 2 excluded. They weren't their live action villain universe though.",2023-12-12 18:41:13
"Unless a movie gets over the marketing budget as well, ie the 2.5x rule, it's still a flop.  The Flash is just as much of a flop as The Marvels even though the former got over its listed budget.",2023-12-12 15:44:24
"Yeah but this is much more low profile. It‚Äôs got nothing recognizable as far as superheroes go, I don‚Äôt think Dakota Johnson is a huge draw, it‚Äôs already being received badly and being compared to morbius. Could do much worse than that one.",2023-12-12 15:54:57

"I don't think this logic actually holds.

It's basically a statement that movies are strictly doing worse and worse over time, and thus it's to be expected that all the worst films will always be modern, due to reasons that have nothing to do with their perceived quality. But the *successful* films look the same, regardless of era. It's actually pretty remarkable, but the fact that the top list can include Gone with the Wind, Star Wars, Titanic, Avatar and Endgame all pretty clustered together says that the benchmark is pretty much the benchmark, right? It's about whether or not the public embraces the film, not the schedule on which they watched it in the theater. Yes, people see movies for shorter periods now, but there are also... more theaters, with bigger auditoriums and more screens. The proof of this is ticket sales: those films all fall in pretty much the same range (mid-high 300m).

There's other implied arguments to this that don't really hold up. IE, one assumption is that having the option to watch something on streaming means a lost ticket sale, as opposed to a gained stream view (ie, that the person NEVER would have seen it in a theater, not that they chose not to because streaming was an option). There are some movies where this is clearly the case, but there are others where it's not clear (ie, Five Nights did exceptionally well BOTH in the box office and streaming).",2023-12-12 20:29:54
"Cleopatra failed to even crack the list I was working from, it's not really anywhere close to the top bomb list.

More specifically, it lost money more because of it's *advertising* budget than it's production one (44m advertising on a 31m budget).  It also happened to open at #1, was extremely popular internationally, and won 4 Oscars. Really, even a casual google about the movie would have told you it's a completely terrible example to use.",2023-12-13 01:27:11
"I think Vegetable is being hyperbolic, but I do think the way Across was a cliff hanger is not the same as Empire or Infinity War.  Across was a hard cut, not a break in the story like the others.",2023-12-12 18:02:33
"I'm really dubious about those numbers, especially as the actual source is locked behind a paywall. Are they lumping in comic sales with retail sales? Why is Spider-Man the only one with listed Video Game sales and Merchandise sales.

"Again, never said it's not a flop just because it makes more than it's production cost. Also the 2.5x rule doesn't always apply. It only does when a films marketing budget is the same cost of similar to it's production budget. Example if a movie has a production budget of $150M + a $150M marketing budget its break even point would be about $375M. But if the production budget is $150M and marketing budget is $100M its break even point would be more like $325M. So for madame web for example production budget is $80 so we'll assume the marketing budget is also $80M so its break even point would be exactly $200M, and probably even lower cause I doubt it's marketing budget is $80M. So ultimately we could assume it has a break even point of say, $180M?",2023-12-12 15:49:32
"Streamed views don‚Äôt account for ticket sales so just taking what you said in your own reply to me is still a lost ticket sale. 
Piracy is also another thing that can affect ticket sales. 

I have friends that watch almost every now film but they pirate them all. If they did not have that option I will say they would at least watch a couple movies in theater. 

There are just too many options now",2023-12-12 20:53:07
"The first link is from a single year. A lot of heroes boom and then falls. Batman in the Dark Knight years and Arkham games was booming too.

"Your reasoning is flawed because we don't know the marketing budget of these movies unless the studio specifically says so which is rare.  Your assumption solely rides off the idea that we actually can say ""the marketing budget is this specific number"" but most of the time we can't.  That's the whole reason why the 2.5x rule of thumb exists at all.
  
> cause I doubt it's marketing budget is $80M
  
Like what is this?  Why would you doubt its marketing budget is $80M?  Just because it looks cheap?",2023-12-12 15:55:11
"My point is that the ticket sales are basically fixed for the top movies. Star Wars: 338,400,000. Avengers Endgame: 351,491,996. 42 years apart. Basically exactly the same level of success in terms of performance at the box office. 

So explain how it's somehow completely different because of viewing trends when the numbers are exactly the same.",2023-12-12 20:58:40

"Firstly I never stated a specific movies marketing budget it was just a hypothetical. Second, it's easy to doubt it's marketing budget is up to $80M because it seems to have weak marketing strategies and hasn't been advertised very strongly. A movie with a marketing budget like that what be marketed much better. Also there are some cases where the confirmed marketing budget for a film is significantly less than it's production budget, this goes for not just smaller films but some big blockbuster films as well. The 2.5x rule makes sense for a lot of big blockbusters but not all.",2023-12-12 16:00:20
"The population has grown exponentially in that time frame. So now fewer and fewer people on a percentage basis go to the movies as there are other forms of entertainment and ways to view shows and movies. Which was my point lol

You have literally been agreeing with me hah

You have to look at other things than just inflation on total cost and revenue. As many things do not actually follow the rate of inflation lol. 

Do the contracts for actors take up a bigger proportional cost now would be one thing. 

Do ticket prices follow inflation. From some quick googling ticket prices are actually rising higher than inflation from 1940 movie tickets to now. Based on avg price of ticket. So then one would assume, all else equal that a movie would be profitable with less ticket sales. (Kind of arguing against myself here lol)

Like I said there are so many variables. Beyond adjusting for inflation as many costs may not actually follow inflation. Look at professional athletes pay. That outpaces inflation. (The NFL Salary cap for ex in 2000 was 62.1 million. It is now 224.8 mil, that is doubling the rate of inflation) So I would assume top actors and directors outpace it as well. That means you can‚Äôt just say that you could make a movie for 15 mil in 1975 and adjust for inflation and you could make the same movie today. The 2 lead actors salary very well may outpace the inflation adjustment lol

 I would assume there is a larger special effects and editing budget now than before etc",2023-12-12 21:43:38
"Its kind of Very hard to measure popularity, you kind of have the feel by the experience of what you see around you.

For example, we both know that Harry Potter, pokemon and barbie are insanely popular Just by noticing around, but this kind of have a bias of the country you live that can skew what is more popular.

If we use Google trends for ""batman"" and ""spiderman"" since 2004-present and Worldwide, we get that Batman is more popular in searchs with the two having ups and downs when a New thing is released, with Batman dominating most countries in the world.

This year for example, Spiderman is Very close and having a lot of ups, we can say It is a Very good year for Spiderman and he is more popular currently.

So its a matter of we deciding: popular with a lot of people and time, or popular currently?",2023-12-13 19:46:34
