i like the line from the villain where hes like “they will destroy everything i’ve built” but like  did he build they never explained anything about him is he a businessman an arms dealer does he go out as spiderman at night it’s literally just him and shosh from girls in a room,2024-02-15
"for anyone wondering 

yes the fact that all the shots of the trio in their hero suits are all in the same location at night as well as the weird emphasis on how fun and important it was for sydney sweeny to hang upsidedown correctly means that the only time they are suited up is for maybe two minutes in a psychic vision",2024-02-15

why is no one talking about this so hear me out the movie is in ny she hears on the car radio that the cops are looking for them mistakingly thinking she kidnapped the 3 young girls she takes em to new jersey and says stay put i’ll be back in 3 hours i have to look into the bad guy at my house girls don’t stay put and go to a diner right so it’s been maximum 4 hours since their kidnapping they are in a different state this movie takes place in 2003 and you got a trucker across the diner reading a news paper with front page news being the 3 girls pictures and their kidnapping being like let me call the cops how the  did that newspaper get out and make front page news across state lines in bum  nowhere new jersey within 4 hours ,2024-02-15

"something like onethird of this is the characters playing a at one point literal game of “how close can we get to saying ‘peter parker’ without actually saying ‘peter parker’” and somehow that’s not the worst part of the whole thing which comes down to a stiff competition between the performances especially a visibly bored dakota johnson and a careerworst tahar rahim the effects which really embody the early 2000s era of the story by looking not like an early 2000s movie but an early 2000s fmv game the script its plotting and characterizations so thin you’d think the shoot was an extended game of improv and sj clarkson’s abysmal direction and the nonstop crash zooms and jump cuts and brazen adr it comprises

edit i just remembered that madame web is blinded when she is hit in the face by a firework that she herself set off this also puts her in a wheelchair for reasons i can’t quite parse jesus christ what a magnificent shambles it gets better the more i think about it i’m genuinely laughing at my desk",2024-02-15

"of course this movie is really bad and ridiculous but will point some of the stupider ones

movie never explains what links them nor gives any indication howwhy these women would be good superheroes theyre never selfless or show any skill other than cpr

the villain can see the future butthe future changed was it a false vision which leads me to


i dont get dakotas power is she having visions or is she time traveling sometimes she is aware she is in the future and sometimes she is completely shocked in the climax getting to the helicopterwas that not her seeing the future or a possible future like why did the helicopter go down if thats not what she saw",2024-02-15

zero hope for kraven at this point ,2024-02-15
how did this movie get made i really don’t understand ,2024-02-15
"this was absolutely  awful  worst film ive seen in the cinema in years and yes its worse than morbius

the good

 celeste oconnor and isabela merced were the best parts of the movie

 there are a few nice shots i guess

 the joke where dakota tries to climb the wall like spiderman and falls down its lame but it made me laugh which is more than i can say for the rest of the movie

the bad

 the dialogue just so much boring exposition so many awful jokes that dont land characters talk like human beings never do like introducing themselves by saying their full name for our benefit

 the plot for starters its an insanely generic origin story then there are insanely dumb story points like the villain having a premonition of the spiderwomen beating him in the future so he somehow manages to capture images of his dreams and then uses software to theorise what the spiderwomen look like in the present and they suddenly morph into exact images of sydney sweeney merced etc its insultingly 

 the inane subplot where cassie gets framed for the villain attacking cops wouldnt the subway have cameras even if not it felt so contrived considering the villain is shown having control of the citys cameras a simple line about him interfering with them wouldve made this better

 all the desperate spiderman links i like adam scott but never really bought him as uncle ben and the subplot centered around the birth of spiderman felt tackedon

 the with all power replacement line the first time i didnt think it was so bad but its repeated later on and made me laugh

 technically this film is a mess it makes morbius look competently directed by comparison tons of weird snapzooms and digital zooms for no reason an excess of shaky cam which makes most of the action look awkward or tough to follow

 bad editing feels very choppy also makes the premonitions more annoying than exciting to watch

 most of the cgi sucks

 villain is awful

 for some reason most of tahar rahims dialogue seemed to be dubbed sometimes its legit out of sync onscreen but a lot of what he says is where his mouth isnt visible on screen yet it was noticeably recorded after the fact because the timbrereverb sounds different

 obnoxious product placement for pepsi the baby shower scene for mary parker has a can of pepsi strategically facing the camera in almost every shot also the final battle takes place on the roof of a pepsi factory and the villain gets crushed to death by a pepsi sign 

 lazy obvious musical choices like britney spears  toxic

 performances arent great for the most part johnson just feels awkward and not in a fun selfaware way sweeney felt miscast to me i just found her goofy stockings and glasses setup completely laughable too

 trailers lied about the movie spiderwomen never suit up except for about 45 seconds of flashforwards at the beginning and end of the film

i thought this was absolutely dreadful and not even in a fun way like morbius theres no have  scene its just soulless and dull from start to finish 210",2024-02-15

"this was a disaster from the gaping plot craters to the stilted dialogue to the wooden and sometimes unintentionally funny performances this was a product placement stuffed frankenshow from start to finish nonsensical plot contrivences bad action and a really forced attempt at a family dynamic that did not work also holy  the adr was bad as were the 80 million 360 camera turns michael bay would blush only points for the wall crawling joke that mustered a chuckle and the defibs on the ambulance roof was a neat use of the powers not sure about practicality


ps who watches christmas carol in  july",2024-02-15
i was barely hanging on because of the horrible pacing but then cassie says she needs to go to peru and i got the feeling the movie was actually going to go back to peru and i walked out it was that bad there was just zero redeeming qualities about it i had a feeling that the only time we were going to see them all in costume was in that flashback at the very beginning leaving me nothing to look forward to and reading these comments turns out i was right i wanted this movie to be laughably bad but it was just unfortunately bad i knew i was  when the director chose in the first five minutes to use an umbrella being opened as a jump scare,2024-02-15

why did y’all go see this ,2024-02-15
"i went to see this movie alone at an amc at 1 pm on valentine’s day surrounded by about four or five other truly twisted individuals beyond saving

so yes i saw the movie in the way i believe the writers intended it to be seen

this movie became a mustsee for me after the infamous trailer drop got memed to death and dakota johnson nixed her agent before embarking on an incredible press tour

that tour featured her apparent puzzlement at the trailer’s online reaction and also a series of various seethrough garments that i firmly believe were engineered in a lab to distract the masses as much as scientifically possible see the butt cheeks and boots outfit on seth meyers

suffice it to say that coming out of this movie i had a lot of questions

did the american heart association pay the studio to promote the practice of cpr

why did the writers feel the teen tragedy trio all needed to have the saddest parental backstories possible

what kind of plastic junk is mattie’s dad helping to manufacture does he work for a temu contractor

why did the teen trio just walk away from a campfire they built in the woods

how much money would the forest service had to have given sony to get some fire safety promotion

why is the diner 50 feet from the woods is this common in new jersey

how did emma roberts’ agent talk her into being in 5 scenes of this movie is emma roberts okay — did she lose money on crypto

why did the writers make us sit through dakota johnson’s deadpan awkwardness at a baby shower

what the  is the villain’s day job what is his daytoday motivation other than not getting killed by the tragedy teens in his near future what does he do besides look after his pet spider nag his evil assistant and create the world’s best surveillance system using a 10digit passcode he got from his nsa honey whats the extent of his relationship with his evil assistant — does she sleep at his place

will madame web ever obtain any real powers or just the ability to envision the future and summon the world’s worst cgi sequences

and finally when is madame web 2 coming out  and will emma roberts be back",2024-02-15
as someone who will never see this movie can someone explain what the mary parker thing is,2024-02-15
"im not sure if i have the time to properly get into all the ways this movie licks  so bear with me here madame web is an utter mess of tone and character that lets you down at every turn a movie hacked to so many pieces that the adr and cuts feel like theyre held in place by scotch tape a two hour runtime with no real humor or action to speak of and four leads that struggle to fit in the most basic backstories and who all have negative chemistry with each other

the whole thing is just so  awkward dakota has zero urgency in her opening scene in which shes racing an ambulance through nyc with a patient in the back and she holds that level of intensity for every action sequence her dialogue seems to be distilled down to saying everything thats happening out loud and there are tons of scenes between the four main gals that have no rhythm and you may struggle to even figure out what their dynamics are when they arent saying super obvious things that wont come into play later like science matters  the premise of the movie is the great importance in these three girls but the movie doesnt depict them as having any sort of special outlook or skill or even morality that could possibly make them useful supers and to make this bowl of nothing that much more disappointing none of them even gain powers or don their outfits surely thats all being saved for madame web 2 no doubt rushing into production as we speak

im not going to go as far to say this movie is subversive because i think that implies some sort of thought put into the decisions and what to depict but its hard to see any other reason that the 40th superhero movie in the last five years would feature no heroes or real fights there are action scenes but its usually seeing a small glimpse of action or a death that would be cool if it werent so toothless then snapping back to reality so dakota can do something to avoid it beyond seeing glimpses into the future unless it would stop her from being paralyzed or permanently blinded her only superpower seems to be grand theft auto and hitting bad man with said auto it shouldnt be so hard to find a way to make her power cool or clever but it goes for the easiest and lamest route every time theres no room for humor like if she were to see something and react different for a laugh every bit of action that could have been interesting is immediately marked as not canon as her superpower actually becomes stopping anything cool from happening


the third act is one of the most ridiculous climaxes ive seen in a movie like this and it swings so far into it that it almost becomes parody but not the fun self aware kind its more like the insincere kind you get when a company is trying to pretend theyre in on the joke but it becomes clear they dont even know what a joke is but they want to make sure you drink your pepsi™ her going to peru is a massive momentum stopper not that this had much to stop but it halts what little is going on i told myself i would try not to use superlatives in this review but the dream montage that is sparked by her trip to peru is truly some of the most awful dream montage filmmaking ive ever seen the issue of her resenting her mother really comes out of nowhere and is presented and solved in the same 45 seconds and if you arent picking up on the subtle visual storytelling dont worry because dakota is standing right there to explain everything out loud

you went to the amazon to cure me

but i dont have a neuromuscular disorder

or my favorite from earlier in the movie so it pigeon didnt die

i dont want to accuse the filmmakers of anything but this movie itself thinks i am so  that i cant tell whats happening when it snaps back to reality so it has dakota say out loud often to nobody exactly whats happening or what shes thinking i actually really like dakota she seems really funny honestly and the very few sincere chuckles in this movie are due to her delivery but this writing is doing her no favors and you can tell she and everybody doesnt want to be there

back to the third act we all know how these climaxes go and this movie blunders through the motions throughout the movie the characters learn things that will be used in the final act such as that incredibly awkward scene where dakota teaches the girls to  resuscitate and we have to watch all three of them try in a long scene that im pretty sure is just fetish content the final power dakota learns from a peruvian native dressed like fred from scooby doo is used when the stakes are as low as possible the three girls need help getting up at the same time and negated by a single punch and never used again even when this movie sets something up the payoff barely limps to the finish line with an unenthusiastic there are you happy

ive spent too much time on this already but theres still like five things that are the stupidest thing ive seen in theaters in a long time

 the villain shows up in dakotas dreams or whatever and volunteers his entire plan and motives to her when she had no clue of either

 dakota doesnt recognize the villain right away even though hes prominently in one of seemingly only two photographs she has of her mother

 las aranas is just spanish for the spiders

 dakota gets the idea that all of this is related to her mother because sydney sweeney says he crawled like a spider then she leaves three teenagers she just kidnapped in a forest with no transportation and says ill be back in a few hours

 they never explain why cassies true nemesis is a pepsi can she in multiple scenes just cannot seem to open its not a physical limitation she constantly almost opens the soda and decides not to truly cerebral acting

 she steals a taxi cab early in the movie and drives it for the entire movie even as it collects obvious damage she smartly avoids the fuzz by prying off the license plates because that doesnt stick out as obviously illegal

 at the end of the movie the girls show up with chinese takeout and dakota says kung pao chicken sounds great and sydney sweeney says how did you know how does she know did you not watch the movie

any points this movie does receive is because the only time i felt like anyone was leaning into how  and fun this should have been was at the end when dakota was in a wheelchair wearing those insane sunglasses that blocked out her dead eyes i could tell she was cracking up under there bless her heart

anyways this will undoubtedly be my lowest reviewed movie this year it ended two hours ago and i truly cannot stop thinking about how it fumbled every moment and tone and barely crawled to the credits almost impressive to make a movie this oblivious and unaware when this type of movie has been the most produced and popular type of mainstream film for the last 15 years 210

it starts with a terrible script like venom and morbius it seems to have fallen right out of 2003 fitting as thats when the film takes place embarrassing individual lines heavy on exposition repetitive like they shot the same details in a few scenes and decided to keep both versions  this happens a few times and inconsistencies in logic time place character and powers 

the acting of the bad script doesnt help it ranges from bored when adam scott cant bother be wary to awkward dakota johnson as the titular character seems lost to outright atrocious too many in that category for an aside zosie mamet as the villain’s man in the chair in too many inexplicably dumb sequences sydney sweeney looks like shes straining to read off outoffocus cue cards and the absolute worst acting ive seen in a long time comes from the terrible “evil for evils sake villain tahar rahim nothing he said wasnt laughable  the  poor adr did no one any favors  


madame web looks like it was shot in an ai art program one full of odd zooms to hide this  the editing is filled with “why did they do this” choices and the action bits for the few that happen are curiously low energy 


the attempts to shoehorn the spiderman mythology are eye rolling and i audibly groaned sorry two other people there

"i saw the movie last night and i have a couple questions 

how did cassy who doesn’t have any super strength pick up and palm a giant piece of metal and use that to deflect fireworks so she doesn’t have any super strength she’s just lebron

how did the main villain who survived being hit by a taxi and an ambulance die by a falling metal sign

how did cassy right after discovering her super powers and saving all the children not see into the future and see the villain was about to hit her across the face 

how does nobody report to the authorities this masked super villain who makes several public appearances and commits  at times square",2024-02-17

add bad acting and horrible dialogue plus pretty boring and unlikable characters on top of that i can see why it got such  reviews

also somehow the spiderpower effects were worse than the original spiderman in  2002 and having out of sync dialogue with an actors lips is absolutely inexcusable in 2024

also what’s the deal with the villain we’re not really told anything about him or his background apart from a line you might miss about how he wish he had the spider to help save his family but… ugh i can’t even be bothered to care

edit im amazed to see people who think this movie was fine and ive even seen some comments about how its no worse than any other campy films or bmovies if it had a lower budget sure but this cost 80 million to make for the faults of the creator which had a similar budget at least that looked amazing and had some cool scenes",2024-02-15

my eyes teared up at the amount of effort made for just a 5 min pitch meeting episode,2024-02-15
question about this atrocious movie during the villains dream sequence was it implied that after they steal his spider he starts to age and loses his powers if not then it makes no sense how he dies from getting thrown out of a building he should be able to either land or survive the fall since he looks identical 30 years after stealing the spider i was assuming it kept him young and he needed it to keep his powers either way very poorly written plot point,2024-02-16
"i love watching this bad movie

so our miss webb just hijacked some random ny yellow cab with 3 random school girls she met 10 minutes ago on the sub chased by a spider guy crawling on the ceiling drop them in the  knows where woods became wanted on print papers in next 3 hours for child abduction somehow came back home unbothered having some forced beef with the mother she never met then drove back to the woods found the girls missing saved them from the creepy spider guy in another random diner like 10 feet away handed over them to uncle ben and while mind you still being wanted somehow ended up in peru on a bus police cbp

at this point this movie becomes so good that it transcends logic and physics and fully embraces it nature of comedy and urban high fantasy

i love it",2024-02-17

from peru dakota gets to ny as a baby  
  

dakota leaves the 3 of them in the forest tells them that she will be back in 3 hours while it is getting dark i am not sure whether ill be mad or confused  
  

they leave a fire in the woods holy  that is how you start forest fires  
  

then the girls dance on top of a chair despite being told to lay low not to do anything  but theyre teens so whatever  
  

when she gets her astral projection she tells a girl to you can do it while helping the others i wonder if the one who made the script still has a job  
  

chest compressions are way too weak  
   

multiple product placements how much did pepsi pay them for it to be a pepsi movie  
  

villain was so flat i didnt know what he did with that spider after getting it did he sell it did he use the powers to get money idk  
  

the theme the vibe felt like morbius i read the comments here and i saw that they have the same directors i mean is it nepotism how are these dudes getting hired despite how awful that movie was",2024-02-18

she knew her mother was a scientist studying spiders but she never throughly read her journals

if you  away the halfbaked superhero bs and the cast with less chemistry than a slice of soggy bread what youre left with is a final destinationesque movie about 2 people with the ability of foresight one of whom is desperately convinced 3 girls will be responsible for his death it could have had a great ending with the circumstances of his death playing out revealing that his obsession was the catalyst for all of it",2024-02-15

“her name is cassie webb daughter of constance webb deceased”

like why was it perfect piece of information about her mom relevant to you at that moment there was no way to know that it would be useful to ezekiel

also after cassie’s doctor visit the doc is like “get some rest watch some old movies” and she chooses a christmas carol in the middle of summer just so they could shove in the line about “things that will happen or things that could happen” 

every bit of writing in this is like they worked backwards from some disjointed thought and had to figure out how to fit it in to move the plot

i know it’s not a fantastic movie but when people talk about quantumania being bad i honestly think people don’t realize what an actual bad movie looks like i hope this puts things into perspective",2024-02-16

ive rated over 2000 movies on imdb over the past few years and this is the first movie ive ever given a 110 which i guess technically makes it the worst movie ive ever seen it also almost became the first movie ive ever walked out on in a theater but i somehow managed to keep that streak going i cannot believe how unbelievably bad this movie is and i have no idea how any person at sony responsible for green lighting this movie a ever got their job in the first place and b still has a job,2024-02-15

"okay so this wasnt good but i kinda loved it for being a hokey piece of  anyway

they really went and set a superhero movie in 2003 and then made a superhero movie from 2003 and while i dont think that was on purpose it sure did feel nice 

it was like a proper throwback to  like daredevil and catwoman and fantastic four 2005 and just  it kinda worked for hitting that nostalgia core even if it wasnt on purpose

im gonna give it a 310 for effort but a 710 for achievement because what they set out to make absolutely wasnt what they made but i think they accidentally made something better than that",2024-02-16

 people didnt dress like that in the early 00s there were no highwaisted jeans and low cut pants with whale tails were the fashion for teenage girls although i get why they didnt do it in the movie
 we just spent the last three years hypersexualizing sydney sweeney and now were going to give her the shes all that treatment nah
 was the bad guy rich why did he have a staff of one how did he make money why were the girls going to  him in the future
 a highranking nsa agent hooks up with a rando at the opera and goes back to his apartment with her badge and then dies but no one in the nsa is going to confirm if her account was compromised
 random security cameras werent good enough in 2003 to identify a broom let alone  recognition of a passenger in a speeding car
 why did the girls have to go with adam scott when emma roberts went into labour
 why did dakota johnson act so much difference after her accident just a complete personality change
 also how much do new york paramedics make to afford that huge apartment in queens
 cant the spiders fix madame webb again or do their healing powers last forever i dont understand why shes stuck as a blind cripple
 only one of the teenagers looked like a teenager
 every bit of dialogue from the mom was stilted and possibly the worst writing ive seen in a movie the last year
 pepsi presents madame webb
 howd he get photo realistic images of the girls on the computer could he draw them from his dreams and then they can just track them out of everyone in the us apparently
 if they can find the girls from his mine sketches how come they didnt track dakota johnson going to peru

"so is the implication at the end with “that’s what he thinks” that she knows her partner and best friend is going to lose his brother and sisterinlaw very soon raise their child and then die himself in a tragedy that teaches this child responsibility   and despite her being able and willing to change the future she’s just going to let that happen presumably because she knows the world needs a spiderman  

that could have been an interesting turnbut it’s dropped way too late in the movie and seems to go against cassie’s arc of becoming a more warm and empathetic person  

it’s ironic that after three soon to be five movies starring spiderman villains the heroic character is the only one who spidey really has a reason to hate",2024-02-19

saw it last night this was a really fun bad movie in my opinion it was not very good but so memeable,2024-02-19
"this was the most fun i’ve had at a movie in a long time it feels like everyone involved in making this movie in front of and behind the camera just gives 0  the editing is jarring the cinematography is inconsistent the acting is bland the costuming is lazy the song choices are crazy and the writing is so unpolished every scene has a ridiculous moment to laugh at and i was dying laughing several times during this movie

it also kinda sucks because there were legitimately some interesting ideas in the script like how the future visions work and cassie learning to control them or basically having spiderman as the villain which is an awesome concept the thing is that they don’t really do anything all that interesting with these ideas — and again it’s all so hilariously bad

"well ive just watched it

its a bad  horrible flick but in a fun way this is like the battlefield earth of the comic book movies the dutch angles the hilarious acting and the bad editing  action scenes are only a plus its definitely not offensive or disgusting in absolutely any way

dakota really carried the movie im surprised i enjoyed her i was fully expecting her to  but she was bearable the 3 girls on the other hand were sometimes irritating and we know nothing about them or their lives the villain was horrible in every scene from the acting to execution we also barely know a thing about him

things simply happen in this movie theres hardly context at all the protagonist has to protect 3 girls but sometimes she leaves them behind and even travels to another country and returns in hours the editing is atrocious 

sometimes the dialogues are heard but the actors mouth doesnt move its very easy to spotwas the main bad guy dubbed 

its mediocre and horrible but ive seen worse the cinemascore in the c range is well deserved not f material but i understand how many people probably gave it an f anyway lol",2024-02-17

for the love of  trade 10 years of sony pictures  for a single 2011 dragon girl sequel lose money up front make more than you would have lost making all this disconnected spiderman afflicted  
everyone is just working for a pay check but holy  this industry is already largely  make something worth making pretend you’re golden era mgm playstation is already keeping sony up

utilise that to make something worth making 

maybe the head of sony pictures and subsidies are lawyers become studio heads that don’t actually care about the industry but holy  is this disappointing to see over and over from a major studio
there aren’t many that can get high budgets together take a moment to make something worth making

"rewatched it twice because watching it once kind of broke me and i wanted to watch it so i could digest the absolute baffling directorial writing and editing choices i wonder how much was ezekiel was reshot because all of his lines are all adred to  and back and nearly all of his scenes are isolated from literally everything else in the film sony also fails to really nail the 2003 year thanks to the guy playing his phone in the train whilst wearing a mets hat that uses the redesigned logo in the 2010s


aside from that whats up with the two reused shots from spiderman 2 seriously what the  why is her theme a blatent ripoff of the ps4 spiderman theme too


the performances feel like theyre all performing their lines through a zoom call with massive delays and it doesnt help that the script is devoid of human dialogue

the absolute peak dialogue includes 

you must have at least one fond memory of your mother “well actually my mother died in childbirth… but it wasn’t that bad i mean obviously it was bad yknow she died laughs uh but i feel totally healthy death in childbirth is super rare i mean she chose to be way deep in the amazon in the last month of her pregnancy so she was hundreds of miles away from the nearest medical facility… so…”

the potential is infinite… its intoxicating… but… in the wrong hands i mean… people will be tracked anywhere they go… its going to change everything…

what are the odds of them in the same place and at the same time “its not a coincidence” there must be something that connects them or maybe something that will


enough your voice is like drilling to the head of my skull and i need to think i’m cassie what are your names

okay anyone who wants to leave can leave right now wait sorry no you cant actually leave because you guys are the only ones that know what’s actually happening okay well this is what we’re gonna do we’re gonna lay low for a little bit and i’ll figure out how to get out of this… this is still not a kidnapping okay

i don’t know crazy  been happening and i don’t know why stop asking me ok


i recognize you too… yeah you live in my building you leave your junk mail in the lobby and then everybody else has to clean it for you “okay well there should’ve been a recycling bin there”

3 hours stay here don’t do anything dumb seriously don’t do dumb things

okay so this guys hands somehow release an acute neurotoxin and it is painful i was lucky the longer he holds onto the more poison goes into your system “then what happens” then your heart stops but you can offset cardiac arrest with cpr

but i don’t have a neuromuscular disorder…

no no i am unwilling to accept the diagnosis of… helplessness… and i’m not going to teach my daughter too either…

you didn’t get the gift of greater physical strength or the ability to use poison but seeing into the future is only the start your mind has infinite potential if you master your power you can use your web to be in more than one place at the same time you’re the only one who can change the future and when you take on the responsibility great power will come

madame webs final suit in a nutshell,2024-02-15
why are sony so relentlessly bad at this,2024-02-15
the actress looks bored and confused all the time she walks in a klonopininduced cloud,2024-02-15
"it just completely lacks any ambition as a film its basically a lengthy montage that should be the opening credits of a spiderwomen team up movie so much of it just makes absolutely no sense the villain is a spiderman for some reason but whats his plan it never really goes into it the girls are not even powered up you get one scene of them in costume that lasts two minutes and another 30 seconds at the end its basically like having a spiderman film but its a few years before he gets bitten 

the final shot of them all in costume is such a middle finger to the audience hey youve sat through 90 mins of filler maybe if you pay for another ticket down the line youll get the actual movie

they could have made madame web leading the spider women against the sinister six  but they made this instead",2024-02-15
you know a film is bad when its been out for two days and it doesnt have a plot summary on wikipedia yet,2024-02-16
i don’t think i’ve ever seen a movie there it felt like nothing made any sense so that’s impressive,2024-02-16
written by the dudes who did morbius directed by someone who has never directed a film before its like they wanted it to fail lol,2024-02-16
this is actually the perfect marriage of character and actor because cassie wanted nothing to do with the story and dakota wanting nothing to do with the movie,2024-02-16
the only good thing was adam scott as ben parker even that wasnt that great,2024-02-16
"madame web is nearly two hours of dropping exposition in the form of dialogue 

they made the movie feel half again as long by showing and reshowing scenes",2024-02-17
710 sure there are bad lines throughout the movie but the story was well in my opinion i liked how cassie was able to connect back with her mother and see what really happened i also enjoyed the paramedics scenes a lot i liked the visuals and how they kept flickering throughout did not know this was pretty much a prequel but i was entertained,2024-02-17
"most memorable parts of the movie

the beyonce product placement

toxic by britney spears playing in the diner

pepsi product placement",2024-02-17
what is sony trying to accomplish with these movies i honestly cant remember the last time i got so bored in a movie,2024-02-17
i was trying to recall what the spider tribe climbing reminded me of then finally figured it out its literally the spider monkey scene from twilight,2024-02-17
sony will forever be my heroes if they release an edit where every scene ezekiel is in he is replaced with bully mcguire from spiderman 3,2024-02-18
"i went into this movie expecting it to be a cringe masterpiece on par with morbius since the two films share the same writers and the same studio and i was not disappointed


between the wooden performances the badly dubbed adr the poorly rendered cgi and the completely  crazy plot that can basically be described as a cross between terminator final destination and thats so raven this movie was a trip if you like to watch so bad its good comic book movies then youll have fun with madame web 


theres a lot of product placement for pepsicola in this movie and i find it funny that the product placement actually winds up saving the day in the end when the villain gets crushed by a giant pepsi sign",2024-02-18
it’s not so bad if you think of it as an elaborate pepsi commercial,2024-02-18
this makes me so sad i was so sad when i watched evil spiderman get crushed by a large pepsi sign he clearly displayed emotions while he was falling and it was recorded by a camera truly of one the best movies i ever watched you guys dont understand true cinema,2024-02-18
movie was so  funny in all the ways they probably didnt intend for it to be delicious delicious garbage,2024-02-18
why did madame web getting hit in the face with a firework turn her into professor x,2024-02-18
"pros 

 that one scene with the girl charging the electrical paddles and using it to shock the top of the ambulance was kind of clever and fun

cons

 the writing acting directing editing cinematography sound design shot composition story and pacing 

i cant say this is some funny bad masterpiece the way some are hyping it up its more fascinatingly bad in how sloppily edited it feels but holy  the one moment that absolutely killed me was when they were going through the fireworksexplosives factory and she goes get down right before the firework conveniently shoots a perfect rectangular door shaped hole in the wall without actually showing any explosion or bricks falling that felt like something straight out of bill  ted i fell out of my suit dude",2024-02-18
"sony needs to stop honestly just stop trying to make a spiderman cinematic universe madame web does not need a whole movie this was trash the ending was trash the story was trash sims was trash

what i really want to know is why the villain was walking around barefoot in the city during some scenes,2024-02-19
i like how they were trying to be smart and remix the great power great responsibility line and just completely butchered it,2024-02-19
madame web after the end mmhmmm pepsi is there anything it cant do,2024-02-19
"absolutely hilarious that the studio could track in real time how much money the movie was losing with people were walking out of the theatre and refunding their ticket 

it really doesn’t help that dakota johnson didn’t give any obvious  about the film in interviews and that the thought sydney sweeney one of the worst actresses out there should costar in it ",2024-02-19
literally an insane movie what the ,2024-02-19
were there any noteworthy lines or memes from the movie like how morbius had its morbin time,2024-02-19

it literally killed the bad guy in the end the pepsi did",2024-02-20
"it was not good not good at all however i still think morbius was worse  
come on sony you know you can get lucrative deal with marvel to let them do all the live action stuff you just concentrate on things like spiderverse",2024-02-21
this cost 10 times as much as godzilla minus one  having seen both id say it was the other way round complete mess computergamey looking terrible dialogue the whole thing is a set up for something im pretty sure were not going to see as well so its a pointless film as well unbelievably poor movie,2024-02-23
the scene in the hospital… two of those girls very much have mothers legally you can’t just say you’re their mother,2024-02-28
just saw this hilarious how dakota johnson drove cars through walls multiple times to directly hit the villain also i don’t get sydney sweeney or celeste o’connor abandoning their families at all sydney sweeney’s family seemed nice and she doesn’t think her dad would want her to come home and celeste o’connor’s rich parents would never come back from china so they’d completely leave because they might regret having a kid and then at the end none of the teens have powers right so dakota johnson is dressed like and acts like professor x for no reason,2024-02-28
i saw this a week ago and i still can’t figure out why ezekiel jumped right into the path of the ambulance,2024-02-28
the venom movies look like endgame compared to this,2024-03-01
"i cannot understand why dakota johnson keeps getting hired she is dreadful one thing i noticed watching the movie last night washer delivery of lines is so watery bland and weak even in scenes where nothing big is happening it really reminded me of how much an actors vocal delivery really sells the whole character like she could say pass me the pepsi ben and i just wouldnt believe she really wanted the pepsi lol surely thats a big red flag in casting preproduction  


also dont women and everyone i guess deserve better superhero movies than this i feel like women keep getting the  of movie quality in the superhero world black widow madame web ww2 capt marvel the way they tried to sell the 3 girls as future superheroes youll be strong youll be faced with adversity but youll push through because i believe in you its nauseatingly bad its sohamfisted and naff or something give women better scripts ffs lol just treat them like humans rather than a box to tick  


1 point for putting  by meredith brooks in the film at least",2024-02-16
"its almost like some weird fetish thing how she seems so happy at the end being both paralysed and blind having three girls looking after her

also even more twisted when she casually jokes about the upcoming demise of bens sister with the whole more responsibility than he knows line

also three girls in mortal danger from unstoppable spiderfiend i guess im going to leave them with my wet lettuce ambulance friend for protection while i leave the northeast of north america for peru

also just explain everything out loud by yourself because you might forget otherwise 

everyone who left the theater after watching this is now 3 dumber than when they entered may  help us all",2024-02-16
"just as much  fun as i was hoping

the performances are stilted the editing is incoherent and the writing is hilariously terrible there are magical amazonian spiderpeople we witness peter parker being born dakota johnson delivers exposition to a cat

the first act is way too long if this were 20 minutes shorter it would be perfect for a bad movie night with friends but i still had a ton of fun",2024-02-15
is it good bad,2024-02-15
one of the worst films ive ever seen,2024-02-15
"i’ve seen some bad movies over the years but this was barely a movie

it implies spidey engaged in cultural appropriation it plays all these games around the existence of peter parker and his family neither the protagonist or antagonist get much in the way of characterization there’s that scene where she and her mom reconcile despite the film not having established in any  way that she felt any particular way about her late mother the movie is set in 2003 with mostly late 90s needle drops and one sequence relying on a song that actually came out in 2004 a christmas carol is on tv in the middle of summer the movie teases a third act we don’t get the action consists almost solely of cassandra ramming vehicles into things the dialogue is some of the worst i’ve ever heard in a movie

a letterboxd review described this movie as razzie bait and that’s spot on",2024-02-16
im gonna get mocked so badly for this but id honestly couldve give this movie a chance if they wouldve actually used the suits and give them powers when it comes to this genre im incredibly easy to impress just give me a classic fight scene 3rd act thingy and im down hearing that the movie barely had 30 seconds of them in the suits is just so  heartbreaking ,2024-02-17
my favorite part was when evil spiderman was killed by pepsi,2024-02-17

this has gone down 34 further on its rt since yesterday when i last checked impressive,2024-02-15
if i’m being honest it was actually a pretty fun time at the movies a third of the way through the entire theater couldn’t resist laughing at the horrendous lines anymore so we just all gave in the rest was pure comedy awful awful movie fun time,2024-02-16
"just saw this movie and it was kinda terrible i feel like if sony wanted to make a madame web movie without the rights to spiderman they could have just had madame web as she is in the comics and cut out the parker family entirely have her reach out to the girls as they gain their powers to shepherd them along their destiny and then let them prove sims fears wrong by choosing the heroic path of not killing that would have been phenomenal and given us actual fights and more runtime to flesh both them and sims out but they had two of the worst writers in recent hollywood history at the helm lol

but also why sims as the villain in the first place when morlunn would have made so much more sense maybe that would be too morbiusadjacent for them  or  help us theyre waiting to butcher morlunn in a silk movie before letting marvel properly handle the material again ",2024-02-16

she called baby peter “tiger” ,2024-02-17
horrible,2024-02-18
well for anything i think dakota is still in a very safe place from what i remember she only acting because of her parents she came from a very very rich family,2024-02-18
celeste o’connors character is so aggressively awful in this it’s insane she’s a super wealthy “punk” which is already kind of ironic first time we see her she intentionally blocks an ambulance for no reason and then acts  about it when she has to keep a low profile she makes everyone go to a diner and then starts dancing on a table for some random teenagers she’s pretty rude to everyone the whole time then once dakota johnson is blinded everyone does this complete personality turnaround and they’re all wholesome besties,2024-02-18
comics tropes fella said it is worse than morbius ouch,2024-02-18
has anyone mentioned the cloverfield production style last half of the movie the worst lol,2024-02-19
"man i went into this expecting to hate it and i kinda didnt 

yes its got some big flaws but i found the villain to be the most annoyingly boring out of the whole cast i dont know if its a problem with sound mixing or what but every single line he delivers sounds like its just been overdubbed and plugged into the movie i actively started to watch for mismatches in how he was speaking 

the girls were fun to watch but i do wish theyd spent a little more time fleshing them out beyond we all have the same  family situation as every other spiderperson ever and some surface level personality traits 

but to all my friends who said i heard it was worse than morbius yeah it was not 

morbius is still the biggest stinker of a superhero movie ive had the misfortune of watching at least we didnt get any hamfisted forced love triangles here",2024-02-19
the only legacy this film will have is if it gets referenced or a cameo in beyond the spiderverse,2024-02-20

idk i didnt mind it  yeah there was some dodgy acting tbh they should have honestly swap emma and dakota in their roles and plot definitely needed work but i enjoyed it for what it was,2024-02-22
it was so hilariously bad that i enjoyed every minute of it i was expecting it to be bad,2024-02-22
i had a good time with this yeah the plots a bit janky and theres some contrivances but it was fun to watch,2024-02-23
some say she’s still opening that pepsi to this very day,2024-02-24
"holy  i just watched it and it’s not only the worst marvel movie of all time but one of the worst movies in general 

how did anyone green light this mess of a film worst plot worst acting worst directing worst editing and it goes on dakota should quit acting horrible just horrible",2024-02-25
i really wanna be in the room when the studio heads get the numbers and reviews about this the conversation would be absolutely hilarious,2024-02-26
the movie was set in 2003 and i guess the editors took that to heart maybe too literally everything feels like it was written edited and paced like a bad movie from 2003 it reminds me of the time my friend in high school was really nervous for a speech he had to do for english class so he got pretty  and went up in front of the whole class and it was 5 minutes of just him bombbbinggg hard and  up all his lines and it was the best speech in that class without a doubt and people loved it and laughed even the teacher was almost smiling because of how bad he was doing watching this movie felt like that it was just very fun bad entertainment,2024-03-15
her powers are like reloading a savegame during boss battles,2024-03-15
hopefully this continues dakota johnsons quest to be a guest spot on a sitcom she is a horrible actress with a bad attitude and full of excuses she can claim ignorance and throw everyone else under the bus for this terrible movie but she has been in abomination after abomination,2024-02-15
to the people who went to the cinema and paid money to go see this why,2024-02-15
"it’s bad but it’s charming bad

there’s basically three good things that i can say about this movie…

1 it didn’t make me actively angry when i was watching it like the very worst of the worst movies tend to do 

2 there’s a “so bad it’s good” quality to this movie that i can’t explain 

3 the scene where she drives out of the side of a building in a nyfd vehicle and hits the villain in midair was just so unexpected and out of nowhere that it got a big reaction out of me it was just so ridiculous that i felt like cheering hard 

there have been a bunch of bad movies released already this year and this joins the list this was like the opposite of iss for me in the sense that iss was like being in a sensory deprivation chamber for an hour and a half whereas madame web was more entertaining than iss despite being more poorly acted and written 

dakota johnson may have given the worst performance by a lead actress that i’ve seen in quite some time and the three spiderwomen  the main villain were all in a competition for worst supporting actor 

as bad as it is i’d take this type of bad over just plain boring and bland bad just my opinion tho",2024-02-16
"when i saw them do the scene with learning chest compressions im like no fking way did they just write this scene so they could get these ladies posing with theirnonoooohahah 

bah you mad lad writers just because you can do something doesnt mean you should but they pulled it off anyways",2024-02-17
i honestly think madame web is the worst superhero film i’ve ever seen in theaters it was that bad,2024-02-21
yall still want that batgirl movie lol,2024-02-15
"nothing else to do today so i went to the movies alone like the dumb  worthless pathetic  loser ive always been destined to be i should just bite a cyanide tablet and end this  nightmare once and for all how many more valentines days left before its over

anyway the movie was fine this is a hard one to defend because i actually like dakota johnson but her monotonous tone has become somewhat of a meme by now the trailers certainly didnt do them any favors i actually liked it up to a certain point but the entire third act was an absolute mess it seems like everything that happened after she went to peru was extremely abrupt and they gutted the entire last half of the movie you can clearly tell there was supposed to be a lot more there originally but it got focus grouped to death and stripped down to nothing

my biggest criticism is that its another origin movie setting up a better movie which is obviously never going to happen they would have been better off integrating those three spiderwomen from the future rather than leaving it as a potential openended sequel at the very least i liked this better than morbius although there are plenty of comparisons to be made between both the most positive thing i can say is that it was under 2 hours so it didnt outstay its welcome",2024-02-15
"went into this knowing itd be a bad time looking for laughs and im still mad
110",2024-02-16
one of the worst films i have ever seen the more i think about it the less makes sense,2024-02-16
i think they redubbed almost all of the bad guy’s dialogue it was so distracting what a mess,2024-02-17
my favorite part was when madame webb said its webbin time and webbed all over the place,2024-02-17
this movie is obviously bad i wont even spend any time on it but what i do want to add is how equally bad of an actress dakota johson is she is one of the worst current actresses but seems to always get a pass or benefit of the doubt its always poor dakota for being given terrible material but never a mention of how talented she is at making awful material 10 times worse with the most bland and lacklustre acting she delivers all of her lines in the strangest deadpan way and her behaviour on the press run to everyone comes off as funny and endearing whereas i just find it rude i cant imagine if she did not look the way she does that people would support her so much she is truly awful,2024-02-20
why did her version of cpr not have any mouthtomouth,2024-02-22
im tempted to see this movie just to roast it but i dont want to give them one dime i just want the sony spiderverse to die,2024-02-15

wow from these comments it sounds like this movie is going to be the last airbender of the sony spider verse lets just collectively forget that this happened,2024-02-15
"scandalous plays at one point in the movie and i thought we were being trolled



i feel like once sony saw the writing on the wall with morbius being trashed and no one wanting to be their spiderman they intentionally made this movie as horrible as possible to sell the movie on being so bad its good to get butts in seats


but they didnt tell dakota nor sweeny about it",2024-02-15

i don’t know how rotten tomatoes works i guess but of the very few positive reviews for this film one said “the only good thing that can be said is that it is not the worst film based on a marvel comic book it will take a mighty effort to dethrone morbius” and gave it a d but it was still counted as a fresh review,2024-02-16

ive been hearing a lot about how the main theme from this soundtrack of this movie sounds eerily similar to the theme from the spiderman ps4 game however i cant find any mention anywhere of something i noticed right away during the film the track on the soundtrack titled oneil or in some places neil dies sounds eerily familiar to the theme time by hans zimmer off of the inception soundtrack am i the only one that has noticed this,2024-02-21
"i watched the movie and did enjoy it but im unhappy that they added yet a 4th peter parker lineage unless this turns out to take place in early in the marc webb universe the fact that the movie takes place in 2003 raises questions on how they will handle the actresses reprising the roles the best thing is they get pulled into another universe or they all acquire delayed aging which ezekiel appeared to have 

the women suits looked great but i was disappointed we didnt get good shots of them or their powers heres hoping marvel can fix the mistakes theyve been making with deadpool 3 all movies should exist within the multiverse but everyone doesnt have to meet and the movies shouldnt cater to children",2024-02-21

im putting this in the so bad its good genre lot of stuff to laugh at and i can honestly say the movie was entertaining throughout a couple of scenes were so ludicrously bad that i was crying from laughing this usually involved the villain and his horrendous dubbedover dialogue that isnt even close to matching his lips,2024-02-24

seriously best part about this movie was laughing at so many parts and realizing everyone else in the theater was doing the same ",2024-02-25
"the more i think about this movie the dumber it gets

shes on the run from the police for kidnapping three teenage girls but then takes a plane to peru 

dakota johnsons mom gives birth to her in the amazon but theres no explanation of how she got back to america were meant to assume everything was fine

ben parker being able to look after the three kidnapped girls being completely okay with having to take care of them and not being spotted by the police at all or anyone",2024-02-25
"i couldn’t finish this i was hoping the bad reviews were overblown but they definitely weren’t holy 

the worst part for me was the horrible dialogue and the way it spells out absolutely everything

when the villain is creeping towards them for the first time cassie literally points at him and says “that man is trying to  you” before running away 

yeah no  sherlock

i don’t like when movies get bashed knowing how much time and effort goes into creating them but this was so dull and strange",2024-02-25

its not to say it was a good movie it washilarious when it wasnt supposed to be

"i went expecting to watch a bad movie
maybe because of this i didnt hate it it has many flaws but i still enjoyed many parts i think there is a decent movie buried below the rubble of bad cgi and forced dialogue mostly for the villain maybe the worse part of the movie for me

laughed at the baby shower and mostly liked the dynamic between cassandra and ben liked the idea of a serial killer spiderman and the bits of horror movie in the scene in the subway deserved more

i watched blue beetle and shazam a few months before that set the bar really low for me madame web cant be the worst of the year",2024-03-01
i too found it confusing that madame webb was wheelchairbound at the end of the film but then remembered a doctor diagnosed her with myasthenia gravis this answer only raises more questions as i believe myasthenia cannot be diagnosed in utero,2024-03-03
"madame web was awful just like everyone in the world knew it would beexcept for maybe the clueless executives at sony responsible for its existence but it wasnt quite as bad as i was expecting it to be because all of the actors involved clearly know that its schlock and dont care about being in it and give zero energy in their performances which makes the movie unintentionally funny

like dakota johnson just doesnt give a  about this movie one bit and its hysterical to watch her sleepwalk through her role as cassandra webb giving the least amount of conviction in her lines as possible you cant even call it phoning it in because she isnt even trying 

if you need further evidence of her comical amount of contempt she clearly has for this watch the press junket interviews shes in where dakota is giving silly nonsense answers to everything in one interview she cant be bothered to remember the three tom holland spiderman movies so she calls them spiderman here he comes spiderman and hes back and the goblet of spiderman lol 

allegedly dakota wasnt even aware at first that this wasnt an mcu movie and she later fired her management team after the first trailer for this dropped i dont blame her 

bonus points because dakota helped end the career of ellen degeneres i think im starting to like her 

but also sydney sweeney clearly doesnt give a  either and neither do the other two actressesthough i like the piece of trivia that sweeney bought her costars tamagotchis to fit in with the movies initial 1990s setting which was a nice gesture and a nice touch 

the level of apathy is quite astounding actually and it does make watching madame web perversely entertaining to watch in an mst3k sort  of way it never quite becomes a legitimately good time like the venom movies which are also both schlock but are held together by the conviction of tom hardys manic madness and his  coded relationship with the symbiote however i didnt feel like my time was wasted because at the end of the day its just a bit of comic book silliness and i actually am invested in seeing just how far sony is willing to go with their spiderman without spiderman universe until they reach rock bottom",2024-03-05
was it good  no not technically  was it super entertaining throughout   absolutely  i think it’s worth seeing this movie for anyone  i was entertained on like an 8510 level  never bored,2024-03-08
i feel like the movie was edited around the horrible acting of the villain seems like even his movements as a villain was bad one scene cut before they could show him jumping like dude couldn’t even jump well enough to make the cut lol,2024-03-16
wow i’m not even done and this movie sucks and i love superhero movies,2024-03-17
every one of you that paid to see this are suckers,2024-03-17
"the reason this movie is so bad is because of unfinished plot threads this basically made the entire movie feel like a 2 hour teaser trailer for the sequel that will obviously never happen

 who is cassies father we learn it is not ezekiel ok who is it
 what was that  ezekiel said in the beginning for why he needed the spider his motive was completely forgotten by the movie
 how did ezekiel get insanely rich again what is he trying to do except stop the girls from killing him and stopping whatever it is hes trying to do
 they acknowledge the 3 girls all coincidentally had contact with cassie before she saved them but they never explain why
 how do the girls get their powers the whole movie were waiting for them to get bit by the spider and it never happens same thing with fetal peter parker

the other far worse crime this movie makes is its audacity to cheapen and retcon the known established lore of spiderman this isnt like spiderverse this movie is positioning itself as a new definitive origin story of peter parker so instead of spiderman being someone with unique powers thanks being bitten by a radioactive spider before he was born theres all these other people who also have them including some tribe of magic latinos and even a dude who not only has spiderman powers but has basically the same costume and all it takes is getting bit by some special nonradioactive spider",2024-03-18

"there is a good concept in here 3 girls getting murdered over and over again and madam web is trying to prevent them it’s final destination but a superhero but holy  the execution is bad they should have started with introducing them all no flashback  give some mystery then reveal all the connections in the end 

you know the story and all the characters from the first 5 mins what is keeping you the other 1hr 55",2024-03-24

"i guess ill go against the grain i liked the movie well enough took my 9yo son and 12yo daughter and they liked it too

granted i dont watch that many superhero movies and wasnt even sure if she was an actual superhero in the past or just something new

parts were a little odd but overall i liked it found some of the lines witharound the teenagers funny  liked how the paramedic partner was actually a good guy

dont know why the 3 teenagers didnt stay behind and he just took the sister in law to the hospital leaving for peru and getting back in time seemed awfully convenient too and racing around the logging truck and still making it in time",2024-02-16
"i had a lot of fun with this i like a movie that tries something different even if its messy

they do some incredible stuff the visions such as the balloon popping scene and the pigeon scene and the early emt stuff is good and kind of intense dakota is magnetic throughout and she has good chemistry with the girls and adam scott is good 

my one major knock is the horrible last 10 minutes where they throw out everything interesting about the movie in the name of faithfulness to comics 

i mean holy  youre going to take away dakota johnsons eyes are you  crazy",2024-02-17
so they did cpr incorrectly didn’t they like especially at the end i was taught 282 where you do 28 compressions then 2 breaths not just non stop compressions they never really checked her airway or anything did they change up the recommendations for cpr it’s been like at least 10 years since i took a first aid class,2024-02-18
this movie was basically if hallmark channel made a spiderman movie,2024-02-20
ive seen worse it wasnt awful just insanely boring mightve been decent if it was anyone other than dakota johnson woof talk about negative charisma also there wasnt a single laugh the entire movie in my theater and that was incredible to me because the movie certainly tried to crack some jokes,2024-02-15

"i didnt think this was terrible definitely not the worst movie ive ever seen and it was actually better than morbius i blame the trailer i actually was looking forward to watching a train wreck so im extremely surprised


there were some truly awful lines though and having so many people with spider powers is  because it makes spiderman less special and unique


those costumes at the end made me laugh they were so bad 


and uncle ben really that was a lame tie in


still not the worst ive ever seen enjoyed it even",2024-02-21

"ive seen both troll 2 and the room this was the worst movie ive ever seen like it is worse than the movies ive seen that were intentionally bad i seriously can not understand how this movie ended up so terrible every decision that went in to this film other than the casting of adam scott as youngcle ben was the worst decision that could be made 

also she drives a stolen cab for an entire week through queens without any trouble also 4 total lives were saved the whole movie and one was a bird

i knew going in it was gonna be bad but let me just say im actually glad i saw it it was like a wonderful car wreck in some ways i looked at my phone to check the time way less than i did for aquaman 2 which im sure the nobody else in my theater appreciated",2024-02-15

even movie critics who try as hard as they can to find good things to say about any movie are saying this is awful,2024-02-15
its baffling to me that they gave these writers another shot after the disaster that was morbius i can think of literally no reason as to why these two writers should ever get their hands on a movie script again its not like they were hoping for a return to form from a previous work because a quick imdb search shows that they have created nothing but big budget disasters they must have dirt on some sony exec or something because this is ridiculous,2024-02-15

"hello it brings me no joy to tell you all i went to see madame web so heres a 

movie review

nbsp

its called madame web because when you take all the plot holes out of the plot its no longer a bunch of paper but just a web of tiny spidery threads that dont make any sense get it

nbsp

madame web is a collection of images played back quite fast overlayed with noises a large amount of these images are ads for pepsi tm we start out with a 10 minute sequence telling us that spiders give powers and this guy is a bad guy then we roll into an hour of an incredibly unlikeable bland boring main character painfully slowly realising she can see the future sometimes because spider

nbsp

our pepsi tm ad is intermixed with a bunch of misunderstandings this movie explictly does not understand a whole bunch of concepts that are honestly not that hard to understand this includes but is not limited to

 teenagers
 cops
 people
 fireworks
 cpr
 cameras
 the tsa post 911
 taxis
 newspapers

nbsp

some  happens the villain shows up and oh boy is he angry it doesnt help that hes played by someone who desperately does not understand what acting means our mc and three teenagers with different skincolours and different personalities tm are now fugitives from the law for some  reasons because writing is hard this is when we meet our second main character plot taxi tm its a wondrous taxi that when the numberplates get removed renders any and all consequences of earlier actions null and void because writing continues to be hard our wanted main character takes the plot taxi tm to the notoriously lowoncopsandcameras airport and flies the  out to peru there she discovers her true powers and the movie insults us all by saying when you take the responsibility you will have great power and i nearly passed out from rolling my eyes so hard 

nbsp

some more  happens and we go to the final confrontation with our deus ex machina 1 fireworks that somehow range from nah mate it doesnt do  to blows up a wall andor helicopter the villain decides this isnt embarrassing enough though so he proceeds to get killed by deus ex machina 2 a giant pepsi tm ad im not making this up

nbsp

even more  happens our mc gets blinded and is now wheelchairbound somehow any semblance of personality she had is now gone and she turns into literally bran from game of thrones season 8 tm  weirdest crossover ever but sure why not we then get some  montage of the three teenagers with different skincolours and different personalities tm doing spiderthings in the spiderfuture what our mc didnt see coming is that that  is never going to happen because nobody could give any  about this  rotting afterbirth of a pepsi tm ad 

nbsp

110 avoid at all costs",2024-02-16
movie felt like a ducking fan film  but worse the ending scene was so bad it made me geek out the future scene she sees of them fighting in the future or any scene shes sees in general for that matter with them having powers is so badly shot and so badly made you couldn’t even tell what tf was going on because everything was so zoomed in and the faces they were making were priceless idk how any of them got casted for this movie let alone this movie even actually being made it was an absolute joke  you could just tell the actors in the movie gave no  about actually acting and just went along with this  that ending shot was so badly made  like i legit felt like i was looking at a photo of some girls trying there hardest to look like these characters from the comics but are no were close to representing them  them    looking glasses had me geeking theres no way she wasnt laughing at her self in wardrobe bc man oh man were those costumes  horrible i gotta stop theres so much wrong on this movie and it was just so badly made pls save your mny if yah gonna watch it at least go on bflix 123mvs movie4k or just dont watch it at all bc its a waist of money lol glad i didnt go to the movie theaters to see this  i would’ve absolutely asked for a refund ,2024-02-16

did she ever relay this information to the girls

"this movie is truly baffling and pretty hilarious i think theres enough so bad its good moments to warrant a watch if you are into bad movies some random thoughts about the film 

the opening scene in peru was so off the conversation between cassies mom and ezekiel was awkward and terrible and so expositional then we continue to follow ezekiel instead of the mom anyone feel like it wouldve been better to see the mom actually find the spider instead of just marching into camp comically yelling i found the spider when we see ezekiel taking photos of the notes we realize hes evil and theres no surprise when he kills everyone except the person actually holding the spider for some reason 

ezekiel in general was just so terrible and funny he legit sounds like tommy wiseau and all of his lines are horribly dubbed over they dont match his mouth at all and a lot of shots simply just dont show his face what the heck happened there we also dont learn anything at all about this character like why did he want the spider what did he do with it he is obviously rich or something but like what does he do all day also did the spider give him antiaging powers 

i love how accurate ezekiel was able to recreate the teens faces like did he hire a sketch artist hahaha 

what exactly about cassies near death experience unlocked her future telling powers its never really explained 

also was ezekiel barefoot 

also the scene of ezekiel dumping exposition to his hook up was hilarious and so awkward did that lady bring her nsa work badge to  evil spider man 

the uncle benpeter parker baby shower stuff is so weird and shoe horned in like did they think that people would be hype for that 

i feel like i missed something why did cassie get on that train and why did the non sydney sweeney teens get on the train 

the plotting after the train sequence is just insane cassie is accused of kidnapping the teens for some reason then drives them to the woods  and abandons them for 3 hours she then drives back to the city and reads out loud to a cat her moms notes about spider people in peru like she has clearly read through some of her moms books before but was she aware of the spider people angle to her research meanwhile in the woods the girls have gotten hangry and decide to go to a local diner and leave a fire burning in the forest did they really need to light a fire at the diner they are spotted by a local trucker who recognizes them as the kidnapping victims from the paper but like didnt this kidnapping happen a few hours ago how is it in the paper anyways this leads to ezekiel driving to the diner to  them 

cassie returns to the pitch black woods to find the girls gone she walks to the diner sees the girls dancing on a table for some reason and they are then all murdered by ezekiel but sike it was a vision cassie had in the woods cassie then hops in the cab that she stole and drives to the diner which somehow takes way longer than wandering aimlessly through the dark wilderness they end up escaping and go to a motel 

cassie then goes back to the diner and has a trippy exposition dump with ezekiel it is a dream or vision or something i dont really know she then teaches the girl cpr did the producer have a cpr fetish before going off to peru to do further spider investigating 

in peru she begins back packing alone through the rain forrest and pretty easily finds the spot her mother died there she meets the spider person who birthed her in a cave pool i guess he was just waiting for her on the off chance she came idk why hes wearing regular clothes now but he is he serves as a mentor to cassie and pushes her into a pool to have a vision in the vision cassie learns her mother actually didnt hate her idk why she thought this but was actually trying to save cassie from myasthenia gravis i am in the medical field and i have never heard of an infant being diagnosed with this prenatally 

peter parkers moms water breaks and uncle ben and the girls all hop in the car to the hospital uncle ben seems a bit flustered by the situation despite being an experienced emt its not exactly clear why the girls have to come along to the hospital but they do and are instantly spotted by ezekiels surveillance system which is straight out of the dark knight 

we then have our climax at a fireworks warehouse that has a pepsi logo on the roof cassie uses her future powers to tell the girls when to duck and ezekiel is defeated by the pepsi sign anyone else craving a pepsi 

cassie is blinded and paralyzed at the end of the film is this from her powers or from almost drowning anyways her glasses and wheel chair are absolutely hilarious 

im also confused how all three of these teenagers are going to obtain spider girl powers are they going to intentionally get bitten by the spider cuz like how could all three of these friends accidentally get spider powers",2024-02-16
"this movie confirmed i have bad taste in movies because i actually liked it

yes it has cringe dialogue yes the acting from johnson and sweeney was bad yes the plot really was stretched too long in what really should’ve been the first act of an actual movie 

at the least it was better than morbius to me madame web actually has an ending morbius just ends with no wrap up at all",2024-02-16
"an absolute disaster beginning to end so baffling throughout nothing about this movie worked 210 would recommend about to watch it for a second time in the same day

all the women were hot adam scott still looks great 

its funny sydney is now more famous than dakota",2024-02-20
is it bad that i kinda liked the movie i was told it was worse than the marvels but to be fully honest as someone who isnt online often and doesnt go to the cinema much i liked the movie some scenes were super cringe but easily overlooked the villain  but the rest of the movie was enjoyable enough for me to forget the guy even existed honestly judging by the rest of these comments im going to get hated on,2024-02-20
guys this is the first movie i have ever seen where i left halfway through,2024-02-20
"very subpar for a marvel superhero movie and pretty much exactly whats been said by most of the critics though i disagree on it being worse than morbius but somewhat in its league for sure  mishandled and undercooked and only worthy of interest due to the choice of casting however its a pretty endearing trainwreck in being a capsule of a bygone era what with the explicit 00s superhero vibe of catwoman meets final destination and the terminator and much of the leading cast led by the oddly charming  dakota johnson and her young stooges isabela merced sydney sweeney and celeste o connor are so much more bearable than jared leto letoing his way through morbius not to mention the geely adam scott as young uncle ben 

honestly i always thought johnson to be very dull and kind of devoid of charisma in every work shes in but shes actually pretty cool here and reliable in the role of a awkward reluctant mother type even when her line delivery can come off as rough and stilted  albeit the extremely crappy dialogue are mostly to blame for it her costard dont fare any better but only one for the worse where the trio of sweeney merced and connor couldve been great under a better script but as it stands sweeney is simply a distractingly hot nerd merced a blank latina teen canvas and connor a feisty rebellious teen 

in terms of the concept and premise i really like the more grounded horrorthriller based catandmouse approach where the girls are barely trying to survive in the onslaught of ezekiel sims whos basically an evil spiderman in this that i wished the film would concentrate more on the horrorthriller thing sims first appearance in suit with him crawling atop a subway station is unexpectedly creepy than the mystical superheroic shenanigans the finale ends up being however the script is just bad bad bad on all levels and failing to meet the minimum requirements of the plot and overall narrative characters arent properly introduced and established ties to spiderman are muddled when taking into account the reworked origin of web and the spiderwomen and ben and mays inclusion to the story leading to a confused lore bad guy sims bearing little characterization and poses lots of questions that arent answered at the end and all the teases for future films which we will never get 

for whats worth its some interesting ideas like madame webb starting out as an awkward paramedic her bff relationship with uncle ben the future trio of spiderwomen establishing their own maternal bond with webb mystical peruvian spidermen while others are pretty overtly bad such as sims overall character being reduced into being a evil businessman with spidey powers and the fact that the teased spiderwomen dont actually become spiderwomen by the end likewise none of these ideas are written and presented to their most appropriate potential not even anywhere near close into contributing a workable narrative the writers have not a clue besides straying away from the source material and doing nothing with it how to handle any and every character nor the main event that transpire and relegate everything to a surface level story that makes little sense the more you think about it 

the dialogue is entirely abysmal probably one of the worst in a superhero movie ever and provides neither actor with anything to work with along with the 90 of horrendous adr by tahar rahim as sims contributing to the plastic feel of whats supposed to be a cool supervillain 

in regard to the direction by sj clarkson who brings forward little bits of neat visual flourishes throughout with the dynamic camera movements but her inexperience in directing her first feature film really stands out the majority of the time insufficiently and abruptly structured poorly edited bland and unexciting action madeforstreaming visual outlook etc its hilarious how identical all of the films of the sony spiderman venom universe is that the underwhelming handling is becoming a sort of a template nowadays lets be honest kraven will be more of the same as well truthfully despite all of its negatives the movie itself being set in 2003 and actually feel like an early 00s stylized superhero movie in the vein of daredevil electra and catwoman and as a nostalgic fan of said films i find madame web to be just as dumb and entertaining enough to not be overly boring or offputting like morbius",2024-02-15
"ive been among those that made fun of everything going on during the last few months regarding this movie and was absolutely convinced that it would end up as the kind of bad that is by the numbers generic uninspired soul and heartless when the reviews came out my impression shifted to unintentionally hilarious trash that fell short in the ambition of becoming at least a somewhat tolerable superhero flick in an exceptionally long line of marvelsonydc garbage i decided to watch it for a laugh and  im gonna get downvoted a ton  found it incredibly charming in its goofyness appreciated its suspensethrillerangle seriously thought that those responsible for the movie at least put some heart into it and tried to do something to distinguish themselves from the canon dakota johnson and sydney sweeney were lovely in it while all of the girls character evolutions and their relationships with each other were nicely uplifting

this is not to say that madame web is a good movie  it is bad but bad in the right ways as clichéd as that sounds its gonna gain a cult following and become for the superherogenre what i know who killed me became for psychothrillers

edit what i also appreciated was that they went with a female cast but did not make the mistake of going that  route that led to the strangulation of so many other projects of the last years",2024-02-16
"dakota johnson felt pretty proud for not knowing anything about the previous spiderman movies like that was beneath her and now it appears she fired her agent for getting her into this movie serves her right i guess

these nepobabies cant be bothered to put in the littlest bit of effort in their work",2024-02-15
"personally i enjoyed the movie i get theres a lot of hate on it because of lacking villain reasoning but truly i think originally the man just wanted power to build wealth the moment he stole it he saw his death every night and was then just focused on stopping it thats all there is no big plot or anything just a small villain who couldnt leave anything alone 

as for the somewhat emotionless madame web i mean as far as i know for comics thats how she is shes not this big web swinging hero shes the one who sets up the future for others she is blunt and straightforward and i actually like that about her character im glad this wasnt just another web swinging movie",2024-02-17
"just got back from seeing this and honestly it wasnt as bad as the internet has made out to be dont get me wrong  it isnt great and its nowhere near as slick as the disney mcu movies but there were some interesting ideas in this film

first of all its not really a superhero movie its more of a slow burn psychological thriller the sequence on the train at grand central terminal was actually pretty gripping and wellexecuted

dakota johnson does a good job with the material shes given especially in the scenes where shes on her own and reacting to gaining her superpowers

the early 2000s vibe is captured pretty well and it even feels like it was made in that era the atmosphere is much more unbreakable than avengers if m night shyamalan had directed a spiderman film in the mid aughts it might have looked a little bit like this

now on to the negatives  both the peruvian sequences were leaden with cliché dialogue and plot holes how did she leave the country and get back in again as the chief suspect in a kidnapping i rolled my eyes so hard at the scene where cassie met her mother

the villain was forgettable and poorly acted his lines were so obviously dubbed it made me wonder if they were originally meant to be spoken in spanish his character is peruvian and the producers changed their minds at the last minute

sydney sweeney was surprisingly not good casting her as a shy selfconscious teenager was a mistake it just wasnt convincing her outfit too  it just didnt fit with the character they were trying to portray the other two actors playing the teen characters were okay ive never seen sweeney in anything else and im sure shes a decent actress but this role just didnt fit",2024-02-18
"its certainly not going to win any awards but it wasnt that bad

youd think it kicked peoples dogs by the way theyre offended by how bad it is

the villain tho  oof i dont think his lip movement matched like any of this words

but is there any explanation at all as to the psychic dream thing ignoring that its the villain monologuing his entire plan or whatever but neither the villain or lady web were shown to have any psychic powers or anything",2024-02-18
it wasnt that bad compared to what the internet made it sound like i feel like the marvels was honestly worse i really wish there was more screen time of the spidergirls in their suits,2024-02-18
havent seen the movie yet but is it explained why emma roberts is supposedly peter parkers mom yet adam scott is playing uncle ben like  is it implied ben got with richard his brothers wife or how the  is ben peters uncle or is he the brother to emma roberts mary,2024-02-15

"i mean no one needs to be defending this movie and this is going to be very small praise but i understood what was happening in it and the pacing was solid and the motivations all made sense in that regard i dont know where all this worst superhero movie ever stuff is coming from  can anyone look me in the eye and say this was worse than quantumania 

im not saying this is a good movie or a decent movie or that it doesnt have the most hilariously bad acting or dialogue ive ever seen im just saying  its more watchable than quantumania or the marvels or especially morbius",2024-02-20
i guess im crazy because i enjoyed it unironically in spite of its many problems yes there is some bad acting there is some clunky writing there is some very bizarre cinematography there are plot holes and things that dont quite make sense and the final battle is a complete mess and still i liked it genuinely and am very sad that a sequel is never going to happen now,2024-02-22
just like my neighbor and landlord  the critics and the general public learn how to enjoy things not every comic movie can be endgame learn how to enjoy things the way they are presented,2024-02-21

why are you guys so surprised it’s not the first rotten sony superhero hero movie ,2024-02-15
why do so many people go see these obviously bad movies ,2024-02-15
"this movie was even worse than the critics made it seem and its so cringy i mean the best part is that dakota johnson is visibly doing this for a paycheck and she looks miserable saying the godawful lines in the script at one point she rolls her eyes at how bad the dialogue is 

also what the  is going on some mass murderer is looking for dakota and my girls and she has time to go to south america for a week and how did zosia mamet get herself in this she looks like mary lynn rajskub 

its campy but also dull a two hour movie with barely no action dakota johnson is funny with her deadpan monotone delivery and sydney sweeney isabela merced and celeste o connor try their best to be convincing as the vapid unlikable victims with their cw teen lore dialogue 

tahar rahim is so bad in this movie that i even wondered if they used tahar rahims identical twin brother who cant act",2024-02-15

went  and still had no fun,2024-02-16
the voice for the villain was adr’d throughout the whole movie the plot was horrible and the camera kept moving in such an awful way at the beginning with the zooming in and out the main character was always in deep thought which was very boringi watched it for my sisters birthday but she just got up after the first scene and left i hope her birthday party goes well on saturday to celebrate with her friends… my mother somehow enjoyed it does this movie remind anyone about the incredible hulk movie in like the early 2000’s with the weird comic  movements or is it just me,2024-02-16
i have a lot of superhero tshirts and im a nerd so when i go and see a superhero movie i usually wear the tshirt of the  the movie i didnt have a madame web tshirt so i didnt bother this time and just wore a pepsi tshirt instead so the fate of the villain made me laugh quite a lot,2024-02-18
"comically bad but i expected that and i think because of that i enjoyed it

was more enjoyable to me than zone of interest and thats up for best picture 

not saying its better but definitely more enjoyable",2024-02-18
just got back from seeing it and i can not for the life of me remember the scene of madame web talking about mary parker dying and ben having to raise the baby when did this happen,2024-02-19
somebody please explain to me how claire parker a person who died 43 years ago is a writer for this movie,2024-02-19
"this one was rough to get through my eyelids were actually getting heavier and heavier as the movie progressed none of the main cast had any chemistry with each other at all performances were lackluster especially dakota johnson but dont really blame her and these three other girls that she is protecting did not buy that they were teenagers at allik their age irl but its still painfully obvious they are adults in this movie

these three kids dont even do anything even close to superherolike for the whole movie excluding like 30 seconds of them fighting crime in their suits in visions of the future thats it they are just teens in danger for the entire movie no character development that properly leads to becoming these badass spider girls the villain was also very boring his entire character is he is trying to  these girls before they become superheros and  him thats it thats his entire character plus his postproduction dubbing or whatever its called sucks

this movie is just friggin boring the action in this is not even action just repetitive sequences of madame web seeing the future like in thats so raven and immediately yells to a character to watch out and thats all it is aside from when web hits the boring evil spider dude with an ambulance to save the teens and ben parker the only time theres anything really actiony is in the climax battle but i still didnt care and how web goes blindits basically just ouch and she has no other reaction to it she just lost her eyesight forever andhas no realistic reaction to it 

my only real positive i can give here is adam scott is pretty solid in this movie gives a far better and more charismatic performance than this movie clearly deserves",2024-02-20
what was the reason for the movie being set in 2003 is there something its trying to set up for the present day,2024-02-20
"i just saw the movie

the absolute best thing about it was the diner scene when the guy with the poison powers showed up and they were playing toxic by britney spears get it toxic because hes a spider and he has poison powers and the song is called toxic hes a spider the song is toxic do you understand the reference

i honestly lost it when i noticed that this is like shrek 3 levels of hilarious quick we need a song for the kings death scene  lets use live and let die by guns n roses because it has die in it  perfect next scene in hindsight im honestly amazed they had the restraint to not go all out with alice coopers poison

this movie was gold easily 1110",2024-02-26

"i’m still confused why the villain never went out and bought some guns  

 dude you’re significantly more athletic and faster in speed and reflexes than all four of them just jump in and shoot them   

also why were they in the car at all to drive ben’s sister to the hospital leave them at your house jesus did ben forget he was a paramedic and that babies don’t instantly pop out when water breaks ",2024-03-16

"the end is a bit depressive ending blind and in wheelchairs combining both professor x and daredevil well to be honest i am not familiar with the source material but i wouldnt mind changing that 

even her monologue at the end did have that gravitas of for example patrick stewart or other trained shakespearean actors",2024-03-16
ive been watching it since it just came out on digital and ive basically been skipping the prologue and all the antagonist of the movie stuff and solely focusing on cassies story watching the movie like that isnt all bad i kind of like how they do the editing of her premonition powers but it sure does feel like a sony movie although its nice to see a period piece 2003 in new york i keep looking for things where they messed up but the production designer did a good job they even have old maxim and vogue covers in there and the right car brands and sizes,2024-03-16
her super power is vehicular manslaughter,2024-03-18
"i saw a thread titled “i need to talk about madame web” and honestly same lmaooooo

let’s see

 the train escape scene
man’s is obviously way more powerful than anyone there and has ample time to execute all of them right there but decided to off the cops for no reason and allows them enough time to escape 

 the diner premonition
let’s just leave that fire in the woods unattended… the teens including madame can walk to the diner in no time but when she snaps back to the taxi it feels like she’s driving for miles before reaching the diner also right at the end of that racing to get there she overtakes a truck just to swerve right in front it like you couldn’t just wait 1 second for the truck to pass

 the taxi and the flight 
everyone’s on the lookout but no1 is picking up that taxi not sus at all with that damage plus not reported stolen and let me also just casually jump on a flight to another country and return without being detained

 the pepsi building
the state is dire and  is falling apart everywhere madame is swung into the lake by the falling signage and the rescue chopper just crashed seconds later 1 of the teens are diving her out and all three of them are on the floor safe and untouched with no signs of helpassistance from anyone also the villain just casually chilling there whilst she has her ultimate saviour moment and waited for her to save all 3 of them before kicking her out it

 the teens
they… don’t have powers yet they’re battle ready with skills and accuracy and 

 at least this movie educated me on what adr is thought i was tweaking but it honestly felt like those dubbed soapies whenever he was on screen i couldn’t shake the feeling

"just finished watching it for free on streaming  there was no way in  i was going to pay to see it

  
overall the acting cgi and costumes were all terrible the customes in particular looking worse than what you would even see workers wear at disneyland not to mention theres barely any action in this supposed action film

  
honestly this was worse than morbius which was actually just dumb campy fun and the actors there were actually giving some semblance of effort whilst this film was just unintentionally hilariouswhen you take on the responsibility great power will come 

  
madame web 2024 overall rating 110 worst film this year hands down hopefully dakota johnsons career dies off after this huge flop",2024-03-25
"its been couple of hours since i watched this film and im still cant forget it and stop regretting wasted 1 hour 57 minutes and 49 seconds of my life like i really havent done anything more  in my life than watching this astonomically awful and  movie whole movie was so wrong on so many levels that i almost fell asleep i think that whole idea of the movie was to promote feminism and that girls also can play superhero roles but it still didnt do the job filmmakers wanted it to do like i really dont know how to express this level of disgust with english worlds this movie is lowest rated superhero movie for me pacing was so mixed and poorly done that i thought i was watching the movie sped up everything happend so fast that nothing was clear and yet it was so  that everything was clear some moments were so bad that my eyes were closed and i was just listening to cringe dialoges about things that were obvious so obvious that even my 4 year old cousin would get it but they still overexplained everything they could

"dakota johnson became gary oldman in hannibal at the end that image and mental comparison was almost the highlight for me

where do i begin the general idea and premise for the movie but the execution and unfolding story is utter  insanity the direction is all over the place the acting is mediocre tahar rahims dialogue as ezekiel sims is so blatantly adrddubbed in even when hes on  screen that you now have something to a drinking game for the movie also addable is whenever dakota johnson has a final destination premonition that she then prevents  it add whenever we see ezekiel sims in the definitely not miles morales suit the action scenes are minimal and mostly final destinationed but the third act takes the idiocy to almost brain cell killing levels of stupidity copying over from a different comment i wrote on it

the climax is at a fireworks storage by the harbor that has a giant pepsi cola sign on top of it earlier in the movie dakota johnson is called in there due to a fire dakota johnson grabs a bag of flares from an ambulance she stole they literally do that one scene from furious 7 here has the girls place them around yadda yadda yadda fireworks go up to the roof where a chopper she called in is circling around and while the fireworks going in all directions she takes a piece of roof steel and uses it as a shield like shes  captain america one firework she deflects hits the chopper and it goes down theres a big ole confrontation between her and ezekiel surrounding the girls while on the pepsi cola sign and with all the  happening it results in him falling down and getting crushed by an s dakota johnson falling down into the river right after with the other s following her down and shes then hit by a firework blinding her the other girls rescue her by doing cpr because she taught them that at a motel and she recovers in a hospital

then its some time after and shes now gary oldman in hannibal shes now using her clairvoyance to lead the girls as a superhero squad akin to the ending with gwen in across the spiderverse and birds of prey we see their suits yes dakota johnson is in that red leather catsuit but shes wearing those  glasses and its only for 20 seconds so we got  robbed and cut to credits

im not making any of this  up this is legitimately what happens in the movie

this movie robbed us of two things hearing that glorious and infamous trailer line in the movie and seeing more of dakota johnson in that red leather catsuit yum yum and the promo shots of the other girls suited up is literally all there is of that in the movie weve been tricked weve been backstabbed and weve been bamboozled

they also have some just bizarre ideas an plot devices like adam scott being coworker ben parker with a pregnant sister mary her water leaking early while theyre watching over the girls  now targeted by sims who has access to nsa surveilance after tracking down an nsa worker at an opera is used as a plot device culminating in dakota johnson doing that scene from furious 7 like i mentioned earlier

wrappin up since i use dice metric to score and rate because we vikings are weirdos this is a 26 for me there were some ok concepts and ideas and some of the wacky  got a laugh but other than that this was a  travesty",2024-02-15

"as much as the hate this movie is getting this is a literal origin story for three different marvel characters can’t we at least acknowledge that they’re planning on a bigger story than this movie they did right to the madam web character i teared up at the end because cassie gave herself to bring these girls together and she was able to give us a glimpse of what is to come am i upset i didn’t see them in action absolutely but when the next movies come out you bet i’m gonna be there watching every single one

the audience for certain types of films like action scifi fantasy warrelated sports is typically male and further slanted towards younger males  why does hollywood insist on making films within these genres that everyone knows will not appeal to that demographic  they churn them out  and when they predictably bomb they blame it on misogyny or racism instead of the obvious answer  youre not giving your customers what they want,2024-02-18

"madame web was such a background character that i figured that only the die hard fans of spiderman would know her

and after this movie that is where she belongs in the background

i know my siblings love spiderman and sometimes she would role play as madam web and even she wonders how the  that madam web got a movie the chair guy never gets a movie and that is what basically madam web is 

how would someone successfully craft a superhero origin movie where the mc is a precog and cant jump punch or act this movie answers that question they cant

i suppose dakota johnson is a fine actor when portraying an everyday firefighter but when she tries to act more than that probably that is way out of her depth maybe the moviemakers pitched this movie to the wrong dakota

the way the editing was done was interesting like this is how you should not edit a movie or write a movie i suppose

the facts in the movie was wrong first thing in a cardiac arrest please please please for the love of  call for help first and not just start cpr

i know that is controversial and there is a huge circle  around this but the reality is without any help out in the field cpr is not a magic spell that can revive the dead the success of cpr out in the field is way of below than what you might think it is around 1530 success if i am being generous

secondly lets differentiate between poison and venom 

if you eat it and you die it is poisonous 

if it bites you and you die it is venomous 

most spiders are venomous although there might be some that are poisonous i dont know 

but what depicted int the movie is called a venom 

it is like the movie when out of their way to avoid saying the word venom i dont know why 

and cpr is not another magic spell for a venom you need the appropriate antivenom 

sometimes a movie can be saved by the antagonist or supporting actors

but that didnt happen here

it is apparent that the moviemakers are pandering for the children

his vision vividly showed characters in the movie will  him

that is enough motivation for any villain to  someone

but the movie tried to say it was more than that and they didnt even try to elaborate what did he build he just stole a spider and he didnt even sell the spider to the highest bidder how did he become a dark goth spiderman after stealing a spider 

i know some slated his dialogue but he is a middle eastern actor acting as a guy from south american lets be honest his english is better that the average american 

lets be honest sydney sweeney is an attraction we read the news report but she was underwhelming here it was classical bait and switch

if she dons her costume there is no doubt in my mind i will be watching the next movie

the parker family side story is pretty much a distraction but seeing that adam scott drank the same elixir as keanu reeves and paul rudd we know he can be the next ben parker and die as ben parker

i cant wait to see another ben parker dying

this movie is a solid 7 to hard core fans although i can see a lot of people downvoting this movie

lets call this movie what it is 

this movie isnt a symptom of superhero movie fatigue for the audiences rather a symptom of superhero movie fatigue by the writers and movie makers or a cynical cash grab by the greedy studio executive",2024-02-15
why did so many people pay to see this theyre just going to keep making this trash lol,2024-02-15
i honestly expected at least a 27 rt score all of these comments are making me want to see this movie more not less im only going out to see this if it gets a mighty morbin rerelease,2024-02-15
i liked the part when she said “it’s webbin time”,2024-02-15
do you all still think madame web is that bad,2024-02-17
is this movie at least funny bad,2024-02-17
i thought it was ok as far as a madame webb movie could be made dialog was pretty wooden and a lot of exposition but it wasok all in all,2024-02-18
"i don’t think that was as bad as reviews were making it out to be but it was bad but imo like barely worse than morbius maybe it’s because i came expecting it to be the worst movie i’ve ever seen i liked the casting other than dakota and i liked the costumes that’s about it on the good things to say about it   
i would have watched a movie about any of the spider women instead of the sony villain movies and this thing it was very cheesy and the last 30 minutes felt rushed and especially bad",2024-02-19
"imagine adapting this and not serperation anxiety or like any other great spiderman comic plot 

literally just picked this derivative flash speedforce garbage the worst spiderman comic run in a while and are like oh why doesnt this work

lifeless and completely tone deaf to what even made spiderman big also the best thing i have seen pointed out is that they clearly filmed a bunch of this movie in the 90s time period and then literally rewrote the year hahah so the cars and clothes are old for no reason ",2024-02-20
where’s the “land of bad” discussion thread that movie was great imo is it original not in the slightest but i really enjoyed it for what it was 710 movie for me,2024-02-21
where’s the “land of bad” discussion thread that movie was great imo is it original not in the slightest but i really enjoyed it for what it was 710 movie for me,2024-02-21
its not that bad better than black adam,2024-03-16
"id say the holland spiderman movies is the best superhero trilogy of the mcu id put them above the raimi movies and tasm as well 

i dont understand how sony can make those in partnership with the mcu with their right hand and make this  and morbius with their left",2024-02-15
"they made a movie about a one off character from the cartoon and comics  the same with morbius and likely with kraven and venom

venom i can sort of understand but he’s such a major character to spiderman the same for carnage sony is doing their best to  out movies so they can keep the rights to some marvel characters but instead of characters people care about it’s characters who know a guy who could have sworn he saw spiderman at a kids birthday party",2024-02-15
a slow but mildly interesting origin story,2024-02-15
i loved the part where she said it’s mawbin time,2024-02-15
i just saw this movie and its not bad at all sure its not a master piece but its definitely not worse that any other superhero movie men like to hate on anything starring women,2024-03-17
"i can come up with a much better plot  
the movie would start with a younger madame web getting bitten by a spider and the next day wakes up in what she doesnt realize until later is another universe one day she is rescued by spider gwen an alternate universe version of emma stones gwen that night she finds herself invertedly summoning the spider noir from the miles morales movie who after mentioning he was part of a group looking for a specific spiderman miles he disappears tva agents appear revealing she has the power to summon spidermen from other universes   
she escapes to another universe when the tva agents are killed by an evil spiderman with the  spots powers this universe toby maguire is doctor strangrdr spider and they come to understand madame web comes from a universe where miles morales becomes spiderman yet went mad after obtaining the spots powers killing spidermen across the multiverse tva agents who try to stop him and is drawn to madame as shes from the same universe and she also developed the power to access universes with spidermen in them after training she has a vision with the spider  the source of all spidermans powers explaining that she will fail unless she offers up a sacrifice  
madame soon faces spotspiderman and summons several alternate spidermen to help including dr spider spider gwen emma and another toby maguire spiderman that instead retained the venom suit despite their efforts they fail and madame instead sacrifices herself to drag her and spidermanspot into the spider gods universe which devours the evil spiderman it resurrects her but she is permanently blind   
the film ends with madame web realizing she can still summon spidermen decides to use her powers for good",2024-02-15
is that the girl from transformers,2024-02-16
i figured out the truth behind madame web hear me out sony created this movie and hired the writers with the intention that it was going to flop they 100 mil on the money knowing that it was not going to make it back so that they could write it off as a tax loss since it is tax season coming up it was in fact a genius strategy to save up for venom 3,2024-02-21
as good as any spiderman movie,2024-03-16
the only reason i can fathom to give sony money for one of their liveaction no seriously its the mcu you guys films that doesnt prominently feature venom is if sydney sweeney who has some acting chops filmed the entire movie completely buckass  barring that ill pass ive seen enough of dakota johnson to figure out that in the career that she was obviously handed in a package with a big bow on top she is about as unremarkable and unnoteworthy as it gets,2024-02-15
serious question is it worse than the marvels,2024-02-15
"okay so i just got done watching this and i cant believe this movie is getting so much hate i had a really great time watching this it was like final destination meets terminator meets spiderman dakota johnson was a super charismatic lead i love the socially awkward jokes her character makes and how by the end she comes to genuinely love and care for these three girls like theyre her daughters it had big found family themes which as someone who birth family abandoned me and the only family i have now is the one i chose for myself  i always cherish seeing in a movie because it reflects something ive personally been through  the part at the end where shes in the hospital and the nurse asks if the girls are cassies close family and she says they are theyre all mine and that she had everything she needed right there almost made me cry

tahar rahim was great as ezekiel simmsthe evil spiderman too i love the parts where hes in the dark spiderman costume and just silent but deadly like i mentioned above it was very terminator i actually thought this was a better terminator movie than most of the recent terminator sequels haha i always thought itd be super terrifying if someone like spiderman wanted you dead because theres not really a whole lot you can do about that right the costume and the way he moves were just super creepy and well done the action scenes where they try to get away from him were far and away some of my favorite parts of the film the part at the end where he jumps onto the cars and hes ready to  them all and cassie just hits him so  hard with an ambulance was fantastic and then he just gets up and keeps chasing them i really love that we got a movie with a spiderman as the villain i dont think thats ever been done before and a lot of the shots where hes jumping around on walls or away from explosions looked fantastic i also liked the peruvian spidertribe even though we dont see a whole lot of them

i thought it was cool as well to have a female superhero whos greatest weapon is her mind and hitting people with cars andor ambulances like shes not super strong and she cant fly or anything like most superheroes can but shes got this psychic power that gives her a mental edge and its her thinking on her feet that gets her and the girls out of most of the tough situations in the movie as a woman myself i appreciate there being a movie about some spiderwomen for once too and they all looked fantastic in their costumes even though you only see them in a few scenes

i know a lot of people are hating on it because its not directly connected to an existing spiderman franchise like the ones with andrew garfield or tom holland and its not part of some cinematic universe but thats part of what i liked so much about it im tired of cinematic universes and superhero movies that rely on the nostalgia factor of hey heres that thing you like and im especially tired of superhero films that are about the multiverse thank  this had nothing to do with that this was just a movie that stood on its own and told an original selfcontained story and who cares if peter parker isnt spiderman in this movie hes actually a baby in this and they made a very funny joke where his mom says he keeps leaping around in there is baby peter parker wreaking havoc on his moms birth canal weve had a bunch of movies with him as spiderman recently and i like the idea of just doing something different we havent seen before not everything has to be connected to a million different things or some other version of the character sometimes its okay for a movie to just use the central idea behind something and tell a new unique story im tired of the mcu and im tired of there being a billion different universes that im supposed to keep track of just tell me one story in one universe i dont need to go to another galaxy everytime i just want to watch a movie about people with superpowers

i also liked that it was set in 2003 i was really young back then still a little kid and so all the needle drops and aesthetics of that time period felt really warm and comforting i think the early 2000s is an untapped market for period pieces they got the look and the fashion choices on point too i actually think cassies outfit was pretty timeless i want to wear a cool red jacket like that haha

id happily watch a sequel to this but im guessing from the amount of hate this is getting bizarrely too ive never seen people so angry about a film before thats not going to happen im cool with that too though i think this movie tells a whole story from start to end and it doesnt really need any sequels expanding on that i really loved it though id give it a 45",2024-02-16
"does the movie  or is it because sexism being a strong waman movie and all

i havent decide if i want to watch or not is it really that ",2024-02-19
i’m was shocked to see so many bad responses to this movie on here but then i remembered not everyone here is ,2024-02-18
oh it came out on a wednesday well im not saying this trash and judging by the comments i was right,2024-02-15
"pretty cheesy without being much fun i can see madame web being enjoyed as camp years down the line by a select few i was waiting for it to kick into gear and it kinda just never does everything is so overt and spelled out here it has been said that this feels like a relic of the catwoman and elektra era of superherocomic book movies and it truly does it also feels like the pilot of a television show i like dakota johnson but she did not seem right to lead this

i do not blame sydney sweeney isabela merced or celeste oconnor the cast looks good and works well together but this was a long hour and forty five minutes sans credits",2024-02-15
delicious delicious trash,2024-02-15
sony just give up super hero movies at this point these movies ain’,2024-02-15
felt an hour too long and an hour too short at the same time,2024-02-15
"okay just saw the movie not quite as bad as i was expecting but dear  did it feel absolutely clunky

one thing that bothered me was the way the villains actor was dubbed over why was that done

also found it weird the tribe member who acted as the mcs guide didn’t do more to help",2024-02-15
"ok someone lemme know so i can make the call

is it tear it to pieces in the parking lot after with friends entertainingly bad 

or boring doesnt even have that kind of enjoyment to offer bad",2024-02-15
so let me get this straight madame web is the jack  jill of movies and morbius is the godfather,2024-02-16
if you don’t think about it too much it’s something to watch i wasn’t very impressed but keeping expectations low kept the disappointment somewhat at bay the final shot they had in the movie with them all in costume went pretty hard that’s about it,2024-02-16
sydney isabela and celeste were the only redeeming things about the movie,2024-02-16
"seriously dont do dumb thjngs

maybe the executive should have heed to thsi advise before sinking 100 million on to it 

there are few funny lines but the delivery is just off what happening to dakota jphnsonwas she always this awkward on screen",2024-02-16
"i felt like the only way to truly do justice to madame web in a review was to try to imagine the screenplay writing process

whats crazy to me is that sony is somehow making these movies even worse,2024-02-16
,2024-02-16
the real villain was the nsa,2024-02-17
comic book ezekiel was a great villain i was expecting to see him in tom holland’ spiderman 5 or something… now he’s gone…,2024-02-17
i dont want  like this id rather have book series like rot and ruin and cirque du freak turned into actual series i loved those books growing up and i so wished for them to be made into film or tv shows cirque du freak was a movie but nowhere near what the series was about and rot and ruin couldve been just as big as twd same with the book prey a fantastic book and wouldve been great to see on screen literally so much at their disposal and this is what we get because everyone wants tobecreative,2024-02-17
i would love to see hdtgm tackle this train wreck of a movie,2024-02-17
this is really getting sad on sonys part i mean really smh  the messed up part is that theyre burning characters that havent been used yet  well next up is kraven ,2024-02-18
"extremely disappointed i heard it was terrible but i heard it was a “so bad it’s fun” kind of terrible some terrible dialogue and acting but it was just bad bad and the best bit is two blink and you’ll miss it montages

what the  was that decision all about have the spiderwomen not even be part of the story i saw dakota johnson moaning that the film was changed do you think they actually shot scenes after all four girls get their powers but then restructured the ending  i can just imagine some donut at sony seeing that footage and thinking “they’re gonna love this let’s just show this as a tease and save it for the sequel”",2024-02-18
somewhat off question but does rotten tomatoes have a critics consensus blurb for madame web i dont see one,2024-02-21
"not a bad movie just a bit strange with some of their choices  
i still had fun and would have liked to see what they did with a sequel",2024-02-24
incredibly bad movie i thought the 4 main protagonists and most of the supporting characters did great but wow what an absolutely miserable script and the main antagonist i meansurely his acting performance must been out have spite,2024-02-24
the villain was so adrd it was like steinbrenner in seinfeld,2024-02-25
"her name is cassandra webb and she is the madame web 


they are really criative",2024-02-27
zosia mamet acted like she was held hostage and on the verge of tears,2024-02-15
"its hilarious that theres this villain the whole time he even has powers but the movie never even really bothers to explain what he wants or why or what he does or who he is

im only being a little hyperbolic but i feel like if they thought they could get away with cutting him out completely they would have",2024-02-15
what was his plan for the spider other than powers for himself did he have plans for using those powers his spider did nothing and shosh was the best part of the movie,2024-02-15
"his entire motivation was i saw a vision of some girls that  me so im gonna  them first thats it thats the movie i mean was he building something off screen like they  him and whatever it is hes building just goes away

i mean in the comics yes hes a successful businessman who owns a corporation that he built using his powers they couldnt have casually thrown that in there just take it right from the comics when i gained these powers i wanted to do good be a hero save peoplebut instead i used them to build my corporate empire and now ive seen a vision of these girls that wish to take it all from me i must stop them

there there ya go thats it all that needed to be said and they simply couldnt bother to put in one line of dialogue",2024-02-16
"he came from nothing less than nothing and had a great apartment and can pick up opera  by fake handing them a program 

what else do you need to know",2024-02-17
"i love how they dont explain him at all hes just like  spiderman 

like why did he have that suit why didnt he wear it when he went to  three kids on a crowded train",2024-02-18
in the comics hes a sort of mentor to people with spider powers and tries to help them reach their potential hes not always good but hes far from evil it made zero sense to make him the villain,2024-02-15
not single thing was explained even why his suit looks like that ,2024-02-17
what about the number of times he kept threatening zosia mamet or how hed bring up his own sad storyline,2024-02-15
his spider research outpost in costa rica obviously ,2024-02-15
"i like the line from the villain where hes like “they will destroy everything i’ve built” but like  did he build 

he obviously got rich if he dies then everything he built would cease to exist for him  

they never explained anything about him is he a businessman an arms dealer   

this couldve been explained in passing in one sentence or two but i guess its too much work for the writers",2024-02-16
"youre supposed to think about what his job was




its a thinker s",2024-02-15
"i guess he built that cool terrarium and a pretty swanky telework setup for zosia mamet 

but yes that line was headscratchingly bad",2024-02-16
what do we build,2024-02-15
just got back from my screening and that drove me insane the whole time,2024-02-17
"tbf that could be read as a shot at those kinds of selfimportant men 

i can’t believe i’m defending this movie",2024-02-19
"i was thinking that not only could he had patented all the medicinal properties of the spider but also used his powers of premonition to pick stocks or make other investments the twist is he needed to have fresh bites from time to time from the spider hence his fear of it being taken from him

im disappointed the guy just had a large spider habitat in his nice apartment for no clear reason except maybe for fond memories of his time in the amazon",2024-02-17
how did he get rich why did they come for him  was he a good guy  we dint know,2024-02-19
he built… a little mini environment for his pet spider,2024-02-23
and how did the spider powers help him build it  whatever it was,2024-03-03
the actor was cringier than all heck too and goodness i hope those writers get fired for life “and once they get powers then they can steal everything i’ve built” if you are going to hire toptier actresses and be that horrendous of a writer at least get an actor that not only fits the role but is also an actor who at least lessens the cringe horrendous ezekiel actor gosh that accent and wow i’m afraid to know who those writers were and i hope they get fired from sony for life they should never have even been able to work in hollywood with their astonishingly horrible grade of writing,2024-03-05
yep they really didnt delve that deep into the sims character the villain just chases them down line some kind of spiderterminatorpredator,2024-03-16
hes not a spiderman though hes a ceiling man according to the gals in the movie,2024-04-06
i said the exact same thing ,2024-02-23
i dont think people were sold for this movie due to those shots more than they were because sydney sweeny hot but that sounds like a kangaroo jack level of bait and switch we havent seen in a long while,2024-02-15
two minutes theres no super suit team up climax,2024-02-16
"i found the trailer super misleading in that case either have the spiderwomen origins too or don’t show it at all in the trailer 
i feel robbed",2024-02-18
i saw it tonight and was really confused when it ended because of all the trailers i saw with the girls suited up and sydney talking about how she studied her character ,2024-02-20
holy  she did say that so much lol,2024-02-15
i wanted her to say come with me if you want to live when she crashed into the diner,2024-02-15
thats not true shes also really good at running the main villain over with a stolen vehicle,2024-02-15
"my mother was shot in the amazon while researching spiders

its odd how the only aspect about madame webb where they remained faithful to the comics was in her powers she cant fight or do anything fightingwise but predict the future they didnt even give dakota martial arts she just survives on luck and the fact that the bad guy is such a lousy fighter",2024-02-15

and run run run,2024-03-31
like 80 of his lines had bad lip sync it was mind boggling and then the other 20 they did camera tricks to not show his mouth did they hire someone else to do his voice but his accent was terrible,2024-02-17
yea i thought the exact same thing it was like it was dubbed for large parts,2024-02-15
do they have a reason for this  my partner and i were wondering the same thing,2024-02-16
there’s that shot of him running sideways across a building but his voice sounds like he’s sat down in a recording booth,2024-02-17
"the villains dialogue was hysterically bad that scene after he seduced the nsa agent and has that nightmarevision made me laugh so hard i cried my spider they have taken my spider

its great too cause he keeps the exact same cadence of generic angry evil villain voice throughout the entire movie his tone never changes its always poorly dubbed its amazing",2024-02-24
i wondered if it was originally in spanish but they decided people didnt want to read subtitles and so dubbed it over with english but i guess they completely changed the plot,2024-02-21
they always do that with masked characters they did it with the first spiderman,2024-02-18
135 billion people speak english there are so many talented people out there and they went with those knobs,2024-02-15
was there some legality reason they couldn’t say any spidermen adjacent people’s names  when they were guessing the name they popped a ballon  wouldn’t say may is the woman ben’s dating  things like that stuck out to me  also the  things like “he’s always leaping around in there” when it came to her being pregnant i hate the whole idea that peter was always destined to be spiderman and he showed little signs before being bit anyone can be spiderman if they step up to the responsibility,2024-02-15
why the  were they given another movie do they have dirt on the execs or something youd think if you made a movie as bad as morbius that your chances at major motion pictures would be over at least for quite a while,2024-02-15
you mean the greatest screenwriters of all time  yay,2024-02-15
you didnt catch on when madame webb said its webbing time before webbing all over the place,2024-02-15

"i agree

they should cast tom hardy in all future lead roles for their superhero films",2024-02-15

i was sitting there wondering why the  the villain sounded like he was dubbed for the entire movie i guess i was pretty much right lol,2024-02-15
yeah it was probably the worst dialogue since the prequels ,2024-02-16
number not amount,2024-02-21
someone in my theater yelled out no at this part in a way that sounded like a genuine reaction and like he was really upset and then he got up and left and didnt come back,2024-02-16
thanks yoda,2024-02-15
is this real dialogue or something chatgpt spits out when you ask it write a spiderman script,2024-02-15
its honestly incredible how hard every postraimi movie has swerved to avoid using the real line itd actually be comical if anyone was ever selfaware enough to play it for a laugh dear future screenwriters you will never write a version better than with great power comes great responsibility there is a reason that line has survived essentially unchanged since 1962,2024-02-16
this cant be a real line in the movie i refuse to believe it,2024-02-17

im more curious about the pepsi thing than the movie now like what did they do that was so blatant,2024-02-15
if this movie has so much pepsi can they at least include pepsiman in it,2024-02-15

worst of all she stole a taxi before leaving new york and then drives to the city where she just stole that taxi drives to her house in a stolen taxi then after she parks at her apartment she takes the plates off not before she enters new york city only once she gets to her new york city apartment in a stolen new york city taxi",2024-02-19

"plus usually when she had a vision she didnt movie in physical space  for instance she had her vision of the diner but at the end was still in the woods and redid things from there  

however when she saw microwave beep and bird hit the window she got up and went to the window in the vision  
but when the vision ended she was still standing by the window so did she teleport that time  

and what about the weird trippy conversation with the bad guy in the diner was that a vision was she psychic for a single scene",2024-02-15

it would have been fantastic if she just started walking through the woods in new jersey or wherever and then she just ends up in peru and i still wouldnt have thought it was any weirder than the rest of the movie just wow this movie was insanely bad,2024-03-15

it was great entertainment  it was very much worth my money  my only gripe is how much i paid for a pepsi ad but otherwise i have no complaints  criticisms yes it was a disaster  complaints no  i was never bored  the executives that made this movie think we’re idiots and were so much smarter than them,2024-03-08

"madame web having her own movie is  insane

but

they could have actually tried with this movie and that would have been the angle to go with

“cassie” could have abused her powers the whole movie…changing things she shouldn’t saving people who died on her as an emt or  you could’ve made her a doctor throw in like her mom dad or brother or sister or someone

have the main spiderplot  happen 

have the web of life or whatever tell her she has to deal with this power and not interfere she has to let her family member die and say goodbye to them yada yada

the end of the movie could’ve been the fact after she learns that lesson that she sees ben’s parker family future and that she has to let that happen too  but promises to be there for ben’s family but really means peter

"thats the million dollar question isnt it 
some say sony is vying for some fiscal benefit
but to hire the same people that wrote morbius to write the next sony spiderverse live action movie is certainly from a business pov inexcuseable
maybe in the end  the executives got big bonus with the number of movies they can make
but overall its doubtfull that there wereare any artistic interest behind a movie like this",2024-02-15
i think part of this is sony executives trying to chase the success of venom without understanding why the movie got any traction another big part is probably the looming writers and actors strike which rushed a lot of films out into production before the script was really ready for shooting,2024-02-15

"i work with someone who was they are the stupidest person ive ever experienced in my life like i actually genuinely dont think they can properly care for themselves  they are the most media illiterate person ive ever met if a movie is good and of any kind of importance to greater pop culture theyve never heard of it but if its absolute garbage then adore it and are shocked and offended to hear people dont they also thought morbius was one of the best movies theyve ever seen as well as black adam their favorite actor is the rock and they think hes an amazing actor 

another coworker was also excited but i think she didnt read too much into it shes a bit geeky and loves marvel stuff and i think she just saw the first trailer and thought it looked pretty interesting shes not obsessing over it and saying it looks like the coolest movie ever like the first person

oh my  the one time i talk about my coworker is the day its announced that they quit by no longer showing up and not picking up their phone theyve been here three years they told a coworker who ran into them in the wild they no longer worked here but didnt tell anyone in charge stupidest  on the planet i swear to ",2024-02-15

i was for the level of camp lol,2024-02-15
i would have been excited to see it if i had known ezekiel was going to be in it  i think anybody going in excited about the spiderwomen gang is going to be pretty  off at the bait and switch regardless of how they feel about the movie quality  teasing them in the trailers and then showing them largely just posing for perhaps 60 seconds of screen time is terrible,2024-02-15

i was despite what many are saying i actually enjoyed it for the most part,2024-02-16

i like emma roberts a lot but she hasnt been in a relevant film that has actually made close to a profit since nerve in 2016 and even that is a stretch to call that relevant but it did make a good profit shes never been a go to name in the film industry

her agents would have not even thought twice about accepting a small roll in an aaa mainstream film it was a nobrainer  if this film ends up benefiting anyones career itll probably be hers

"ok a lot i want to respond to here

did the american heart association pay the studio to promote the practice of cpr

so am i crazy or were they doing cpr completely wrong i havent seen anyone mention it and from how much its featured in the movie i figured they had to be pushing the newest method butthey never do any mouthtomouth they just do a bunch of really fast chest compressions and apparently you cant stop ever idk i got cpr certified once like 15 years ago but i cant believe you would never need to put air in the persons lungs 


why did the teen trio just walk away from a campfire they built in the woods

i caught this immediately with as many wildfires as they have in cali and as many celebs have lost houses and possessions from wildfires i would think they would want to push good fire safety i would give them the benefit of the doubt and that they were trying to show how dumb and reckless the girls are but then why not show any consequences 

why is the diner 50 feet from the woods is this common in new jersey

honestly it looked like they were right off the highway so its possible that was just a diner at a highway exit im more concerned about how the  they got that cab to drive that far into the woods i didnt see any kind of road it was just an old  cab in the middle of the woods just driving around at the very least the suspension on that should have been completely destroyed and undrivable 

why did the writers make us sit through dakota johnson’s deadpan awkwardness at a baby shower

ok i legitimately enjoyed this part it was just straight up an snl skit and i was laughing my  off like they were supposed to write down their favorite memory of their mom and she put a blank slip of paper in there because her mom is dead comedy gold right there",2024-02-19

"my sister and i just read your review together and laughed so much seriously on the nose we saw it tonight and i cant stop thinking about all the issues also it caused a fight between us because i wanted to go to the showing of a ghost story amc released it for exactly one showing today because of valentines day and weve never seen it but ive been wanting to for years and was so excited to have the chance to see it in theatres instead of on tv for the first time but she preferred to see this for valentines day instead im literally punching the air right now and during the whole movie i knew it wasnt going to be great from the trailers and i was like we can see this on friday lets watch a ghost story instead but no so i compromised like an idiot theres no  way i wouldve compromised if i knew that the writes of morbius made this movie i only found out after reading this reddit post

anyway i have to add to the stupidity bullets you made mine are super nitpicking but this movie is now living rent free in my head for all the wrong reasons did chatgpt write this  no wait that would be insulting ai too much the  behind morbius did

when adam scott saved dakota after she went down off the bridge in a car like how did he get down and pull her out of the water and under the bridge and why wasnt anyone else there with him did he dive off the  bridge straight in how could he or did he run down then swim in from the shore swim over to where she fell in swam down to the ever sinking car that is probably very far down by that point somehow break the window open pull her out of the car swim up out of the water with her and do chest compressions until he revived her all in 3 mins

what was with the final destination bbq scene from the vibe of the editing directing and acting i thought that pushing the patties can easily cause a fire would lead to just that i only thought that  thought because they commented on it a million times like why did they prolong that scene and emphasize it so much weird

emma roberts just met dakota but cared so much about what she had to say during the games why was she so laser focused on her instead of her real friends

when sydney sweeney materialized out of thin air in the hospital hallway that whole scene was edited so weirdly

when sydney yelled to the police in the train station that they were being kidnapped to me i didnt even notice that the officers looked their way i thought that they didnt even hear her they sure as  didnt walk towards them and question dakota then later in another part of the station like 5 officers go to handcuff dakota  

at first i thought that maybe the villain was like invisible to anyone but them the editing and dialogue were both so weird because in the train station they kept saying that no one could see him and after when the radiostation said that she killed the police they again repeated that the police didnt see him how he killed a few of them and more came to fight him when they left so i thought maybe some other  was going on made no sense also why was dakota so freaked out about them mistakingly thinking it was her she couldve driven straight to a police station and had the 3 teens tell them exactly what happened shed be cleared and theyd probably all be safer

when that guy in the diner called 911 because he saw the 3 girls in the paper first of all how the  did that happen already they were kidnapped like 3 hours before plus none of their parents were involved how did the police identify the 3 girls get their headshots provide the info to the newspaper so that they could write up the headpage then print and disperse the newspapers so that diner guy could have it in head less than 3 hours after they were kidnapped 
second of all why did he call the police he saw that they were alone and safely eating food no dakota in sight they were flirting with the teenage boy booth for  sake then instead of going up to them and saying one word he immediately calls the police ok amazing samaritan i guess

why were they dancing on the table like buffoons that was so awkward

dakota has another future vision she doesnt see them at the campsite so she blues clues after their footprints and walks the presumably half mile to the diner in time to see girl 1 and 2 pull girl math onto the table with them to dance to britney spears toxic then she walks in and blah blah blah million dollar baby chair neckbreak blah blah blah stab then she goes back to present where she is safe outside of the cab back in the woods and toxic has already started playing what does it take like 8 mins to leisurely walk half a mile why did the music already start playing then she made it to the diner in time to see the 2 girls pulling the 3rd girl on the table but with a cab she didnt get there until after all three were dancing and the villian came inside 60 seconds later then she ran into him the timing doesnt line up at all

she rammed into the diner with the stolen cab looks like she drove like 1 mile to the motel so theyre searching for the 3 girls and know that a stolen taxi drove into the diner but dakota parks it in front of the 1 mile away motel without a care in the world and the police dont find it

when dakota shows the 3 girls the photo of her mom and the villain in peru they immediately recognize him its annoying that skater girl says so this is your fault or because of you or something girl she just saved your  again and obviously never met the dude but you think she had some storyline with him didnt you listen to her also am i crazy or didnt they not ever see his face at that point they only saw him in his spidey costume right they didnt see his face yet so how did they immediately recognize him",2024-02-15

"ill disagree about the driving part at the beginning because that was the only realistic to ems part when you drive an ambulance lights and sirens through traffic its simultaneously dangerous and anticlimactic the ambulance drivers have seen it all and people react so strange to the truck coming through stopping in place or even flipping off the ambulance for inconveniencing them theres also a lot of mumbled curses when it gets frustrating however you cant be so urgent that you make a mistake because thats how you end up with a garbage truck coming through the side of your rig as depicted later in the film

also ems would never be going into a building on fire from fireworks the fire crews would be doing those grabs im not sure as the the exact triage protocol in 2003 in nyc but in 2024 she wouldnt have been doing cpr on that guy he would have been black tagged and shed be working on a red tag or possibly even still just triaging i dont think they would have been called in from home to go to the hot job though

she would have never been allowed to just walk off her drowning either emts very rarely do the blanket and treat at the back step of the truck it might happen on set for booboos but 911 is going to be setting up to transport stuff like broken limbs and gsws

anyways movie adr  especially any time the villain spoke he sounded like a narrator rather than a character in the room

the metronorth stuff was weird and the amtrak train that kept repeating in the background of the shot wouldnt have ran into grand central at the time also the scheme on the outside looked like the modern cdot scheme so im not sure where they filmed",2024-02-15
"dakota gets the idea that all of this is related to her mother because sydney sweeney says he crawled like a spider then she leaves three teenagers she just kidnapped in a forest with no transportation and says ill be back in a few hours

" that the adr

the villains lines are definitely 100 adr right like i dont think they left a single world of whatever he said on set in the film if you made a drinking game out of his dialogue not matching his mouth you would die and also only not take a shot maybe once

also they definitely adrd  digitally edited in the 2003 stuff right like dakota johnson saying she has to watch idol and the martha stewart reference both feel like they got dubbed in later and that random beyonce ad in a back alley is like a painfully obvious addition the og cut was definitely set in 1993 and probably somehow inexplicably even worse judging by ezekiel",2024-02-17

" and who decided to cover sydney sweeney up and make her the  girl

it isnt even a weird reddit hornybonk moment here  it is  hollywood  how do you have the hottest woman on the planet right now figuratively and literally and you dont have her show any sort of  appeal at all and then blue ball us with no spidersuit for any of them

 only one of the teenagers looked like a teenager

thats because none of them are and its quite crazy they dared to go that way just because they wanted to cast some up and coming actresses for their surefire new franchise

 whyd she keep the banged up taxi did no one notice the banged up taxi

she removed the plates and all ny taxis are banged up after all  the driver just decided that it wasnt a job for him and didnt report it he went on to become a bike courier

it doesnt feel like its so bad its good like the room or a money plane or neil breen film where you can see they all tried to make something good but lacked the skill and funding then you can pick apart the technical stuff of the movie for laughs this movie has the budget and cast but just didnt make anything its very first draft first take no acting adjustments first edit to push out the door

i just want to see them sweat their life off one phone call away from a mental breakdown because their genius screenwriter hasnt delivered after a month of blank page syndrome and 20m went down the drain because now they have to reschedule filming locations and rewrite artists contracts as they see their budget slowly chip away because of all the bad decisions they made

wait am i understanding this correctly do they imply aunt may is pregnant with her nephew",2024-02-16
" if they step up to the responsibility

great power will come",2024-02-15
"its probably some internal studio policy as to not  any potential licensors or upcoming directors of any potential new actual spiderman films  just my guess  

or maybe they were hoping to tie into the mcu tom holland spiderman despite his birth being off by two years but couldnt totally confirm that because of studio politics",2024-02-15
"anyone cant be spiderman he has super powers 

in comic books everyone is connected",2024-02-20
"i think because technically since sony owns the rights of spiderman 

but the tom holland spiderman is a joint venture of disney and sony so disney might have more of a say now in how spiderman is used until maybe the disney and sony agreement is over because frankly the reason spiderman is doing so well is because of the disney crossover hence why madame web venom and morbius did so poorly",2024-02-21
"and its not just morbius they are on a crazy streak of movies 

pretty  impressive list",2024-02-15
they probably get the script done on time they are trusted contractors who will pump out a script about characters x y and z and have 35 action set pieces the execs are gonna cut it to  and change what they want anyway so why bother paying more or waiting for a good script,2024-02-15
starting to think these are a tax write off for sony they have to make them every few years to hold on to the screen rights and they likely don’t care if they’re any good,2024-02-15
scriptwriters have very little power when it comes to a finished movie so they dont really get the blame for the movie being bad,2024-02-15
" someone asked me what the movie was like and i said it felt like i was watching morbius  
  
why do people keep giving them movies those are the two worst superhero movies of all time",2024-02-18
it was so final destination 2 codes they should have just leaned more into the fd mythos,2024-02-16
you must have never driven in the south happens all the time,2024-02-20
it was actually slower since toxic finished and ezekiel showed up before her driving there ,2024-02-18
i come from the future where i am watching this movie she was fumbling with the radio as if she needed to keep toxic playing in order to find them it was insane,2024-03-15
what if symbiotic alien goo and tom hardy were a messy  couple,2024-02-16
of sony’s spiderman without spiderman films the venom movies are the only things worth watching and that’s all on tom hardy putting everything into it to be entertaining as ,2024-02-17
" his sweaty goofball idiot brock and loser symbiot relationship was fun

his acting chops are pretty  good  he made that relationship work",2024-02-16
was super awesome they made a sequel where theyre away from each other for 75 of it,2024-02-19
tom hardy hamming it up with all that physical slap stick comedy is a major reason those venom movies are watchable ,2024-03-16
they work because everyone in those films are in a horror movie except tom hardy who is in a comedy its the same genius that makes ghostbusters work so well the characters think theyre in a different genre,2024-02-19
madame web 2 tom hardy bugaloo,2024-02-15
she fired her management team a week after the premiere of the trailer it’s rumored she didn’t realize when she signed up this wasn’t an mcu rolemovie and her team didn’t tell her different,2024-02-15
how many movies does she have to do this in before we accept that shes just kind of a flat and bland actor,2024-02-15
i think it’s just her did you see her on snl oy,2024-02-15
"her timing is so odd 
like shes swallowing air before finishing a sentence",2024-02-15
her and sweeney are just flat actors when i saw them both cast in this it told me everything i needed to know ,2024-02-15
yeah she clearly regretted signing on for this and regretted it early on in filming  i cant blame her  this is going to hurt her career  she is the face of this and is going to win the razzie guaranteed  isabela merced is bad but she has a ton of stuff coming out soon and wasnt the face of the film,2024-02-16
alternate theory she’s a terrbile actress and wooden stiff is what she does ,2024-02-18
half the reason i saw madame web was because for how awful fifty shades was dakota johnson still put effort into her role,2024-02-17
i dont think she0s a great actress to start with,2024-03-15
no she is that bad at acting,2024-03-16
shes not a big enough star to do that lol,2024-02-15
i know right multiple actors in this had kind of a stale way of acting and it feels like that was kind of the point sometimes if thats the case then i find it very impressive ,2024-02-16
"that is so fcking unprofessional that i cant even find the right words to describe it did her team make a huge fcking mistake probably does that mean she can do a half  job absolutely not

ill give her the benefit of the doubt that maybe she is just a bad actress",2024-02-19
they wanted a narration he gave them one,2024-02-15
wow harrison really didnt wanna do narration huh,2024-02-15
you didnt,2024-02-15
"so ive only seen the final cut of bladerunner never the theatrical one with the narration

and i have to say dear  what were they thinking",2024-02-15

the editing on that legitimately felt like a mistake that wasn’t caught",2024-03-02

yeah maybe ai would have been better,2024-02-18
didnt may say it practically verbatim in no way home though,2024-02-18
oh it is saw a clip of it on twitter,2024-02-17
you understand how bad the movie is now,2024-02-17
"they didn’t try to reword it or anything it’s a poorly writtenexecuted scripted but the i think the intention of every scene was obvious enough 

the scene the quote comes from sees madame web having to come to terms with her new powers of pre cognition she’s being told that she’s never going to be able to control the power until she accepts that it’s hers to control she had spent the film up to that point using the power out of a sense of bare minimum decency to not let three teenagers get murdered in front of her but now she’s accepting her greater place in everything 

it’s not a good film but the line wasn’t “messed up” it was just a bad script",2024-02-18
"so it was not just me it was not explained why the firework to the eyes also paralysed her

i do not believe any character even acknowledged that she was blind and paralysed now",2024-02-15

i laughed out loud when they showed her at the end in the wheelchair and glasses holy ,2024-02-23
i burst out laughing xd,2024-03-27
i wanna see the outtakes where dakota johnson is breaking character because she cant keep a straight face during that scene,2024-02-16
i said “okay xavier we see you”,2024-02-17

"probably just a case that the best outcome future is one where ben dies and peter becomes spiderman

a necessary death for the good of the world theres been many what if comics that have covered this they all end up worse for peter when ben lives",2024-02-17
sure couldn’t save this movie though lol,2024-02-19
oh my  youre right,2024-03-17
so all of the marketing is a lie the three spider girls don’t get their powers during the movie it’s only from web’s visions of the future  about 60 seconds at most the main villain dies because a pepsi sign falls and crushes him,2024-02-15
several people holding pepsi cans throughout but the climax also happens at long island citys pepsi cola sign,2024-02-15
at a bbq someone hands her a pepsi and she holds it like shes presenting it to the screen,2024-02-15
just last week there was a post on rspidermanps4 about how one of peters costumes looks like pepsiman and now im seeing him mentioned here apparently spiders and pepsi really go together ,2024-02-15
what if they make a pepsi man movie if they leaned into the absurdity of it they might have something,2024-02-15
drinking coke yawn getting crushed by pepsi woohoo,2024-02-17

she parked a stolen smashedup taxi at the airport for a week while she was in peru then came home and drove it around some more with no issues i guess she did take off the license plates which of course made the car unidentifiable despite the taxi number on its roof and definitely isn’t something that would make the cops pull you over,2024-02-17
"and she gets literally nothing out of that entire peru trip nothing that helps her out at least 

dude who met her couldnt have just sent a letter saying that her mom was trying to fix her  he made her trek that far and drop of ton of money to hear it in person

and the weird power to save people who need to get helped up except it got negated by one punch and never showed up again",2024-02-27
she also drives around in a stolen taxi with no plates and no one bats an eye,2024-03-17
i guess they originally wanted it to directly tie into hollands spiderman but they scrapped it so it still randomly takes place in the past but doesnt have a direct connection beyond mary being pregnant with a peter just not an established peter,2024-02-15
"you know how the last good sony superhero film was a spiderman sequel made in the early 2000s

and how every superhero movie they made now feels like it was made in 2009 at that latest

sony peaked in high school and absolutely cannot let go of that here they’ve decided to lean into it",2024-02-15
they straight up just needed a reason for smartphones and social media to not be popular to help establish how they could hide from the villain ,2024-02-18
because cell phones wouldve tore the movie apart,2024-03-03
"uncle ben is young peter is being born at the end of the movie 

it couldnt be current times with the current spiderman",2024-03-24
you can assume that ezekiel’s womaninthechair sent the cops that’s explainable but they made no attempt to explain it,2024-02-19

pepsiman already exists and they could have just spent the money to give him the big screen treatment he deserves instead of being involved in this embarrassment ,2024-02-15
from this thread i don’t even know if the pepsi stuff is actual sponsorship or simply the movie’s commitment to be as 2003 as possible,2024-02-15
i want to see it more because its recieved poorly lol,2024-02-15
now i want pepsi,2024-02-15

so they lure ezekiel sims to a warehouse that madame web was at earlier that had a bunch of fireworks in it and light the fireworks to distract him why they didn’t go off when the entire warehouse was engulfed in flames during that earlier sequence is beyond me and they’re going off all during the climax and when madame web falls into the water at the end of the fight she’s staring up at all the fireworks going off and there’s a sense of her taking in the beauty of it and then one of them shoots down and absolutely drills her right in the face,2024-02-16
i can imagine it being a barnburner with friends and booze,2024-02-18
i was thinking more alvin and the chipmunks,2024-02-17

eh they just didnt wanna have to deal with people talking about dakota sleeping in the same bed as one of them since theyre all underage,2024-02-18

"theres a good story in the three spiderwomen each with slightly different skills working together as a team against i dont know the sinister six 

but they chose not to make that movie",2024-02-15
honestly the girls were some of the least offensive part of the movie imo they at least could read their lines much less soullessly than dakota johnson,2024-02-17
it is an abusive boyfriend it has its good moments but then the rest of time it hurts you,2024-02-15
i honestly dont think its nearly as bad as people are saying its not good but i had a fun time with my audience i legit enjoyed it more than i did quantumania last year i went in expecting a train wreck though so i was kinda surprised when it was just mid,2024-02-18
it was so dumb and i enjoyed every minute of it go see it,2024-02-19
ive learned over the years that the original mcu timeline set expectations way too high for anything that came out after endgame ive thoroughly enjoyed the stuff that ive seen and i have a feeling this movie isnt that bad,2024-02-15
dont forget when she did basic arithmetic in her head when they were driving to the hospital to give birth to spider man,2024-02-17
they are black hair brunette and red hair so close enough,2024-02-18
like the patton oswalt bit about the kfc famous bowl getting them to respond to him oh you want to make fun of our food you  comedian how about you make a joke about this funny guy and they release the doubledown that forces you to burn your hands to eat it,2024-02-15
"they hired the morbius writers long before morbius was released so they wouldn’t have known that audience would reject the movie

it seems like it might be more about them having extremely poor taste in screenplays",2024-02-15

these writers took it personally",2024-03-19
i must disagree morbius has several memorable lines and scenes how can you forget the milo dance scene morbius is very memeable,2024-02-15
my son and i had the same thought after watching madame web last night it was funnier in a bad way where as morbius just kind of  and was boring and i seriously dont remember anything except there were bats in it,2024-02-23
i have  regal unlimited and watched morbius on netflix,2024-02-15
my theater is really easy to sneak into only do it for bad movies though,2024-02-16
counter theyre both  tedious this one doesnt have matt smith to lighten things up though,2024-02-17
"id say the opposite morbius was dull and forgetful it was just bad

madame web is a campy mess that i could see having cult status similar to the room in terms of how bad it is

i would watch madame web again i wouldnt watch morbius again",2024-02-17
why ,2024-02-15
in many ways premonition is just a kind of time travel and manipulating the future by selecting from possible futures is the best example of how that is true,2024-02-16
so what is the ratio of number of innocent people she killed vs how many she saved,2024-02-21
that made me so mad how did she move spaces of what she is seeing is visions and not time traveling,2024-02-15
"the real answer to these questions is that the writerseditorswhatever didnt care enough to give it an internal logic

but for the last part  the vision conversation with the bad guy which is also the only nonaction scene that the two of them share  i took it to mean that she saw in the future that shed go to the diner and have that conversationand since she already experienced it in a vision there was no need for her to actually go out and do it",2024-02-15
why did the television turn back on  she came back to the present when the microwave stopped but she already turned off the tv before turning on the microwave,2024-02-15
"that was her deliberately using her powers ezekiel was waiting around the  diner that just got utterly wrecked like a  that wants to go to prison   some more cops 

so she futuresighted what would happen if she visited that place rather than actually going there and thus got a vision of a potential conversation actually given how disjointed it was several different potential conversations 

ezekiel is really dumb if your opponent has future sight you never ever tell them anything because you might be in a vision",2024-02-17
"the scene opens with the microwave beeping cassie opening the microwave the pidgeon hitting the window i suspect that while the distinction is a small one cassie can only see the future not time travel and that all three of these things were a potential future which never happened  when cassie becomes aware of the bird is not when the bird hits the window but instead several minutes earlier she walks up to the window in the present likely before even turning on the microwave and changes the future she had been watching i actually like the causality jolt here because i think it gives genresavvy viewers the same disconcerting surprise cassie has in universe since she does not know she is in a movie and still confuses the future with the present

i doubt it was a simple continuity error but since it is close enough to being one for most people to break immersion on that it would probably be poor cinematography either way",2024-02-18

pretty sure they forgot to release it,2024-02-20
yeah i dont understand how anyone gets excited about kraven ,2024-02-17
don’t know if you’re serious or not  but why does this sub wildly overestimate certain actors,2024-02-15
"thats not it sony only needs to release a spiderman movie every 5 years and 9 months to keep the rights they just released spiderman across the spiderverse in june 2023 so they dont need to release another spiderman movie until 2029 

sony released so many spiderman movies because they were super jealous of all the money the mcu was making so wereare trying to jump start their own cinematic universe they are just really really bad at it but theyre so blinded by the potential of making billions and billions that they cant stop trying",2024-02-15
im surprised they would dump so much money into a rights holder movie,2024-02-15
i heard somewhere that theyre contractually obligated to make these  movies to keep the rights the spiderman rights but i may be wrong,2024-02-15

except it doesn’t even work for that  if peter parker was born in 2003 he’d be in the 7th grade in civil war  the timeline doesn’t match up with… anything  2003 was just a year they picked out of a hat because they wanted a “toxic” needle drop,2024-02-15

christmas in july wasnt just some marketing from abc there have been christmas in july events for a while its pretty much just a fun excuse to do a bbq in the middle of summer there were big events on the beaches back in the day giving dollar store toys to local kids,2024-02-15
holy  you just shook a memory loose from my brain it was a thing for a bit,2024-02-15

yes and yes the power line gets flipped though where you take responsibility then you get power or some  they repeat it a couple of times always bad,2024-02-18

wait…what i thought the whole point of the movie is that the villain is trying to  mary parker so she doesn’t give birth to peter are you telling me there is no point to ben and and a pregnant mary parker being in the movie if the villain isn’t trying to  them to prevent spiderman from being born,2024-02-15
take me through this rabbit hole please,2024-02-15
theyre just doing terminator i guess,2024-02-15
its so they can have peter in the movie without explicitly stating it and also hes not yet actually a person and is still gestating in his mothers ,2024-02-15
"i am not convinced that this isnt a  

this sounds like someone trying to be deliberately ridiculous",2024-02-15
so theres no richard parker or may reilly just a dude driving his sisterinlaw to the hospital we dont get to see aunt may or peters dad,2024-02-15
i just realize this ben is the uncle ben lol,2024-03-15
"so is it set in the 90s then wasnt aware it was basically a prequel

i guess that makes sense because the madame web character in the comics from what i can see looks a lot older than mid30s so dakota johnson is just a younger version of her although she also looks a lot older than early 50s that would fit the timeline when peter parker is a teenager",2024-02-15

they are only seen in costumes during visions of the future which is like2 scenes including the final scene they have no powers at all during the movie,2024-02-15
sony deliberately misleads the audience on a certain level they know that girls in the costumes are the topic and charm of marketing but  just don’t know why the movie doesn’t do this,2024-02-15
we got tricked like dakota got tricked into being in this movie crazy it might end her career or at least take some years off,2024-02-15
which is wild  it isnt even really a superhero movie  if you are going to make a bad superhero movie at least make one  instead they made the equivalent of a spiderman movie two years before he gets his powers  it was crazy  literally one of the worst film ideas ever ,2024-02-16

we call that the sony special,2024-02-15
honestly your best bet is just to search out random clips of the truly insane adr and baffling line readings get all the unintentionally hilarious parts in like 5 minutes and miss out on the rest of the dumpster fire,2024-02-17
"why was peruvian jungle spider man wearing normal clothes when dakota and him found each other why wasnt he dressed and painted like in the beginning of the movie did he retire was it his day off did he clock out for the day where was his tribe were they all drinking beer in front of a tv reminiscing about the good ole tree climbing justice fighting days did they die whats with the disconnect plus she said shed be there for a week but we saw the river and cave scene which took an hour at most and then she was home again what happened to the better part of that week why didnt he teach her anything why didnt we get a mr miyagi montage scene

the characters were so twodimensional and annoying the skater girl was a biatch saying ewww to the woman whos water just broke in her home that she let them shelter in for their safety even though it was putting her and her baby in danger that resentment that dakota randomly revealed for him mom going to the peru jungle while she was 8 months pregnant isnt that the danger emma was putting her unborn baby in by prioritizing 3 strangers

the skater girl and all 3 girls didnt cover their faces when they went to the hospital why the  did they even go with them to the hospital they shouldve stayed in the home but then they didnt even cover their faces they put hoodies on that didnt even cover their hairlines and then stuck their faces to the car windows like they were supermodels standing outside a candy shop

dakota tells adam scott to get emma roberts away from them because vullian guy would leave them alone once they left why wouldnt the best plan for him be to use them as leverage take adam and emma and say   them if she doesnt trade the teenagers

as soon as dakota radioed in for the ambulance chopper thing to pick them up on the roof my absolute first thought way why so you can get some innocent emt ambulance pilots killed with your  plan she was probably friends with them too i hate that main character plot armor  like she put her life on the line to save these 3 strangers but then gets the pilots of the helicopter killed and doesnt even wince or gasp their lives dont matter might as well have ran straight to a police station or hospital instead of making up that even dumber plan

why was the villian so onetrack minded hes supposedly so smart and farsighted but doesnt stop to think that hes  bent on killing them and the only reason  see his demise is because of that like he had that convo with dakota in her dream but didnt stop to think about what was happening

the girls actress showed remorse for a second when she said that she didnt know theyd be teenagers but then never again like she even turned all the lights green without saying anything even though something like that could  a bunch of innocent bystanders 

also what happens to her after villain dies she was such a random character and was never mentioned during or after the climax 

the whole climax of the film on the rooftop was so weird also how did she get paralyzed by falling in the water did i miss something and it looked like the firework hit her hand not her face
 
madame web more like madame water she fell and sunk in water 3 times like she was kevin costners long lost daughter in waterworld

tiny detail lol but when dakota was wearing her sunglasses after going blind professor x on us at the end you could see her blue unharmed eyes through them no blindness cgi that they had during the climax
how  annoying was that scene weird without being campy but how annoying was the kung pow chicken bless you math girl like imagine she does that every second id say syonara real fast if i was them

all in all i didnt understand the point of this movie it showed us nothing it didnt show us what the villain did after he got the spider and how he gotdeveloped his powers that couldve been interesting so they had to keep it out it didnt show anything that happened after they defeated him not getting their powers or anything dakota had basically no  powers and was physically defeated the first time she used it like what was the point of this  i really like dakota johson by the way actually she was the only good part about the movie she brought some light to this  even adam scott was somehow boring in this i dont know how thats possible 
like i wish this movie had the balls to do something anything tried to be funny or tried to be serious or tried to be an action or tried to be scary or tried to be campy instead it tried nothing 2 hours of nothing id honestly rather watch the elite 50 shades trilogy again before watching this again imo they were genuinely better movies than this

now that ive vomited these 2 long  comments i can rest easier tonight",2024-02-15
so the film features a peruvian spiderman named santiago who is the leader of a secret tribe of spiderpeople living in the amazon rainforest who on finding cassie webb’s dying mother helped her give birth before sending her baby cassie into the american foster care system like cassie’s mother was alone in the amazon when she died so santiago would have had to have flown to new york himself to do this he tells the baby he will tell her about her history in the future and cassie eventually goes back to peru thirty years later meeting with santiago now wearing an ascot who shows her the opening scene of the film with no new information via a pool,2024-02-15
ruhruvian red raggy,2024-02-15
he was my favorite character in the film thats santiago a member of las arañas a secret indigenous tribe from the peruvian jungle with spider abilities played by josé maría yazpik a mexican guy because eh close enough las arañas dress two different ways in spiderman suits woven entirely from reeds leaves bark and branches or in ascots,2024-02-16
"he was able to perfectly recreate digital images of the three girls from his dreams and then they were able to deage them to their exact current age somehow 
figuring out dakotas real identity seems easier than that",2024-02-15
also they all have the thing above the windshield that matches the plate and the one in the movie accurately has that too so popping off the plate was big dumb twice over,2024-02-17
there are none the protagonist defeats the villain by crawling backwards to ensure the s from a a falling pepsi sign hits him before she is suddenly blinded and paralysed by a firework to the face that she was also paralysed is not conveyed well and no character onscreen herself included acknowledges that she has been blinded so when the final scene shows her in a wheelchair wearing sunglasses it is more confusion when did that happen than anything else,2024-02-15
"mandy in your top 4

 yeah",2024-02-15
theyre basically trying to do the classic goblin you cant save them both at once thing its during the big final set piece on a giant neon pepsi sign on top of a fireworks factory and the scaffolding around it is crumbling and theyre all on it at one point it shifts and all the girls fall down in their respective areas and the villain says you cant save all three of them but lucky for her the one power the peruvian told her shed develop is to be in multiple places at once so she uses that power and a three force ghosts of her go to the girls and basically lend a hand and are like come on get up and then the main dakota still standing there in front of the villain gets punched in the stomach and all the force ghosts disappear,2024-02-15
she helpfully knocked ezekiels grenade under a random taxi sat in the intersection so someone other than her friends blew up also,2024-04-01
call it,2024-02-15
yeah maybe it was a bad look having her tell the 3 random teenage girls shed gathered in a motel to all makeout with the pillow,2024-04-01
riley keough was  fantastic in the lodge it’s just a slow burn indie horror so no one saw it dont you dare compare her to dakota johnson,2024-02-18

there’s ndas associated with projects  as long as someone is a part of the industry it can come back to bite you in some form  but i will pass your request along,2024-02-19
she had glasses on too,2024-02-15
and a ponytail what is that,2024-02-16
and she’s supposed to be 16 don’t let the writers of this near a high school,2024-02-19
"sony wanted to have her in the movie but also were too afraid that by her being in the movie families would hesitate to bring their kids

so they opted for the worst decision that could be made and appeased no one",2024-02-16
this is definitely a reddit  moment she’s portrayed as minor yall dial it back some the table dancing scene was already weird and inappropriate and totally unnecessary,2024-02-17
"no i think what this guy is saying is right esp after she fired her management agency she knows this a heavy  to her brand

i would be  she already had built herself up after 50 shades tho i would say that movie was actually a positive for her but this would clearly crater her career

i know she can go attempt to go about it like ryan reynolds or robert pattinson but i think shes a more serious actor so she would hate being made fun of as it affects her bottom line",2024-02-15
does no one remember him from harry potter,2024-02-16
i am convinced that the original cut of the film had him literally turn out to be her father and that the main part of the future he was seeking to prevent was her being blind and paralysed not just him being dead since the actor kept talking about how the character was morally ambiguous in interviews,2024-02-15
the first half hour and the last half hour are laughably bad the middle hour is pretty rough,2024-02-15
" i want this to be laughably bad

it was i rate on a scale of 10 through 10 with 5 through 5 being boringly bad madame web was like a 8",2024-02-17
"honestly if it stuck out so much that people are mentioning it on the internet then it was successful  it doesn’t matter if your product is associated with a good movie or a bad movie as long as people think about your brand it’s a win

maybe they signed a contract and cant back out,2024-02-15
the advertising worked ive though more about pepsi today than i have in months and i didnt even see the movie,2024-02-15
hey but think of it like this…pepsi got the final  shot…pepsi is actually the real hero of this movie,2024-02-16
unfortunately yes,2024-02-15
i want to know if it’s worse than green lantern,2024-02-15
i haven’t seen the movie but i’m willing to bet the lone ben affleckbruce wayne scene is better than madame web,2024-02-15
the flash was actually decent not original ground breaking decent but decent,2024-02-15
i actually enjoyed flash maybe because of my rock bottom expectations for the old dcu but i thought it was pretty good,2024-02-15
i don’t even think the flash should even be mentioned alongside a film like this that movie has flaws but you can at least tell that the people involved cared about the project nobody involved in madame web seemed to care it was like they weren’t even trying lol,2024-02-15
didnt laugh as much with flash tbh,2024-02-15
easily,2024-02-15
flash had at least an understandable plot characters you actually gave a  about and even heart in places,2024-02-18
the whole pepsi logo fireworks climax was a choice i expected britney spears to show up with her back up dancers,2024-02-22

someone here mentioned that sony only needs to release a spiderman movie every 5 years and 9 months to keep the rights they just released spiderman across the spiderverse in june 2023 so they dont need to release another spiderman movie until 2029,2024-02-15

why would she even have a passport from what we can tell she has no life outside of being a paramedic in queens i would’ve rather seen a shot of her waiting at the post office for 6 hours to get a passport rather than any of the scenes we got in the movie,2024-02-17
since she actually had some handle on her powers at that point im presuming it was done by very careful timing and standing in the queues with the most zonedout border guards just basically save  the security checks this line no this one  no this one ah toddler having a meltdown in 4 minutes,2024-02-18
how did she go to peru spend an extensive time there finding this location and come back to ny on the same night she left,2024-02-17
the story was on the front page of the paper within hours of the girls being kidnapped lol jameson is so fast so i’m assuming they’d figured out who took them by that point if they knew the girls they’d easily be able to identify her as well,2024-02-19
these are questions the writers should’ve asked themselves,2024-02-16
"right the 4 dceu movies last year i would classify as camp

mw is so much worse than that",2024-02-15

yeah waiting for your character to develop at the literal last second of a movie is truly the way to go,2024-02-21
some things are just too selfevident,2024-02-22
thats right i totally forgot about that line  that being said she takes all the other strays to her new apartment but not the cat too  seems like a missed opportunity imo,2024-02-21
sorry for your loss ,2024-02-20

actually after seeing this i appreciate the weaker mcu films like ethernals or shang chi even more,2024-02-20

it’s weird that wiki said 2004 maybe that just meant released to radio i didn’t look at the details after i saw the date good for the movie for getting that right at least,2024-02-16
"i don’t disagree i personally enjoyed quantumania and even lt on rewatch but even if you were to think those movies were bad this is just objectively so far below that that it would have to rise your opinion of the others by comparison

i think there’s a degree of bandwagon hate for recent mcu stuff because it got so popular and quality fell to some extent but this movie deserves the bad reactions truly terrible",2024-02-16
"i didnt like the movies you mentioned but at least they were made properly the cgi issues are industry wide as well

yeah it wasnt in the zeitgeist of that era though you always hear songs from years ago on the radio not sure if that is what they were going for the album with toxic in it came out in 2003 but toxic itself wasnt released until jan 2004 but maybe it had airplay at the time i cant remember,2024-02-16

batgirl didnt have pepsi fu money so thats gonna be a no,2024-02-15
also madame webb isnt exactly popular even amongst comic book fans i wouldnt say hated but it not one people think about on the other hand batgirl is actually a character normal people are aware off to some degree and is popular with the fanbase quality aside it makes so much more sense to make and relese a batgirl movie than a madame webb movie,2024-02-17

originally it was supposed to take place in the 1990s from what i understand sony initially wanted madame web to take place in the same continuity as andrew garfields tasm movies but then they pivoted at some point to wanting it to take place in tom hollands continuity but they didnt remove all of the 1990s references",2024-03-13

given what they’ve seen him do i don’t think they’d have trouble believing “he thinks you’ll  him in the future” or even just “have you ever seen terminator sort of like that” she can definitely tell them without doing anything that would prevent them from getting their powers since she doesn’t even know that plus since they  him with the pepsi sign they changed the future anyway,2024-02-24

this i disagree with i saw it thrice in the same day and on my second viewing with friends and a pitcher of beer i honestly had a great time the first viewing was torture for sure but the second viewing was genuinely hilarious i was absolutely losing my  at every technical inefficiency every line reading it truly to me does fall into that same camp as the room which i go and see pretty regularly in theaters still

the third viewing however i had had enough and bailed after the hour mark",2024-02-21
"pretending i wasnt pretending anything i really enjoyed it you know its possible for people to like things you dont and it was about a team of spiderwomen you see them fighting in their spider suits a bunch of times in the movie just because its a nontraditional superhero movie and does an origin story in a different kind of way i dont think that makes it less of a superhero movie again like in my original post its like terminator how john connor is going to be a resistance leader in the future but you follow him before he becomes that knowing what hes going to become  i wouldnt say that makes john connor less interesting just because we dont follow him being a military leader for the whole movie

i explained pretty clearly why i liked the movie and why it connected to me so much youre welcome to disagree with me but i dont get this idea that if someone likes something you didnt they have to be pretending people have different opinions and thats okay this is the kind of movie i enjoy i also liked batman and robin back in the 90s and people crapped all over that back then too i liked the fourth indiana jones movie and people still  all over that but i dont understand why i also liked last years morbius okay id say about a 35 although nowhere near as much as madame web for every movie thats made there are always some people who enjoy it you know these movies are made with an audience in mind clearly its not the one on here but they dont just make these for nobody

if i had to guess id assume and i am just assuming so correct me if im wrong a lot of people on here enjoy the mcu and that style of superhero movie and dont like that this wasnt that at all for me its the opposite im so tired of the mcu at this point and i like it when i see something new",2024-02-16
i like cheesy movie villains i agree it did sound like he was dubbed over maybe the actor doesnt speak english no idea but i liked that he was just a bad guy through and through you dont have any sympathy for him its just yeah this guy is an  hes gonna  the spiderwomen i hope he does get crushed by a big s also he doesnt really talk that much does he i feel like we saw way more of him in the suit as spiderman than we saw of him just doing his day job and when hes in the spiderman suit he doesnt talk at all just acts which i thought was pretty intimidating,2024-02-16

what you described is what i got from the trailers i havent seen the movie but i guessed the scene with them in the suits was the bad guys vision of the future when they  him  youll notice when he fights them in the trailer he has grey hair which he doesnt have in the current timeline  all the scenes with the girls in the trailer in the current timeline have them being helpless which indicates the film will end without them ever suiting up or getting powers,2024-02-15

"thats all that movie had that was memorable though the memes that movie had should have been saved for this movie it was the actual ridiculous cringefest while morbius was mostly just boring as

doesn’t this create a paradox if she got the information that she needed from the vision why did her future self go to the dinner why didn’t her future self receive the same vision,2024-02-16
"actually the scene opens with a long shot of her watching scrooge on tv before she ever gets up she then says sometime thing like sorry scrooge you cant change the future before the microwave beeps

wait theyre not doing that spider  thing from the comics are they like where the different spider people are different aspects of the same spider  ive seen some very negative opinions on that storyline so im honestly quite surprised that they would even adapt that,2024-02-16
can you clarify something that doesn’t sound like the movie was suggesting that peter was committing cultural appropriation that’s your conclusion based on the existence of these characters correct,2024-02-16
the funniest part about this is that when dakota johnson later goes back to the amazon and the leader of the tribe is just dressed like a typical person,2024-02-19
"the thing is this storyline is from the comics and was a kore change people hated when it was done back in 2004

"i do laugh that apparently everyone who has ever got tangential spiderpowers over apparently hundreds of years at this point all independently come up with the exact same design for their supersuits  

  las arañcas all have various red paintvine spiderman design suits even with the unnecessary eye holes  
  ezekial despite never actually meeting las arañcas designs an almost 11 modernised grey version  
  madame web and her webbing trio all have varying plays on the spiderman suitinsignia despite mw being the only one to see las arañcas and being blind at this point and nobody ever having met peter parker as he doesnt exist for quite a while yet the only person they would have met with a similar suit is ezekiel who i doubt theyd want to imitate in any wayshapeform seeing as hes literally the guy that tried to  them as children  
  peter parker then 1520 years later despite never knowing about the web sisters nor ezekiel nor las arañcas comes up with pretty much the exact same design  

i get why multiverse peter parkers all end up at near enough the same suit because theyre the same person under varying circumstances but it repeatedly happening independently within the same storyline is kind of hilarious",2024-04-01
huhhh i kinda need to see this movie now that sounds unbelievably ,2024-02-15

ah right i forgot which came first between endgame and iw but i dont think removing dark phoenix from that list really changes anything about the actual point,2024-02-15
i mean personally id say dark phoenix is the worse movie but to each their own either way theres still no shortage of bad superhero movies,2024-02-16
"spiderverse came out in 2023 as well as tmnt if you want to count it obviously theyre animated but theyre still comic book movies for 2024 weve got deadpool and joker 2 which id say have decent shots at being good

but to your point yes  its been an off couple of years but its also worth noting the few years preceding iwendgame were major outliers

i mean look at 2009 its pretty much all duds watchmen is probably the best and 2010 wasnt much better even if you jump forward to 2015 the only standout is antman which is hardly toptier and its next to the disappointing aou and the absolute  fant4stic 

the hit ratio really isnt much different now than it has been for decades we just got spoiled for a solid run of 3 or 4 years and even then we had movies like suicide squad and justice league",2024-02-20

it’s rumored that was the original plot then sony scrapped it because originally they decided it was a prequel to garfield’s spiderman before changing it to holland’s then realized the timing was off so they scrapped it,2024-02-15
that subplot was cut but the characters were not so they are more there for the sake of being there more than a few were cut,2024-02-15
" i thought the whole point of the movie is that the villain is trying to  mary parker so she doesn’t give birth to peter

that was allegedly the original plot which was changed when it was realised setting it up in 2003 wouldnt link it to any of the other spiderman films sony made

the even funnier thing is that changing the targets to the future spiderwomen could have made sense in a way that engages with spiderman lore and couldve easily set up a legitimate franchise option for sony

the main villain is ezekiel sims who in the comics almost exclusively exists to introduce the concept of spider totems multiversal spiderpowered individuals to the audience

have his premonitions be about seeing the inheritors invading earth due to the increased number of spider totems between ezekiel and the 3 spiderwoman that allows a legitimate motive for ezekiel to want to  them in a way thats not just theyll  me in the future 

that way you can introduce the multiversal vampiric hunters and it leads almost directly into a comicaccurate live action adaptation of spiderverse which was the inheritors embarking on their great hunt",2024-02-17
maybe im dumb but i didnt even get that was meant to be mary parker and just kept thinking why is emma roberts playing a random pregnant woman in the film,2024-02-18

of course it would have made more sense to have the 3 girls have their powers but it would have made the move more expensive so you do 2 scenes and pack them in the trailers",2024-02-16
reportedly this was the original plotline but they had to scrap that and do extensive reshoots so the villain is now trying to stop the girls from becoming spiderwomen,2024-02-20
yeah lol,2024-02-24
evil spiderman was trying to  the girls because he had a vision of the future where they all had spider powers and they  him note they do not have spider powers in the movie he just thinks theyre going to get them in the future the girls were staying with ben because madame web had to go to peru for a week to learn about time travel mary was staying with ben because richard was on a business trip in asia,2024-02-15

the problem w johnson compared to pattinson and reynolds is that i dont think ive ever seen a comment anywhere saying she was exceptional in anything after 50 shades the second that pattinson got announced as batman there were a lot of doubters but there were also people talking about how amazing of an actor he was in all those indie films his charisma is also kinda unmatched both on screen and in interviews its partly why him  on twilight actually worked because he was funny and likeable about it hes never comes off as overdoing it reynolds is in that rdj camp of over overcharismaing about it but it still works most of the time johnson is kinda just unfunny and wooden all around but i guess well see whether or not she was wooden because she lacked the right director since song has proven herself as a director itll be hard to hide her lack of acting when shes put up against pascal and evans,2024-02-15

yeah if youre as big as coke or pepsi you just advertise for awareness rather than trying to get your product known or something those types of companies will always have enough customers they just advertise to entice someone like you just mentioned to think about getting one when they already like it it is to keep market share up as well because if you were to suddenly see pepsi stop doing ads but coke does everything people would be like whats up with pepsi maybe not a lot of people but enough in their eyes and despite how much random  happens in big companies that makes no sense especially in marketing they probably have done a costbenefit analysis on reducing the amount of ads,2024-02-15
what soda are you going to get,2024-02-15
maybe cocacola paid them to put pepsi in the movie,2024-02-15
"yes green lantern at least felt like its trying to be something and its got the sick sequence on the alien planet plus ryan reynolds at least has charm

this has none of the above",2024-02-15
green lantern was bad but there are a few sequences that are good and ryan reynolds was not too bad,2024-02-15
yeah i don’t understand how people grade super hero movies  everyone seems to understand they’re not supposed to be tarkovsky movies and happily forgives the nonsense plot of endgame but then treats a perfectly serviceable movie like the flash like it was the room,2024-02-15

"yes but they dont hit as hard thats literally the definition of mediocre a few good ones a few bad ones

"i thought loki was pretty bad in season 2 it felt like loki was a completely different character for the version that jumps off straight after the events of the first avengers movie 

moon knight was boring af i couldnt get through it same with wandavision

shang chi was pretty forgettable

gotg 3 and no way home were pretty good though",2024-02-16
"mmm i would have to disagree zlatan and messi are zlatan and messi forever 

and because of the skill gap they still dominated

marvel is not dominating nothing to be ashamed of to be honest most of us only really have 10 good years of anything any bandartistactorathletefighter only really have a prime 10 year run in them

theyve lost relevance as the zeitgeist is switching back from losers saving the world to winners fighting each  other for control

atst atst,2024-02-16
i mean in that its badness stems from several key conceptual choices early on in production that impact everything about the movie why is a 28 year old playing a 17 year old  why do the super important future spider people not do anything relevant in the plot,2024-02-15
the baby shower scene was high art,2024-02-24
 how did she get from remote peru where she was born to a new york city orphanage,2024-02-17
see that might have been an interesting scene to i dont know put in the movie,2024-02-18
no she was in peru for a week it just happened she returned at the same time mary parker went into labor and the girls subsequently showed their faces in public speaking of which why did they have to go with ben and mary why couldn’t they have stayed home realistically wherever they were how could ben have protected them from bootleg spiderman,2024-02-17
good point i missed the front page of the paper lol i was probably still trying to make sense of the craziness of the subway scenes,2024-02-19
"i think its intentionally a joke once any of the spidermans didnt want to appear

not the worse use of a cranberries song in a recent movie at least,2024-02-15
nah they definitely baby mouthed his face a few times like the superman reshoots in justice league,2024-02-20
can’t be worse than madame webb apparently,2024-02-15
nah itll be timothee chalamet or someone with zach braff as either the villain or rhinos dad,2024-02-20
i would recommend cha cha real smooth i think this was a good role for her i overall enjoyed that movie largely because of her came out in 2022 and streaming on apple ,2024-02-19

"the album came out in november but still after the time in which this movie was set it was the fourth single released in january and didn’t hit radio until then

and the dj  called her an up and coming artist like nobody knew who britney spears was in 2003",2024-02-16
they don’t actually get their powers or costumes in the movie it’s only in a brief 60 second long vision that madame web sees,2024-02-15

"thats a different issue a lot of  didnt make sense in this movie but

im guessing since shes an emt she gave a good explanation especially with what happened to her its better than a random person stealing an ambulance

and the kidnapping id guess the girls explained it to the nypd",2024-02-18
lol yes haha k thought i missed some bad easter egg,2024-02-19
aside from airport security not being alerted the most confusing thing to me is how she could get back into the city without switching cars,2024-02-26
same i saw it the saturday after it released it was so bad i went back to see it again immediately with some friends and had a pitcher of beer throughout and it was even funnier the second time i ended the night with going to see it a third time but after halfway through  had had enough and found out a girl id been seeing was at the same theater so i ditched it but the 2 and half times seeing it in the same day was something ive never done for another movie ever,2024-03-18
thats true i just went to my 5th screening of it last week and will probably go again next month we didnt need to bring spoons because the people behind us threw so many that we had plenty land on top of us,2024-02-16
its absolutely worth watching for all the wrong reasons lmk if you did end up going to that matinee or not xd,2024-02-21

"my interpretation was she had the vision of what would have happened if she decided to go to the diner he would have been there and told her that stuff and after the vision she was satisfied with having the fractured information from the vision and decided not to leave the hotel

bad movie but i found it more mediocre bad than entertaining bad",2024-02-18
nope morbius is still worse,2024-02-22
id go as far to say that this is even worse than that leaked precgi version of xmen origins wolverine,2024-02-21

"is that the only movie marvel has ever released

who knows maybe if marvel releases a few more the marvels sony will stop making these bits of faff",2024-02-15
but that’s the thing… this movie tried to be good thsts why they teased the costumes so little they were setting up a trilogy lol,2024-02-18
"for me at least with catwoman it’s clearly distanced itself away from the batman lore it’s so far removed from batman that it’s not even a sin  the cgi in catwoman is horrible but that was actually 2004  it’s bad in a “boring i’ll never watch it again” way 

madam web tries to do way too much and create an incredible amount of plot holes  the camera work is bad  the story is bad at every turn it’s a spiderman film with a baby spiderman and we still don’t even get to see any actual connection to spiderman  it’s the 4th installment of sonys spidey universe of marvel movies and they keep getting worse  the tone is all over the place balloons pop at a baby shower and cassie offends mary parker cassie doesn’t react to cgi shrapnel inches from her head the villain sucks at delivering lines   his motive is a bad dream a lot of the cgi in the movie actually looks like it’s from 2003",2024-02-20
"i can somewhat agree with that

id rather watch a 110 movie like madame web than a 510 movie like black adam",2024-03-18
kraven is a pretty major character and has a famous arc involving killing spiderman,2024-02-18
every word she said had to be said to them,2024-02-15
they were absolutely hilarious so glad this movie has the most egregious use of adr ive ever heard in a big budget studio release made it that much more memorable,2024-02-23

except entertwined with an open loop timer wimey story because cassidy realizes she can change the future kind of a cool premise if only they had executed it better,2024-02-22

more comic book accurate look,2024-02-21
you have to sign this contract first though,2024-02-17
i guess the road was a farther trip than directly through the woods,2024-02-16
its the only thing that makes sense,2024-03-04

who are these bozos how have they failed to accidentally write something good",2024-02-15
"and dont forget dracula untold

but in all honesty theyve been mostly bad but not 100 bad they were only story writers on power rangers someone else did the screenplay and the movie imo wasnt that bad and quite fun to watch plus they were also the writers and showrunners on netflixs lost in space which actually got better with each season",2024-02-15
thats what i noticed why would you hire a two time razzie nominated screenwriter theres something weird about this is their intention to get into the too bad its good category is it easier to make people curious about bad movies than good ones the studios must realize that after 4 horrendous films those guys are not gonna give you a good screenplay i also dont think they can be cheaper than a new writer,2024-02-15
power rangers was decent cmon,2024-02-15
yes but the studio will not be the ones realizing that net loss ,2024-02-15
power rangers was legitimately good even if the rest are stinkers,2024-02-19
no its not its cheap talent that delivers a consistent result and its usually profitable which is why they keep getting work thats the opposite of throwing 10s of millions in the toilet ,2024-02-15
power rangers was alright tbh,2024-02-16
hollywood is about who you know rather than what you know people will hire their buddies repeatedly regardless of their track record,2024-03-16
whoa whoa they wrote story credit only for power rangers which given how much of that story is just day of the dumpster again mostly means they wrote the first draft and the 2012 oscar winner for best original screenplay came in and wrote a better one,2024-03-17
none of those movies was that bad,2024-03-23
i thought gods of egypt was fun ,2024-02-16
i looked for 45 minutes just now going through my youtube history and trying out searches and couldnt find it again   i watched it around the time morbius came out sorry i couldnt be of more help,2024-02-16
also the real money doesnt come until it gets made,2024-03-27
they did it was called rat race 2001 and it was beautiful,2024-02-15
unfortunately none of those things would exist without money,2024-02-15
they could call it billy and the cloneasaurus,2024-02-15
eeehh…make a good movie even an artistic creative movie like the spiderverse movies and the money will come make good art and make good money same with a lot of categories,2024-02-22
everyone goes into this industry caring about their legacy and wanting to make art but eventually most just get to the point where they need to pay their bills and keep their health insurance,2024-03-27
yeah but a lot of that is simply because he needs to be to some extent just for basic plot points thats not quite the same as surprise the entire universe revolves around you and you specifically,2024-02-15
"i havent seen that one  but his parents were secret agents    that was established before garfield was even born

have you not seen the second one this is pretty much shown that not anyone can be spiderman and they actually get real pissy when a peter parker doesn’t get his powers,2024-04-02
because he was never supposed to be a super smart gifted teenager that is the modern take he was just a smart kid almost a stereotypical nerd,2024-02-15
they’re obviously talking in the sense of being destined to be spiderman instead of happening by chance,2024-02-21
don’t be obtuse,2024-02-15
i dont think they felt the need to do that because we all know who it is they wanted to leave it as a winking reference rather than explicitly name him i dont know why they chose to do that because the rest of the movie is about as subtle as a nuclear explosion but it did feel like an intention choice,2024-02-21
the creator of the character on seeing the trailer having not been informed his character was being adapted said he thought they just merged ezekiel with morlun on seeing the film i would say he was probably right,2024-02-15
"it’s the homecoming comic book right ezekiel is great because he came with the whole mythology blablabla exactly when peter is back to his old school now as a chemistry teacher peter is a man of science with the power to educate and the responsibility of his students… there’s something like yinyang dynamic

my only concern is about ezekiel background and character design being a massive spideroldman without the web shots looks like a beast impersonator",2024-02-17
its been a while since i read jms run on spiderman but wasnt ezekiel a mentor figure and a good guy,2024-02-17

these two new people  outside of power rangers where they did try hard although it was ghost written by judd lynn as well supposedly  are making these movies seemingly seriously with people on the production sas the lead actors not really getting the joke",2024-02-16
 it is impressive in the sense that every single one of those movies is a dumpster fire,2024-02-16
coyote vs acme would like to have a word,2024-02-23
i think they know they’re not capable of making something of quality,2024-02-15
they have a lot of spidey stuff in the pipeline doesnt mean much some will get made some wont i believe they have to have something in production within a year or 18month window or the rights revert to marvel,2024-02-17
they love to slam on the brakes when they turn too like come on,2024-02-23

source reddit comments,2024-02-15
 was here,2024-02-21
how is she going to google something that isn’t public lol the deals are well done when leaks and public information comes out she probably was tricked into thinking it was a sony  marvel partnership like the other spiderman films,2024-02-15
"gwyneth paltrow was on jon favreaus cooking show as a guest and she admitted that shes not sure which marvel movies shes in so she just pitches up and films her parts but she has no idea which film they are going to be in

then said she doesnt even watch the films if i remember correctly",2024-02-15
matt smith seemed to think the same thing about morbius he said that when he got the offer he called karen gillan because she did some of those movies and asked her what her experience was with the guardians of the galaxy movies,2024-02-15
dude you’d be surprised how little actors are involved other than showing up on time if they can even manage that and knowing their lines once they do decide to show up even then they mostly just show up grab the sides and memorize 5 mins before we call em to set actors ain’t  lol,2024-02-15
brian cox told fallon that he thought he signed on to be a bond villain but it turned out to be a host for a bond show,2024-02-15
id wager over half the ga has no idea that sonyverse marvel movies and the mcu are different entities people are pointing out theyre seeing comments about how people are citing this movie as another marvel disaster not realizing its not the same franchise theres no reason to believe actors who are even less involved in the fandom are any more in the know,2024-02-15
"dakota not knowing it wasn’t a mcu project but a sony ‘marvel’ movie when she signed on is just not a good excuse for me 

i fully understand most big time actors don’t keep up with superhero movies and don’t know anything about comics but i’m just saying is dakota lazy and can’t research what she’s going to be a part of  i

i’m not talking about madame web research cuz obviously that wouldn’t make sense but literally a search on sony studios and their marvel projects 
dakota could have easily found out they had a bad track record even this is something an agent should know and told her too but clearly failed 

so in the end i think dakota just didn’t care and thought ‘it’s disney mcu and a good pay day’ and took the role and her agent didn’t tell her any different oh well…",2024-02-17
"bill murray did the garfield movie thinking it was written by the coen brothers   


it was written by joel cohen not joel coen",2024-02-15

it was apparently a completely different script when she was hired ,2024-02-15
it just happened to brian cox he signed onto some game show with james bond in the title thinking hed be the next bond villain woops,2024-02-15
i cant believe she didnt realize what film she was doing it feels very tina louise getting her  on gilligans island,2024-02-15
i remember bill murray had said he signed up for the garfield movie because he was told it was directed by a coen but wasn’t specified that it wasn’t the coen brothers i don’t know if he was just doing a bit or not though,2024-02-15
from what ive heard thats happened to several actors in sony marvel movies,2024-03-15
another famous example of this is that bill murray did the garfield movie because he thought it was written by one of the cohen brothers but instead it was joel cohen,2024-02-15
its what happens when you dont actually enjoy movies youre just in it for the pay literally anyone who watches films could have steered her clear,2024-02-17
this was her biggest film in awhile venom is actually profitable its easy to forget movie stars need work,2024-02-20
she has said that the script changed drastically after she signed on and she fired her people so while i dont put any stock into she thought she was making an mcu movie idea it is pretty clear that behind the scenes this thing went south pretty quick,2024-02-15
they didnt just hide it from her the postcredits scene in morbius shows that theyre actively trying to push their movies into the mcu its utterly transparent how desperate they are for marvel money,2024-02-15

to be fair they did put out two of the best marvel movies ever made its just live action theyve failed on,2024-02-15
" how disney havent taken action at this point is ridiculous

because they cant sony owns the film rights to spiderman  related characters disney had to sign a licensing deal to get tom holland in the mcu and his trilogy are sony coproductions specifically because disney does not own the rights and sony can always walk away from those deals like they threatened to in between ffh and nwh theres nothing in the contract that says the movies have to meet certain benchmarks just that they have to begin production and release them within certain timetables and as long as they meet those deadlines the rights stay in sonys hands indefinitely 

i mean i agree sony has put out nothing but clunkers in liveaction for a long time but legally theres literally nothing that can be done about it",2024-02-17

maybe bc shes never been a good actor all ive ever seen was her bumble around and chris pratt try to make a movie franchise essentially by himself with cgi dinosaurs,2024-02-15
it definitely feels like the movie we saw was done in post production after everything was filmed all of the villain’s dialogue was adr and the entire thing was just non sensical,2024-02-18
dude watch entourage you can see the exact type of scenario of this going down because those people seem truly oblivious i know it’s just a satire but it feels pretty on brand for most on it,2024-02-17
exactly not sure why people are making excuses for her before you start working at a company you research the company before you sign on,2024-02-16

"eh i think a lot of people including pro critics are more reluctant to criticize actors because unlike directorswriterscrew you actually see their face onscreen and theres more awareness that this a person who could be hurt etc

but this is a business and the reality is that everyone involved in the production is a person who could be hurt its true that johnson has not been wellserved by her scripts but a big part of that is the best directors and writers dont particularly want to work with her because shes not that good of an actress in madame web there is bad acting on display which is related to but not totally a function of the bad screenwriting and direction if you want to see how a great actor can salvage a poorly written character check out the first two iron man movies if she wants to break out of this cycle she needs to get good",2024-02-17

the visions of the girls having powers are from the villain and those visions are why hes trying to  the 3 regular teen girls this is the entire plot ben and mary are irrelevant side characters that could be anyone and have no bearing on the plot other than madame web working as a paramedicbeing close with ben the pepsi sign is what kills the villain at the end of the film and then in the closing madame web also has the visions of the girls getting powers which confirms they do get the powers just not in the film nor is it revealed how they get the powers

you can tell the film originally was more than it was but got cut for reasons unbeknown but if you go into watching it detached from the spiderman universe like i did its a perfectly middle of the road film that should easily appeal to people who dont even like superheros as the superheroness is very subdued

seriously though i dont think anyone giving it 1s 2s and 3s out of 10 are being at all genuine it is far from that bad lowest grade id consider valid would be 4 and i still think that would be harsh",2024-02-15

it’s a creative choice that has utterly hilarious implications in the larger “cinematic” “lore” it’s not my “conclusion” it’s established that this ancient spider worshipping tribe no longer exists and their traditions directly translate into peter parker’s costume design

she’s probably pregnant cuz of  idk tho,2024-02-15
i’d probably take the movie about webb trying to save the three future spider girls than trying to shoehorn in the parkers for a nothing plot point,2024-02-15
wouldnt surprise me if theres a version in someones computer where the baby is explicitly named as peter parker,2024-02-15

i haven’t seen the movie the rumors going around the movie before it was released was that it was going to have a terminatoresque storyline hence why ben and mary parker were characters in the movie the movie still sounded unnecessary but that’s an interesting plot point after reading the spoilers it sounded like there was zero reason to have ben and mary parker in the movie which apparently is the case,2024-02-25

pattinson is definitely dynamic and reynolds works best as a clown but she probably cant and wont want to pivot into something like that at this stage in her career

indies are also notorious with bad pay and semi bad work environments and on the other side shes also getting flanked by the hollywood female age problem

"they didnt just hide it from her the postcredits scene in morbius shows that theyre actively trying to push their movies into the mcu its utterly transparent how desperate they are for marvel money

at this point wouldnt it make more sense if they just did an extension deal with marvel studios so they can use the library of spiderman related characters instead

because clearly their spiderman less universe is not working except for the venom movies",2024-02-15
theyll do anything except make good movies,2024-02-17

this isn’t relevant i didn’t say she was good on snl or any live tv venue we were talking about whether she’s a good actor in general for the things most big actors act in

i said snl isn’t a normal live performance venue and being bad at it has zero bearing on one’s abilities in a medium where they get a bunch of takes of every single scene  that is every tv show and movie we’ve ever watched or she’s ever been in",2024-02-15
"for context the show snl is entirely written rehearsed and performed in a week the host helps write the material gives input they can’t rehearse until it’s written they do the dress rehearsal in the two hours before the show airs and cut it down to 90 minutes for the televised show by getting rid of the jokes or skits that the audience didn’t laugh at during rehearsal then they do it all again immediately on live tv

it’s not even a good indicator of lack of ability to act under normal live audience circumstances because this is a tiny fraction of the time any live stage actor would have to get the same amount of material right and that’s fine because that’s how snl is supposed to be

snl has literally never ever been a bastion of high quality top tier acting by its hosts it’s just about a recurring cast acting with a popular celebrity who does what they can in the absurdly rushed snl format

sorry i’ve been bizarrely into snl recently",2024-02-15
i liked her in the lost daughter peanut butter falcon and suspiria,2024-02-15
she got out acted in a bit part in jump street by some rando talkin bout finger poppin assholes  her main claim to fame is fifty shades of old lady softcore   not saying she will never be good in anything ever but shes a nepo baby and it shows,2024-02-16
shes great in peanut butter falcon and bad times at the el royale ,2024-02-15
she was good in suspiria though mia goth stole the show,2024-02-15
"what has she been good in

her 5 minutes in the social network with timberlake were entertaining",2024-02-17
i just think people are only now starting to realize that shes not actually that good i feel like she has a face that when you glance by quickly something in your brain just goes ah i guess i just saw another hollywood starlet cool but i feel like people are starting to look again and people just kinda see a drab unexciting person,2024-02-19
too many people confuse “i am attracted to her” with “she’s good”,2024-02-15

its just a completely different skill set than acting in a movie some people can do both but most cant having comedic timing with very little rehearsal or prep time and doing it all in one take is really  hard,2024-02-15

for the same reason they cancelled the mcu cut of morbius where the newscaster on television talking about vampires and peter parker was j k simmons’ j jonah jameson and michael keaton’s vulture was morbius’ cellmate who kept talking about the blip which sony was allowed to have be mentioned due to the term being introduced in spiderman far from home it no longer made sense with their current plan,2024-02-15

ok that actually looks really good i’m gonna watch it and reevaluate my opinion,2024-02-18
i see that one gets brought up occasionally when asked about her good roles there never seems to be the universal love that pattinson gets tho the hype around pattinson being an amazing actor was pretty insane at the time saw some people say hes one of the best working actor of his generation and was on track to be among your leos de niro pitt etc,2024-02-16

its because a lot of low level alisters will do indie films for the paycheck and dont feel like putting work in  they only get the sides the night before and some dont feel like memorizing after working a 12 hour day etc  so they just try to figure it out on the day  if you memorize based on the lines youre responding to you can learn really quick  people wanting their dialogue on cue cards isnt farfetched either some even use earpieces  im sure early in their careers or doing important films theyll put enough effort in but not every film is worthy of that  not for someone whos already secured a career,2024-02-20

yes but this was kevin feigesmarvels doing and their creative decisions not sony

sony has been trying to milk the rando roster of the few spidermanadjacent characters with hopes of duping people into thinking its the new marvel flick since this plan of operation started back when any marvel movie was guaranteed to explode the box office

venom is a massive staple and understandable that marvel would want to loophole use of him but morbius madem web etc is purely sonys desperate attempt to cash in and confuse audiences",2024-02-15

"as of right now marveldisney owns spiderman

incorrect

sony still owns spider man but has agreed to a limited picture deal whereby marveldisney has some say in how hes used with those films being disney coproductions in exchange for having him in the mcu  once that deal expires sony can do whatever they want with spiderman they just cant use any marveldisney properties  they can already make nonspiderman mcu films  they just dont want a second live action spiderman diluting their brand  

x200b

disney has no rights to kraven venom morbious or madam webb so sony running them into the ground is only damaging their own brand  

x200b

think about that crappy first fantastic four roger coreman film  marvel couldnt sue just cause it stunk  many films are  out just to keep the rights from reverting to their original owners  

x200b

 they do have movie rights

i shouldve clarified that this is what i meant  sony has distribution rights for spiderman in movies in perpetuity with a rights reversion clause  disney still owns the comic book version of spider man",2024-02-15
disney is definitely  but there is absolutely nothing they can do about it sony bought the film rights and as long as they make a film with any of the characters every few years they will hold them in perpetuity unless they  sell them they likely wont  with spiderman but they still need to make movies so they release something that they hope will at least make back the budget to extend the rights  another few years,2024-02-15
yeah i can imagine the frustration if these movies were just mediocre like the amazing spiderman films disney would probably be fine with it they did include garfield in no way home and i think it went pretty well but the spiderman universe movies are a laughingstock,2024-02-17

honestly i figured itd never work out this way into the spiderverse is their only good spiderman property left and the team behind it probably has enough power to tell sony to  if theyd try something like what i wrote above so any spiderman  story sony could come up with  that could be tied into that specific animated spiderverse wont be which is a good thing",2024-02-17

"and youre using sonys spiderman to justify marvel success

if you want to equate a sequel automatically making a bunch of money because the first movie was a wild success ie black panthress 2 guardians then i dont think youll ever be ready to hear that marvel hasnt technically been a success success since endgame you know the days were they were pumping hits after hits

and and my point is simply that youre a marvel shill doing selective comparisons to favor your position jumps straight to morbius and youre also pulling box office figures out of your 

now tom hollands spiderman does appear in marvel movies thanks to a special revenue sharing agreement they worked out with sony but venom morbius and this  have nothing to do with marvel studios 

venom 1 made almost 900 million worldwide

the marvels made 200 million worldwide

these are cheap cynical ploys by sony to draft off marvels success

sure 99 of people have no idea who writes a movie before they go see it but that doesnt mean a bad script cant  a movie you could market a movie perfectly but that wont stop a massive fall in the box office after opening weekend the audience doesnt need to know who wrote the bad movie to decide they arent going to go see a bad movie",2024-02-15
"yeah none of those movies made money thats not how it works marketing budgets are usually the same as production budget

if your movies budget was 150m and you made 150m you still lost money why because theaters take 4050 cut from each ticket these  goes up and down depending on the movies performance also the budget doesnt include the marketing costs 

in order for 150m movie to make a profit first the movie have to make 300m plus marketing costs this is breakeven everything above that is profit",2024-03-24

steve buscemi wasnt even on this planet during 911,2024-02-15
also the guy who voiced garfield was literally also the voice of a bill murray character in another cartoon so bill was kind of a perfect choice,2024-02-19

look i haven’t seen the movie but from what i gathered it sounds like they decided to have a film about a character who has the power of teaser trailers so they can stuff the movie full of teaser trailers a bit like bvs only they planned for the teasers from the get go,2024-02-15

the cpr dude is implied to have been hurt in some kind of explosion but he doesnt actually look injured and there are no other signs of destruction the car accident did involve webs friend driving an ambulance so it was at least related to the fire even then its not clear if theres even a patient in the back of the ambulance",2024-02-15

i saw wonka and hated virtually every second of it however an actually engaging movie like the greatest showman one of my all time favorites i like baby driver oppenheimer was like the movie equivalent to just getting the job done i saw everything everywhere all at once and fell asleep it was not fun in the slightest john wick was decent dungeons  dragons was fun overall yes i dont really like a story thats not meant to be fun i can enjoy a movie thats interesting like buried with ryan reynolds but im not going to spend my time on a movie like that about a completely unrelatable sequence of events thats also not fun and interesting",2024-02-15

since spiderman was originally in the morbius trailer and then keaton ends up in his universe at the end it was heavily hinted that garfield would be the one to face sony’s sinister six eventually i read recently that execs wanted either tom holland or andrew garfield to appear in kraven but i don’t think it panned out",2024-02-15
oh,2024-02-22
which ones,2024-02-15
if it was originally supposed to be andrews spidey at first then uncle ben really aged horribly,2024-02-15
"i literally told you two actors

 it let’s add some more

dakota johnson tagged marvel studios in her announcement post for madame webb she thought she was in the mcu sydney sweeney did the same

tyrese gibson did an interview where he said morbius was part of the mcu with the avengers",2024-02-15
"tagging marvel studios is not an admission of anything

tyresse gionson misspoke and sony literally quickly refuted the statement this also does not change the fact that tyresse would know the main production he was working under was not a marvel but sonycolumbia one",2024-02-15
"yes because you normally tag studios not involved with your movie when announcing your involvement

tyresse didn’t misspeak he thought he was don’t quickly refuted it because they had to

“is this film in the mcu”  “yes” is not misspeaking drop the  dude lol",2024-02-15
"“is this film in the mcu”  “yes” is not misspeaking drop the  dude lol

are you serious right now when youre wrong it is literally the definition of misspeaking transitive verb 1  to speak something such as a word incorrectly 2  to express oneself imperfectly or incorrectly

yes because you normally tag studios not involved with your movie when announcing your involvement

youre forming an opinion with little to no evidence as someone who supposedly works in film you have a startling lack of knowledge around how productions work its simply conjecture and would only point to an actor being completely ignorant not being purposefully misled",2024-02-15
"misspeaking implies he knew he wasn’t in the mcu and just said something wrong he didn’t do that he flat out said he was in the mcu with the avengers he believed that that’s not misspeaking

your dakota link also proves my point that she thought she was in the mcu did you even read it lol you don’t accidentally think you’re part of the mcu",2024-02-15
"misspeaking implies he knew he wasn’t in the mcu and just said something wrong

  dude i literally posted the definition for you",2024-02-15
"yes and the definition isn’t what you claimed

“express oneself insufficiently clearly or accurately”

tyrese expressed himself clearly he thought he was in the mcu that’s not misspeaking that’s being wrong

being wrong isn’t mispeaking",2024-02-15
"not only have you clearly not worked in film but you also clearly have no idea what youre talking about and are fumbling around simple definitions

tyrese misspoke about being in the mcu on a long media tour 

as i already said you would know who is doing the production on the film youre working on",2024-02-15
"“no one who works in film would ever not know what they’re working on”

lists a bunch of people who thought they were working with different studios and part of the mcu but weren’t

“okay but those don’t count cause it doesn’t prove they didn’t know”

dude shut the  lol",2024-02-15
least it didn’t take two seconds on google to find evidence to prove me wrong lol,2024-02-15
it did take two seconds i literally posted a link to sony refuting tyreses statement within a day because he misspoke,2024-02-15
which doesn’t disprove that he thought he was inthe  mcu when he joined the movie,2024-02-15
"again when joining the film he would know its sony pictures

youre a liar you dont work in film and ignorant an idiot",2024-02-15
yet madame webb cast also thought it was with marvel studios you’re really failing here dude it’s pathetic,2024-02-15
no they didnt whats pathetic is pretending youre in the film industry,2024-02-15
"so let me get this straight you think they knew the film was with a different marvel production company but when tagging the production companies they all accidentally tagged the wrong one and she also spoke to olson who was in a mcu movie to ask how it was even though she knew it was a different company

you’re reaching so  hard it’s impressive",2024-02-15
buddy they sign their checks ofc they knew it was a sony film,2024-02-15
"please just stop this is embarrassing you’ve failed to make any compelling argument outside “nu uh that doesn’t prove anything” i’ve listed tons of actors making it clear they thought they were in the mcu now it’s abundantly clear that sony isn’t super honest with things this is the company that literally lies with its marketing you don’t accidentally tag the wrong studio in your marketing post you don’t accidentally say you’re in the mcu with the avengers you don’t accidentally talk to actors in the mcu for advice

just stop",2024-02-15
"you’re ridiculous you’ve been cornered into basically going nuhuh you lied about being in the film industry and then relied on random conjecture about actors being duped 

it’s a sony film they would have to know it was primarily a sony film as that’s who is paying them and who they’re working with when they read the script went to set etc for months 

a simple google search would have also alleviated any confusion marvel announced their mcu films years in advance the ssu is also clearly separated with the mcu",2024-02-15
"it’s a sony film they would have to know it was primarily a sony film as that’s who is paying them and who they’re working with when they read the script went to set etc for months

being a sony film wouldn’t mean they’re not part of the mcu they sign on long before scripts and filming starts you’d think someone in the industry would know that

a simple google search would have also alleviated any confusion marvel announced their mcu films years in advance the ssu is also clearly separated with the mcu

maybe you should do a google search too cause marvel doesn’t announce any spiderman films in the mcu



phase 4 lacked any mention of no way home



phase 3 lacked any spiderman films at all",2024-02-15
"the tom holland spiderman films were primarily marvel studios productions meaning when you go onto set youre working with marvel not sony

if you were working on moebius madam webb etc you would be working with sonycolumbia pictures it would be quite obvious that the films were not marvel studios mcu

end of story

being a sony film wouldn’t mean they’re not part of the mcu they sign on long before scripts and filming starts you’d think someone in the industry would know that

you think they sign on before the script is written how do you think they cast the parts",2024-02-15
you’re not contradicting me sweet heart lol,2024-02-15
"no im showing you how   your argument is they knew they were working on a sony pictures film they were not duped into anything you literally said above the cast thought they were in a marvel studios film your words

yet madame webb cast also thought it was with marvel studios 

maybe you misspoke",2024-02-15
"nah you’ve failed at that quite drastically

“just google to see marvels list of films and it clears confusion”

but marvel doesn’t announce any of the sony films even the ones they’re working on like spiderman so… no you’re wrong

“you think they sign on before a script is written”

you must be new to how movies work do i need to remind you of el muerto lol or  morbius where tyrese signed on to play a badass with a super robot arm then when they finished the script he was just a normal cop or the countless mcu films that didn’t have finished scripts until they were already filming

you literally said above the cast thought they were in a marvel studios film your words

they literally tagged marvel studios in their announcements… that’s by definition thinking that they’re involved",2024-02-15
"they literally tagged marvel studios in their announcements… that’s by definition thinking that they’re involved

do you not see how   this is

you must be new to how movies work do i need to remind you of el muerto lol or  morbius where tyrese signed on to play a badass with a super robot arm then when they finished the script he was just a normal cop or the countless mcu films that didn’t have finished scripts until they were already filming

ok so scripts are rewritten all the time this has little to nothing to do with your argument again sony film i feel like a  parrot can you get this through your head they knew they were on a sony pictures film nobody was duped into thinking they were working with disneymarvel studios or that they were in the mcu 

but marvel doesn’t announce any of the sony films even the ones they’re working on like spiderman so… no you’re wrong

youre so close to getting it",2024-02-15
"nobody was duped into thinking they were working with disneymarvel studios

they literally tagged marvel studios as one of the studios they were working with lol you don’t do that unless you think you’re working with  marvel studios",2024-02-15
so your entire argument hinges on a tweet got it,2024-02-15
more proof than you’ve provided lol,2024-02-15
im not the one making the claim dingus,2024-02-15
"and i provided evidence for my claim like i said there is evidence that they thought they were in mcu films like evidence of them literally tagging the  mcu studios in their films like them saying in interviews they’re in the mcu like them talking to mcu actors about taking these roles

yknow actual  evidence where as your claims are “nu uh” cool story bro",2024-02-15
i think they’re saying the actors didn’t understand that sony’s marvel movies are separate from the mcu but they still knew they were working with sony it’s not like sony hid the fact that it was a sony production to trick the actors into thinking they’re part of the mcu the actors just didn’t understand there’s a difference they probably assumed marvel is marvel,2024-02-16
"so your entire argument hinges on a tweet got it

so your entire argument hinges on a tweet got it",2024-02-15
no one said they didn’t know they were working for sony though they clearly knew they just also thought it was sony partnered with marvel studios not marvel entertainment,2024-02-16
you gotta take the l and move on here brother youre clearly talking out your  and have been proven wrong over and over lol,2024-02-17
are you  this is a twoday old comment the only people talking out of their  is you and the person ive been replying to who has zero film experience and is quite literally by definition talking out of their ,2024-02-17
