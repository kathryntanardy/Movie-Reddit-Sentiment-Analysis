idk why but dakota johnson reminds me of an unsalted peanut,2023-12-12 14:59:17

"we dont want this 

stop introducing supporting characters in their own movies just introduce them in a proper spiderman film and spin them off from there so they actually have their proper relationship to spidey 

also stop making everyone young and hot madame web should be played by someone like hellen miren ezekiel isnt mryoungandsexy beard man in a nondescript arrowverse quality spidersuit hes a surprisingly spry old man with spiderpowers acrobatic old man was his entire schtick and why did you think it was a good idea to throw all your spiderwomen in a grab bag and say heres all of them at once",2023-12-12 17:43:25

"i asked chatgpt to predict the end of movie and it still sounds better than whatever theyre going to come up with

  
as the climax builds cassandra webb and her allies face off against the vaguely spidermannish villain in a dramatic showdown in central park the villain cloaked in shadows cackles maniacally revealing his master plan to use a giant sky beam machine to merge all realities and rule them as a tyrant as the skies tear open a plethora of spiderthemed heroes and villains from various dimensions begin to pour into new york city including a talking spider with a top hat and monocle

  
with each of the heroines knocked down cassandra scrambles towards a mysterious amulet that had belonged to her mother hoping it holds the key to their victory in a flash of desperation she activates the amulet which emits a blinding light when the light fades the villain is inexplicably immobilized frozen in place by an unseen force meanwhile the young women discover they can now communicate telepathically  


the final scene is a musical number where the entire cast including the villain performs a synchronized dance routine to a spiderthemed parody of a popular song laughing and forgetting their onscreen conflicts the film ends with cassandra returning to her paramedic job winking at the camera after saving a cat in a tree—a task she performs by shooting webs from her hands  
  
a postcredits scene shows the villain waking up revealing everything to have been just a dream he’s actually a spiderman impersonator at a childrens birthday party and cassandra is just the party planner looking on in disbelief",2023-12-12 16:11:33

how does she keep getting work shes pretty awful,2023-12-12 15:39:46

place your bets is this gonna bomb harder than morbius or not,2023-12-12 15:08:41
it looks bad but i bet it makes a profit plenty of time after marvels and aquaman 2 and plenty of time before deadpool 3 for cape fans to want to go back to the movies and during a month where its only real box office competition is argylle probably rushed to hit that spot even,2023-12-12 15:11:53

i consider myself a big spiderman fan but my only contact with this madame web character happened in the 90s animation never seen her in any other comic she also appears in the shattered dimensions games right she seems to be a plot device simple as it is a excuse to connect the spiderverse and the timing is weird sony is currently making a spiderverse animation already somehow it worked now its spiderverse again but with female versions of the character instead is that it i guess the general audiences are as confused as me lol this movie feels so random unnecessary,2023-12-13 00:21:50
this  looks  already,2023-12-13 00:23:39

this is going to be awful and it makes me sad because the character has so much potential and great stories and we are not going to get any of them,2023-12-13 01:24:46

sorry but dakota johnson is a charisma vacuum if she wasn’t solidly nepo she would’ve never made it in the industry,2023-12-13 05:46:07
no disrespect to dakota johnson but that woman couldn’t even make softcore  interesting aint nobody gonna see that movie,2023-12-13 06:28:02

i was excited for this until i saw dakota was the lead as an actress she is the most boring monotone snooze fest person i can think of i don’t understand,2023-12-13 06:57:02
even the poster screams next on the cw,2023-12-13 08:11:12

i cant wait for this to be the next example of hollywood bad becayse w0ke when its actually just a bad movie",2023-12-12 14:51:55
i am going to be truly shocked if this does well even the comics barely know what to do with the madame web character as they circle back to her about once every five years could turn out to be really entertaining just between the cast and the trailer my expectations are low,2023-12-12 15:13:06
looks like  and is led by maybe the least charismatic actress i’ve ever seen its going to do even worse than the marvels if i had to guess,2023-12-12 15:17:37
what manner of blackmail does dakota johnson have to keep getting roles  she looks like shes heard of emotions but doesnt believe people can have them,2023-12-12 15:21:48
sony disney and wb all in race to the bottom of the superhero genre maddening,2023-12-12 15:40:54
"why so much hate for the poster here i get it were tired of superhero movies sonys track record sucks screenwriters are notorious for their garbage but the poster looks fine 

its just like every other cheesy action movie poster for the last 30 years colorful eyecatching marginally clever design  are you people expecting if you cant appreciate one thing about something you expect to hate then  dudes eat some fungus and chill the  out",2023-12-12 16:37:22
i have no idea what the popular sentiment is around her but i actually really like dakota johnson and i think shes a fantastic actor so i am truly baffled why she would sign on for this movie i have to hope it was an amazing script    but she also signed onto fifty shades of grey so who knows,2023-12-12 18:04:17
dakota johnson is a talentless hack,2023-12-12 23:54:54
no  more superhero movies,2023-12-13 00:17:43
this looks  dumb,2023-12-12 14:46:17

"dear sony

if youre going to adapt a comic book character it should resemble the original character in some way any way",2023-12-12 14:54:08
this will  so much,2023-12-12 14:50:39
the only reason people will watch this movie is for sydney sweeney in a spider suit,2023-12-12 14:52:34
literally the only reason im going to watch this free online is to see sydney sweeney in hopefully skin tight latex,2023-12-12 15:09:32
"im starting to think im crazy cuz i actually liked the trailer and im excited for this movie i have absolutely no idea why people dislike it

the poster looks fine 
the trailer doesnt look bad either

i dont know who made this poster but all i know is he was in the amazon with my mother when she was researching spiders right before she died,2023-12-12 14:51:58
this will do webmillion dollars,2023-12-12 14:52:23
which tanks harder this or kraven,2023-12-12 14:52:45
 this and kraven are bound to flop,2023-12-12 14:58:53
i almost feel like sweeney would have been the better lead at least shed bring in some horndogs,2023-12-12 15:04:47
this looks like the poster that my mom saw the man carrying who disappeared after she was killed studying rare spiders,2023-12-12 15:09:09
i would promise to go see it if her  come out,2023-12-12 15:12:28

its webbin time,2023-12-12 15:28:55
i have a little hope spiderverse and the original trilogy are probably the best spiderman maybe besides the insomniac one i do have a love for andrew garfields spidey and the suit… but i can’t see madame web being any more boring or cringy than the holland spiderman movies,2023-12-12 16:48:13
is it wild that i recognize none of these actorsactresses,2023-12-12 17:47:31

dakota johnson  smell the charisma,2023-12-15 17:31:53

isso tem 100 de chance de ser uma merda,2023-12-12 15:10:22
lets hire a popular talented actor for the male lead and then dont put him on the poster  smart,2023-12-12 14:31:35
i’m not usually one to bash a movie when it’s announced but this trailer was shockingly bad,2023-12-12 14:32:57
is it 2003,2023-12-12 14:36:37
the marvels looked more convincing,2023-12-12 14:36:57
poster sucks trailer sucks cast sucks this is gonna be a box office winner for sure,2023-12-12 14:43:33
 you it’s february,2023-12-12 14:43:51

i’m sorry but dakota johnson is the dullest woman in the world there are so many amazing actors even her face on this poster i’m falling asleep,2023-12-12 19:32:00
please give me more female leads in super hero movies those are great and always successful because everyone loves watching women be super heroes not like those men those are probably touching everyone inappropriately offscreen onscreen they are way too aggressive and scare me with their physical strength and male gaze,2023-12-13 10:22:38
will be as successful as the last ghostbusters,2023-12-13 12:59:41
does anyone here care or are willing to give this a fair shake or has everyone here just decided everything here is garbage and will  on it for karma farming,2023-12-12 14:14:04
"yikes i can see where this is going this will end in the forgettable pile i only feel sorry for tahar rahim to be part of this

after watching the 2nd venom movie and morbius which felt like something before the superhero movie breakout around spiderman i can safely say this might be be up in the realm of cat woman and the marvels",2023-12-12 14:45:22

im glad they prioritized diverse woman and made them lame instead of making the priority a good movie,2023-12-12 16:24:13
another female dominated film that is gonna flop so hard,2023-12-12 18:42:09
legitimate question does anyone actually give a  about marvel releases anymore i used to be a huge fan and was hyped for every film they put out but they’ve been so bad recently i don’t even bother anymore the only thing i really cared about from them recently was loki and the 3rd guardians movie,2023-12-12 20:38:00
what dlist character can we make a movieshow about next  marvel,2023-12-12 22:55:32

"it is absolutely wild how little sony seems to try marvel has made plenty of missteps over the years but at least there is usually a ton of heart behind it and some kind of unique vision this feels like any other bland superhero movie from the mid2000’s

the dialogue will be terrible the special effects questionable the story will take something awesome and make it a complete bore and the movie will feel like a complete waste of time",2023-12-12 22:02:04

its not art but it does the job the designers were likely told to deliver  make people know this is spiderman",2023-12-12 14:44:40
can’t wait to see madame web web all over the place like she does in comics,2023-12-12 14:45:11

clearly looks like the poster for a student film,2023-12-12 15:04:58
it looks exactly like anyone would expect a spiderman movie dealing with possible futures looks,2023-12-12 15:05:51
looks like the type of poster that is done in photoshop classes,2023-12-12 15:06:06
there was a time when a marvel movie got me excited fast forward to today and all i did after coming across this poster was let out a quiet  continued by a burp and just kept scrolling,2023-12-12 15:06:21
they haven’t had enough flops,2023-12-12 15:06:58
i can tell the plot involves the metaverse even without seeing a trailer,2023-12-12 15:08:14
i actually struggle to believe still that this is real,2023-12-12 15:10:52
"remember when columbia marvel logos would appear and you’d get hyped

"this has the same level of excitement for me that the black widow movie did spoiler not great 

coincidence perhaps",2023-12-12 15:18:14
this looks like one of those movies that goes straight to dvd,2023-12-12 15:18:20
why are we being given this and morbius instead of venom 3,2023-12-12 15:19:04
neat title neat tagline but the poster looks like a ctier 0budget marvel movie,2023-12-12 15:19:13
looks like a knockoff superhero movie,2023-12-12 15:20:07
no,2023-12-12 15:20:41
flop,2023-12-12 15:20:48
i think we need a break from this stuff for a while i am sure the movie is great and acting great etc but too much of a good thing can ruin the good thing and that is where we are at  at least for me,2023-12-12 15:21:21
the trailer looked fun idk,2023-12-12 15:22:01

new mcu movie lets go,2023-12-12 15:24:45

i feel bad for tahar rahim guy deserves better roles than this  ,2023-12-12 15:28:32
i would take a mediocre spiderwoman movie or even a lukewarm venom sequel over this  at this point they should just put a tag line of its spidermanish on the poster and hope for the best,2023-12-12 15:28:34
due to needing to slap every main actors face posters  ,2023-12-12 15:28:35
her web is stunning and brave,2023-12-12 15:28:41

big batman and robin poster energy coming off this one,2023-12-12 15:31:44
i cant wait for some people to try and pretend like this is totally going to break out even considering the current cbm market,2023-12-12 15:31:54

i just hope it’s fun bad,2023-12-12 15:32:29
this is the most generic and safe movie poster i’ve seen so far it’s so bland and doesn’t many elements which would tell you what the movie is about,2023-12-12 15:32:46
trash,2023-12-12 15:33:05

we dont need this movie,2023-12-12 15:36:08
morbius finally a worthy opponent,2023-12-12 15:36:11
"for all the recent malaise its suffering sometimes selfinflicted one thing the mcu did right so far was quarantine sonys attempt to fully incorporate their inane spideyless spiderverse into the mcu timeline

sonys spideyverse can occasionally make minor incursions no relation to the marvel comics multiverse concept of incursion into the tom hollandstarred spidey mcu movies but for the rest of the mcu they will only allow hollands spidey and maybe mj or ned to appear in their movies 

sony can make all kinds of references to the mcu timeline but so far marvel studios is keeping this spideyverse at arms length like an embarrassing relative",2023-12-12 15:36:18
okay so i seefelicia hardy on the top right who are the rest supposed to be a young doctor strange on the bottom left,2023-12-12 15:37:27
i bet sydney is a scientist with those glasses,2023-12-12 15:38:16
when i saw the trailer i thought it was a directtostreaming movie… you’re telling me this is going to theaters and imax lol that’s don johnson’s daughter lol,2023-12-12 15:38:26
s t a h p,2023-12-12 15:38:34
this is worse than a strain to dvd design,2023-12-12 15:39:11
this looks like a poster for “liberty lass” on tosho,2023-12-12 15:41:04
i’ve seen that man before ezekiel sims he was in the amazon with my mom when she was researching spiders right before she died,2023-12-12 15:41:25
at least put adam scott on the poster,2023-12-12 15:41:43
who in the  would go to see this,2023-12-12 15:42:13
show of hands who actually honestly genuinely even cares at this point,2023-12-12 15:42:23
as a huge marvel fan i am excited to not watch this film,2023-12-12 15:42:33
it’s webbing time,2023-12-12 15:43:07
oh boy this looks neat is this movie supposed to break the record that the marvels just set,2023-12-12 15:43:25
"
can’t be the only one to have thought that was reilly reid at first",2023-12-12 15:43:52
so this is a latenight or streaming  thriller right everybody in this movie gets  for exactly 15 seconds with the name tagline and cast that’s the only way this makes sense,2023-12-12 15:44:02
"i know most people dislike them but to me the sonyverse marvel movies have become a sort of guilty pleasure

they have that early2000s nostalgia factor like daredevil ghost rider elektra not necessarily stellar movies but kinda nice and cozy on a rainy sunday afternoon",2023-12-12 15:44:15
this poster makes them look so lame,2023-12-12 15:44:48
thought that was keanu for a second ,2023-12-12 15:44:49
another massive marvel l the funko pops will do well though,2023-12-12 15:45:19
relax its a fan movie,2023-12-12 15:45:51
he was in the amazon with my mom when she was researching spiders just before she died,2023-12-12 15:45:56
will bring the worst movie of 2024 no doubt,2023-12-12 15:45:58
looks lame af please dont tell me this is tied into avengers bs to me it looks like marvel studios is  the bed,2023-12-12 15:46:37
it’s webbin’ time,2023-12-12 15:46:37
i honestly thought it was a show with its cwlike quality,2023-12-12 15:47:07
it’s not gonna do well it’s too obscure no way the markering can make it look like a must see,2023-12-12 15:47:52
hard pass,2023-12-12 15:48:26
they forgot the peacock logo,2023-12-12 15:49:39
can i just ask  does dakota johnson even read the scripts that are sent to her before signing up  she is almost universally in trash projects,2023-12-12 15:49:53
selling the rights back to disney has got to be more profitable than this,2023-12-12 15:50:13
better than i expected,2023-12-12 15:50:15
"considering how rapidly marvel and dc movies have been declining at the box office over the past couple of years i just cant see madame freaking web of all things performing even half as well as the marvels or shazam 2
then again judging by what ive seen so far this movie looks like sony paid the cast and crew in cryptocurrency and spankings so it will probably somehow turn a profit

i know sony is just trying to retain the film rights to spiderman but are the tom holland and spiderverse movies not enough to accomplish that",2023-12-12 15:51:21
doa,2023-12-12 15:51:50
this is a movie legit thought it was a tv show,2023-12-12 15:53:00

what is tahar rahim doing in this disaster,2023-12-12 15:53:58
looking forward to new zingers out of this movie like it’s morbin time,2023-12-12 15:54:47
watching a wet paper bag slowly dry would be more entertaining,2023-12-12 15:55:15
easy pass,2023-12-12 15:55:18
will madame web became better than morbius,2023-12-12 15:56:01
isnt this basically dead on arrival,2023-12-12 15:57:19
this is going to be the diet multiverse of madness isnt it,2023-12-12 15:58:11
"a whole bunch of spiderpeople are superheroes in this film  but the main character is not one of them  she can just like i dunno go back 5 minutes in time  and thats it i think

and honestly i can see a movie being pretty interesting that is all about someone who is a normal person living in a world full of superheroes and how their life is getting affected by that  but thats definitely not what this film is going for  

this is going straight into the garbage im sure",2023-12-12 15:58:41
it’s webbin’ time,2023-12-12 15:58:43
i predict this is going to be one of those movies that goes from bad to so bad its actually camp,2023-12-12 15:58:56
ill only watch it if the spiderwomen shoot webs from their buttholes,2023-12-12 15:59:08
its interesting to be living trough the death throes of a massive movie trend this must be what it was like in the 60s when westerns were on their way out,2023-12-12 15:59:13
this is going to bomb,2023-12-12 15:59:32
this looks utter gash,2023-12-12 16:00:22
its madame webbing time,2023-12-12 16:00:25
i miss good movie posters i know theyre antiquated with trailers and  but jesus  even is that poster just some people ive never seen playing characters ive never heard of for a plot theyre not telling me about,2023-12-12 16:00:34
if a character cant carry a monthly comic book they should not get a movie this is guaranteed garbage,2023-12-12 16:01:22
what am i some sort of madame web,2023-12-12 16:01:26
if i was marvel i would sue to have my name and logo taken off this movie,2023-12-12 16:02:01
doa sony really should just give everything to marvel even though disney is down rn everything is definitely better than morbin time and venom 2,2023-12-12 16:02:13
luckily this has no one in it that i will miss when it tanks their career for being in it,2023-12-12 16:02:39
i didnt know cinemax movies had posters,2023-12-12 16:02:54

"sony you know what spiderman needs more ladies

writer why dont we make all the spidermen ladies plus lets make the villain the only male but hes also spiderman boss  am i right

sony  yeah and get that terrible actress from 50 shades",2023-12-12 16:05:07
sony trying to scrape a franchise out of their spiderman rights never stops being funny,2023-12-12 16:05:16
what kind of “include women” spiderman knock off is this,2023-12-12 16:05:18
lol ok,2023-12-12 16:05:21
its webbin time,2023-12-12 16:05:54
it looks like a cw tv show poster,2023-12-12 16:06:10
"lol

nope",2023-12-12 16:06:22
dakota seems to be getting caught up in ropes or web in her movies,2023-12-12 16:06:22

"nice another incoming superhero giga flop   will go straight to tubi  fubo

x200b

also really the best tagline they could come up with was her web connects them all",2023-12-12 16:07:21
why is the lower left corner of the second “a” cut off it’s driving me crazy the first a has a corner,2023-12-12 16:08:49
who is this for,2023-12-12 16:09:40
what are these actors doing they really didnt get any better offers to be another superhero these things are getting handed out on the street nowadays they cant be this  to agree to work on a project like this,2023-12-12 16:09:47
dakota johnson is the actress they wanna make a thing so bad i’ll never get it,2023-12-12 16:09:53
 this,2023-12-12 16:10:00
this movies is going to end some careers,2023-12-12 16:10:10
madame flop,2023-12-12 16:10:33
this is gonna tank so hard,2023-12-12 16:10:48
theyve captured her lack of charisma very well,2023-12-12 16:11:00
i read an article that said madame web is an iconic marvel character and is she ive read comics since the 90s and legitimately do not remember her i was big on xmen mostly but dabbled in spiderman too who was she around that i would have run into her,2023-12-12 16:11:04
funny how the poster looks like it has more of a budget than the movie itself,2023-12-12 16:11:54
where does she shoot her webs from just so i know if this is a movie i want to watch alone in the dark,2023-12-12 16:13:10
oh it’s most certainly webbin time,2023-12-12 16:13:20
can we take sonys live action spider verse out to pasture yet im worn out of good marvel movies and this  isnt doing them any favors hard pass,2023-12-12 16:13:23
i can’t decide what’s worse this or the trailer… man this film is gonna be so bland,2023-12-12 16:14:21
sony executives when this movie inevitably flops,2023-12-12 16:14:30
the trailer looks fake and so does the poster,2023-12-12 16:14:43
is it one of those fan made posters,2023-12-12 16:14:57
i hope its good for dakota johnsons sake she deserves to be recognised as a good actor,2023-12-12 16:15:01
this poster had so much potential to be more interesting  the bones are there,2023-12-12 16:15:07
the trailer looked pretty cool  i’m not familiar with the comics at all tho,2023-12-12 16:15:10
if it connects them allwheres spiderman,2023-12-12 16:15:37
gonna fail,2023-12-12 16:16:14
wheres the chair,2023-12-12 16:17:03
oh not marvel again,2023-12-12 16:18:21
dakota johnson looks like shes taking her drivers license picture,2023-12-12 16:19:55
what are we some kind of madame web,2023-12-12 16:20:00
that’s certainly a poster,2023-12-12 16:20:29
bomb written all over it,2023-12-12 16:20:34
this somehow looks worse than morbius,2023-12-12 16:21:01
why is this one coming out before kraven,2023-12-12 16:21:15
gonna be doodoo,2023-12-12 16:21:56
maybe theres something interesting about the character that can be told but this straight to dvd poster isnt convincing me,2023-12-12 16:23:16
sweeney has glasses she must be really smart,2023-12-12 16:23:48
fifty webs of madame web,2023-12-12 16:24:12
this movie screams ai generated content more than anything else ive ever seen in my life lol,2023-12-12 16:24:15
oh  they have dora in the movie,2023-12-12 16:25:04
the only positive thing i think ive seen from this film was sidney sweeney in that blackwhite julia carpenter spiderwoman costume all she needed was the white lenses for her eyes and it would be perfect  idk how random cosplayers can get this stuff right for comiccons but professional studios with actual budgets cant,2023-12-12 16:25:15
someone really looked at this and said yeah thatll do and put it online jesus christ,2023-12-12 16:25:28
pretty sure i saw that on tubi except it was called mistress net or some ,2023-12-12 16:25:31
this trailer played before napoleon i some one who has some knowledge of superhero movies was incredibly confused at what i was watching and thought it looked like diarrhea i cannot for a moment imagine what the packed audience of people over the age of 50 that were seeing napoleon were thinking,2023-12-12 16:25:58
lots of people got paid to make this film,2023-12-12 16:26:23

im honestly kinda looking forward to this i know it wont be good but i want to go see it in theaters,2023-12-12 18:23:44

if dakota johnson were a spice shed be flour  i dont think pirating this movie will be worth the money,2023-12-12 18:25:42
while watching this trailer i thought i had slipped into some timeline where spiderman had become public domain and was getting the blood and honey treatment,2023-12-12 18:26:11
 not exactly the look i envisioned for the cinematic debut of this character but honestly at this point that’s a background issue,2023-12-12 18:26:19
look like another great marvel movie to put on when im having trouble sleeping,2023-12-12 18:29:03
its amazing how much hate this is getting personally i liked the trailer and this poster is not really bad,2023-12-12 18:29:12

trailer this week,2023-12-12 18:40:54
cool dr strange did it first good job designer,2023-12-12 18:40:54
man i could’ve done a better job than this you may have heard it said that the teaser posters for marvel are always better than the official ones the official ones are noisy and messy,2023-12-12 18:42:12
idk who these people are or what this movie is about but judging by the poster alone its going to be garbage,2023-12-12 18:45:00
how did they think this was a good idea,2023-12-12 18:45:01
i miss being excited for marvel films,2023-12-12 18:46:23
its madam time,2023-12-12 18:47:24
the marvels all over again,2023-12-12 18:47:55
one of the worst movie posters i’ve ever seen,2023-12-12 18:48:51
why does it look like thats the picture from her drivers license,2023-12-12 18:49:10
bomb city or bombs away couldnt decide,2023-12-12 18:49:32
if you don’t want more of this simply don’t go see it in theaters i promise you morbius isn’t getting a sequel because of how poorly it performed,2023-12-12 18:50:15
 this looks awful,2023-12-12 18:50:29
"warning february is the often the release month for the crappy films

this looks like it qualifies",2023-12-12 18:52:10
this looks as bad as catwoman,2023-12-12 18:53:19
he was in the amazon with my mom where was researching spiders just before she died and her web connects them all,2023-12-12 18:53:43
i see her and all i think is 50 shades of  up marvel doesnt know when to quit and using her is probably one of the worst ideas they had granted i liked her in the 50 shades movies but for this nojust no,2023-12-12 18:53:59
at least dakota johnson knows this wont be the worst movie of her career,2023-12-12 18:55:13
putting down a 2leg parlay 66 on rotten tomatoes and 50 million opening weekend,2023-12-12 18:55:31
i admire sony for the commitment of making mid 2000 movies in 2023,2023-12-12 18:55:34
my favorite part was when madame web said it’s webbin time and webbed all over the place truly one of the moments of all time,2023-12-12 18:56:55
"oooooh this is gonna go well 

can’t wait to see what kind of “ist” we are for not watching it",2023-12-12 18:57:15
that looks even worse than the trailer but not as bad as the hack job they did to the story and character,2023-12-12 18:58:02
who’s making this …,2023-12-12 18:58:30
if they’re gonna go with a more obscure character like madame web can you at least go with the design people recognize get an older actress like christine baranski and have her be the leader of a group of spider men you don’t even need tom toby or andrew branch out and get other alternates to use other actors tom cruise could be the peter with the spider armor from the 90s spider wars arc you can use women too as spiderverse has proven just don’t be lazy this looks lazy and halfassed just from the poster and the trailer even more so,2023-12-12 18:59:05
walmart brand spider man ripoff characters that make no sense since it’s supposed to be before spider man was a thing,2023-12-12 18:59:57
  poster why cant we have cool posters why do the studios always choose the worst looking ones as the main ones i mean the answer is probably so they can get all the actors faces on the poster for money but still give us good posters,2023-12-12 19:00:34
she looks so bored in that image,2023-12-12 19:00:57
it’s webbing time,2023-12-12 19:02:03
gonna be a big ole flop,2023-12-12 19:02:25
"going by the trailer this will be a disaster

dakota johnson is a  actress",2023-12-12 19:02:39

they’re gonna get it done,2023-12-12 19:03:03
even the poster looks fan made how is all this being green lit,2023-12-12 19:04:07

this is gonna make 30 dollars,2023-12-12 19:07:00

 is this broke  spider man,2023-12-12 19:14:02
future bomb of a movie,2023-12-12 19:14:30
i feel like making fun of this movie just feels like redundant it’s like making fun of someone in hospice,2023-12-12 19:14:44
this looks so bad i think it would be incredibly funny if it turns out amazing,2023-12-12 19:15:27
even as a morbid curiosity this won’t be worth watching,2023-12-12 19:16:49
great another rarely ever used marvel character gets its own movie this is going to end well,2023-12-12 19:17:29
looks like broken glass,2023-12-12 19:18:26
is it just me or she looks like monica bellucci in the poster,2023-12-12 19:18:39
i soooo cant wait to not see this,2023-12-12 19:19:08
"why does everyone on the poster look bored or ashamed to be there

why is the tagline so dull amd cringey

who the  decided any of this was a good idea",2023-12-12 19:19:35
i do not like dakota johnson,2023-12-12 19:19:56
but who are them all,2023-12-12 19:20:03
more wasted potential from sony,2023-12-12 19:20:46
terrible poster,2023-12-12 19:24:08
i actually want to see this based on the trailer but holy  what is this,2023-12-12 19:24:13
looks like a scifi channel movie lol,2023-12-12 19:26:03
genuinely could be the funniest flick of ‘24,2023-12-12 19:26:35
wow the thread makes screenwriting almost sound like a regular job s,2023-12-12 19:28:25
this certainly looks like a columbia pictures superhero movie,2023-12-12 19:28:52
why is it called “madame web” is this a spidergwen spinoff not too familiar with spiderman comics,2023-12-12 19:28:55
watch this shut up,2023-12-12 19:29:53
does anyone genuinely care about this,2023-12-12 19:34:28
who even wants to see this who makes the decision to even start producing  like this what the  is going on,2023-12-12 19:34:57
 is this,2023-12-12 19:37:38
is sony film run by the two guys from the producers are they purposefully releasing bad film after bad film,2023-12-12 19:38:38
   if you took away the title you wouldnt know what this was you could know everything about madame web and not think this has anything to do with it it looks like it could be a  parody of spidermanspiderwoman maybe nothing here looks iconic to the characters or the verse at all  are they doing anymore its just so weird honestly imaging what their vision for this is,2023-12-12 19:38:38
this movie will bomb nobody will like it and a month later sony will announce a standalone movie about hydroman and the cycle continues,2023-12-12 19:39:11
how does dakota keep getting movie rolls shes awful,2023-12-12 19:39:23
who is this for,2023-12-12 19:39:27
its almost like sony saw the marvels and said hold my beer,2023-12-12 19:40:04

fifty shades of madam web,2023-12-12 19:43:22
no offense to anyone but its getting to that point where any of these come out and studios are just let it ride and hoping it does well but its probably gonna bomb people are tired of these movies in general,2023-12-12 19:43:26
oh man even the  tagline is bland as ,2023-12-12 19:44:18
the little details of the statue of liberty and new york skyline in the lettering for madame web look so ,2023-12-12 19:44:37

this too was fan made to save on production costs,2023-12-12 19:47:34
cinema is over,2023-12-12 19:49:04
how will they find time to shoot this film with her being asleep for so much of the day,2023-12-12 19:50:55
why does this look like it was cobbled together in two hours in visme with liberal use of ai prompts,2023-12-12 19:51:07
2 web 2 succeed,2023-12-12 19:51:24

you can try to deglam sydney sweeney but nothing will stop this woman from looking good,2023-12-12 19:59:02
hey sony stop it get some help,2023-12-12 20:01:21

i cannot express how bad this looks,2023-12-12 21:46:45

this looks hilariously bad,2023-12-12 21:51:13
pass,2023-12-12 21:58:23
all i know of madame web is the 90s spiderman cartoon not ganna lie between other spider man spin offs like venom which are meh at best i’m not hopeful sony does a pretty dam good job with the core spiderman but i feel like they really don’t put the best towards other characters i’ll probably wait and see how reviews score this before see if i want to pay to see this in theaters,2023-12-12 21:58:48
dreading the inevitable sexism is the reason talk when this based on the trailers terrible movie gets released and bombs,2023-12-12 21:58:50

its astonishing to me that the same company who made two excellent animated spiderman crossover films keeps  the bed with their live action ones,2023-12-12 22:06:01
i love spiderman in every variation very much i would go as far to say i heart spiderman with my whole heart  i just hope marvel and sony dont turn the franchise into a commodity to fill their pockets especially when you consider the success of the spiderverse movies,2023-12-12 22:07:06
why isnt she old like in the comic,2023-12-12 22:08:15
i’m so done,2023-12-12 22:10:03
ugh can marvel just take a break already,2023-12-12 22:10:38
unless its a kids movie studios know its a dud when they release it in january  february unless its a romantic comedy i dont think its making huge numbers on valentines day,2023-12-12 22:11:18
yikes…,2023-12-12 22:11:53

im honestly giving it more thought than they did though",2023-12-13 00:03:34
this  gonna bomb hard,2023-12-13 00:07:22
a february release date says a lot about the level of confidence in the project,2023-12-13 00:09:05

is this like a sequel to fifty shades,2023-12-13 00:19:20
the original title sticky stepsister was taken,2023-12-13 00:19:54
i domt think i will care for any of the spiders or madam web not if they doing a origin story instead of just having her already in the web origin stories ruin the mystic around the character,2023-12-13 00:21:18
this is gonna flop so hard,2023-12-13 00:52:52
this  looks as bad as that  horror movie they tried to pass off as an xmen movie,2023-12-13 00:53:00
"reminder kevin fiege told sony to stop making bad spiderman movies

sony hasnt listened and im sure theres still some profit percentage in place that these movies have to make in order for sony to keep some rights the more  sony produces that fails the more of a chance disney will gobble up all of sonys spiderman ip",2023-12-13 00:56:13

this movie isn’t going to be good but i want dakota johnson and sydney sweeney to make money,2023-12-13 01:09:39
people are gonna be shocked when this falls on its face buteven setting aside that literally nobody ever asked for a movie about  madame web nobody in that poster is terribly familiar besides the lady from 50 shades of grey and the overlap between that movie and spiderman fans isnot terribly big,2023-12-13 01:09:48
this movie looks terrible basing it off this poster,2023-12-13 01:13:45
ah yes dumpuary cannot wait for the garbage that drops,2023-12-13 01:14:11
why why,2023-12-13 01:16:20

the marvels 20,2023-12-13 01:41:29
the only reason this won’t bomb as bad as the marvels is because sydney sweeney is in it ,2023-12-13 01:42:49
this is the most generic looking poster ever if i didnt know who this character was alreadywell  i still have no idea what the  this movie is supposed to be,2023-12-13 01:46:38
horrible poster for a horrible movie,2023-12-13 01:48:00
south park was right,2023-12-13 01:51:19
yikes,2023-12-13 01:52:58
i forgot is this movie in the mcu or the sony universe,2023-12-13 01:55:17
lemme guess when this flops mega hard they gonna blame on misogyny again,2023-12-13 01:56:07
i hope this movie bombs,2023-12-13 02:00:07
the trailer wasnt that bad tbh could have done good if it wasnt the knockoff spiderman universe,2023-12-13 02:01:26
who actually wanted this,2023-12-13 02:01:36
flop incoming,2023-12-13 02:01:40

what’s bob iger going to blame this flop on,2023-12-13 02:05:00
the best sony superhero film since the first sony superhero film since the dark knight,2023-12-13 02:05:18
which shade of grey is this,2023-12-13 02:05:33
so based on my research sony knowingly sought out the morbius script writers after seeing their work in morbius ,2023-12-13 02:15:13
looks boring,2023-12-13 02:18:59
it’s nice when the poster is so  you know you can skip the movie because obviously even they didn’t care,2023-12-13 02:24:00
"ive seen fanmade posters better than this you have dozens of super hero movies posters to use as a template and hundreds of thousands of movies in general to use their posters as a template and somehow you still made this generic uninspired chat gptmadr poster 

i cant begin to explain how excited i am to see this movie im so so so curious as to what was made that wasnt shown in the trailer",2023-12-13 02:25:50

“it’s web’n time”,2023-12-13 02:33:17
is it gonna get all fifty shades,2023-12-13 02:35:54
legitimate question  are they just leaning in to so bad it’s good meme potential now since morbius hit that mark,2023-12-13 02:38:44
its mormon time,2023-12-13 02:42:21
"everyone whos not kevin feige should just stick to animation

0 interest,2023-12-13 02:52:47
another flop for marvel,2023-12-13 02:52:47
graphic design is my passion,2023-12-13 02:54:30
i thought this was a youtube fan made movie,2023-12-13 02:57:58
is this another  movie starring dakota fanning i thought they were done with those,2023-12-13 03:06:34
does this movie have anything to do with spiderman,2023-12-13 03:07:52
my favorite part of the poster is when the poster looked right at the camera said its posterin time and postered all over the screen,2023-12-13 03:08:43
why,2023-12-13 03:15:46
this screams it should’ve been on d exclusively,2023-12-13 03:16:54
gonna be so ,2023-12-13 03:18:14
"truly the “we want spiderman” 

“we have spiderman at home”

of the spiderman movies except instead of you going home your mom leaves you at the grand canyon and drives away",2023-12-13 03:18:22

y’all have no idea how much this horrifies me,2023-12-13 03:21:54
what is this horse ,2023-12-13 03:22:59
what a godawful logo,2023-12-13 03:23:16

"it’s like when you’re about to see a car crash happen right in front of you but you can’t do anything to stop it 

so you just watch and you notice that both drivers are completely aware of what’s happening and they’re making no effort to avoid this disaster

then at the last moment you catch a look on one of the drivers faces as she punches the gas just seconds before impact making a bad situation worse

that’s been the experience of watch the buildup to this movie’s release",2023-12-13 03:37:43
its like the cw is making a movie,2023-12-13 03:43:22
i think im gonna sit this one out,2023-12-13 03:43:57
amazing spiderman poster is that you,2023-12-13 03:49:57
really reminding of the batman  robin poster,2023-12-13 03:59:41

but like for real why are they making this,2023-12-13 04:02:36

christ marvel is absolute  i shan’t,2023-12-13 04:47:08
wow the actresses of anastasia steele and cassie howard interesting,2023-12-13 04:53:19
this reminds me of those off shoot movies from the mid 2000s that wanted to be set in a universe and form a franchise but didnt have the rights to the characters or the budget for decent actors im hoping itll be good of course but between the casting choice for the main character and the lack of spiderman in a spiderman story my hopes arent high ill watch it on whatever third rate streaming service it ends up on with a free trail,2023-12-13 04:54:13
"i feel like they know the fans are expecting this film to be like the madame web in the comics and for it to connect to the spider verse and other films and they’re playing heavy on it 
especially because the poster says “her web connects them all” they know the fans are gonna assume the other spider meant 
but watch it be a cheeky double meaning and they’re trapping just referring to the characters in the movie if that’s the case they should expect heavy disappointment",2023-12-13 04:55:08
who tf is dakota johnson,2023-12-13 04:55:59
all posters look the same its crazy because its clearly backed by millions of dollars and thousands of very qualified people yet they miss the most basic tenets of marketing,2023-12-13 05:01:36
what is this,2023-12-13 05:01:58

surely this is a screenshot from that “awful fan made movie posters” twitter account,2023-12-13 06:16:36
i wanna say this is their worst spinoff sorry but they already did morbius next has to be like a rhino movie but its nothing about spiderman at all its just the plot of the pacifier but with a rhino instead of vin diesel,2023-12-13 06:35:30
is this real,2023-12-13 06:38:48
im so excited to hear the line its webbing time and have the madame web all over the bad guys,2023-12-13 06:46:07
this looks very early 2000s liveaction disney movie its giving me nostalgia i would have worn out the vhs tape  and memorized every garbage line,2023-12-13 06:46:50
its actually hilarious how they can get the spiderverse stuff so right but everything else related to spiderman sony manages to absolutely butcher,2023-12-13 06:52:44
ngl i have no point of reference for this movie whatsoever  is it part of the venomverse  mcu spiderverse  isnt she supposed to be old,2023-12-13 06:53:11
is this about time travel because this looks like a tv movie from 2006,2023-12-13 06:59:57
her web connects them all is a crazy tagline,2023-12-13 07:03:45

couldn’t care less about a movie release,2023-12-13 07:47:24
i dont know why this gives me romcom vibes,2023-12-13 07:48:49
will it be a bigger failure than the marvels,2023-12-13 07:53:34
i’m pretty sure i saw the whole movie when i clicked on the trailer,2023-12-13 07:54:40

i must be the only person on the planet that liked morbius,2023-12-13 10:36:59
cant believe people keep letting disney get away with this,2023-12-13 10:39:15
her web connects who all ,2023-12-13 10:40:48
very excited for this fanmade film,2023-12-13 11:32:00
this looks so  bad,2023-12-13 11:38:00
surely we can all just wait for the pitch meeting episode on this instead of actually seeing it,2023-12-13 12:03:06
who,2023-12-13 12:12:59
 lol,2023-12-13 12:30:06
if any movie needs the imax screen it’s this one,2023-12-13 12:32:00
"43 rt 64 metacritic 47 imdb

my prediction",2023-12-13 12:37:53
yawwwwwnnnnn,2023-12-13 12:47:28
coming to theaters soon another colossal flop,2023-12-13 13:31:19
the tax write offs for these movies must be huge,2023-12-13 13:38:55
the trailer was very cringe,2023-12-13 13:47:59
yawn,2023-12-13 14:30:50
i cant wait to occasionally glance up at this as i scroll through reddit four weeks after the theatrical release,2023-12-13 14:51:15
so is this tied directly into sonys spiderman movies the same way that venom is,2023-12-13 14:51:23
 is this ,2023-12-13 15:02:51
the marvels can’t wait for this film to drop,2023-12-13 15:15:44
everything about this movie looks awful,2023-12-13 15:35:34
probably the most boring poster you could make,2023-12-13 15:58:27
everything i’ve seen from this screams fan film,2023-12-13 16:46:22
why is this getting so much traction it looks like such a terrible movie from a terrible sony universe  that doesnt understand its characters i would be shocked if this does well do people just like it ironically or is this the kind of movie that people like and want now,2023-12-13 17:21:49
it’s webbin’ time,2023-12-13 19:27:33
this looks like something out of entourage,2023-12-13 19:59:09
what the  is this director doing  were there no more compelling portraits than these  for  sake madame webs is the worst  what am i supposed to feel when i look at this,2023-12-13 20:03:43
sony what did you do,2023-12-13 20:44:56
i feel like this is one of those movies thats gonna bomb super hardcore just so exec can learn the exact wrong reasons why a film fails,2023-12-13 20:48:29
batman  robin ,2023-12-13 22:02:52
releasing in february  dud,2023-12-13 22:30:28
anyone ever try   i was thinking to try them out they seem really affordable and wanted to find reviews,2023-12-26 17:43:44
it’s weird to me sony is using the rights to the marvel character madame web but then making her nothing like comic character so what is the point why not just write an original movie the couple dozen fans who want to see the comic version are just going to be disappointed,2024-01-08 03:39:59
he was in the amazon with my mum when she was researching spiders right before she died,2024-01-11 02:52:24
this movie is going to be trash,2024-01-24 23:44:31
first film to make a webbillion dollars on release,2024-02-02 12:30:32
looks so utterly terrible,2024-02-12 07:54:49
isn’t madame web supposed to be a blind old lady,2024-02-13 16:21:07
i cant wait for that cameo where madam web says its worbin time and webmorbs all over those guys,2024-02-14 17:41:30
i actually look forward to seeing this  i have a thing for movies that are bad,2024-02-21 20:14:08
"i mean honestly how do these guys keep getting work

5 movies so far between them dracula untold seems to be their biggest success",2023-12-12 15:23:20
i would love to see from the writers of morbius in the next trailer,2023-12-12 16:43:39
i saw the preview for this before napoleon and it was no doubt the worst trailer i’ve ever seen,2023-12-12 15:49:25
dope,2023-12-12 15:14:21
i guess its webbing time,2023-12-12 15:43:55
thats almost as bad as having the person who wrote xmen the last stand do a doover with xmen dark phoenix nobody is that silly right right,2023-12-12 17:16:24
its webbin time,2023-12-12 16:13:03
that means it will make a webbillion dollars1,2023-12-12 15:56:45
stay positive 50 of the screenwriters didnt work on those films,2023-12-12 16:43:03
"when i search morbius screenwriters it says matt sazama and burk sharpless were credited

when i search madame webs screenwriters it says claire parker and sj clarkson were credited for the screenplay and kerem sanga for the story ",2023-12-12 18:23:29
"craig mazin was a screenwriter on a long list of terrible parody movies then he wrote hbos chernobyl and the last of us tv show 

that being said i dont think this is going to be any good",2023-12-12 18:47:23
hey gods of egypt wasnt the worst over budgeted for sure but its perfect brate slock to put on the background,2023-12-12 21:36:57
gods of egypt was atleast entertaining enough imo but maybe that was just the director working with what they got idk,2023-12-12 15:34:55
as far as resumes go if that were mine id list unemployed during those years,2023-12-12 15:59:33
so it’s morbin time again,2023-12-12 16:02:10
it’s morbin time ,2023-12-12 16:07:03
who the  pays these people,2023-12-12 16:19:11
"so you’re saying it’s going to sweep at most awards’ ceremonies

s",2023-12-12 16:23:48
we’re all gonna be webbin watching this,2023-12-12 15:44:46
this project never had hope why cant they get gail simone to write the scripts instead they get  writers,2023-12-12 16:35:54
i mean theres what writers write and then there the director that throws it all away and replaces it with its morbin time meme,2023-12-12 16:41:38
lol someone really saw morbius and said yeah we should hire that guy,2023-12-12 17:33:36
theyre cheap,2023-12-12 17:38:09
well at least their output quality seems to be consistent p,2023-12-12 17:44:25
it’s webbin time,2023-12-12 18:02:54
i loved when morbo morbed all over the egyptian gods,2023-12-12 18:03:46
oh…,2023-12-12 18:13:04
 yikes,2023-12-12 18:24:36
oh oh its morbin time,2023-12-12 18:48:31
i can say with 100 percent certainty that this script is trash and this movie will be too unless they did reshoots which i don’t think they have,2023-12-12 18:48:37
hey now morbius is one of the movies of all time its morbin time is one of the all times lines from a movie its a  movie,2023-12-12 19:18:10
its morbin time,2023-12-12 19:18:11
ngl i kinda enjoyed gods of egypt,2023-12-12 19:36:01
people keep saying this but who is the morbius writer,2023-12-12 19:39:27
and the director has directed some episodes of dexter jessica jones the defenders and sucession interesting,2023-12-12 19:42:55
oh  i cant wait to watch this,2023-12-12 19:51:44
more screenwriters means more good,2023-12-12 20:07:13
this blows my mind,2023-12-12 20:32:31
"disney board of directors bob the company is in trouble we gotta have a turnaround what do we do 

bob iger its morbin time",2023-12-12 20:33:13
so its webbin time,2023-12-12 20:52:20
how do they keep getting a job ,2023-12-12 21:01:25
 i was kinda excited until i just read this comment and the reality set in i was really looking forward to this one the one person who can help peter parker reunite with mj is madame web,2023-12-12 21:19:49
they wrote for morbius so its going to be a masterpiece,2023-12-12 21:23:19
it already looked like it was gonna be mid but gods of egypt and morbius…dear  have mercy on us,2023-12-12 21:38:53
guess its webbin time,2023-12-12 21:39:07
it’s gonna be a perfect 57,2023-12-12 22:17:07
the bar has never been lower,2023-12-12 23:14:27
in an infinite multiverse it’s always morbin’ time,2023-12-12 23:29:04
sure but what if i told you the other two wrote citizen kane and rashoman,2023-12-12 23:30:58
there was a time when i would actually get excited when they announced a new marvel movie now there are so many that i cant even keep track of one franchise if i do decide to watch them i find most of them barely palatable or at best just straight up boring theyve really bled the marvel universe dry as it seems their strategy is to pump out as many as possible to try to make as much money as quickly as possible with no regard to quality control,2023-12-12 23:31:25
i could tell just from the trailer this is gonna be another stinker from sony’s spiderverse they should just do sm4 with tobey and tasm3 with andrew and they’d make a killing instead we’re subjected to this stuff,2023-12-12 23:50:49
2 of those writers also made that lost in space reboot which i loved personally,2023-12-12 23:59:16
i have never seen those movies but ive heard great things about them,2023-12-13 00:35:14
it’s webbin’ time,2023-12-13 01:32:27
bold of you to assume this movie even had a chance,2023-12-13 01:35:04
holy fck it looked bad but with this information im even more concerned,2023-12-13 01:35:21
looks like it’s webbin’ time,2023-12-13 02:18:00
well the guy who ruined dark phoenix the first time in xmen last stand got to do it all over again with a new cast in the reboot so its not like hollywood learns from its mistakes or anything,2023-12-13 02:18:29
these the same whiny screenwriters on strike   us audience need to go on strike for screenwriters to write better movies,2023-12-13 02:25:45
the internet decided they hated morbius before they heard a line of dialogue,2023-12-13 02:28:36
"ohhhhhhhhhhh nooooooooooooo 

yup its gunna ",2023-12-13 02:52:13
thanks for the warning,2023-12-13 03:43:42
what do you expect it’s an origin story about a characters whose whole appeal is the mystique around her origin so basically the worst possible way to introduce thatmsort of character to a franchise i’m fully expecting this to be one of the all time worst comic book movies,2023-12-13 04:34:56
ooooooooph,2023-12-13 04:57:48
that’s how you know you’re getting true cinema,2023-12-13 05:03:51
yikes,2023-12-13 09:59:25
still not hackish enough bring in chris terrio and alex kurtzman to clean it up,2023-12-13 19:21:04
you mean morbs of egypt and godius ,2023-12-13 22:04:03
bro knew things,2024-02-19 21:52:43
its making its premiere on corncob tv,2023-12-12 14:53:51
but her web connects them all,2023-12-12 15:05:27
i was gonna say cw but crackle is better lol,2023-12-12 15:10:35
this is definitely a movie i’m going to watch … in a few months after it’s out of theaters and it’s on streaming for free when i have nothing else to do one night,2023-12-12 15:39:45
sony doesn’t even own crackle anymore,2023-12-12 14:37:19
its webbin time,2023-12-12 15:40:28
looks like an early 90’s horror movie without the gratuitous nudity,2023-12-12 15:54:55
i spit out laughing,2023-12-12 15:11:56
 yeah im a total cracklehead,2023-12-12 15:18:23
lol as someone who used to work at crackle this was dead on,2023-12-12 17:11:02
it’s impossible to tell what is going to be a “straight to video” movie anymore since everything is on streaming got tricked by ghosted on apple tv,2023-12-12 17:19:00
the sheer blandness coming from johnson is wild she’s a good actress but my  she walks through that trailer like she’s in a different movie or a hidden camera show or something there’s zero tension or drama,2023-12-12 17:32:29
this came outta nowhere and i did not really picture her has madam web,2023-12-12 19:17:30
i screenshot this just to share your picture i am dying with laughter,2023-12-12 16:05:31
you mean looks like a chicken soup for the soul exlusive,2023-12-12 17:24:34
"still better than the furiosa poster though


people seem really hungry to hate on this one",2023-12-12 17:26:31
looks like a fanmade poster,2023-12-12 19:13:51
modern disney…,2023-12-12 17:31:41
i prefer whattimeisitrightnowcom,2023-12-12 16:32:52
its a sony superhero ip might as well be,2023-12-12 16:57:03
" crackle

is crackle still a thing  i remember seeing that thing everywhere  and now not",2023-12-12 17:10:58
it’s madam’n time,2023-12-12 17:50:16
so did the trailer genuinely looks like the lowest production value blockbuster film in recent memory,2023-12-12 18:14:04
watch it exclusively on cricket mobile devices,2023-12-12 21:25:39
it’s gonna premiere on tubi,2023-12-12 21:33:17
i can already hear the freevee chime as i fire this puppy up,2023-12-12 23:33:04
crackle 90day exclusive then it goes on tubi,2023-12-13 20:45:55
i genuinely do not think anyone involved in this has ever seen a spider web in their life,2023-12-12 15:46:07
 its like in between the two and ends up looking so bad,2023-12-12 15:36:11
i hope the movie actually includes shattering glass following by steve austin walking in to give everyone a stunner,2023-12-12 16:07:51
can we have everyone looking really bored  and also no indication of what the movie is,2023-12-12 16:52:35
oh  i knew id seen it somewhere,2023-12-12 16:04:55
trying to invoke the multiverse of madness poster,2023-12-12 16:40:21
and the actual web in the bottom left is just mirrored for the bottom right they didnt even bother making things look different,2023-12-12 16:17:54
its like they asked ai to make them a web,2023-12-12 22:48:38
this made me realize its not in fact shattered glass,2023-12-12 17:43:27
the fact that it’s perfectly symmetrical is so  lazy ,2023-12-12 18:48:57
”throw in a few sith light sabers while you’re at it”,2023-12-12 23:17:20
looks exactly like a web to me,2023-12-13 01:45:08
movie posters have really gone downhill,2023-12-13 03:50:13
to be fair shattering glass is always used in “multiverse” … but the bigger problem is this looks extremely fan made,2023-12-12 20:31:23
i like to think the artist made it look fantastic and the producer said no it has to look  than that,2023-12-12 21:33:36
“are those lasers”,2023-12-12 18:00:42
and they  mirrored the pattern instead of doing it twice,2023-12-12 19:28:42
this season of black mirror has truly gone to the spiders,2023-12-13 06:07:03
1woman brunette portrait centered frontal inside web centering around bottom edge high quality poster masterwork realistic,2023-12-12 19:08:56
why are all the marketing assets for this movie so bad even though morbius was bad the assets still looked decent,2023-12-12 20:45:13
is make it look like an m night shyamalan movie poster,2023-12-12 22:57:15
two thumbs up way up… yer ,2023-12-12 19:13:32
remove the film title and its basically a technothriller with dakota as a hacker,2023-12-13 17:59:21
i think that might’ve been the first time my web connected them all,2023-12-12 16:15:00
i hope the line is even longer in the movie,2023-12-12 16:44:46
went and watched the trailer after seeing chatter about this holy  that line is terrible,2023-12-12 18:21:27
from the writers of morbius this is cinema,2023-12-12 15:43:42
that line still makes me laugh,2023-12-12 16:37:10
i knew someone was gonna say it  i was gonna post this poster was in the amazon  with my mom  where she was researching spiders just before she died,2023-12-12 18:09:57
"it might not be as bad if they broke it up a little

he was in the amazon with my mom where she was researching spiders

and how is it you remember that

because it was just before she died",2023-12-12 23:51:41
she got cut by a radioactive web,2023-12-12 17:56:59
im pretty open to  dialogue or movies but this  was hilarious ,2023-12-13 01:21:52
im something of an amazonian spider researcher myself,2023-12-13 03:39:33
do scientists leaving for the amazon to do research every think to themselves waitthis is how it always starts,2023-12-12 21:35:04
what does spiders have to do with amazon web service,2023-12-13 04:07:31
 no way,2023-12-12 19:09:48
spiders you say,2023-12-13 02:56:53
in the comics a different character took over the role of madame web the film seems to have combined the two into one,2023-12-12 15:04:26
voiced by stan lees wife no less,2023-12-12 15:14:59
thats exactly what i said  why didnt they hire some great older actress to play this character and do it correctly,2023-12-12 15:05:09
madame web transferred her powers over to spiderwoman julia carpenter and she took up the name happened in the comics about 15 years ago,2023-12-12 15:48:18
yes she was like that in the comics this is sony saying “yeah we get that but agatha harkness was also an old lady and marvel made her young so  it we’re doing it live”,2023-12-12 15:38:36
this is supposed to be her origins or some made up ,2023-12-12 14:51:02
with sweetass sunglasses,2023-12-12 16:20:48
its safe to assume when youre dealing with marvel properties there are multiple versions of the character,2023-12-12 17:14:02
she’s also dressed in a weird  suit that has no legs just a webtacular tail,2023-12-12 16:25:11
before she was old and grey hair she was young and didn’t have grey hair crazy i know,2023-12-12 22:36:57
oh  you just gave me flashbacks of memories i didn’t know i had ,2023-12-12 15:47:15
yes and this is her origin story,2023-12-12 15:47:50
she freaked me out as a kid,2023-12-12 16:00:45
well they come in all shapes and sizes you know,2023-12-12 16:44:14
this show has a lot to do to live up to that series the madam web saga on the 90s spiderman was so well done even if it was going like 100mph,2023-12-12 16:57:06
did her legs flap around when she web swung i’m not sure i understand this character,2023-12-12 17:28:51
her hair gains a streak of gray by the end of the film maybe,2023-12-12 17:40:44
she got hot for marketing purposes,2023-12-12 18:16:26
i thought madam web ran the spider person brothel,2023-12-12 18:34:22
and now shes played by a lady known for  films,2023-12-12 18:59:58
the rumor is that this movie doesnt take place in the present the adam scott character is rumored to be a younger ben parker,2023-12-12 21:12:36
this is what i think of when i think of madame web as well,2023-12-12 23:10:47
stem cells ftw,2023-12-13 00:12:27
yep i only remember this character from the 90s animation wth is this character she is supposed to be aunt may for another dimension that somehow connected all the spiderverse together or some  the whole thing feels so random lol in the recent spiderverse animations they used a better excuse the super futuristic spiderman was able to connect stuff through scifi technomagic madame web feels like a pure magical character its really weird and disconnected,2023-12-13 00:25:30
everything sony does still feels like 1998 blade to me ,2023-12-13 02:06:19
madame webb first appeared in 1980,2023-12-13 09:50:59
will they release madame web in theaters twice,2023-12-12 14:43:17
"madame web

thats it tough to build a marvel cinematic universe when you only hold the rights to a single superhero and their associated characters but damned if they arent going to try and fail  the venom movies were pretty middling  they  up morbius  kraven the hunter is probably going to be a mess  might as well make a madame web movie while they try to figure out what the  to do with spiderman,2023-12-12 14:37:04
there must be some producers  going on surely everything about this movie especially after morbious was such a disaster or are the noncreative suits running things really that out of touch,2023-12-12 14:38:35

"morbius had all the things movies are supposed to have it had a plot setting characters and theme it was technically a movie the theme was unarguably the best part it was encompassed by the best line in this cinematic marvel its morbid time

a lot of people actually wanted to see morbius the only problem was that most of them regretted and didnt want to watch it again or tell anyone else to go see it madam web is doomed from the start because unlike morbius nobody seems to want to see this movie and more importantly it is almost certainly going to have way less morbid time",2023-12-12 15:38:42

"obviously ai algorithms already make all marketing decisions so no innovation or creativity exists anymore slightly facetious so i suspect its a default decision of marketing teams not knowing who their audience isafter marvels its clearly not women who will show up just to save your box office its safe bland and unappealing which is irionically the audience they seem to be creating it for

i also suspect its partly due to the desexualization of women in hollywood by major studios the most obvious examples are typical  symbols showing less skin men are excluded from this ie thor think of every gradual female costume design change in every marvel or dc movie over 10 yrs as examples there are dozens of other examples that demonstrate this trend clearly over a decade in entertainment regardless of opinion for or against it

its apparently impossible these days to market women who arent  symbols or even if they are",2023-12-12 17:08:33

"it not uncommon for movie writers to not actually…you know…write the plot at all 

plot is often already decided by producers execs etc and gets handed to the writer writer cranks out the script

there’s a lot of writers reddit seems perplexed they still have a career after a lifetime of stinkers of course they have a career they’re good contractors the producer hands them a plot outline said writer keeps his opinion to himself cranks out dialog and scene transitions the best the can if it’s wonky and needs “touch ups” because of course it is the outline isn’t good they hand it to their next contractor to fix up some bits

and that’s how you have 45 writers all of which have nothing but stinkers on their resume it’s a stinker resume to us to producers they’re contractors that do what you ask of them

it’s like…we don’t really get mad at the sound engineer on metallica’s st anger for the drums sounding like trash cans we can understand that was probably a decision he was told to do by the band or lars or their producer but for some reason we blame movie writers forgetting their often being brought it to do the same thing",2023-12-12 15:55:21

its possible these writers saved morbius from being even worse or even did amazing work on movies you love but didnt get screen credit

in the grand scheme of making movies they really had a great jumping off point just with spiderman and his related folks to work with  but they seemed to have no abilityinterest in making something good they just want to pump out good enough to make some money keep the rights and get a nice chunk of money from marvel using spidey in their movies",2023-12-12 17:26:31

yeah fully agree lots of nepotism got them opportunities and keeps things coming in but most are not net drains on the productions they are in i just haven’t seen her in a single thing that i liked other than when she called ellen a liar,2023-12-12 17:56:06
"dakota johnson is a genuinely talented actor who delivers anytime she gets a good role suspiria bad times at the el royale cha cha real smooth shes even surprisingly good in the first fifty shades despite all the other problems that movie has

im appreciative of how theyve let their channel and content mature through the years i get a lot more rewatchable enjoyment out of the more obscure stuff they talk about like the kyle gallner triple feature spectacular or when they talked about cobweb to shine a light on something good that the mainstream spotlight passed over,2023-12-12 17:45:14
thats because every time they criticize a superhero movie a fanatical base of die hard marveldisneydc fan kids raid the comments saying its actually a good movie and rlm just doesnt like it because it casts a female lead has a diverse cast is from a lesser known director is being used to set up films or etc pick your excuse,2023-12-12 17:16:32

"dracula untold made 217 million on a movie budget of 70 million that is considered a hit for the studio

to me the movie was not bad",2023-12-13 00:38:35
its also often an important stepping stone in your career you do the  jobs with very little creative output where you follow the studios plan for ten years then you get enough leeway to make the film you really want its an obvious example but ive seen people on reddit genuinely shocked that craig mazin wrote chernobyl and the last of us after starting his career on scary movie 4 and superhero movie but its not like these are equal creative ventures in his eyes its like being a session musician and writing your own album you do the soulless contract work and build a name as a reliable likable screenwriter that writes scripts that make money then you get the blank check to make the show or movie youre really interested in many auteur directors got started on car commercials you know,2023-12-12 17:25:19
"yeah and also its easy to us as consumers to look at our personal taste and opinion to dictate and find whats wrong with a movie  morbius i mean its the writing the issue right the direction and even acting were well decent passable but the plot outline and writing were atrocious 

but for producers its  and i really dont mean that to defend them i  wish i could shake them up to sense  a bit more complicated youre not making movies out of your own personal preferences peoples jobs depend on your decisions and you cant be emotional and egotistical about it you have to try and be more rational look at the numbers weight different opinions etc 

well how many absolutely great scripts flop at the box office a lot so flopping cannot be simply a matter of wellwrittenbadlywritten sometimes so many other factors are weighting in marketing actors politics time of release general interest in a subject etc and the sad reality is that holy   is it dizzying to try and decipher reviews and criticism coming at you from hundreds of thousands of different sources again for us its easy well connect with criticism and reviews that reflect our own well have our own biases towards this well point to the ones we like and say that thats the reason it failed but from an outside point of view

people saying the issue is because of the actor others because there was a scene with a donut in it others because it was cold outside some might say it was the writing the issue but some people also said inception was too confusing and that blade runner 2049 was too boring so what do people know about writing should you really pay attention to them

but for a producer its overwhelming its way too much data to process people stating their opinions online arent to be trusted because most of them are  idiots but these  idiots are the one with the money so which idiots do you listen to

the only thing they know is that a finished product makes more money than an unfinished one so yeah these scriptwriters gets hired again because their  script is 99 the same as many other  scripts that somehow for some reason rack in the cash  because thats how fickle this industry and the audience are change a line or a scene in morbius and suddenly its a box office success for some random esoterical reason im sure someone could tell me the difference in quality between the script of suicide squad venom and morbius but i cant for the life of me i have no  clue why one failed where the two others magically made money 

so why blame the writers",2023-12-12 16:57:14
on the st anger snare the engineer specifically wouldn’t have been able to do anything about the snare sound because lars had removed the actual snare off the bottom head of the snare drum so it was just basically a timbale garbage in garbage out,2023-12-12 21:46:37
this sounds accurate theyre terrible to us but to hollywood theyre reliable and bust  out when needed without hangups,2023-12-12 16:36:58
"which is sad as  producers often cant write for  so what the  would they know about building a compelling plot you cant superglue a wig to a mannequin and call it a strong female lead but they always seem to believe that its just that easy

everyone who wonders why rings of power  rotten  should look at the writing credits no career writers among them its a team of tv producers who thought its tolkien ip how hard could it be you just put the pieces in the right places and stitch it all together even if they had managed to conjure up some tolkienesque prose which they clearly couldnt the plot was bad the pacing was bad the characterization was bad it felt like a high school production because thats your average producers level of understanding when it comes to the whole writing process",2023-12-12 20:34:53
" plot is decided by producers execs etc and gets handed to the writer writer cranks out the script

but seriously id like a more age diverse cast especially when it comes to the main characters its all just so generic with only a few exceptions here and there",2023-12-12 17:19:26
nah theres made up stuff and theres made up ,2023-12-12 16:14:22
"sure if you consider everything ever written to be made up  

the difference that they mean there is some  thats made up which is actually good and then some other people see that and think they can make up  thats just as good and they cant see got seasons 16 vs season 7 the first seasons were made up by a lazy but talented writer and the last season was made up by some tv writers who thought they were just as good

thats why some  performs better than others",2023-12-12 18:04:44

cant wait for madame web to web all over the place

i would be overjoyed if they included her number one quote from the source material its webbin time",2023-12-12 15:55:00
its webbin time,2023-12-12 18:51:48
congrats on making me throw my phone across the the room,2023-12-12 16:36:03
i need you to know i hate you for making that joke but also i laughed my  off and will probably say it myself so good job lol,2023-12-12 18:33:01

what is this a webbedover episode,2023-12-12 15:47:19
this movie is going to make webillion dollars,2023-12-12 15:42:47
somehow madame web returned,2023-12-12 18:06:53

like spiderman,2023-12-12 18:38:48
until the after credits scene where we get a brief cameo from someone connected to the ones you care about with a name drop of the one you care about,2023-12-12 19:04:09

with great madame comes great web,2023-12-13 00:20:39
madame web looks just awful all around i feel like itis going to be closer to morbius than venom not sure about kraven the hunter it looks pretty bad to me but a lot of movies that look bad to me wind up doing moderately successful,2023-12-12 15:46:28
people still ate that  like it was a 5 day old donut,2023-12-12 14:52:19
i want more morbius content i want it to be the same quality as before,2023-12-12 17:27:24
"morbius got a rerelease

if anything they are making them  on purpose cause the internet seems yo love it

stop talking about it

and they will stop making them",2023-12-12 16:03:26
"i probably never wouldve watched morbius if not for people talking about how bad it was

its like when you get something to eat and its gross and so everyone youre with wants to try it only to confirm its grossness",2023-12-12 16:05:05
except people did watch it it topped charts on netflix and proved successful on streaming,2023-12-12 21:52:20
to think the director of morbius is directing the live action legend of zeldasmfh,2023-12-12 16:12:05
the way the internet made sony rerelease morbious to theaters was hilarious,2023-12-12 17:32:50
people ate that too…,2023-12-12 18:12:34
morbius  anchovies,2023-12-12 23:25:28
anchovies,2023-12-13 00:34:56
people watched that because it was bad but they watched it,2023-12-13 01:25:39
theres an alfredos pizza cafe near me so i gave it a try  if this is the good pizza pizza by alfredo really must be a hot circle of garbage,2023-12-12 15:05:33
ah yes the cici’s model of spider content,2023-12-13 03:36:59
people will eat this pizza not many people but theyll be there,2023-12-12 21:28:52
yea that’s likely the real reason they make their money one spiderman with the real releases and retain with this slop,2023-12-13 00:17:11
and even with venom im sceptical how long it will continue the second one still turned a profit but it was a significant step down from the first financially and thats with a big name like carnage attached,2023-12-13 10:08:43
ben carson was a fantastic neurosurgeon but a hapless politician sony has both the midas and the brown touch,2023-12-12 14:39:56
even if you boiled it down to the response  performance of one movie your aim shouldn’t be to emulate anything morbius did  instead someone  decided to steer into the skid and become another morbius  the even dumber thing is that they probably have a good idea in here somewhere getting johnson and sweeney is a casting coup but the execution looks to be utter garbage,2023-12-12 14:42:23
its a big company plenty of room for geniuses and morons,2023-12-12 14:53:10
sony pictures and sony interactive entertainmentplaystation studios are two different companies theyre both under the umbrella of sony the conglomerate but their both independent of each other i think there was even a case of sony music suing sony pictures or it may have been the other way around,2023-12-12 15:46:06
theyre ostensibly different companies ran by totally different people  their main money maker is actually insurance and you can be  sure their best leadership probably go there,2023-12-12 15:36:40
uhthe spiderverse movies,2023-12-12 15:25:08
"sony lucks out more than not with their games i think they have some really good tentpole franchises that elevate the entire brand but when you get rid of those big names theres not much else  

the day one of their big budget games truly flops is going to  them",2023-12-12 15:28:22
"the spiderverse movies are fantastic 

almost all of their live action films arenot",2023-12-12 16:48:58
i feel like their games are also mostly a crapshoot regardless of budget doesnt sony make most of their money on electronics,2023-12-12 16:52:07
"for real doing the ezekiel story without peter is already the dumbest thing possible but making it into a girlsquad film at the same time is beyond the pale who the  greenlit this travesty

not to mention the trailer could have been taken right out of 2002 the exact same  exposition dialogue as they use to do back then why on earth would you want to go back to that",2023-12-12 16:00:43
they’re completely different companies it’s not so surprising,2023-12-12 16:08:09
except for the spiderverse,2023-12-12 17:33:37
their animation and tv studios are actually decent to good their live action movie division doesnt understand movies,2023-12-12 17:55:37
basically separate companies with the name sony on them,2023-12-12 19:01:21
its weird how good their animated spidermovies are compared to how bad their live action spidermovies are when marvel studios isnt doing the heavy lifting,2023-12-12 15:00:53
"spiderman as an ip is worth more than the majority of marvel

yeah sony would be dumb to give it back to disney especially since they paid  basically pennies for it back in the early 00s",2023-12-12 15:02:11
the live action sony movies  but they are also responsible for the spidervese films and spiderman games which are the best superhero media to come out in recent years,2023-12-12 15:18:15
spiderman is the most popular superhero worldwide by a good margin sony would be  to give him up,2023-12-12 16:30:43
the toys and franchise deals alone make way more money than the movies,2023-12-12 16:57:29
lol when was marvel ever offering 5 billion,2023-12-12 16:46:50
it isnt about them making bank its about not letting the competition make bank,2023-12-13 07:07:33
i feel like you missed a really ripe opportunity to say purrrview,2023-12-12 18:25:50
"while the playstation is in fact an intellectual property when someone uses ip in this context theyre almost universally referring to characters and settings not hardware

in this case referring to the fact that sony owns the rights to moviegame productions that contain the spiderman ip which has generally been one of their primary cows for quick cash in recent years

its worse ezekiel simsmight be something inbetween and the trailer cut it together he was in the amazon with my mom when she was researching spiders right before she died im confident the second bit at least isnt cut together and its hardly going to be the worst thing in this movie but who looked at that and okayed it,2023-12-12 15:14:31
this isn’t that bad of a line sometimes i think this site just tries to find thing they can meme on i’ve heard worse writing before this throw away line in a trailer,2023-12-12 14:41:24
and what exactly is the problem with that line,2023-12-12 14:59:09
tom as eddie was the most entertaining performance i had seen in ages jim carrey in liar liar vibes,2023-12-12 15:37:36
for me the venom movies become infinitely more enjoyable if you just watch it like a buddy cop film,2023-12-12 17:49:17
hardys commitment is maybe the only reason those movies are watchable  but its also the thing that makes me resent them for being so aggressively mediocre because hardy deserves better for all his efforts,2023-12-12 22:13:59
tom’s willingness to make it as  as possible without onscreen  is the best part about these movies,2023-12-12 15:38:55
cmon hes clearly giving over 9000,2023-12-12 15:44:04
the ben reilly saga was one of the most hated storylines in comics i don’t think anyone involved with the ip wants to dredge that up,2023-12-12 17:36:31
"oh not just them they have cowriters for this one they wrote the story with some random person named kerem sanga whos either the guy looking  or behind the two ladies here and who wrote some random  movies no ones hears off

then the morbius duo wrote the script from that story they wrote with that random dude with the director whos previously made an assload of tv and some random chick named claire fun fact that was the working titlecode name for the movie during production parker who hasnt done diddlysquat

this is about to be a  masterpiece",2023-12-12 15:58:52

well those actresses would have actually have wanted to be in this train wreck i’m willing to bet there weren’t plenty of talented actresses that wanted to be cast in this…,2023-12-13 03:22:30
i dont know how to describe it but she has probably the flattest voice i have ever heard,2023-12-12 15:43:07

i graduated from one of canadas top business schools with really good grades,2023-12-12 22:35:56
it will lose less money than the marvels though,2023-12-12 14:29:11

gotta love how the marvels is the new gold standart for movie bombs,2023-12-12 14:33:06
audiences are dumb this could easily make more money than the marvels while being  a worse movie,2023-12-12 17:50:25
doubtful as i doubt sony spent as much money as disney spent on the marvels not counting on rewrites reshoots and the  awful unfinished vfx,2023-12-12 18:32:27
which is a shame because you could genuinely argue that whatever the  this movie is gonna be almost has to be guaranteed to be worse than the marvels if were just basing it off of morbius,2023-12-12 15:00:25
it wont its budget is only 80m and 160m is guaranteed to while it will for sure be an underperformer it will at least be doubling its budget back unlike the marvels,2023-12-12 14:50:38
please dont insult the first two seasons of the flash like that,2023-12-12 17:59:04

that’s the nepotism working,2023-12-13 00:29:08
she was in 50 shades of grey so you know she can act,2023-12-12 17:53:01
it feels like throwing something cheap out there to keep the spidey rights…which is probably the actual reason,2023-12-12 21:07:27
i think its because their kids never had to work hard and never had to develop that drive that creates personality and charisma,2023-12-13 08:32:36

"i’m not so sure marvel is pumping the breaks” i think the actors and writers strike has delayed everything and with secret invasion doing so badly and apparently was a mess during production and them reviewing daredevil footage and saying “ is this ”  they’re taking an opportunity to fix what’s wrong 

will they succeed i doubt it but who knows",2023-12-12 18:18:54

no spiderman no initial havoc if not venom no idea who you mean i havent touched the other movies theyre so bad",2023-12-12 15:50:10
as far as i can tell this director has never made a movie before though she does seem to have quite a bit of experience in tv it is unusual for someones first feature to be a big budget studio film that would lead me to believe that she doesnt have a ton of creative control and the studio is going to really dictate what this movie ends up looking like this is the same studio that gave us morbius so thats not ideal maybe im wrong and i hope i am but im not super optimistic about this,2023-12-12 15:56:46
this is being written by the same people who wrote morbius so no,2023-12-12 19:24:18
those arent minus spider man though and sony animation is a different division than the live action movies,2023-12-12 19:24:46
same thing with the name placements and masks in movies reason why i didnt like smith as deadshot in suicide squad always took off his mask to talk its an ego and contract thing i guess,2023-12-12 14:26:58
and it’s a  name for a movie you don’t just have to call the movie by the character’s name it’s lazy and indicative of a poorly written film,2023-12-12 14:28:11
i just think the movie looks like  for the very reasons you described not to mention sony hasnt had a good record of quality with spiderman movies without spiderman,2023-12-13 00:19:01
whos arguing i dont know what the  madam web is in any context so youre not a million miles away i wouldnt have cared to see it regardless i just saw a ridiculous comment and chucked in a silly reply,2023-12-12 19:06:53
the marvels still did better than the all male cast expendables 4 movies are in a rutt has nothing to do with the gender of the cast,2023-12-13 02:45:07
"not in the imdb casting list i heard this movie takes place in the 90s thats 20 odd years before we see peter parker so anyone in this movie would be that much older by the time of homecoming 

besides i thought black cat was getting her own movie",2023-12-12 15:53:40
no i’m sure it’s the other way around sony have to sign off on any disney marvel property involving spiderman himself i may be wrong though,2023-12-12 19:13:15
all good but yes technically sony still owns spiderman he’s just on loan to the mcu as for the spiderverse movies same thing all sony that’s why sonys been able to done every ps5 spiderman game with much smaller royalties to marveldisney,2023-12-13 02:11:34
i know dozens of people enjoyed it,2023-12-12 17:24:41

just such a  movie",2023-12-12 22:52:48
"it is certainly hilarious so it has that going for it faster than a falling star but cannot catch someone falling from a height 

the highlight of the movie is definitely the soldiers who literally blindfold themselves to fight against him and their nonsensical reasoning that they wont be afraid if they cannot see him 

i am not sure if the writer was just mocking their own movie with those scenes or just trying to turn it into a comedy",2023-12-12 23:16:57
yeah dracula untold is actually a pretty good monster movie,2023-12-12 18:14:27
found luke evans account,2023-12-12 22:19:06
me too i liked the armor design,2023-12-12 22:32:36
honestly i kinda did too it was a ok movie but certainly not good enough to live up to their aspirations of it being the foundation of some monsterverse,2023-12-12 19:02:43
same i honestly hoping they were going somewhere with it,2023-12-12 22:06:01
it also takes artists in any discipline years to get really good true some seem to be great from the start but these are the outliers a lot of todays best screenwriters learned and honed the skills that make them great writing films that arent well remembered or received,2023-12-12 20:24:33
the director of everything everywhere directed the music video for “turn down the what”,2023-12-12 20:58:53
"mazin is a good point of reference because it’s notable that in film writers generally have less control over the rest of the process after turning in a draft but on television writers sometimes run the whole show and even choose directors so if you associate a writer with a terrible film but they wrote a whole series that you liked it’s possible the film’s lack of quality isn’t their fault and the tv series is more representative 

actually in film they might have turned in a draft and then never heard from the studio again meanwhile a bunch of writers were called in and made new revisions and punched up the script but since they didn’t fully change the structure and plot or some percentage of the thing the original writers got credit of the barelyrecognizable screenplay through wga arbitration",2023-12-12 22:03:13
big names arent immune to this either alita was a passion project for john williams that he funded with his own money now that avatar 2 is out he can work on alita 2 edit james cameron not john williams  brain,2023-12-13 17:23:41
back in the old days you worked for cheap on  movies because thats what those projects could afford now it seems like the big studios are cutting costs by hiring the cheap writers for their major projects and thats why were getting underwhelming  i cant tell you how many movies ive seen lately that have so much potential to be great but the dialogue is so terrible that it sounds unnatural and ruins the experience maybe im a snob though who knows,2023-12-12 22:05:13
"i totally agree with you on most points but i do note that suicide squad and venom marketed to showcase the humanity and humor in their movies while all the ads for morbius seemed like were going for a dark and psychologically deep horror thriller about bats vampires idk jared leto is in it and we know hes a creep but his eyes give sick contrast

morbius seemed to be aiming for the angry teenage boy audience which is a solid audience it worked for the dark knight but didnt showcase the buddy cop aspect of the other two any romance any physical or metaphorical light plus jared leto is icky imo so thats why i didnt see it but watched the other two i still dont know what its about despite having seen several advertisements for it just have a vague concept of jared leto and maybe bats 

so its not the writers so much as the producers and marketing people probably being like its a comic book movie i think so were gonna really try to get that angsty 1222 year old boy crowd and any jared leto fans still hanging around make it mysterious and the writers did their jobs",2023-12-12 17:18:26
im not exactly hot and fresh with that joke holy  has it been 20 years but enjoy having that in your head,2023-12-13 01:47:08
my fellow human thats the secret a bunch of movies have always  you just dont remember them because nobody that watched them remembers them,2023-12-12 16:14:13
nowadays there have always been big budget movies that  in fact good ones have always been the minority,2023-12-12 21:47:05
the big push in modern industry is to commoditize as much of production  possible  anything too valuable to replace needs to be replaced asap,2023-12-12 18:58:02
i mean people have schedules as much as movies are an art they have a business operations side thats unavoidable people need to be able to set and commit to schedules so that they can commit to other areas of their life and coordinate thats how the grown up world works movies take a lot of people to make them and its unfair to keep all of them in limbo waiting to know when to go or having their schedule pushed backrearranged while the creative soul artistic writer shirks deadlines because that feels too much like an office job a lot of these people need to finish this job on time so they can make the beginning of their next one so they dont lose it so that they can pay their bills,2023-12-12 17:47:01

"the comics didnt but there were interviews over the years that did so if you forget about aunt mary for a while have you ever wondered why peter himself looks like hes 40 years old 

its because ditko largely drew peter by studying his own reflection and he was around 40 himself so guess how aunt may came into being you guessed it by ditko considering what his own aunts looked like and they had to be 60 or older so thats how you end up with grandma aunt may who is canonically a 50yearold aunt to a high school student",2023-12-12 18:16:45

it was relatively normal to have a sibling 15 years older than you before the 90s if peters parents were 2035 years older than him his aunt could be 3550 years older and itd be normal

also being considered too old at 40 used to be viewed as somewhat normal marisa tomei was 52 when she debuted as aunt may when the show debuted the golden girls were three 55yearolds and ones 80year old mom",2023-12-12 18:26:19

yeah that never made sense to me,2023-12-13 02:28:45
an aunt and uncle could be 60  i know quite a few people that have big age gaps in between siblings,2023-12-13 13:50:32

that was just morbius morbid fascination,2023-12-13 12:48:28
morbius didnt really make much money though budget is listed at 75m and the movie made 167m at the worldwide box office the general rule of thumb is that the marketing budget adds a 2x multiplier to the production budget for the total cost of the movie so sony spent 150m on morbius for 167m in box office returns not the sort of success that would get them to keep making movies like that i think this is more riding the coattails of how successful the venom movies were rather than anything morbius did,2023-12-12 19:15:54

"except the times we remember sucky films best of all something has changed the decoupling of artist and art is on a scale that never existed before actors arent in the same room as their scene partners were approaching passable digital humans theres various technical ways the human element is being removed this in addition to the subjective ways storytelling and writing have suffered
the fact i can watch century old film containing coherent writing means so can everyone else involved filmmakers of the past had to work hard to track down old prints today i click a button theres no excuse today to not produce something coherent",2023-12-13 01:15:15
"yes its pretty much always been the case that for every good movie that stands the test of time theres 100  movies which are soon forgotten same as any other creative media from tv shows to music to theater productions to novels etc

the thing with movies though is that their production and distribution has always been dominated a very big very centralised industry for a long time the quality at the top end of that industry has been consistently quite high aside from the occasional bomb most of the lowquality stuff comes from the middle or bottom of the industry or from outside the industry mainstream entirely

but recently this situation has basically reversed  the proportion of goodtobad movies hasnt changed much but how theyre distributed relative to the subset of releases most people are actually exposed to certainly has and while this kind of thing has actually happened a few times in cinema history its the first time this situation has arisen in living memory for anyone under the age of about 50 or so so it seems unusual and its not surprising that people feel like all movies  these days",2023-12-13 00:00:28

this probably stems from the 90s when marvel which was owned by a toy company at the time toybiz was facing bankruptcy and so sold their cinematic rights to sony fox universal etc fox and universal also didnt have merchandising rights

yeah but what im saying is knowing that theres further context may dissuade some people from seeing the movie immediately because they want to watch the show thats exactly my situation,2023-12-12 18:49:10
yes this has a big chance  but it does have a big nice looking shirtless dude so it will probably pull in more women than the marvels plus how much did it cost  i am hearing the marvels cost 300 million  and they may only make a little more than 23rds of that  pretty big bomb,2023-12-12 19:09:48
the flash lost money it did bring in 270 million worldwide box office and pretty sure it cost less than the marvels which will probably not make 220 million  so you tell me,2023-12-12 19:07:46

netflix paid sony for morbius streaming rights and it topped for the period of time where it was brought to the service to the point where netflix signed a deal for future sony movie streaming rights from what was discussed about the financials of it it seems like sony makes money from the netflix deal makes money from the box office and netflix has prepaid for the production of these movies

it doesnt hurt that theyve made a bunch of money on the spiderverse and venom films they pretty much have free reign to keep throwing things at the wall to see what sticks it seems to be working for them financially theyre 4 by market share for 2023 edging out paramount and on warner bros heels",2023-12-12 19:33:52

we also have no idea if sony would have walked away from the deal had they not gotten perpetual rights and marvel were desperate for the money yes the sony films have been mostly  but it was their raimi trilogy that played the biggest part in getting studios to see superhero films as something worth putting money and effort into making",2023-12-12 16:23:35

not really sony is doing very well with spider verse you can’t just say sony is doing a bad job when both of those movies exist especially when they were better than any marvel movie released this year,2023-12-12 18:20:37
not the point im making never said it was a good thing just pointing out that how big of a flop the marvels really was also there is a big difference between a flop that isnt even able to make its budget cost back and a flop that makes more than its budget cost back both are flops but theres still a difference,2023-12-12 15:40:30
i think 160m is definitely possible sure its obviously not gonna be a very good movie but that doesnt stop people from going to see it most people agree the marvels  but that actually made a bit more than people expected,2023-12-12 15:38:19

so back then if you wanted to see a movie you would watch it in theaters and if you just wanted to watch a movie you wouldn’t have as many choices as now and if you wanted some form of passive entertainment you also had less choices 

all those factors and more would account for why historical movies even when adjusted for inflation do not make appearances as the largest flops",2023-12-12 19:22:51

no im saying that with foresight the goal of selling the rights was to save the company and return it to prosperity right they really couldnt foresee ever being in a position to want those rights back like never ever  wb sold rights to dc characters over the years but they always reverted back after a period of time or number of films the perpetual license sony has over spiderman was ip law malpractice on the part of whoever worked out the deal on marvels side",2023-12-13 03:15:09
"there was a few comic book movies in the 90s that did decently to well like blade and spawn 

part of marvels business problems though was during the peak of xmen in the 90s they over extended while doing cost cutting measures that would prove costly one of the reasons comic book dealers still hate them today though in the past decade or so theyve done plenty of new things to  comic book dealers

in general the movie rights sales kept them afloat enough to make a come back with the ultimate universe 1610 until disney bought them outright and started using the comics division as an ipconcept farm to support their mcu project

it should be noted marvel comics sales have been poor since the mid 2000s roughly after interest in the ultimate universe declined however comics in general is really niche on its own as a whole theres some ups and downs in the last decade or so as fueled by cape movies but right now comic book dealers are steamed at marvel again for the nth time because marvel bundles comics they arent selling to their niche customer bases with the comics that actually do sell",2023-12-12 19:38:20

yeah but this is much more low profile it’s got nothing recognizable as far as superheroes go i don’t think dakota johnson is a huge draw it’s already being received badly and being compared to morbius could do much worse than that one,2023-12-12 15:54:57
i agree with all of that i just think disney used that “bigoted nerds” argument to try to rebut all criticism not just the gross misogyny,2023-12-18 08:22:00
i agree an overarching story about one or a few protagonist monster hunters having to deal with different monsters over the course of multiple movies with crossovers could be cool,2023-12-12 23:16:13
"i dont think this logic actually holds

its basically a statement that movies are strictly doing worse and worse over time and thus its to be expected that all the worst films will always be modern due to reasons that have nothing to do with their perceived quality but the successful films look the same regardless of era its actually pretty remarkable but the fact that the top list can include gone with the wind star wars titanic avatar and endgame all pretty clustered together says that the benchmark is pretty much the benchmark right its about whether or not the public embraces the film not the schedule on which they watched it in the theater yes people see movies for shorter periods now but there are also more theaters with bigger auditoriums and more screens the proof of this is ticket sales those films all fall in pretty much the same range midhigh 300m

theres other implied arguments to this that dont really hold up ie one assumption is that having the option to watch something on streaming means a lost ticket sale as opposed to a gained stream view ie that the person never would have seen it in a theater not that they chose not to because streaming was an option there are some movies where this is clearly the case but there are others where its not clear ie five nights did exceptionally well both in the box office and streaming",2023-12-12 20:29:54

but ofc it’s entirely subjective",2023-12-12 18:49:07
again never said its not a flop just because it makes more than its production cost also the 25x rule doesnt always apply it only does when a films marketing budget is the same cost of similar to its production budget example if a movie has a production budget of 150m  a 150m marketing budget its break even point would be about 375m but if the production budget is 150m and marketing budget is 100m its break even point would be more like 325m so for madame web for example production budget is 80 so well assume the marketing budget is also 80m so its break even point would be exactly 200m and probably even lower cause i doubt its marketing budget is 80m so ultimately we could assume it has a break even point of say 180m,2023-12-12 15:49:32

firstly i never stated a specific movies marketing budget it was just a hypothetical second its easy to doubt its marketing budget is up to 80m because it seems to have weak marketing strategies and hasnt been advertised very strongly a movie with a marketing budget like that what be marketed much better also there are some cases where the confirmed marketing budget for a film is significantly less than its production budget this goes for not just smaller films but some big blockbuster films as well the 25x rule makes sense for a lot of big blockbusters but not all,2023-12-12 16:00:20
"the population has grown exponentially in that time frame so now fewer and fewer people on a percentage basis go to the movies as there are other forms of entertainment and ways to view shows and movies which was my point lol

you have literally been agreeing with me hah

you have to look at other things than just inflation on total cost and revenue as many things do not actually follow the rate of inflation lol 

do the contracts for actors take up a bigger proportional cost now would be one thing 

do ticket prices follow inflation from some quick googling ticket prices are actually rising higher than inflation from 1940 movie tickets to now based on avg price of ticket so then one would assume all else equal that a movie would be profitable with less ticket sales kind of arguing against myself here lol

like i said there are so many variables beyond adjusting for inflation as many costs may not actually follow inflation look at professional athletes pay that outpaces inflation the nfl salary cap for ex in 2000 was 621 million it is now 2248 mil that is doubling the rate of inflation so i would assume top actors and directors outpace it as well that means you can’t just say that you could make a movie for 15 mil in 1975 and adjust for inflation and you could make the same movie today the 2 lead actors salary very well may outpace the inflation adjustment lol

 i would assume there is a larger special effects and editing budget now than before etc",2023-12-12 21:43:38

if we use google trends for batman and spiderman since 2004present and worldwide we get that batman is more popular in searchs with the two having ups and downs when a new thing is released with batman dominating most countries in the world

this year for example spiderman is very close and having a lot of ups we can say it is a very good year for spiderman and he is more popular currently
