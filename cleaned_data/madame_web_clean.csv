"overall a good addition but few things didn’t work for me
1 the effects of rebecca’s death didn’t really seem to take a toll on a level i expected her character seemed more like an after thought throughout
2 gabriel’s history with ethan didn’t really work for me it felt like it was simply added on in the last minute to give him something he is recurring character so perhaps  be better over the course of two films
3 the editing was wonky during the train sequence they were cutting abruptly between the guys exposition and tom’s bike ride could have had been more streamlined 

loved atwell’s addition and the action was once again top notch watched it twice already and had a really good time",2023-07-12
the two cia agents chasing ethan were oddly enjoyable characters when he felt for the mask on kittridge that was an awesome payoff,2023-07-12
"so entity what’s the next part of your master plan

why crashing this train with no survivors",2023-07-12
"the train sequence is one of the wildest stunts i’ve ever seen the kitchen car the piano wild very uncharted 2 like

my biggest issue is gabriel i appreciate the attempt at fleshing out ethan’s premi days and why join the imf but giving me a 5 second grainy clip 7 movies in and saying here’s ethans old nemesis you should hate him too was rough

here’s hoping pom is alive and joins the team the next go round",2023-07-12
can someone help me out was kittridge in on the world domination stuff with cary elwes or was he just trying to get the key i was a little lost with their plot line at the end,2023-07-12

anyone think it was a bit odd that at the end of this movie they have to travel underwater to an imploded sub given the timing of the events that happened with oceangate a couple weeks ago the entity knows all,2023-07-12
"holy  hayley atwell is  gorgeous ive also only seen pom in marvel but i think she did fantastic even with her limited lines

the movie definitely needed more gabriel and a little clearer motives does the entity just want to destroy the sub because it contains its only weakness why not have gabriel immediately destroy the key when he found it why doesnt the ai just launch a few nukes at where the sub is i highly doubt this  tier ai cant figure out where the sub that it hacked is located

also hayley atwells character is what indiana jones attempted to do with their untrustworthy british woman sidekick but they failed miserably compared to this movie",2023-07-12
"did anyone feel like this one pays significant homage to the first mi film 

kitridge played a huge role 

masks were a major character more than usual it felt 

train sequence 

lots of close up claustrophobic shots 

70s thriller vibes 

i really need to see it again to fully process it",2023-07-12
"yeah okay its quite a good movie but im gonna be pretty upset about ilsas death for a while

was it pretty heavily telegraphed by the trailers and gabriels ultimatum between ilsa and a character that was 100 going to be in the train scene and the subtext in every interaction between ilsa and ethan and kittridge saying ethan was gonna lose something while a giant picture of ilsas face looked over the conversation in the background  yes but i was in denial  she did get a great final fight and her death is layered enough for it to not technically be a fridging she makes the choice to go save grace and the predictability of that choice is thematically important but it still felt like she was underutilized  i think her last line was some offhand question to the white widow in the club and then she doesnt say anything until her death  she really doesnt say much the whole movie now that i think about it  even in fallout when she was hiding a lot of the time you could really feel her presence  and then they only mention her by name a couple of times in the following scene before shes kind of forgotten  for the fourth character in the entire series to make it more than two movies in a row ethan luther benji it felt like she deserved more especially since shes mcquarries character and not a holdover from a previous director  i suppose the effect its having on me means it was an effective choice though  those few scenes where she and ethan were momentarily happy together were everything  still bitter  im gonna sit over here and mourn for a while

in other news nice to see shea whigham step out of his comfort zone and play a wellmeaning cop that becomes an obstacle for the main characters havent seen that for a few weeks",2023-07-12

"vanessa kirby really knocked it out of the park as masked grace

there were times i felt like it was really atwell with cgi layered beneath but no that’s definitely kirby acting her  off haha",2023-07-14
maybe its just because their eyes were eight feet tall on my screen but how did nobody else notice that atwell and kirby have completely different eye colors like excuse me who replaced my boss ice glare with these big brown puppy dog eyes ,2023-07-12

why are you telling someone else to shoot her when you literally are already aimed with your hand on the trigger

why even bother to have her leave it on the table in the first place if youre just going to shoot her regardless",2023-07-12
"grace freaking out about going on the train just for ethan to covince her by hitting her with the mbappe line

ill be there no matter what",2023-07-12
grace accidentally doing donuts in a fiat in rome while being chased down by everyone in existence was one of the funniest moments this franchise has to offer i loved the threat of this film being the entity and gabriel it feels so ominous with its predictions it’s not as air tight as fallout but this film is a blast of an entry that is up there with better half of this franchise it’s awesome that the cast of the film and creatives have made us so comfortable with these casts that we can have moments like the ones on the canals where the characters just visually acknowledge each other with few words the chemistry between the new additions and the mainstays in these films is just phenomenal as always i could watch so many more of these characters just bouncing off each other,2023-07-12
"surely theyre not going to fake ilsas death twice in the same movie 

sad to see her character die benji and luther are both tech wizards and it was really fun to see another badass entering the field with ethan",2023-07-12
ethan constantly saying “it’s okay” to people when they’re in near death scenarios is one of my favorite running bits in the franchise,2023-07-12
loved the fight scene in the alleyway so claustrophobic and frustrating,2023-07-12
absolutely loved briggs checking everybody for masks i wonder why ethan didnt use one for the airport sequence,2023-07-12
whenever luther says i have hacked something it always gives me a chuckle like its the most unconvincing tone vic uses that amuses me,2023-07-12
"the universal consensus here seems to be—

1 fallout is still the best one

2 faust’s death was a rough point in an otherwise strong narrative 

3 the villain’s just sorta… there certainly no cavill 

4 despite the poor treatment to faust the ladies really killed it this time around 

5 a lot more like the first film in the franchise assumedly building up to a heavy action oriented second half

6 mcquarrie’s weakest yet still very stong entry",2023-07-12
"i really enjoyed this superb action great humour and  near every setpiece competes with the showstoppers of previous films

atwell is great and makes a superb addition to the team loved pom and seeing kittridge back was great

the only thing i really didnt like was the decision to  off ilsa rebecca ferguson was such a brightspot of these recent films and this choice was a genuine vibekiller that harmed my enjoyment for a good 15 minutes but that train sequence roared it back to life",2023-07-12
was anyone else genuinely devastated when ilsa died i didn’t even realize how much i loved having rebecca ferguson in this franchise like when alec baldwin died in fallout i just kinda shrugged and moved on this one kinda hit differently tho,2023-07-12
i really loved this movie and i hate when people get mad about a character dying but… it  sucks to know part 2 won’t feature ilsa unless they’re going heavy on flashbacks or did some  fakeout i think her character is far more compelling than haley atwell’s and the replacement leaves me feeling hollow,2023-07-12
when benjie activates self driving i almost shouted in the theater “why would you do that” esp since the entity literally just hacked through their laptops what makes them think that the entity couldn’t also just hack through the self driving feature and crash the car,2023-07-12
"oh we finally have a thread on this

i saw it this afternoongod   that psychopath did it again

this movie was great  and despite it being a part oneit was a fully fleshed out and finished film that stands completely on its own  if the next one had a different name that wouldnt take away or being confusing at all

the one complaint is that it felt a bit overly long with how it was paced but the choreography was top notch",2023-07-12
"great movie fallout is still the best one though hayley atwell was incredible and so magnetic great to see my boy shea whigham get some cool  to do and great seeing henry czerny back for the first time since the first movie 

the motorbike stunt was ruined by the hundreds of behind the scenes clips promoting it however still cool but not as impressive on screen as the stunts in 4 5 or 6 killing off ilsa after the misdirect of her dying at the very start was a bit  to be honest and the villain was pretty weak the whole ai plot was a bit average but ultimately this film was well worth the wait 

also anyone else think we really weren’t going to get the intro with the theme tune after about 10 mins had passed already",2023-07-12
"i felt like ilsas death was random and out of blue like i felt confusion rather than sadness  it has to be a misdirection right or did something happen behind the scenes they spent last two movies building up her character and relationship with ethan she felt like a second main character almost all that for her to be fridged i enjoyed the movie a lot but i just couldnt stop thinking about how weird her death was 

i hope she comes back somehow because that death was not given weight or build up it deserved",2023-07-12
"i thought it was a fun movie if a bit expositiony i appreciated the goofiness of the action sequences with hayley atwell

that said the way they killed off ilsa was so weird that i hope it was a misdirect she’s barely there and then she dies without much fanfare for a character that has been so important for the last two movies if this is it for ilsa they did her dirty",2023-07-12
"ok it’s good just to get that out of the way 

loved the train sequence obviously love hayley of course liked the cops chasing ethan in intense frustration soundtrack was outstanding 

but man this had some misses for me hated what happened to ilsa’s character not a fan of how much chasing there was grace runs away from ethan like 6 separate occasions… feels like it could have streamlined a little doesn’t feel like the supporting crew has much to do at all and the villain is just sort of there 

and the biggest let down for me is this one didn’t have any kind of elaborate heist plan grace wears a mask but compared to the elaborate heists in previous mi movies there was nothing even close to kidnapping psh from the vatican the burj khalifa swap breaking into the kremlin etc i don’t think i would even put this in like my top five in the series didn’t feel like a mi movie to an extent 

looking forward to part 2 but hoping for a 45 minute insane set piece if possible",2023-07-12
"amazing movie outside of the ilsa death and immediately getting ‘replaced’ 

did rebecca ferguson want out of the franchise because the way her character was handled in this movie was bizarre",2023-07-12
this is probably my least favorite of the mcquarrieinvolving mission impossible movies which is impressive because its still a solid 810 i cant wait to watch every second of the making of feature on the train crash,2023-07-12
"it has coincidentally been 12 years this month since captain americafirst avenger came out so why the  did it take this long for hayley to land a huge role like this i’m happy she did but man she should be getting more roles 

like  i can’t get that slick  tap on the shoulder move ethan did outta my mind immediately she was captivating and their chemistry was great 

the movie was great looking forward to the next one and the whole train sequence reminded me of uncharted 2 which is another funny coincidenceparallel because ethan and grace remind me of nathan and chloe or elena 

and i got to give a shoutout to pom klementieff she was clearly having fun driving that big humvee",2023-07-12
solomon lane was so much better than gabriel,2023-07-13
"rebecca ferguson is killing it this summer 

shes the lead in silo

"overall i’m pretty disappointed with the movie especially considering fallout being a masterpiece

the editing and direction of many scenes was messy and just not very tight weird cuts to similar but slightly different shots or angles it just didn’t feel very deliberate or focused sometimes compare it to a fincher movie… at this level i expect more

some of the fight choreography was just plain weak because it make no sense especially ilsa on the bridge in venice they kept dancing around each other instead of actually trying to  one another with the sword and knife john wick this is not 

also the agent trying to shoot hunt for the entire film gets plenty of possible shots but never takes it then what’s the point even he keeps chasing him for what

i hate to say it but the major setpieces the one everyone knows from the preview and the train that follows are overreliant on vfx and look somewhat cheapfake they barely show hunt falling from the motorcycle jump and cut away so soon it’s a shame because we know some parts are real but the over the top nature of most of the last train scenes actually takes away from the impact of those real scenes

the villain of the story is weak both the entity and the person who works for him gabriel he’s just a dude who can be scary but mostly because we are told he is i sure hope there’s more to “the entity” because it lacks any interesting properties maybe there’s more to it another character or party it needs more of a motivation i kept thinking of the ai in the game metal gear solid 2 which had some great dialogue on why it was taking control

the ending of the film is also just such a downer no real tease for the next one no big twist or cliffhanger it just kinda ends right after the train stops which also went on for way too long

best parts of the movie

 the entire airport part
 hunt inside the hq gassing his bosses and talking to kittrige
 pom being a maniac the whole movie

buster keaton up in heaven hooting and hollering good flick but way more exposition heavy than i expected based on how economical fallout was i didn’t mind the slightly campier tone either,2023-07-12
"ethan hunt crash landing into a moving orient express saving grace from being shot got the loudest applause and cheers in my screening over cruise’s signature stunt jumping off a cliff on his motorbike was not on my bingo card that scene is pure comedy gold whoever of the writers that though of that was genius 

btw i’m sure it’s not just me but the movie didn’t even feel like it was 2hrs with its almost 3hr runtime it’s an incredibly paced film",2023-07-12
"it’s a weird one to talk about because i generally enjoyed the  out of it but it also feels like the first time since 2 that one of these hasn’t bested it’s predecessor and maybe that’s a bit harsh since fallout was as good as it was

the few quandaries i have are minor but i might as well mention them one maybe i missed something but i didn’t get how whigham and co were always showing up wherever ethan was once or twice is one thing but for the sheer number of places they go i would’ve hoped for some explanation it’s not like a ‘plot hole’ or anything just curious 

two did the ‘climb up through a falling train’ sequence at the very end feel like it was one train car too many to anyone else started to feel a smidge too repetitive 

and three i know ethan cares about people in general but gabriel positing that ethan would have to choose between ilsa someone who he’s had a history with for the past couple movies and grace essentially a random pickpocket he met a day or two ago… treating those potential deaths as emotionally equivalent struck me as odd is all of course having to make an active choice to say  grace isn’t something ethan would do but it felt like the movie was treating it as some sophie’s choice

again even lodging these ‘’’complaints’’’ feels odd as this is easily one of the best blockbusters we’ve gotten since the start of the pandemic but when your predecessor is mifallout the smudges seem to show a bit more",2023-07-12
"a lot of mixed thoughts on this one 

obviously top notch action  and overall i think it’s really good  

there were a few more clunky parts here that kept it from being as sharp as fallout 

i do kind of wish they hadn’t shown the bike jump so much and so often leading up to the movie  

i do think i will like it more on further watches   i saw it last night at an advance screening and was kind of annoyed right off the bat when they showed not one but two sneak previews for mission impossible dead reckoning part one",2023-07-12
justice for ilsa,2023-07-12
"alright i have a lot of thoughts so i apologize for how inarticulate this is but here goes

i loved this movie and consider it third best behind 1 fallout and 2 rogue nation my biggest gripe with the film was with ilsas death and ive been sniffing that copium hard since i saw it last night i think my love for this movie will either stay the same or decrease based on how its resolved in part 2 because i personally think shes still alive

i feel like this was mcqs love letter to the first mi because there are some key similarities to name a few

1 dr part 1 was less actioncentric than the previous installments and focused more on deception spycraft and sleight of hand
2 both featured an explosive final act that took place on a train
3 return of henry czernys key character kittridge and most importantly
4 a death on a bridge

ilsas death was so abrupt and completely unceremonious  even alec baldwin got a more dramatic sendoff than rebecca ferguson the scene right after her death ethan and the gang are talking about how they need to deceive the entity this leads me to believe its possible that ethan wanted the most capable agent on their team to be able to operate outside of the entitys purview assuming she is even outside of it even after faking her death

also paris suffers a similar stab wound to ilsa and at the end she has a pulse

i refuse to believe that mcq would be so careless to  her off in such a disappointing manner simply to raise the stakes when they were already doing that with all of the expositional dialogue and heist scenes beforehand mcq breathed the character of ilsa into the franchise and clearly has love for her as do many fans of the franchise to me shes easily the second best character behind ethan in these movies because she more or less operates as an equal which makes things really interesting since shes more morally grey than ethan

i really hope that the introduction of grace wasnt the reason that mcq felt it necessary to off ilsa simply because we cant have two badass female supporting characters in one franchise

at the same timethe fact that they already faked ilsas death in the beginning once leads me to have doubts about my theorybecause if she is alive in part 2 then yeah having a second fakeout is honestly quite silly

i really loved this movie but if shes gone for real then ill be incredibly disappointed especially because of how it happened someone please whisper sweet nothings in my ear and tell me everythings gonna be okay someone please get mcq on the phone and have him tell me that hes saving ilsa for a gandalflike reappearance like in the end of the two towers where she inevitably emerges from the horizon with the cavalry of maggie q paula patton jeremy renner and  even thandiwe newton",2023-07-12
"i might be alone here but everything besides the stunts in this movie which were incredible was horrible the melodramatic closeups the cheesy entity scenes the totally ridiculous “i can hit two keystrokes and i’ve hacked a satellite and airport security” scenes untouchablelame gabriel etc 

it committed the ultimate movie sin for me by the end of the movie i didn’t care about any of the characters or really care to wait a year to see part two",2023-07-13
nobody is talking about the guy in the beginning who delivers the mission message to ethan ethan literally says “welcome to the imf” and then we never see him again but it seems like with all the plot holes and loose ends in part 1 he has to come into the mix somehow right,2023-07-13
"super enjoyable start to finish a very good mission impossible film to me not equivalent to rogue nation or fallout but excellent on its own merits

some small complaints

 wanted to see gabriel better fleshed out especially his history with ethan i dont think the film is hindered by his unknowns but at the same time the film is asking us to buy him as ethans arch nemesis based only on a repeated seven second grainy snippet of their past couldve used an opening scene with him

 while a lot of the action is top notch it felt like it lacked some of the stakes and gravitas of previous films that said it was nice to not have nuclear weapons be the overarching threat for a change

 avoiding spoilers here but i didnt think they needed to handle that certain showdown on the venice bridge the way they did it was well done for what it was but it felt like an unnecessary motivationstake raising given that were already supposed to understand both the threat and gabriel and ethans history

 this is a relatively small quibble but in previous films wasnt the imf portrayed as another known agency akin to the cia and nsa but just lesser known publicly and seen as the black sheep of the intelligence community how is it possible that the director of national intelligence would have never heard of the imf
what about all the previous directors of imf weve seen what about alex baldwin in the last film when he mentioned making a lateral move from director of the cia to director of imf",2023-07-12

"taking a vote who was the most unhinged character pom klementiff as paris or shea whighams hair

as a confirmed hunthead i thought this was very solid but when compared to the masterpiece of action filmmaking and pacing that is fallout it does feel a little deflated im going to try not to make this review a full comparison to fallout but ill just say that this being a part one and some other decisions kept this from being anywhere near that level i still very much enjoyed it its probably the 4th best mi film and its keeping good company

one major criticism i have is that i feel the intro scene with the submarine should have been the intro to part 2 these movies usually have ethan a step ahead of us as viewers and its always very satisfying when he reveals that to us in this movie ethan is trying to find information that we already know the final moments of the film and the final piece of information he extracts from pom is something weve known literally the whole runtime that mixed with knowing this is a part one and they wont even go to the sub made the pacing of this movie feel off and the final scene feel anticlimactic despite the awesome set piece of the falling train cars

beyond that i was really interested in the ideas at play the entity is a neat villain although i do feel theres still so much we dont know about gabriel and ethans past i loved the contrast between ilsa and grace ilsa being the intelligent spy always working an angle and a  of a driver grace being a petty thief with no idea what shes into and an awful driver 

i do have complaints about how they handled graces character but my massive crush on atwell tells me its not a big deal i was pretty upset with what they did to ilsa tho in my opinion shes had a huge hand in the quality of the last two movies and is the best female character theyve written by far 

what really  hums in this movie is of course the action and the determination tom cruise can convey with his running i loved the handcuffed driving scene the aforementioned train scene and that narrow alley fight was something i could tell they were really challenging themselves with i love poms character i love to see whigham in anything i loved that they brought back czerny and shot that awesome scene where ethan knocks out the meeting room of officials just to talk with him like a de palma scene with all those dramatic angles 

overall this movie is really something its unfair to say its not the greatest action film of the next five years but thats strangely what ive come to expect from these movies i wish the part one of it all was handled better this was a great movie to watch but i didnt feel like it had a complete arc or set up anything for me to look forward to like spiderverse did you could argue rogue nation and fallout are a combo as well but each had a satisfying arc and ending to the villains this just seems like the halfway point of a very long mi movie but the action was handled well and while it may not be perfect its still probably one of the top three action movies that will be released this year its an 810

"i thought it was a fun and entertaining movie but i found it mcquarries weakest entry so far in the franchise which isnt necessarily a bad thing since hes made some great mi movies

i dont know what was more enjoyable watching paris tear through the city having the time of her life or graces efforts behind the wheel

was great to see the talented indira varma and charles parnell in the beginning scene discussing the entity i do kinda think they got repetitive with discussing the ai felt a bit superfluous that they were dragging the conversation for the ethan reveal  but could def be a me problem and one ill realize i was wrong about in my next viewing a nice bonus in that scene was catching angela bassets photo on the wall to show her character is still around

i didnt like ilsas death at all it just reeks of her being fridged  didnt like how they undid ilsas development in fallout by the end of it shes free and clear and then shes right back into trouble at the beginning of this one i know the entity is to blame but just wish they went a different route with her character like her joining ethan at imf instead of feeling like her character went back to zero respectfully it just wasnt a directionchoice i liked her death does make me wonder if maybe ferguson wanted outgot too expensive or busy or was it none of those things and they just chose her poorly id add to be the sacrificial lamb to show  this enemy is serious

i thought the actor for gabriel was good but just wasnt that impressed at how he was built up as ethans big bad but its hard to do given that were 7 movies into this awesome franchise but dead reckoning part 2 could def change my mind on him and his backstory with ethan but as a standalone i was only meh about him

i dont claim to be a movie criticexpert all i can claim is to knowing what i like and this was fun some great set pieces good gags like the agent trying to take off faces that he thought were masks great acting all around with some good banter including the duos of benji and luthor and grace and ethan grace made a great debut in this franchise and was a delight throughout the movie i was also satisfied with how it ended i thought they wrapped it up well while also hinting to what was to come in part 2",2023-07-12
"it’s hard to criticize a movie this well crafted but i came out of the theater disappointed not because it’s anywhere near a bad film but because the overall experience felt empty this is a new sensation for me with this franchise

the ai element with hot buzz words like cryptocurrency thrown around didn’t work for me everything with gabriel fell flat maybe the second film will solidify the character but he’s a poor villain compared to the syndicate and solomon lane

i can forgive all that i mean it’s still enjoyable gobbledygook but what they did with ilsa was nonsense a tremendous waste of a wonderful character that has spent the last two films becoming better and better i don’t understand the goal here maybe covid delays interfered with rebecca ferguson’s schedule what a lame death man 

this did not come anywhere near the exhilarating heights of rogue nation or fallout for me although bringing back kittridge was genius

im probably wrong but from start to finish the film felt like it was trying to suggest something uncanny valley i was honestly waiting for some sort of reveal that the main characters were being put through some ai simulation

almost every shot during a conversation is from below the chin looking upwards until luther specifically tells ethan about their final plan luther is almost the only character that ever gets a fromabove angle the camera cuts back and forth sharply between characters before theyve finished their sentences

each character seems to have certain tics or behaviours that they didnt quite have before  ethan is more hesitant and tends to grimace grace wears a dizzy smile for many of her scenes the white widow has a dazed gaze in her eyes and gabriel does not blink even once during the film its almost as if gabriel is a manifestation of the ai itself as he somehow knows what the key unlocks is fiercely jealous of anyone else who might know and comes across as the big bad antagonist trope to everyone who encounters him

some scenes also play out as if theyre trying to suggest a vr simulation a bizarrely random nuclear weapon turns up in a bag is disarmed through riddles and games and never comes up again not one person comments on the issue of a tactical nuke turning up at an airport even if it was fake

agents rigourously pursue ethan through a strangely calm and quiet airport planes take off and land people stroll around leisurely and security is completely absent as if nobody can see two massive armed military helicopters circling the airport an ai playfully leads the agents astray in locating their target luther can somehow open unpowered fire escape doors remotely through his computer

during the venice chase ilsa and gabriel fight to the death in a very wellchoreographed sword fight ilsa is expressionless and dies with neither blood nor fanfare when the camera focuses on them its perfectly stable and cinematic as soon as the shot cuts back to ethan and paris fighting in the alleyways the camera is so shaky and erratic that its sometimes difficult to even see who beats who every shot in venice follows this rule  gabriels shots are slow and stable ethans shots are shaky and erratic

the humour was also pretty off the charts  in a good way it was really enjoyable but out of curiosity i watched fallout again after this and the tone is completely different ethan doesnt balk at strategies involving jumps and doesnt really driveshoottravel in ways that seem humorous fallout is a serious film during this film my entire cinema was in stitches during the italy scene and laughed even harder when alanna dropped unconscious for the third time in a row on the train before still swaying left and right like a 

ive made a bet with friends that part 2 will reveal that part 1 was an ai simulation for the entity to learn more about ethan ill probably lose but  ill be happy if i end up just 5 right",2023-07-12
i loved pom klementiffs psychotic assassin henchman vibe so it will be interesting how they go about filling that void for gabriels team in part 2 because you gotta have some fun henchmen,2023-07-12
i had very high expectations after fallout and those expectations were not met i think the dialogue in this is pretty bad and the editing is odd too still enjoyed it though and i’m sure part 2 will bump this one up a little,2023-07-12
ill never get over how well done the humor is in these films compared to marvel where there is just a bunch of unnecessary humor done at the most unnecessary times the use of both verbal physical  practical humor in this film is superb,2023-07-12
" the women in this mission impossible movie in particular were just awesome

haley atwell showing us why steve rogers went back in time for more than just a dance cant wait to see her join the crew with ethan benji  luthur

rebecca ferguson although a brief appearance established herself as such an intriguing character in rogue nation  fallout making her death here heartbreaking knife fight with gabriel on a bridge over a canal in venice was so dope tho

vanessa kirby being a hilariously entertaining broker as she was in fallout and her being a fun 

 finally pom klementieff being sexy badass  surprisingly maniacally evil while driving the jeep around rome was just fantastic glad they didnt  her off itll be interesting to see if they bring her character back  what role itll be in",2023-07-12
killing off ilsa was weird after the fakeout earlier it gave me some walking dead vibes with glenn it lessened the impact if thats the case and didnt seem like a good sendoff not sure about hayley atwell as a replacement either unless she turns out to be ethans daughter or something just a wild theory well id prefer that over another maybeloveinterest again,2023-07-12
benji lashing out on ethan for the first time  felt him especially when he’s at stress in a self drive,2023-07-12
"i quite liked it though as a fan of the franchise i recognize im not entirely impartial

the hfro homage in the opening scene was great

and for as much as this is clearly part one it also told a fully contained narrative of its own  there is more story to come but this story stands on its own  which really stood out to me after fasten your seatbelts and across the spiderverse both ended on hard cliffhangers

i have two complaints really

ilsa got done dirty i could expound but i wont here and now

up against a rogue ai able to  any digital system necessitating both the imf team and mainstream intelligence agencies revert to offline  analog tech benji enables selfdriving mode and gets out of the drivers seat trusting his safety and life to the digital technology of the vehicle

i mean i know that the scene was there like that because it was product placement included to show off the awesome technology bmw wants us to believe their vehicles possess and i havent minded the nested ads in the previous films for the awesome crash protection and general coolness of the beamers but this one is in such conflict with the story its injected into that it ganked my immersion temporarily",2023-07-12
for the love of everything holy they better bring ilsa back in part 2 or else because if shes dead for real what the actual  was that death not only did she get killed off so unceremoniously merely to up the stake and give ethan some angst but the team also moved on after like 2 seconds of halfhearted grief then she got immediately replaced by grace they spent 2 movies building up ethan and ilsas relationship and while never spoken aloud the two of them most certainly had a thing going on theres the utter lack of reaction the way the team kinda avoided stating explicitly that ilsa is dead seems to me like a setup for a twist perhaps a plan to help ilsa go underground to evade the entity mcq is too good a writer to fridge one of his best characters like that,2023-07-13
enjoyed the movie but it did feel like they were forcing the grace character too much didn’t feel natural like how ilsa faust stole the show in rogue nation,2023-07-13

"initial thoughts after just getting out of the movie  

 enjoyed the movie for the most part but i have more complaints than positives   i’d put it middle of the pack in terms of my mi ranking i think 46 are way superior   

 the first 30 or so minutes were extremely slow odd editing scenes that went on way too long   didn’t feel like an mi film  nothing but dialogue flashbacks of things we just saw happen not even any background music  just felt odd

 another thought of the beginning that conversation between the half dozen us agents in the conference room went on way too long and was distracting how they would all finish each other’s sentences  

 way too many closeup shots throughout the movie  especially during dialogue quickly switching to a closeup of different peoples faces was distracting and got hard to follow the conversation 


 did anyone else have trouble following the story  at a high level i understood it…i think  but so many different people wanted the keys and the keys were stolen so many times i had trouble figuring out who was good vs bad and what each persons motive is  

 gabriel as a character needed fleshed out way more  i didn’t feel i should hate him like the movie wanted you to  it was some random 3 second clips from before ethan joined imf  i have no idea who he killed and why he did it   

 i think they could’ve trimmed 15 minutes from the movie 

 haley atwell is a babe

 cruise really is the goat",2023-07-16
"grace is the we have ilsa faust at home for this movie 

though i won’t be surprised if it’s a misdirect the latter half of the movie felt like they were putting on a show for the entity at points",2023-07-12
"eh didnt like this one the story moves at a pace that theres no time to actually digest whats happening how did the keys end up found from the ocean why did grace and ilsa both run to the bridge to fight gabriel we have 6 mission impossible movies why did they feel like they needed to have a very poorly filmed flashback sequence to give ethan hunt some backstory couldnt we take something from any of the 6 prior films why did ilsa get jobbed by old man gabriel im sure each of these things have reasonable answers but the pacing doesnt give you even a second to reflect on whats happening or has happened 

the thing is whatever all of it on its own probably a decent enough film but as a follow up to fallout and rogue nation this doesnt even feel like the same people worked on this movie take for example that scene with all the heads of different branches of intelligence or security postulating about the entity that scene was so bad i honestly thought we were watching a scene of what the ai thought was going on or it was another wolf blitzer fakeout 

oh well bit disappointed with this one fallout was just such a great time at the theatre so im feeling a little shocked at how this one played out hopefully its better on a rewatch",2023-07-12
mcquarrie has gotten seriously good at directing he and his dp’s shot selection camerawork and lighting are very impressive here the first half i was just constantly marveling at how much i felt like i was in the action without the use of  shakycam mcq has talked a lot about learning from movie to movie and how unhappy he was with his previous work but i think he did really well here,2023-07-12
"im the biggest fan of mi6 its the only film i went to see twice in cinema and was grinning in joy through all of it

this one did not cut it for me and unfortunately with how high the reviews were and me not having seen anything prior to avoid spoilers it was a very very large letdown some notes

mi6 had unbelievable stunts and setpieces all connected with a great plot and tight story here the pacing and writing felt off enough to pull me out of the movie a few times it was clear we were going from stunt to stunt and honestly the new setpieces whilst pretty awesome arent a step up from fallout

killing one of if not the coolest character in such a dubious way and both very quickly moving forward and meta replacing them also immediately after felt off putting

i understand wanting to add importance to the new villain but introducing him as this important genesis character for ethan through weird flashbacks was detrimental they could have easily introduced gabriel as someone new the stakes are already high and ethans character is sufficiently fleshed out i feel that for this backintime stuff to work the movie would of had to put much more time into it but as it is it felt like a shoe in for added dramatic importance

comedic timing was off for me 5 and 6 were funny at the right moments where this one was overly preoccupied with everything else

dialog felt messy the best example i can think of is the scene with all the higher ups at the intelligence meeting at the start and how everyone is seemlesly finishing everyone elses sentences luckily the second half of the movie delivered better in this aspect

scenes like the desert and airport felt like they were building up to something bigger and didnt properly pay off the big train sequence had a lot of moving parts and i feel lost a bit of focus with having pretty much all of the characters in it also the bike jump was cool but even for mi having ethan accidentally save the day by jumping into the right window was a bit too wild

however there are positives here movie still looked cool action overall was still solid the ost whilst not as impactful as fallouts was still very good although a bit samey tho not complaining chasing after the macguffin was silly but fun

i wont lie and say im not seeing part 2 i hold mi6 so dearly in my memory that i owe the team a chance with the follow up as for ilsa coming back theories and the issues i had here being fixed im lowering my expectations although i am aware that part 2 has no setup to make so theres some hope

i almost never engage negatively around media but i loved loved the previous title so much that i felt compelled to write here truly rooting for part 2 to excite me in theatres next year

sorry for how long this was but luckily you dont have to read twice because this message will selfdestruct in 5 seconds",2023-07-12
"i must say i was a bit… disappointed this one literally felt like half a movie to me and my ultimate opinion will depend on part ii 

the train scene was good the stunt from the cliff was pretty cool but didn’t wow me as much as precious ones and the rome chase was nothing new 

ilsa’s death was totally unnecessary hoping she comes back for part ii otherwise it’d be a total waste of an amazing character",2023-07-12
loved the cast but why did all of the dialogue feel like it was written by an edgy teenager especially bad in the scene with the american intelligence group in the beginning of the movie,2023-07-13
"this is going to be unpopular it seems but i honestly thought the plot was poorly written outside of the action sequences it was basically the cast sitting in a room spoon feeding the audience what just happened the current state of affairs then the plan going forward — rinse repeat 34 times between action sequences and were done little character development just characters reciting what we just saw and are about to see 

maybe that’s to be expected for these movies either way i’d still give it a 758 for a solid action flick",2023-07-18
i really enjoyed the movie but the scene where grace is in the mask kept bothering me because the white widow’s brother had plenty of time to notice her eye color was different that felt like something he would’ve picked up on did i miss something can anyone give me an explanation as to how she got away with this,2023-07-12
vanessa kirby nailed playing grace playing widow,2023-07-14
"a lot of people talking about how great grace is and how much they enjoyed her character and i just dont get it grace is the most frustrating character in the franchise i really disliked her how many times does ethan need to come in and save you before you understand the gravity of the situation and that you are not equipped to deal with it yourself she just didnt get it over and over and over and over made her character feel inept foolish and unlikable to me 75 of the movie was ethan chasing her around and cleaning up after her could have been a fun cute premise in a different movie in this one though it was just frustrating

unfortunately my dislike for grace really kind of killed the emotional weight of ilsas death instead of really feeling it and remembering her history with the team and ethans feelings for her and appreciating her sacrifice  i was just  off at grace because surprise this was yet another mess she got herself into by only thinking about herself and preventing ethan from helping

i dont feel like grace earned her welcome to the team

all that aside the movie was  rad not as great as fallout but did have some of the more memorable moments of the franchise",2023-07-12
"just got out and wow what a ride

my only real gripe with the movie is the part 1 in the title  it takes away some of the suspense because you know there will be a follow up  should have done the marketing like dune and then displayed the part 1 at the title of the actual movie it’s a nitpick for me but i feel it takes away from the suspense a bit 

 the next bond is in serious trouble trying to keep up with ethan hunt at this point 

the “villain” is inspired  doesn’t have emotions doesn’t have doubt doesn’t feel pain and can’t be intimidated  all it sees is probabilities and possible outcomes  in the world we are living in right now it seemed extremely relevant especially with the speech kittridge gives to ethan at the beginning if that’s our future we are throughly  

cruise runs not once not twice but three times in this one hasn’t missed a stepped  he still looks the part and still maintains hunt as having a heart instead of a cold blooded assassin 

hayley atwell is the most distracting thing in the movie in the best possible way  she’s charming vulnerable and insanely attractive the combination of her ferguson and pom were all next level “bond girls”  beautiful but very capable of taking care of themselves  pom was especially shocking  i’ve only ever seen her as mantis so seeing her as a kick  assassin was great and she was clearly having a lot of fun vanessa kirby seems to have gotten the short end of the stick in this one but hopefully she makes up for it with more time in part 2 

the stunt was great and the build up to it was pretty  funny with pegg egging cruise on  i have no idea what cruise does next  unless he skin dives the bering sea  or climbs up the side of a rocket on its way to space i’m running out of ideas as to what he can do to keep tipping himself 

cruise has had a terrific run here for the last 15 years  there is no doubt he has cemented his status as a bonafide movie star  he might never win an oscar for a particular performance but the dude  sure deserves a lifetime achievement oscar for what he has done for his career 

the best part about it is you can tell cruise cares everything outside of cinema might be loony or weird but when it comes to the job the dude goes all out  he really is aiming to entertain the audience and make you feel like your money was well spent 

i’m not sure how many more of these he has left but ethan hunt has outlasted two different iterations of james bond and basically has made jason bourne a fond memory",2023-07-14
"i found the inconclusive nature of ethans relationship with ilsa weirdly forced she invited him to run away with her in rogue nation which was an obvious romanticsexual proposition to leave the spy life behind so they can be together validated by luthers ohboy

by the time fallout ends and ethan almost dies ilsa is casting him longing looks and caressing his face to me it was clearly implied theyd be together after that inflection point  not necessarily in a traditional domestic sort of way of course since theyre agents but the films have showed us they have strong feelings for each other and have gotten to a place where theyre mutually expressing their attraction openly

i mean theyre both attractive people people  people have relationships within varied boundaries and ethan finally finds a match that is the opposite of julia in the sense that ilsa can keep up with his lifestyle and fend for herself it seemed obvious to me that theyd have a thing already going in some form casual or not by the seventh based on the trajectory of their relationship

yet we find ilsa far away from ethan doing her own thing despite the fact that she had become wholly embedded into his team by the end of fallout worst of all from a character perspective not a fanboy shipping perspective theres been no progression in their relationship when he sees her in the desert hes caressing her face and being all tendertouchy which is a romantic gesture but theres no kissing or words of acknowledgement its like mcquarrie purposely wants to evade anything that would naturally exist based on what weve seen and this turns the mi world into a weirdly asexual place the way star wars for instance is wholly aromanticasexual with the exception of empire

its not that i want to see characters getting it on because that doesnt fit the mi tone or structure but its equally weird that the relationship is never clear or advanced or addressed outside of this dumb limbo then on the balcony in venice they have a flirty touchy interaction followed bynot holding hands exactly but tenderly holding armshands in the gondola clearly theyre super into each other and both know it but they never cross some imaginary chaste line for no reason theyre both spies they both live that life they love each other and yet this weird evasion for no reason

after that they  off elsa ethans whole character has thus far been defined as a gambler who will not sacrifice anyone on his team to get the job done who refuses to let anyone die he is defined by his need to protect everyone no matter what this is the first time in the series that ethan has lost someone centeal from his team secretaries like alec baldwin dont count in this case the one person he had a romantic attachment to he finally loses a gamble and fails to keep his people safe which is a core of who he is

and the story doesnt show us his grief over this effectively even at all theres a silent moment where hes sad when he discovers her and then he just kinda carries on i get that almost killing the villain is supposed to be an expression of his rage but cmon we dont see his sense of loss portrayed in any meaningful way

look i dont mind losing ilsa if its going to serve the story even if its a bummer but the way she was unceremoniously dispatched without shattering ethan or fundamentally changing him then plugging in another pretty girl for him to have romantic tension vibes with right after was poorly handled i like grace her dynamic and chemistry with ethan was great 

but i just feel like the writer didnt know what to do with ilsa and thus didnt treat her character the way it deserved i considered her death being fake but the way it was done negates that possibility 

i assume  that the artificial vague nonromantic romance with ethan and ilsa continued so that ethan could still have plausible sparks with grace but it just comes off as lamely written and does ethans character a disservice ilsa is almost up there with julia for him as someone he deeply loves and wants to protect so the way it was handled didnt make sense

super entertaining film overall though i mean the train sequence bordered on looney tunes exaggeration but was so spectacular that i was fine with it",2023-07-17
love that the last 15 min turn into a disaster movie lol that train set piece was so good reminded me of uncharted 2 meets titanic,2023-07-12
"so it pains me to write this comment that probably no one will care about but this movie really disappointed me from introducing a useless character in grace yes i like haley atwell but in the 7th movie of this franchise she was unneeded to the team just glossing over ilsas death to introducing a bunch of new characters that were as shallow as a 2 inch puddle with not true motivations to entirely dragged out scenes and exposition that made this movie wayyyy longer than it needed to i came out deflated 

i believe that since mi3 this franchise has gradually improved and mcquarrie proved he knew what he was doing until we got to dead reckoning part 1 we got a few good action scenes some tom cruise running and a whole lot of newboring characters that dont even need to be in the story gabriel is the main bad guy why is he working for the entity idk why was he chosen by the entity idk why does he have a rivalry other than a cliche flashback of killing someone ethan loves idk why does grace get a spot on the team when she consistently proves she doesnt have any skills is a flight risk and quite literally just got ilsa killed i think the writing room was invaded by 5 year olds or taken over by tom cruise entirely because this movie is just not the same as mcquarries other mission impossible films unless dr part 2 is absolutely phenomenal i really dont see how they could drag another 2 hour movie as a sequel to this almost 3 hour movie that doesnt feel like a slog fest",2023-07-12
"loved the movie except what they did to ilsa of course it makes absolutely no sense killing literally the second most important character so randomly its cheap  disrespectful paris is killed the same way but ends up being alive i really hope that was a hint that ilsa was also alive are we supposed to just move on  start shipping ethangrace no way yes they are a great pair but not every new girl has to be ethans soulmate

it would make way more sense that theres a twist in mi8 which reveals that ilsas death was faked would make sense in the defeating ai plot mi8 is supposedly the last film of the series its the finale ilsaethan finally getting some peace together would be right ending not ethan ending up with a girl he met an hour ago their chemistry was fire though still doesnt beat the preexisting couple ilsa is almost as good as ethan in combat being an agent yet she just loses so easily while gracea pickpocketer fights way better against the same guy makes no sense not to mention the importance the two women have one is like the wife of the main character  is the second mainmost important character the other is just a rando he met an hour ago

ilsa has to be alive in mi8 rebeccas name is there in part2s cast  she has also shot for some scenes could be flashback scenes but i really hope that she turns out to be alive in part2 otherwise im going to end up hating my most favourite movie franchise",2023-07-12
killing off ilsa in such a random way to then establish grace was weird,2023-07-14
"i am a giant fan of the franchise and 100 not a mission impossible critic i have literally loved every other mi movie to death and watched them repeatedly

dead reckoning is one of the worst mi movies ever made and i couldnt be more disappointed i have no interest in watching part 2

for the first time i felt like the main purpose of the movie was the spectacle and everything else was in support of that

ethan hunt is suddenly skittish and apologizing for driving into a wall i get that they were trying to setup a gag but they failed it only became apparent after the fact and felt totally out of character

i didnt buy hayley atwells character at all especially as a potential mi agent and if ethan could pick her pockets so easily he could also just as easily put those items back on that guy himself it was 100 unnecessary and contrived to involve her at all

ilsa fausts characters involvement and death were severely underwhelming

shot after shot were mission impossible cliches at this point take the boat ride which they do in every mi movie now  cool scenic shot here unnecessary boat ride in a foreign country there the whole movie felt like contrived scenes stitched together with mi cliches and gratuitous unnecessary stunts

i have never felt like an mi movie was more predictable or underwhelming in every way",2023-10-14
"another great entry to the franchise not fallout level of excellence but that was such a ridiculously high bar 

i think where it fell short was the clunky exposition at times and perhaps the cary elwes sub plot that could have been cut  but still the time flew by and all the set pieces were terrific 

highlights for me were of course the train sequence the venice sequence  and the score during that sequence was just chefs kiss and the airport sequence was classic mission impossible mask sequence brought into the digital age 

looking forward to ethan and benjie going full analog in the next movie",2023-07-12
"man everyone here has pretty much nailed anything i wanted to say about this film saw it in full imax and was blown away so much fun the train the fiat chase everything was 

also shout out to all the women in this film pom haley rebecca and venessa were operating on all cylinders i really couldn’t choose a favorite between them",2023-07-13
i will always enjoy a mission impossible as much as the next fan and i did enjoy this one because stunts but i am fairly  at the 100 positive nothings wrong reviews surrounding this movie 7 had some serious flaws and youd think with this writers strike going on youd see more reviewers highlight the need for better paid writers the pickpocketing key gimmick got real old by rome too many plot development lands at my feet moments i dont think they handled the seriousness of the entity situation very well especially in that security debrief meeting why did ilsa have to die again stop with the rehashed fallout drums at every single moment not really a script complaint but maybe they saved money on a composer as well im going to see part 2 for sure but only for submarine stunts this movie could have been really something with a better script,2023-07-27
"watched it twice in one day and noticed something interesting although not sure if intentional

luther and ethan have a conversation in which luther tells ethan that to beat the entity they have to think like it “cold logical…” something like that basically telling him to act logically and without emotion and i mean like we’ve seen with the previous films that’s not really ethan he’d do anything to save his friends even if that were to mean jeopardizing the mission but in the end it always works out

in this movie we see multiple characters acting on emotion shea wigham’s character choosing not to shoot ethan even though he said ethan is expendable they seem to have a past ethan sparing paris and in turn paris saving ethan and grace and then grace declining to send the money to herself and deciding to help ethan also not to forget ethan saying “ logic” and actually attempting to  gabriel at the end even gabriel is confused because he and by extension the entity thought that ethan would spare him for sake of not knowing what the key would unlock all these things seem to defy the entity’s logic and play a big role in driving the plot forwards and forcing ethan towards the end of the mission",2023-07-12
"as much as i loved grace was it really necessary to  off ilsa so grace could take her place 

its pretty offensive that we finally got a female regular on the team and then they just decided to  her off so that grace could take her spot 

emmanuelle beart thandie newton to be fair she was never a member of the team maggie q paula patton and then rebecca ferguson took the spot and it seemed like the franchise kept her in for good but then she got the keri russell treatment 

oh well hope haley atwells grace doesnt suffer the same fate",2023-07-12
star wars has not reached the level of mission impossible,2023-07-12
a small gripe i have about the movie,2023-07-12
killing off ilsa if shes really dead is dumbest decision of this franchise since when they turned jim phelps into a lame villain,2023-07-12
"while i greatly enjoyed the train sequence movie felt disappointing

the story felt so unnecessarily stretched the intro till ethan meeting kittridge was expositions placed like a group presentation the meeting room with all characters taking turn in explaining the entity in qna felt like a classroom many a times between imf team the dialogues felt like a group presentation of expositions as well than real conversation

i still dont get what they were trying with amsterdam parcel scene in start to show ethans mission ilsa is said to be hiding in desert but it felt like she was depolyed in the middle of nowhere 

a lot of scenes could have been trimmed entity or gabriel didnt invoke much sense of danger the only time i felt some sense of danger was when entity faked benjis voice but they left it there as a one off and cut to the bridge fight gabriel fighting grace and then ilsa in that order felt weird i dont see the point of machine asking one girls death if it wants ethan out it could easily have the play felt forced same with pom n the other guy trying to  ethan in fist fight

i know its hard to top fallout but i wish this movie was made tighter",2023-07-14
so nobody else thought it was super cheesy,2023-07-15
i liked it but something about it felt off to me i think after iisas death i kinda checked out the pacing of the climatic sequence was off with the flip back and forth between ethan on the bike and the train also missing out on the complete parachute jump for a dues ex machina device to save grace,2023-07-16
anyone else think this movie was just average outside of the ending train sequence i didnt really feel like there were any standout moments from this movie especially considering how great fallout was hoping part 2 really ups the ante but i was kind of disappointed in this one,2023-07-18
"thoughts

 kittridge should have been in way more of those films hes fantastic
 those cia guys chasing tom cruise around were great  dont know if they need to be chasing him around in the next one per se but if they were there in another capacity would be neat
 the new female agent atwell and the new female villain french chickadee are just great
 that room that disguisedtom cruise gassed near the start was stacked with quality actors kind of fun to see maybe a little collection of people cruise has worked with and asked to come on or something like that
 killing ilsa faust almost ruined the film for me took me until about when kittridge appears again on the train before the sour taste passed  i hope that they didnt croak her for real that would be so  shes like the best recurring character in the series kind of on a par with cruise  killing her like that was just so i dont know lame  bring her back
 simon pegg is looking his age ving peaced out for the entire final heist probably because hes a giant old man too  how long can these folks last
 great set piece type scenes as expected but that final train escape was something else very well executed
 that club scene is not going to age well
 the arabian desert abu dhabi rome venice and the alps  not bad
 they had four great and super attractive and deadlysneaky female actors in the film a shame they didnt get there a few films earlier in the series because they can really turn it up
 quite a humorous film but its sort of old people humor  im guessing that tom cruise has to approve every joke
 glad that the brother to the blonde widow woman didnt get croaked i like him looming in these scenes hes a great bit of decor
 lastly i expect there will probably be some sort of twist where the ai was bringing tom cruise to it all along and that it plucked that guy from cruises past basically to orchestrate the entire long play with that result in mind  sorry if i spoiled it",2023-07-13
"am i the only one who thought it was too long and the story was kinda meh 

best part was atwell whos gorgeous",2023-07-14
"surprisingly disappointed after seeing and reading so many really good reviews and impressions it just didnt work for me on so many levels plot writing  like i dont know maybe in previous movies i didnt put that much attention to it but here it just stand out that characters didnt speak to each other  all dialogue scenes where full of exposition very inspired speeches and it was pushed to absurd like the board meeting with denlinger or in the club i felt like the only actual humantohuman conversation was during the chase when ethan was instructing grace where to turn 

another thing  its very often referenced as a spiritual successor to de palmas first mi i didnt get that feeling at all yea it references it a lot and it had dutch angles closeups and kittridge but its a very different kind of cinema  new mi its a typical modern action movie  i you watched bullet train or indiana jones recently you may feel like having a deja vu  i did rewatched the first mi not that long ago and was genuinely surprised at how much of a spy thriller it really was as i wrongly associated it only with the final train sequence forgetting how awesome and grounded the rest was and how good the build to that was 

so didnt get the old mi vibe here  its all chase and action and apart from jumping from the cliff which felt super forced btw i didnt felt like it raises the bar ive seen plenty of chase scenes some better some worse bond indiana all the netflix kind action things and the trains oh man i just feel tired of train roof scenes i guess like i feel this has been really overexploited  there is nothing new they did with that  again probably just watching indiana jones didnt help with that impression chases where there too a lot of them and i get it   it was mi reference  but again  in brians film it was something that stands out from the whole thing it was a conclusion  here it was just yet another crazy action sequence after so many other action sequences as a viewer i get fatigued

back to the jumping scene  apart from the fact that for me was more thrilling watching those making off videos than the actual bit in the cinema  it was funny that the whole dialogue around that scene felt like some metacomment on that ethan being confused on what hes doing really on that bike and getting to that train like that doesnt make sense  and benji was like i dunno man  just do you big stunt that the only place in that story where we make some use of it yeah its  but im dont have better ideas a lot is going on no time for that d anyways  it was the first time when i felt that toms stunt was about toms stunt  where previously it felt always much more integrated 

what else dunno plot holes even small things like the whole thing about the necessity of using analog technology because of entity scene later has benji driving an electric car using autonomous drive  i was really waiting for entity to take control over that bmw but it turns out to be just a product placement they need to inject that electric vehicle there 

gabriel flat and thats all i kind of write about the guy really out of nowhere ethans origin no its not a flashback to prague from the first mi as many people think it was  that i just cant relate to and after so many movies just felt forced again probably fatigued with the franchise bringing another ghost characters from the past like in bond or ff  at this point i just hope its not ethans brother d  

ilsa dead oh boy the whole bridge sequence  it was an amazing mixed bag of really cool build with great score moments with tom running through those streets mixed with a super awkward mediocre boss fight sequence on that bridge between gabriel and grace and later ilsa such a great character deserves much much better  felt like she should just kick his  i think id even it would work better if it was a more grounded and sudden moment the departed style leo in the elevator  not to mention the buildtoher death was a bit too much on the nose 

and yeah it has some cool moments appreciated the humor the new female cast was superb pom and hayley and fiat scenes were cool and genuinely funny but all those good stuff were overshadowed by bad stuff for me so yeah  i think its one of the worst if not the worst mission impossible experience for me it hurts as i overall appreciate the series a lot  was for me much more consistent in quality than craigs bond series which was all over the place starting from brilliant casino somehow getting to awful spectre",2023-08-03
"i might be in the minority but ive found this to be one of the weakest mi movies to date it had its moments and i wasnt really bored but the movie really felt like someone thought of a lot a set pieces and characters but forgot to write a good story around them

the mi films always had a lot of charm in its simplicity tell a pretty simply basic narrative with a small but great cast and pack that with amazing action set pieces dead reckoning had so much going on and so many characters that i felt it forgot to make me care about the plot and those characters 

like why is grace even a character why is she needed when we had a perfectly great female character in ilsa her death was totally wasted it seemed like hunt was over her 20 minutes after it happened

the whole ai thing i really didnt feel and they tried so hard to make it sound like the most dangerous thing but failed to do so imo let alone the gabriel character and his french henchgirl who i couldnt care less about i honestly dont know why gabriel was in the movie and why ethans past suddenly became part of the story

the score was amazing and i loved the whole train sequence but it lacked so much lf the greatness fallout and its prequels had that i left the cinema dissappointed i expected more",2023-07-12
"saw it on sunday in an early screening since paramount is the one that mostly offers them to consumers 

while not as good as rogue nation and fallout it’s still a great action film with some great sequences 

the cgi and “covideffect” are minimal mostly a wonky green screen pickup like some brief shots of the climax i did notice that both this and indiana jones had similar car chase and train sequences wonder if there was some sort of competition between disney and paramount about how their sequences would be portrayed so close to each other they also have similar budgets and were released two weeks near each other 

take it from a young guy who loves old people movies this  is toptier i loved indy 5 and even little mermaid 2023 got me to smile mi will firmly be the film of the year in aarp magazine and it deserves it 

not everyone may agree though  at a 3pm showing both someone next to me and someone behind me were loudly snoring during the film that took out some of my suspense during the dialogue scenes but dialogue isn’t really the franchise’s strong suit more about feeling and intentions and zig zagging loyalties",2023-07-12
i will miss you ilsa,2023-07-13
"honestly i like fallout a lot better the pacing here was too slow for a mi movie there were many scenes and sequences i felt overstayed their welcome there was also a huge over reliance on closeups and poorly framed ones at that so many dialogue scenes play out in nothing but closeups and not in a way thats invoking claustrophobia and paranoia its just nonstop close ups even when a scene isnt trying to be intense or dramatic 

and the editing is really bizarre and distracting like theyll be on a close up of a character speaking and then randomly in the middle of their sentence they cut to another close up from a slight different angle with some equally wacky composition and they do it like 20 times per conversation its so strange maybe im being too nitpicky here but it really started distracting me

i also gotta say i dont really love the whole skynet thing even with all the ai buzz lately it felt too cartoonish for this franchise and the human villains were super bland they wanted this big emotional connecting with gabriel but you cant just shoehorn that in with a couple black and white flashbacks you gotta earn that relationship for it to mean anything when they fight

on that note killing ilsa and swapping her for grace was a huge misstep theyve spent 3 movies building their relationship and it was the only thing in this franchise currently that feels really emotionally engaging now its a new girl out of nowhere right at the end and if they end up doing a death fake out for ilsa twice that will be even more disappointing honestly id rather they just commit to it at this point

to end on a positive note i really loved the final train escape sequence as its falling off the track that was really thrilling and unique",2023-07-15
i liked the movie a lot but they should have brought thandiwe newton back as the master thief,2023-07-17
first one i didnt like horrible dialogue repeating the same things about the entity over and over again no chemistry between the characters was just exhausted and bored by the end of the movie this one needed to go through the writers room 10 more times show dont tell,2023-07-17
"mi dead reckoning part one has been one of my most anticipated movies of this year but does it live up to the hype in my opinion in ways it does but in other ways this falls short compared to mi fallout 

to start off on the good and what i liked about this tom cruise man you have to give him his props say what you want about him but there’s no denying the guy has a passion for the movie making experience and does everything he can to entertain the audience in the best way possible seeing him jump off a cliff on a motorcycle and knowing he actually did that was crazy to me i also liked esai morales and the overall artificial intelligence villain this movie had i thought it was timely especially with how things are today in the world a few more things i liked here were both hayley atwell and vanessa kirby this is arguably atwell’s best role to date she was great here and was able to hold her own opposite cruise it was also great to see vanessa kirby reprise her role from fallout and she has more to do here thankfully and you could tell she had fun essentially playing a double role here hopefully we’ll get more of her in part 2 also was a big fan of the entire train sequence it reminded me of uncharted 2 


now to move on to the negatives why the  would you  off the illsa faust character when she “died” the first time i was dumbfounded but later in the movie when she actually died i was just as upset if this was the plan from the start then what was the point of having her continue on after rouge nation i don’t know if at the time this was filming rebecca ferguson was also busy with dune part 2 or her silo appletv series and that factored in the decision or mcquarrie felt like he couldn’t develop atwell’s character properly with ferguson still around and if that is the case i completely disagree why couldn’t we have three badass women kicking  here in kirby ferguson and atwell just a mind boggling decision all around hope she somehow returns in part 2 what i also wasn’t a fan of was pom klementieff’s role here as a voiceless assassin until her character is on death’s door and she blurts out three lines of dialogue in another language her role here is equivalent to dave bautista’s in spectre and i thought that was lame because it just felt like a waste of another capable and good actress also not really a fan of splitting big blockbusters in two parts either i know this isn’t anything new but now it seems like every major studio is doing it first with dune then fast and furious and spiderverse and now this not sure if i’m a fan of it

overall while this isn’t as good as fallout in my opinion this is still highly enjoyable and will likely be in my top ten for the year definitely looking forward to part 2 next year and it’s definitely between this and john wick chapter 4 for best action movie of the year for me that is unless gareth evans next movie “havoc” ends up releasing this year",2023-07-12
liked the movie a lot … real fun but i felt rebecca ferguson’s character was well underbaked this movie,2023-07-13
"it was fantastic sometimes funny super exciting and surprisingly very intense at times  

cruise running to try to get to ilsa in time had me on the edge of my seat 

i still cant believe shes gone

the jokes poking fun i love when the mi series can laugh at itself 

atwell is a great addition to the cast and had a great dynamic with ethan

there were so many set pieces that i loved  the car chase scene being one of them  

such an enjoyable ride  

i love the mi series and will be rewatching this one many times",2023-07-14
that hug between ethan and ilsa was the cutest thing ever,2023-07-14
"luther and ilsa are 100 teaming up behind the scenes only way to win is for them to be playing without any of the other characters including the entity knowing they are

remember her death was based of its calculations not destiny hunt needs to think she is dead for the play to work",2023-07-15
the hundreds of people frantically typing out ground truth statements because everything digital is effectively compromised might be the most dreadinducing setup ive seen in a movie for an ai villain,2023-07-16
couldve been trimmed 30 min also ilsa barely had any dialogue but her death was sad considering shes been in the last 3 overall i enjoyed it though the plot seems kind of meh compared to the last few nothing can top the last 3 imo they were very well made,2023-07-17
my second least favorite mi movie it just felt so disjointed compared to the last three movies who thought it was a good idea to go ff route and try to rewrite or add to ethans origin story gabriel is a terrible villain and it kind of reminded me when they added john cenas character to ff movies even the action scenes werent that impressive compared to the last three movies then they had the audacity to  off ilsa for some dumb reason overall i expected a lot more from what was supposed to be one of the best movies of the year hopefully part 2 will be a much better movie,2023-07-17
"so the ever present ai antagonist was an edgy windows screensaver and the human puppet baddie was just there okay they could have learnt how to show to your audience a godlike ai if they watched a few scenes of person of interest the screensaver and transformers sounds were laughable

they didnt show up how they did retrieve the keys in the first place and filled all the holes  with exposition the action scenes as always were nice but i think this is one of the weakest antagonist and plots",2023-07-21
so benji really engaged ai driving assist while theyre fighting an omnipotent evil ai entity,2023-07-24
"why is everyone jacking off this movie so hard

there were so many exposition heavy scenes where the main characters would just go on and on about  was going on talk about disrespecting the audience much and wasting banji and luther’s character 

isla fausts death was so nonchalant too isn’t she one of the main characters at this point i get that this is an mi movie but there were way too many  deus ex machinas that it took me out completely 

also so many dutch angle shots why

510 honestly huge step down  the train scene at the end was cool though",2023-07-12
"1 ilsas death took me out ive mentioned this elsewhere but it really felt like a nothing death so unearned and very unmourned and the cut to the next scene where grace is for some reason styled like ilsa feels like single white female replacement vibes ilsas plotline in general is just   considering the setup at the end of fallout which implies she might join the imf why is she still disavowed and on her own
2 mcq says grace was intentionally written as a character not meant for the mi series and it shows dislike that she becomes a damsel in distress after a rather strong start and if you know youre a terrible knife fighter why arent you running away the film really wants me to like her and im not feeling it
3 paris is amazing i hope she joins the team since shes way more fieldready than grace
4 we went from not fridging anyone to two fridges marie in the flashbacks ilsa wow  dont really understand the retcon of ethans past to being a criminal very vibes of napoleon solo in muncle
5 way too much exposition and everyone having a followup line it just sounds super scripted or in context of the film super rehearsed seems like the script wants to sound clever but it isnt
6 this doesnt rate above fallout and rogue nation what are the critics smoking",2023-07-12
great movie it was very fun to watch and i didnt feel like i was left empty at the end like most 2 part movies seem to do the best thing i can say about the movie is that ethan felt like the weakest not physically character in it and thats not an insult towards tom cruise,2023-07-12
it was nice of tom cruise to rescue rebecca ferguson from arrakis,2023-07-12
if i were paramount i’d have given isla faust her own movie with her own team instead of killing her off to mine pathos for ethan hunt,2023-07-12
"honestly it felt very…average definitely weaker compared to fallout and rogue nation action scenes were fantastic like usual but the writing was just all over the place

the villain just felt off for some reason i get that he’s a throwback to the first movie but i just didn’t feel threatened by him he felt like a classic bad guy goon rather than the main antagonist 

then there was isla’s death this one was clearly foreshadowed throughout the beginning of the movie but it still just didn’t sit well with me she was one of the main characters the past 2 movies and then gets an anticlimactic death scene come on not to mention it barely affected ethan and the rest of the gang we see one shot of ethan sad by a railing and then it’s back to business as usual 

after that we are expected to all of a sudden like ethan and grace together it felt really rushed grace consistently tried to sneak away from ethan but now ethan and grace are super close 

regarding the ending i just didn’t feel hyped for the next part whatsoever ethan won he got the key and knows the location of the sub it honestly should have ended with gabriel winning and ending up with the upper hand this just felt…boring 

here’s hoping part 2 kicks it up a notch also i couldn’t help but think the ai was the same from the show mrs davis if anyone has seen that",2023-07-12
most unrealistic part was hayley atwells bazongas disappearing when she put on the mask and reappearing when she took it off,2023-07-14
grace is a great addition to the cast but i really hope ilsas death was a bad fakeout,2023-07-12
"questions

why did cary elwes dni think he had any leverage over gabriel i missed that why did he expect anything other than just being killed it didnt come across as a surprise to me but i might have missed something in the dialogue that would have made it more twisty

kittredges monologuevoiceover at the end was that the same voice as the beginning that was on ethans tape or was the opening voiceover different than the tape if it was on the tape weird because the tape selfdestructed so are these new words from a second tape

i kind of suspect theres some stuff that will be reinterpreted in the second movie thatd be cool where we think weve seen one thing but it turns out it was something else explained in an entirely separate movie",2023-07-12
"where to start im a big fan of the franchise and was really looking forward to this one having seen it in imax last night i could not wait for it to be over it has amazing action scenes but overall it was about an hour too long it really needed trimming

the visualisation of the entity was hilariously bad it looked like a 2008 windows media player visualiser gabriel not communicating onscreen with the entity was a huge miss how cool would it have been if he had an earpiece and the ai was giving him realtime instructions now it was something lame like i have prepared for a thousand outcomes him jumping off the train onto a truck was so  

no idea why they introduced grace when you have rebecca ferguson there she literally couldve done all the things grace did 

the fact its 3 hours long and only the first part of a twoparter is wild to me this franchise doesnt need a 6 hour movie for such a simple story",2023-07-12
the sunken submarine at the bottom of the ocean is very bad timing,2023-07-12
"some complaints

ilsa is almost certainly not dead but i think they could have made it more believable  evidence  right before the venice party seen ethan was told he needs to think like a computer so taking ilsa off the chessboard makes the most sense  also ilsa had a fake out death earlier  also furgeson is cast in part 2  also benji is the one who had the fake bomb foreshadowing that his personal info will be weaponized  also her deciding to fake off herself makes a lot of the plot holes make a bit more sense why nobody mourns her death why grace seemingly faced gabriel for no reason why he was told not to deviate from the mission

im not sure why gabriel is a superspy villain if ethan and gabriel crossed paths before ethan was part of imf then gabriel should really only be a street level criminal  also why does gabriel have such a hatred of ethan  maybe all of this will be explained better in the next movie  imo he should have just been a unknown new villain  this would actually clean up a lot of plot holes and make ilsas death actually feel more like an emotional weight on ethan

graces motivations the entire movie seemed bizarre  i get not wanting to give the key away in the airport but even then who was she going to sell it to  but after rome she 100 should have realized yeah this whole thing is definitely over my head i should definitely trust this ethan guy who so far is the only one who isnt trying to  me  venice should not have happened the way it did and i have no idea why she was going to  gabriel unless gabriel intercepted her escape  but why if he assumed the widow was going to do good on her end  couldnt really tell  also at the end not entirely sure why she didnt just take the money might as well have even if you planned on double crossing the us government

benji using autopilot for his car even though the entire plot of the movie is that there is an evil ai trying to take over the world that is untraceable and untouchable and can control any technology  i was almost certain that there would be repercussions for doing this but no

personal gripe but i dont like super pickpocketing as a trope  pickpocketing is actually incredibly difficult even more so when the person youre trying to pickpocket is aware that youre going to try it  they did it a lot in this movie and treated it almost like a super power nobody ever failed at it and it was always too clean  this one is more of a personal gripe though

other than that pretty much loved it  there are a few complaints that can probably be explained in part 2 but i am wary that grace will be better fleshed out as a character and its going to take a lot for me to buy that gabriel is as competent as he is considering who he should be  honestly i wouldnt doubt if there is a 35 hour cut or 4 hour cut that better explains some stuff and adds a bit more to some of the scenes that had awkward pacing",2023-07-13
"still can’t believe ilsa lost with a sword vs a knife worst story misstep they’ve had in a while

really liked the movie but man that is still bothering me she’s a trained assassin and elite fighter ugh",2023-07-17
"did anyone think the writing  plot to this movie was cheesy as 

look i know its been critically acclaimed by critics and fans but i couldnt stop to think it was almost parodying itself in some ways as well  
the waytoolong scene where kittridge and cronies are explaining the ai to denlinger by saying one sentence at a time to form a giant story as if its some improv warmup youd do in class just made me laugh out loud because of how long it overstayed its welcome also who is that good at talking  
which is interesting because that  writing is diffused pun intended by awesome natural moments like in the car chase scene and the chemistry  awkward pitterpatter between ethan and grace  
but the whole plot of there being an ai the threat just didnt seem real like what even is the threat so  a sub blew up great we didnt really see anything else this ai is capable of its just some menace in the background and is personified via gabriel who we are supposed to care about because of a quick flashback  
i dont understand gabriels power either hes not a bionic supervillain hes just a regular guy indoctrinated by a computer talking to him i guess its not like he has super fighting ability or has downloaded the future into his brain his monologue in the club of the ai knowing everything thats going to happen is downright silly he could have just been  the ai could have been a screensaver on the background  
also when gabriel emerges from the luggage in the train he has a what i assume is oxygen mask with the ai on it at first i thought he was bionic and this thing was programming him in that moment but what the  was the point of that mask  
everything just seemed really paint by numbers in terms of a big threat and writing twists like a hand off gone wrong and this person will double cross you i dont know it seemed phoned in for me  
also the whole macguffin with getting this key for something nobody knows what it does seemed pretty pointless  
i would have wanted to see the ai launch a nuke and destroy a country and have the stakes be real but it seemed like we were just supposed to trust the fear imbued in everyone in this film this whole thing could be a ruse",2023-07-12
i don’t understand how everyone is rating this so highly the “entity” plot line was exciting predicting outcomes was really cool but there just wasn’t enough of it gabriel felt so unintimidating scenes were way too long plot could of been executed better and overall didn’t live up to the hype they honestly could of cut a few unnecessary scenes made others much shorter and made this into 1 movie and gone 3hours in length however the cliff jump scene was really awesome but still a 610 for me,2023-07-12
killing ilsa off makes this a bad movie full stop,2023-07-12
"did anyone else feel a sense of irony when atwell’s character was warned ethan would use her then dump her for the next one

ironically that’s what it feels happened with rebecca ferguson they killed off a great character and replaced her with a new shiny version",2023-07-14
"not as good as fallout for me personally but still it was a really fun ride runtime of 2 and a half hours went by so quickly 

i just felt fallout was a bit tighter with the narrative whereas this one got a bit wonky with the whole gabriel character introduced in a like 10 second flashback sequence 

lots of people talking about the train sequence and with good reason it was awesome but i think my favorite set piece was the airport one luther deepfaking ethans face onto random people to throw the cia guys off the scent the cat and mouse with ethan and grace benji defusing the fake bomb 

i felt like that sequence while not as flashy was mission impossible at its best",2023-07-16
"honestly do movie reviews mean anything anymore this is a great action movie but the plot was absolutely absurd and theres weird exposition and pacing issues throughout there is no way its a 96 its much worse than any of the recent entrys like fallout and ghost protocol

the key macguffin gets old real fast",2023-11-02

"i’ve seen the last four mission impossibles on opening weekend it has quietly become one of my favorite franchises and i… was disappointed

my girl ilsa didn’t deserve to go out like that i’ve recently seen a lot of criticisms about other big franchises killing off their strong female characters as a means of making their leading men feel bad i could see the blog post as the fight on the bridge went on if they wanted her out they should have given her the exit julia got in fallout

hayley atwell is charming and a great addition to the cast i can’t figure out for the life of me why ethan chooses to trust her so much in my opinion handcuffing him to the steering wheel may as well have been attempted  and now he has to choose between her and ilsa honestly same with pom ethan kills henchmen all the time when pom asks why she was spared i really wanted him to answer the only assumption i have is that he doesn’t  women

bike stunt was underwhelming i know that’s such a keyboard warrior thing to say and i know how much workrisk goes into this stuff but it just wasn’t as cinematic as other big “poster” mi stunts train on the bridge sequence was peak mi though

but most of all i was just bored a lot it seemed like so much of the runtime was exposition planning tense speeches… this one took a long time to really get going i wasn’t really engaged until the airport scene

hoping that now the pieces are set and part ii hammers it home but i think this one’s a 610 for me and mi is usually a personal 89",2023-07-13
"they really worked overtime to avoid saying “ai”

“i’m telling you hunt it lives in every computer it’s like some unstopping… artificial… entity”

i think this movie will mark the beginning of a decade of ai being bad guys and then one day it’ll hit too close to home",2023-07-12
"saw this 2 days ago and it was phenomenal

fallout still remains the best but this was up there with rogue nation level of greatness

the only thing that stops it from reaching fallouts goat status is the pacing and overlypacked story which will elevate the film on a rewatch some people also might not like what they did with a certain character although i thought it worked within the context of the story

the train sequence alone was worth the ticket price and the action in this was again out of this world

hayley atwell was a refreshing addition to the cast and she did great especially in the second half of the film

balfe composed another amazing soundtrack as well and i cant get over how good the opening 20 mins were leading to the titles sequence

in addition the decision to change cinematographers and shoot digital the signature de palma dutch angles mi 1 vibes and the beautiful set locations made for some truly spectacular cinematography it has an orangebrownish tint but not as strong as the yellow tint that ran through rogue nation or the heavy blacks present in fallout

in other words  it will look stunning in 4k

the wait for part 2 will be long especially with how theyve set up the villain of the film

i really wish fights on top of a train would stop being a thing in hollywood as they are just flat out ridiculous especially when the train is moving 80mph or however fast this one was going  take the fight inside and you can have pretty much the exact same action sequence just one grounded in at least a bit of reality,2023-07-13

"i originally posted this in the mission impossible reddit but here’s my take about a certain character 

i liked the movie a lot but was very disappointed with what happened with ilsa however here’s my theory for the time being she’s not dead we know the imf repeatedly uses the same tricks to deceive others think mask infiltration to achieve their goals in rogue nation brandt is led to believe julia had been murdered as a way to protect her identity from bad actors now what if ethan found ilsa on that bridge and we didn’t see him discovering she had a pulse they could keep her existence hidden as a major wild card against the entity in dead reckoning  part two we know the entity relies on predictability to stay ahead of ethan and co so having any kind of wild card would be necessary to defeat it that and i believe this was foreshadowed when we were momentarily led to believe that paris was dead until degas checked her pulse after ethan had escaped call it wishful thinking but i think it could be a cool twist when we get part two next year",2023-07-14

"i have a theory ilsa and luther fooled the entity in venice

the entity said either grace or ilsa were dying so luther and ilsa faked ilsa’s death to “prove” the ai right and save grace 

that’s why luther disappears at the end of the movie and doesn’t seem sad about ilsa at all 

there’s a couple giveaways imo 

the first scene where ilsa appears she fakes her death and the camera aims at her on the floor similar to how she lays on the bridge 

ilsa suddenly appears on the boat without ethan knowing implying her and luther have been in contact without telling ethan",2023-07-15
"i didnt understand why ethan is the only one who had to do a tom cruise level stunt to get on to the train in the climax when every other character gets onto it with relatively lot less effortparis gets onto it by simply jumping off a bridge and then unlocks the container carrying gabriel which is somehow already inside the train

the cia agent duo get on the train and it seemed like other compartments even have ordinary civilians so if white widows henchmen checked every passenger who boarded the train at the station they must have still stopped grace considering her disguise doesnt work because they would know she isnt their boss

also benji is using what i assume to be a laptopwhich can breached by the entity since luther said he only modified the commsfr guiding ethan onto the train so i was expecting them to acknowledge or realise that the entity was making it harder for ethan to get on to the train by misleading them or something but it never happened 

i can understand that tom cruise probably made the writers write the climax around that stunt after coming up with it and of course the stunt itself extremely impressive but it could have been fit into the narrative with little more grace it is also publicised so much so as soon as he got onto that bike you would be waiting for that stunt scene and every time it cut to him trying to catch up to the train you know it isnt going to work which made the scene feel dragged out although i actually liked the landing part since it embraces the absurdity and dumb luck involved in ethans missions which i guess isnt an opinion i would share with many people",2023-07-16
i thought this was really good but a definite step down from fallout but to be fair thats probably an unfair criticism because i genuinely think fallout is one of the best action movies of the 2010s just below the raid movies,2023-07-16

gabriel as a villain wasnt that great honestly for those whove seen the earlier films phillip seymour hoffman rip had the best villain in the mi series,2023-07-16
after initially thinking it was genuine im coming around to the theory that ilsas death was an elaborate fake to allow her to move invisible to the entity only ethan luther and benji know the truth theres a few hints the only real mourning is shown by grace when asking luther about her and the knife use to  her has its own focus shot during the entity party im betting shes working on how to actually access the entitys source code once ethan has the cruciform key and the sevastopols computer,2023-07-17
"question about plot spoilers

i think i might have zoned out during a crucial point so alanna has one half of the real key and hired grace to steal the other half of the key but grace keeps it and alanna never receives the other half of the key so does alanna just plan to sell just one half of the real key and if she chose to help gabriel why would she sell it and not give it to him",2023-07-17
"they got such a great cast of ladies in this movie im very happy with all of the different energies they brought to this film  pom was so fierce and and crazy i loved her looks

that said im super disappointed by the way that they killed off ilsa  mi rogue nation is my favourite of the series mainly because of ilsa  shes the only female character where i felt like there was real chemistry between her and hunt because shes not just a romantic interest shes truly his equal when it comes to spy craft  theres a lot of betrayals in mi with a focus on how coldly governments use or discard their agents  but what really brought that home for me was experiencing it with elsa when her superior wiped her drive so that she had no way to come home  ilsa and hunt really feel like kindred spirits sometimes and the scene where she asks him if he would leave with her at the end of mi5 was probably the most emotionally resonant this series has been for me

the way that her character story played out this film felt like they just wanted to fridge her so they can replace her with grace  im really baffled how choosing between ilsa and grace is supposed to be difficult for hunt  on one end you have someone who he has known for several years and is probably romantically involved with on the other end is someone hes met for like 2 days thats refused to cooperate with him every step of the way  

the fight between her and gabriel was also ridiculous not only because of the terrible sword choreography but also because grace who is not supposed to have any special training seemed to hold up around the same as ilsa against him  also can someone explain why gabriel didnt  grace after he killed ilsa

and if she really had to die that way i was hoping for something more emotionally poignant than what we were left with  bringing back some nessun dorma in the score would have been such a great callback to when we first met her",2023-07-18
"there is absolutely no way in  ilsa is dead by that point in the movie they know the entity is able to predict things that are going to play out i think its a misdirection to fool the entity into thinking shes dead meanwhile shes mia and only hunt knows shes not dead if the entity knows all then hunt cant risk letting benji and luther in on the fact that shes actually alive and is going to be used by hunt in someway to eventually dispose of the entity 

unless rebecca ferguson absolutely told them she was finished and to end her story in this one so she can focus on idk dune or silo i mean dune 2 is already in the can silo just ended and i havent read anything about them filming season 2 in the near future 

absolutely no way on gods green earth is ilsa dead 

agree with so many people saying it was a homage and spiritual successor to mi 1 it 1000 percent was i was a little confused by the start because it didnt flow like the last 3 did but once you sort of realize you are watching the spiritual successor to mi 1 it made a  load of sense

i feel i am an outlier here but i found the film quite boring at times amazing action sequences of course but  much like the latest bond films  it seems like it was just loosely connected scenes in exotic locations without much of a story to link them together even when a main character died i felt nothing as the scene just felt like a drag to me you could make the same argument for mi fallout but at least they had a charasmatic villain two villains no less so i was engaged in what happened this time round they had an under baked antagonist who i didnt fully get the motivations of and an ai who felt understandably like a background presence rather than a genuine threat i hope the second part wraps it all up nicely but i really feel this could have done with either some serious editing to make the pace quicker or it it has to be that long development of the characters as there were just too many for me to really care about,2023-07-20

"the scene where ethan was running on top of the abu dhabi airport building and then voila  we are in rome i laughed my  off on that 

the built up of the scene where ethans jumping off from the mountain top seemed very off

overall this movie was a mess maybe i expected too much

i must have rewatched the bathroom fight scene from fallout more than a dozen times the burjkhalifa section from the ghost protocol almost a 100 times but i still dont get bored of those parts 

meanwhile there was nothing i mean no scene worth rewatching in this edition of the movie franchise",2023-10-14
"after the extreme highs of top gun maverick and mi fallout this was such a let down kept feeling like a too many cooks situation with a lot of writing and some weird decisions

"holy  this movie was comedically terrible this movie demands you have no brain and have literally zero expectations for any sort of quality writing the dialogue in the movie is just an explanation of what is about to happen with not a single normal conversation the plot completely disregards any sense of reality and as such apart from the visuals theres nothing left the soundtrack is terrible just a random assortment of orchestral noise at various volumes for dramatic effect the plot just randomly moves from set piece to set piece making up reasons to be there as it goes along with exposition every 30 seconds perhaps ironically the movie itself seems like it could have been made by an ai the costume design is hilariously bad with the female characters looking like they robbed various disney characters for their costumes

complete drivel and i would only recommend it if you want to hate watch it for comedy purposes but be warned its long and exhausting to watch

it was entertainment but there were certainly flaws the river cgi during the train scene was noticeable gabriel is just not as intimidating i would have rather they did something with angela bassetts character ilsas death was not handled properly they moved on so quickly her presence will be missed was not a fan of shaky shots during the car chase sequence but the plot is very interesting and i hope benji and luther get more to do in the next,2023-07-14

"honestly the more ive thought about gabriel the more its bothered me the way they just jammed him into ethans backstory in the laziest way possible were at what mi7 where has gabriel been the past thirty years just wandering the globe waiting for a selfaware ai to be invented hes apparently badass enough that ilsa knew his name and that hes some sort of agent of chaos and the white widow feared him so much she nearly bugged out when he threatened her but none of the rest of them even knew he existed except ethan who only knew his face from thirty years ago and had no idea who he was maybe if they had had amazing foresight to plant esai morales into the background of certain scenes every single movie before this so that its revealed hes been behind everything this entire time for years then thered be some rationale to the dread everyone acts with upon revealing him but as it stands hes little more than some smoothlooking guy who acts tough and makes threats but really just comes out of nowhere

they should have set him up as an unknown that the ai has established as its voice who speaks for it and does as it demands but is a complete mystery to everyone who he is it would make his actions more surprising you dont know why he does what he does except that he is told to hes mean and strong surprisingly talented enough of a fighter to outdo ilsa and grace on the bridge and even gives ethan a run for his money

ethan didnt need the sledgehammered backstory of how he joined the imf the idea that this guy gabriel killed someone and set him up for  is annoying for one thing there was no reason to make it that ethan had to join the imf for that and that hes actually innocent they make it clear that everyone joins the imf as a choice because they did something bad why does ethan have to be the odd one out and second if gabriel is such a terror to everyone in the spy network despite having vanished for 30 years after stabbing some rando woman in an alley wouldnt they know gabriel did it and why would they want to hire ethan based off that one

after relatively airtight plots of mi 45 and 6 this was jarring so after killing ilsa gabriel just leaves grace alone on the bridge with half the key dafuq he could have captured and tortured her to obtain the key and killed vanessa kirby to get the other key instead of dealing with all this drudgery what use was the entitys precognition powers except to erase cctv footage i was expecting gabriel to have an earpiece and more hired goons because the entity could steal cash and outsource anonymously btw if the entity wanted to protect itself why not just have gabriel destroy the key or even just half the key to lock out the sub or takeover another sub and shoot out a torpedo to completely destroy sevastopol the entity is so focused on peoples emotions that it missed the easiest path to obtain its goal the quality a cold calculating machine should have had they hyped up the motor jump but we didnt see him steering towards the train lameo compared to hanging off the burj kalifa a plane or even the motorcycle chase i hope they were saving their load for part two because this is ranked below mi 456,2023-07-18
"mixed feelings for me but ultimately a bit of a disappointment 

the good  most of the action was well done some things were over the top and stretched believability ie the whole parachuting through the side of the train at the exact right moment etc but im willing to roll with it for the most part i thought the performances of most of the main cast were pretty good

the bad  the writing and plot was just awful imo im not even the type of person that needs a perfect plot with no holes in my blockbusters but this one was just bad the expositionheavy scenes with extreme closeups and overly dramatic line reading was so cringe people dont talk that way the idea for the story ai and its effect on society is prescient but the execution was nonsense and calling it the entity instead of ai was just dumb it also didnt affect the story enough in something like terminator the terminator is relentless and seemingly everywhere all the time and the characters always have that hanging over their heads here the influence of the ai only seems to be important when they need it for a particular moment in an action sequence rather than influencing every decision they make they should be worried about dealing with ais influence on their perception of reality and trying to mitigate it literally all the time 

the character of gabriel was also a 2d bad guy again hes essentially a human terminatorlike character who should be scary but i didnt get any real sense of it aside from being told it at first and i have no idea what his motivations or goals are aside from just being the bad guy i did like pom klementieff as his henchwoman even though she basically had no lines her death scene was idiotic however how did she get from the room on the train car where she was stabbed to the dangling car ethan and grace were in with a gaping wound in her gut on the verge of death and manage to pull them both up from the brink of death nonsense ultimately i could have dealt with that if the rest had been good but it just wasnt 

finally it was too long it could have had at least 20 minutes cut out by tightening up the dialogue eliminating one of the chases andor having one less plunging train car",2023-07-19
i feel like i just dont connect with these films as much as the majority of people obviously at its core its an action film im not expecting it to be the most insane narrative of all time but i just felt that was incredibly plain cliche and a bit of a drag the constant close of shots of every characters face whilst they spend 10 minutes just explaining the plot is so exhausting the stunts were very cool of course but i just didnt feel like it was enough to justify the bland parts of the film,2023-07-20

"i feel like im in the minority with this take but i did not enjoy this movie as much as i expected to

now i understand the intentions behind the homage to brian de palma and the original mission impossible in 1996 they recreating many scenes from the original like ethan sneaking into the cia running through narrow european streets at night to save a team member arriving just after shes been killed flashback scenes to hint at the missions failure fighting on the roof of trains and the use of dozens of dutch angles in practically every other shot however despite these wellexecuted nods dead reckoning suffered significantly for me in terms of its writing characters and loopholes

x200b

characters gabriel felt underdeveloped as a character i appreciate the attempt at fleshing out ethan’s premi days but giving me a 5 second clip simply announcing that it’s ethan’s old nemesis without anything else added at all was a bit roughits truly disheartening how rebeccas character met her end choosing between a woman you love and someone you just met a couple of days ago isnt a real dilemma and felt forced due to poor writing moreover the aftermath of rebeccas death didnt have the impact i anticipated it seemed like her character was somewhat neglected as if she was just a plot device to advance the story considering the history her character had with ethan she deserved a more fitting and respectful exit

x200b

writing the writing as a whole felt lazy luther explaining what might happen in the train felt like it fell out of a first semester college student’s backpack the odd expository dialogue chunks in the first half could have used a couple more drafts the government people explaining the ai felt like they used basic chat gpt to write the script about next level ai the “shoot her” line was the icing on the cake for me why do you tell someone else to shoot her when you yourself have your hand on the trigger

x200b

loopholes too many loopholes holes does the entity simply desire to nuke the submarine because it holds its only weakness why didn’t gabriel immediately try to destroy the key when he found it why doesnt the ai just launch a few nukes at where the sub is why can’t this godlevel ai figure out the location of the sub

"overall i enjoyed the movie but left pretty disappointed definitely felt like a step back from the previous movies 

off the top of my head main issues 

1 the entity being the villain this felt like boomers trying to tap into ai fears but totally failing to do so in a cohesive way overall way too amorphous hence having to use gabriel as a representative why couldn’t the ai just  ethan or anyone instead it throws a party and shows up as a strobing light lol

2 the nuclear bomb at the airport giving benji random riddles and super deep questions like “are you afraid of death” in order to learn more about him set aside the “entity” creating this the entire concept of it learning about him through those questions was laughable 

3 the two special agents that spent the entire movie chasing ethan they always felt like a convenient plot device never characters that actually mattered to the story 

4 action scenes were great but it seemed like they were trying to shoe horn as many cool scenes into the movie as possible i get it it’s an action movie but you run the risk of turning into a fast and furious movie when you force in action scenes at the expense of plot",2023-07-25
"things i liked

 action was topnotch even if the chase scenes didnt feel as cleanly photographed as in fallout  dead reckoning pt 1 felt half as long as it actually was

 there was a lot of physical comedy punctuating the action cruise and atwell swapping spots in the car was brilliantly done

 the final sequence when the heroes are racing against the train as it plummets one car at a time was brilliantly done  it wasnt just run jump phew we made it

 despite all the moving parts and opposing parties everyones motivation in this movie made perfect sense which is no small feat

things i didnt like

 fridging ilsa it was the worst kind of fridging killing a character who matters not just to the hero but to the audience  it completely undermines the final exchange in fallout  is that really it for the character  did we really get such an awful development because of scheduling conflicts  why even include the bit about gabriel killing ethans old flame if they were forced to  ilsa too

 the plot felt a lot less cohesive than fallouts and much less in service of the actions tension  having everyone pickpocketing the key from each other basically became who needs to have the macguffin in their pocket to set up the next action sequence

 i understand the claustrophobia inherent in the alleyway fight but i wish wed been able to see more of pom klementieff in action

 the entity is such a mouthful they couldnt come up with anything to make the dialogue surrounding the antagonist less awkward

 gabriels khaaaaan moment and decrypting blockchain really

 fridging ilsa  yes im incredibly sour about this

dead reckoning pt 1 was great but its starting to look like fallout was lightning in a bottle  that movie worked on a level that dr1 couldnt quite replicate  im interested to see where dr2 goesim just bit less interested than id be if ilsa were still in the picture",2023-07-26
"good movie and fun concept since sci fi is becoming real today fallout was better i think ghost protocol is better also i rank this as third now so that pushes rogue nation to forth for me spoilers below

the cinematography was a massive downgrade in this film after fallout i was expecting more of the same i figured the series had hit its stride with christopher mcquarrie directing but with the dop change and i guess the directing it felt far less mature grand and epic certainly compared to fallout but even to rogue nation the endless dutch angles which ive always disliked coming after fallout which basically had none just wasnt cool the lighting and action camera work wasnt at the level of fallout 

in terms of the action itself the italy chase was fun and i always enjoy a massive vehicle chasing as smaller vehicle in movies t2 canal scene huge truck vs dirt bike for example but the paris chases in fallout where just better shot and the goofy fiat while humorous actual detracted from the scene because of that humor the train sequence in particular after the bridge explosion and the climbing up the train cars one by one as gravity pulls them as fantastic i didnt like how hunt just exploded into the train for an accidently saving of grace

the character development which the series has frequently made an after thought wasnt as good or well integrated as in fallout in the previous film learning more about hunts weakness for choosing people he cares about was very well done it truly felt like we got to know what motivated him more on personal level and fit well with what we already had seen in the series the flashbacks with the villain in this movie are a bit jarring since this is the seventh movie and we havent had hint of how hunt ever became part of the imf it just kind of calls attention to itself too much 

the music was pretty good but had a very different tone from fallout as well fallout had an almost inceptionish vibe to parts with its integration of my synths which i thought was a huge modern upgrade it had the best renditions of the original theme and made the 70s theme fit very well for a modern day movie go listen to the exchange from fallouts soundtrack but all that was gone in this film a movie with an ai character that seriously could have made use of those synth elements this movie felt like a much more traditional soundtrack

i didnt like the ilsa sword vs dagger fight on the bridge it felt fake and too choreographed it had huge sweeping kind of childish aerial camera moves that again contrasted the very real and gritty camera moves of fallout i compare that fight to the washroom fight in fallout and just  thinking of the bridge scene it felt like a completely different filmmaker and in a bad way it was also exceedingly clear what was about to happen to ilsa who was basically underutilized in this movie and existed to die her last 10 or so minutes were mostly silent with no real impact on the scenes at the party 

i really like grace and thought she was a great new addition to the series it was fun seeing a character be recruited into the imf 

i hope the next movie is good but i dont feel it is likely to exceed fallout either same dop and i imagine the music will probably be in the same style if it is as good as this film then great a this was a pretty darn good movie but overall i was really hoping fallout would set the direction for the remainder of the series but clearly it did not",2023-07-27
i could go for a gritty mi like 1 or 3 getting tired of these polished ones,2023-07-27
"let me start by saying i am a fan of the franchise overall not a fanboy just a fan but
  

  
is it a sign of the times and so many people have become too lazy to think for themselves or critically review a piece of cinema i can’t even believe the near perfect reviews it’s getting on rt are people blind sheep or just incredibly 
  

  
that was the laziest writing i have seen in any of the series and if you were honest you would really rate it alongside mi2 as being one of the worst of the series i came so close to just walking out of the theatre after ilsas fate unfolded
  
tropey is all i can say its like they just took a blueprint of helena from indiana jones and the dial of destiny and went yeah that will do
  

  
warning spoilers ahead
  
so many times throughout the series the creators have made a specific point very well of creating complex characters and in this case female characters  they have been incredible ilsa was a brilliant complex and complicated character who was capable of love betrayal and everything and between and with this had a complex set of circumstances and motives that drove her but at her core from the start you knew she was just like the team human caring and would always put the needs of the one or the many ahead of her own a point driven home over and over again throughout the series and indeed in this movie both by benji and ethan and it is this character trait i believe above all else that makes her and all of the characters so likeable and makes the viewer empathize with them and care about them
  

  
i almost feel like i should write the rest of this as lazily as this movie has been written so it can be understood by a 10yearold and everyone else be damnedso i will so what do they do they  ilsa and replace her with a tropey annoying  she steals from ethan and leaves him for dead he saves her life she steals from ethan and leaves him for dead he saves her life and on and on and on  so boring character arc what character arc
  

  
ilsa was shown to be so bad  in the previous films and she randomly dies fighting gabriel on a bridge getting stabbed please just shoot the fool and get it over with for gods sake i could have killed that idiot and i can barely  a fly  and again she is replaced with a vacuous selfserving tropey criminal who brings nothing to the table
  

  
we all faced a choice at the beginning says luther oh wow great save writers that really wraps it all up in a neat bow congratulations i really care about grace as a character now  it reaks of  lets just discard this character and replace her with this character and presto job done
  

  
a few cool scenes for sure but half the dialogue and writing was cheesy and boring and just dragged on and on and the key the key this the key that bloody norah who gives a  about the key if i hear about it one more time i think my head is going to explode
  

  
and for the love of  how the  did no one including zola notice that grace as the white widow had brown eyes when alanna has blue eyes there were a load of closeup shots of their faces and eyes leading up to the train scene i mean these guys are supposed to be elite best of the best criminals who are highly intelligent and dont miss a thing again lazy and pathetic writing i mean my girlfriend noticed the eyes and she misses everything in movie details",2023-10-04
wow the writing was extremely corny and cheesy,2023-10-11
"the action scenes didnt do it for me particular the fight scenes

coming after the bathroom scene in fallout this doesnt scratch that itch

which is a shame because we saw that mi could have fantastic fight choreography

also i hate how characters repeat dialogue twice character 1 summarizes the story in an already simple way character 2 so let me get this straight youre saying

this repetitive dialogue is such a pet peeve of mine in movies",2023-10-12
got about 20mins into the film then left utter dross how on earth did it get that 79 imdb rating the acting was poor and overall the storyline at that point made no real sense,2023-10-15
"not that great they baby the audience by repeating the plot threads a lot unnecessary when the thread is ai bad need key  location

it was silly to start it out by lecturing hunt over the mission briefing and more silly to get in his way you cant have the state of things be impossibly dire and hinder people who have a track record of solving those problems

also the source code doesnt do  to stop anything its ultron magic and we needed vision magic to counter it

its bloated and feels long 

the bad guy has incredible plot armor someone should just shoot him in the foot 

hayley atwel joined the team and got completely lucky she didnt die because hunt had no real plan to save her out of her depth by a mile  needs a year of training minimum also why couldnt hunt just fake her death like he has for others

there is more but why bother they can pay me to help edit the next one",2023-07-12
"i think it  didn’t feel like a mi movie right from the weirdly personal mission message to ethan in the beginning if it was that critical a message it should’ve been in person 

the major bike parachute stunt was shown to death in trailers but unlike when they did the same with rogue nation the set piece was at the end of the movie instead of the beginning kinda reflective of this movies ambitions should never have been a two parter 

the tone was bizarre and didn’t feel like high stakes espionage was taking place like in the previous movies a nuclear bomb in an airport should not be a whoopdedoo situation especially with how well fallout did it previous movies were able to have humour while still treating serious situations with gravitas

i don’t know why or how the script became this mess but i suspect covid and delays did this that and the two part movie format its a weird thing to do when there’s no book as source material",2023-07-14
"maybe i was just too hyped for this but after fallout this feels like a significant step back the idea of an ai that knows what hunt and the team are going to do before they do and can calculate all the possible scenarios that may occur is solid they just did a very poor job of showing that play out there was also too much exposition around the entity and what it can do instead of showing its capabilities throughout the movie

shea whighams character felt pointless and added nothing to the overall storyline there was a moment when he is first introduced and they are tracking ethan at the airport that i thought it was going to go in a more bourne identity type of way but they just ended up being useless characters that were always two steps behind

i feel like gabriel as a villain was just not menacing and too chill they also shoehorned in a vague backstory that ties him to ethan hunt was clearly alarmed to see him at the airport but we are never really told why gabriel is such a big threat

giving hunt the choice of losing ilsa compared to grace whom he met like a day earlier felt off considering his years of history with ilsa then we get like five seconds of hunt being sad about it before he just moves right on hunt has shown that he puts his team above the mission in previous movies but here he pretty much contradicts that notion it just kind of came and went 

also there was no cold opening with hunt",2023-07-13
"so i did not enjoy the movie at all about the opposite of the guy behind me when we were walking out of the theater who said it exceeded his expectations

about 3040 minutes into the film i started to recognize the unending exposition which continued throughout the film  never before have i had to sit through exposition 2 hours into a movie that is when i started calling the movie exposition the movie

so this was when i got bored and started over analyzing the cinematography which was hard to ignore given how this film seems to use dutch angles every other shot but the angles arent typical angles instead theyre 5 to 10° and then every other angle is seemingly downward or upward which is fine but every conversation is either someone exerting dominance or being dominated that was when i changed my mind this is dutch angel the movie

seems most people really enjoyed the film i did not",2023-07-15
"a little mystified by the universal critical acclaim was it bad no i had fun and it looked and sounded amazing in dolby but i dont think it comes close to the highs of the previous installments  

its ironic that a movie about bad ai felt like it was written by ai

i thought the plot was awful like i dont need mi to have a realistic plot or anything but turning the villain into ai and then using a bland surrogate as the human face of the ai made the movie feel pretty lifeless to me i thought the attempted retcon of ethan and the rest of the imfs backstory was ridiculous why did they let him retire after mi3 then and forced without seeing the history between ethan and gabriel the villain didnt work because there was simply no emotional baggage between the two of them despite them trying to tell us it existed overall you could really feel this movie explaining everything to us rather than showing us the second scene was one of the worst scenes ive seen in a while — just constant quick cutting to closeups while the characters dump exposition on us all the exposition really took me out of the movie i was not immersed in the movie until the final act and i think thats a pretty damning indictment for a mi movie 

i thought they missed a real opportunity to explore the impact of ilsas death on ethan by breezing past it after one short scene where luther makes one comment about his relationship with her it felt insignificant to the point where i didnt understand the point of killing one of the better characters in the franchise — if its not going to weigh on ethan emotionally then whats the point of killing her off

the last 45 minutes were the most enjoyable but even then some absolutely ridiculous stuff happened  gabriel falling off the train into the bed of a pickup truck was such an eye roll i didnt think the big stunt lived up to the hype because they spoiled it already in the trailer and the extended preview and then they cut away from him attempting to land it

i had fun it wasnt terrible i just expect more from these movies because theyve been so  good since mi2 this is the first one ive seen since mi2 that i have no interest in rewatching its also the first time ive felt like theyve become kinda stale and i really think they need to switch it up moving forward as much as it pains me to say it i think the luther and benji stuff is getting stale its the same humor everytime i wish they would be as willing to swap out the team as they are to swap out attractive brunette sidekicks 

my takeaway is that this version of mi may have peaked with fallout i dont think theyre going to find a way top fallout unless theyre willing to change

given how much i was anticipating this movie and how good the last few installments have been i thought this was pretty disappointing a solid 710",2023-07-17
"my least favourite out of mi 4 5 and 6

the score felt reused from fallout  a lot of action but not the same suspense  gadgety scenes from the others which are gripping and i enjoy  climbing the tall building using the projector screen to steal the files accessing the water submerged computer server etc

overuse of cgi on the train falling sequences plates falling etc stood out to me  

then the whole key thing… she has the key no he has the key  no wait she thinks he has the key  he thinks she has the key but actually he has both of them and doesn’t know  i’m exaggerating but felt like we went round and round with the key idea and it became a bit contrived at the end

it’s certainly not a bad movie and i enjoyed it  but i didn’t “love” it  i’ll go see part two but i felt this has been overhyped  ghost protocol still my favourite",2023-07-12
"am i the only one who didnt love this movie the opening was a slog the exposition was repetitive and stilted everything with gabriel was tell not show they rewrote canon they invented a female character solely to retroactively fridge her then they fridged ilsa only for her to be instantly replaced by another love interest    seriously this movie treats women like they are toys so ethan can have a little pout when they get taken away

the stunts were very cool and there were some quite funny bits theres a lot to like but its very tonally different from the more recent installments in a way that didnt resonate with me if this was my first mi i wouldnt seek out another im glad other people enjoyed it though",2023-07-13
"i was really bored by this movie aside from the final scene on the train  i felt as though i was watching the same conversations happen over and over and over again as if the studio was concerned the audience wouldn’t quite grasp the danger of the ai or the gravity of the keyentity falling into the wrong hands

moreover the revelation that the entity is afraid of ethan hunt while making distorted animal noises made me burst out laughing again playing into my theory that the studio was worried it wouldn’t come off as scary enough

gabriel as a villain was pretty weak and didn’t feel earned  he’s not compelling enough to be the franchises’ big bad

lastly it suffers from the same thing any two parter does  the stakes aren’t all that high as you know at the least ethan has to survive",2023-07-12
painfully mediocre the film was like 80 wonky dialogue there’s more scenes of cruise just running than genuine action scenesset pieces my mind is blown that it’s sitting at 96 on rotten reading some of the reviews on there it’s like critics watched a different movie from the one i did glad i watched it on a normal screen and didn’t buy into the hype and opt for imax saving that for oppenheimer next week,2023-07-16

everything was too explanatory the opening sequences for example i wouldve preferred it if it was completely in russian cause in english it sounded a little cringy and too simplified

also how many times do they say entity and key in this movie to the point i sometimes thought it was meant to be comical wasnt crazy for this ai and macguffin idea at all

"the gabriel character was clearly rewritten from when it was originally cast at least his relationship with ethan was unless they planned on a 4 year old nicholas hoult being a key figure from his past

mcquarrie has talked before about how he basically writes these while he’s already filming which just astounds me with how good they turn out",2023-07-14
"compared to the preceding films this one felt a little bit slapdash to me like they reverseengineered a plot to justify a cliff jump but if you can feel them ethan grace cruise mcquarrie making it up as they go along that’s sort of the spirit of the thing in some ways this is the scene in the first movie where ethan does a magic trick with the drive stretched to nearly three hours it’s a lot more fun than that sounds even if the middle act suddenly swings for serious with a little too much unearned force showing the seams of an improvisational creative style that sometimes requires a sacrifice that more careful planning could’ve avoided basically ilsas death made sense within the movies logici just dont understand the logic of making the movies logic demand her death 

still the movie got back on track by the time a train was flying off of one and i dont think infinite ais with infinite motorbikes could come up with all this wonderful daredevilry if cruise wants to eventually die onscreen for our pleasure i say we let him keep trying",2023-07-14

"im so mad they killed ilsa how dare they

in all seriousness she was one of my favorite characters  i dont know what grace can do in future installments to pay that back but i think ill always look at her with disdain  ilsa was a character with actual development built over the previous 2 movies and to have it all wasted away is such a shame  i love this franchise so much but why do they have to recycle female characters every couple of movies",2023-07-15

i really enjoyed it though ilsas death was such a flat moment and ruined the momentum it didnt feel like a good death for her character to have it did pick itself back up but i just cant get over the cheapness of ilsa being stabbed and if they do go with the faking her death for a second time how does that work from being stabbed and laying motionless i know luther said to think like the entity but how can she go from being a main character to just dying,2023-07-15

also in all the areas where tom cruise was being monitored airport mostly why didnt he just wear a mask with an accompanying passport so he can avoid all the trouble

also if all the entity wants is no one to access the submarine for its source code why not just have gabriel destroy half of the key so no one could ever stop it chuck it in the middle of the ocean gg no one can control destroy or stop it now

and why cant they just make another key it seems like an analogue key and they have the perfect mold for it and the perfect specs so whats preventing them from making another one",2023-07-16

1 i still dont get how ethan landed on that train let alone in the exact spot where he needed to be

2 paris saving ethan and grace felt like a cop out there shouldve been a better way to end what would have been one of the best set pieces in the series

overall it was fun not as good as rogue nation or fallout 810 for me",2023-07-16
it was really good and definitely in the top half of the franchise but i really missed the darker vibe that fallout had with much better cinematography    there was nothing in this movie that matched the shots of ethan peering out of the airplane ramp at the storm with the eerie music    fallout had a real vibe that set it apart from the others    this one felt much more like gp or rn   anyone else get what i’m saying,2023-07-16

why did grace and ilsa head right for gabriel on the bridge following the party neither knew where he’d be as far as we know he had neither piece of the key he literally announced one of them was going to be killed ethan told them to stay put and they both just… ran directly towards him,2023-07-17
"ilsa  grace

i am so annoyed",2023-07-17
"i am in shambles after being so excited for this movie if i had a nickel for each time  
 there was a dutch angle  
 a character finished another’s sentence  
 the key got pickpocketed  
 grace ran away from ethan  
 another official in the us bureaucracy showed up on that train

i’d be able to buy all the rapidly depreciating cryptocurrency being moved around in that movie

and the movie’s big stunt ending with ethan accidentally crashing through the perfect part of the train at the exact moment grace was about to get shot and then his parachute opening and saving them again like he’s mr bean killed me 

and while the train sequence was the one set piece that worked for me it then ended with grace and ethan playing endless train car frogger climb and only surviving because harley quinn who’s said two words in the movie so far has a nearly inexplicable change of heart

i have so many other thoughts including on the wild retconning of ethanimf’s origin the pacing pretty sure ethan doesn’t throw a punch until 90 minutes in the tone break from fallout the aigenerated villain ”gabriel” and the actual villain called “the entity” like a 1990s idea of what a sentient computer villain would
be but my brain and heart are numb finally “the interested party is the party” has to go down infamy as an alltime ridiculous line",2023-07-18

this is the first time i felt the plot was needlessly long and dragged on for very little purpose it wasnt tight at all like the other films the stunts were great tho,2023-07-19
when i thought ilsa was dead in the beginning it ruined the movie for me until i learned she wasnt when they killed her the second time  i felt like walking out i didnt but it really did ruin what would have otherwise been a very enjoyable movie for me guess im just not a fan of investing in characters and seeing them die in movies like this wouldve rather she just sat this movie out completely than meeting the fate that she did,2023-07-19

"after the back to back to back highs of ghost protocol rogue nation and especially fallout this was disappointing in comparison of course

its still good in my eyes 7ish out of 10 but i dont think the covid impacted production with multiple shutdowns has helped in fact ill blame it for the movies weaknesses apparently for instance haley atwell didnt even have lines for 6 months there was more ad libbing etc

i hope part 2 will be better but thats also kinda being impacted now too by the strikes

i see that the main complaint is too much exposition just between set pieces but they do this in almost every mission movie it was just more turgid and noticeable in this one maybe cause its an ai villian and theres too much telling not enough showing",2023-07-19
i enjoyed my time at the cinema and it was refreshing to watch something half decent after this years onslaught of  movies however it still fell a little flatter than what i had hoped for i actually thought to myself in the cinema that i feel like i’ve seen half the movie in the trailer also the whole movie felt like it could’ve been half as long but the latter half was dragged out almost like they only decided last minute they wanted a part two to make more money definitely some funny moments but i thought the pacing was a bit off probably a 610 for me enjoyable but somewhat forgettable and cliche,2023-07-19
the worst intro of all just meh and cue mi music so unlike all its predecessor what are they thinking,2023-07-19
"idk it was pretty meh obviously some great action but the plot and dialog was so goofy it felt like a scary movie style satire film i really began to wonder if it was written by an ai 

how does paris get fatally stabbed in the chest then save ethan and grace 10 minutes later moments before she dies how does ethan have enough speed from parachuting to smash through the steel walls of a train while also not being injured whatsoever ethan also clearly didnt have enough time to escape the fiat before the subway train hit him how the  does ilsa lose to a knife with a sword is ethan shifting the stick in the bmw while grace isnt touching the clutch at all

i know this type of stuff is common in action movies like this but they stretch the suspension of disbelief much farther than most and being mi i have higher expectations of it",2023-07-19
i felt the actor who played gabriel played him like a vegas magician like an any point he’d say “is this your card”,2023-07-19
my main reason i think they wrote ilsa to die is because they literally got almost an exact doppelganger in atwell to replace her she comes in after almost zero grief from ethan and now is part of this team that had been together for years felt out of place,2023-07-20
"plot wise i thought this movie was nonsense the core concept of the ai is cool and i like how it counters the typical mission impossible tech but everything with gabriel was weird who is he and how did he start working for this sentient ai why does he even believe the ai is sentient and not just some dude emailing him or whatever he was not shown to be a great fighter but was able to  isla in a terribly choregraphed fight scene isla has a sword and gabriel had a knife why was she character trying to grabble with him instead of fighting from a distance baffling story telling choices the action scenes were incredible though and i liked ethans chemistry with grace 

did anyone else notice the hissing noise on the dialogue tracks during the train scene i dont know if ive ever seen that in a movie of this budget there was also a lot of noticeable adr throughout the film",2023-07-22
seriously what is the point of the grace character  awkward forced in  and “the entity”    zero continuity from fallout  they did ilsa dirty in this,2023-07-23
"why did they  off ilsa so unceremoniously immediately replacing her with grace also gave her no chance with fans of the franchise 

i feel like lane would have been a better villain than the guy they had here maybe 3 movies is overkill but hes easily the best villain they had going and his story isnt necessarily complete they should have brought him back as the face of the entity because the gabriel part of this movie really dragged the movie down they had to jump through too many hoops to accommodate the character",2023-07-23
though i enjoyed the movie and was entertained by majority of it this one felt the most “marvel” like out of them all in my opinion in most of the others especially fallout and my personal favorite mi3 i felt like ethan had met a worthy bad guy who could actually hurt him or one of the team don’t get me started on the cheap death of ilsa  but this one just felt so much less serious to me even with the stakes being the highest they’ve ever been,2023-07-24

also while cruises ego may not be quite as rampant as some of the leads on the fast  furious series ethan gets beaten up and outmanoeuvred in ways that the rock jason statham or vin diesel would never allow themselves to be i do roll my eyes whenever characters wax lyrical about how supernaturally capable ethan hunt or his villains are",2023-07-28

edit even further on the entity thing they barely even show how nefariouscool it could be they really needed it to do more stuff like the benji bomb defuse to make it somewhat interesting or maybe show it attacking americans or something instead of some russians that i dont care about sheesh

the entity wasn’t an interesting ‘thing’ at all maybe if it messed with them more personally or even showed at all that it was ‘scared’ of ethan instead of just them declaring it the only cool thing that happens with that is benji defusing the bomb but that’s literally the only thing that happens between the team and the entity on a ‘personal’ level gabriel is so lame and uninteresting i have no idea how they expected me to care about something that’s literally never happened 6 movies in there is sooooo much ridiculous exposition dumps that ultimately just way over explain ‘wow hey this thing is very powerful and could lead to extremely negative outcome for da whooooole world’ as if we haven’t just had 6  movies all with the same exact concept every new character outside of maybe the two cop guys chasing ethan the whole movie were so boring even the main one hayley atwell her motivations in this movie are just dumb she’s obviously involved in something now that’s way bigger than whatever record she’s trying to erase ugh everything about this movie was just so beyond disappointing

  i’m not even joking for the standard of the series overall this might be my least favorite one even mission impossible 2 i can enjoy more than this in the ‘so bad it’s good’ sense because of just how ridiculous and silly it is compared to this just being boring

anyway yea disappointing",2023-07-15
"after the onetwo punch of rogue nation and fallout this does take a comfortable third place mostly because i’m surprised how well they pulled off ethan vs hal 9000

loved how they utilised the entity pitting the technologically advanced imf against their own hardware was a nice touch to ramp up the technothrills

atwell was a great addition to the cast primarily because grace calling out the insanity of ethan’s life was a much needed outsider perspective also because atwell in a suit was giving me  panic and i’m a straight dude

felt gabriel was a bit undercooked but i’m willing to give him a chance if they expand on his history with ethan in part 2

i had money on someone dying as a cliffhanger and i expected it to be luther did not expect ilsa and did not expect it that early",2023-07-12
"i saw the move a second time knowing that ilsa “dies” and here are some things i observed leading up to it

 the idea of ilsa being dead but not really is foreshadowed in the beginning of the movie

 ilsa’s very quiet and generally acting kind of strange from when they pick ethan up in rome to her death she knows more about the entity than the rest of the team and the reason she gives is literally just “i know someone”

 there’s an insert shot of a security camera recording ethan and ilsa as they enter the party there’s never any followup as to why that shot is there but later when luther talks about how he needs to decrypt the hard drive with all of the data from the party we’re left wondering what “data” might be there and why it might matter the only other two instances where camera recordings matter in this movie are when ethan and grace are detected in rome and then when they see gabriel getting erased on the footage in abu dhabi

 during the party itself several knowing looks are exchanged between gabriel and ilsa while ethan remains confused why

 luther gabriel and the entity all know that ethan will fail if he kills gabriel in revenge and thereby destroying any hope of knowing what the key will unlock it’s not unreasonable to think that the entity might be trying to make this happen

 hayley atwell explicitly said her character isn’t a love interest and isn’t meant to interfere with the relationship between ethan and ilsa

 chris mcquarrie is a smart screenwriter and everything else that’s ever been penned in these movies is done with lots of intent and rebecca ferguson is still listed as a cast member for mi8 according to imdb

my theory is that ilsa isn’t dead and that the ilsa we see beyond the intro is someone else most likely working for the entity and trying to derail ethan in a mask the team is going to find this out when luther shows them the footage from the party and we see that fake ilsa is also being erased in realtime",2023-07-12
this movie is hot garbage,2023-07-16
"probably the worst opening scene in the franchise

throughout the whole movie there is just too much repetitive dialogue you really dont need to spend 10 minutes on some boring suits explaining the dangers of ai between all this ai talk and clichéd scenes like a police officer reminding a person under arrest about all of their past crimes i was really bored while waiting for the action scenes to start and even the action didnt feel that exciting too much of been there done that okay the train scene was good but all of the bike jump was basically spoiled by the trailers the chase in rome was really annoying i was waiting for hunt to showcase his driving skills but they kept him at disadvantage by chaining him to grace for far too long 

the decision to  ilsa was horrible all of that development from the previous two movies went into nothing they should have kept her as one of the main characters and just written grace out of the movie grace was a character that weve seen a million times someone greedy and selfish who has a change of heart just look at the last indiana jones for an example of that the villain was really contrived felt like lazy writing ethan hunt is just not a type of character who needs these villains from his distant past

such a huge disappointment especially after how great mis 46 and maverick were for me it was surely the worst mi movie",2023-07-12
"i left the theater super angry what were the writers thinking

i was so excited for this movie 

everything was amazing until they killed off ilsa 

what the  were they thinking 

they killed her off like she was a minor character and immediately gave ethan a new sidekick in grace

if rebecca ferguson was busy with other projects they could’ve just written her out of the movie like they did with jeremy renner

i literally left the theater furious to  the only female lead to make it past 1 movie is insane

if benji or luther had been killed off their deaths would’ve been way more dramatic and actually impacted the story here they just killed her off and just forgot about everything rebecca ferguson brought to the table in rogue nation 

i don’t know whose decision it was but it was a  decision",2023-07-13
hayley atwell’s character was terribly written full stop it has zero to do with her acting but fridging a loved character for someone so awfully onedimensional was a slap in the face,2023-07-17
"hated it hard to choose just 6 but here’s the top 6 stupidest parts  

1 gabriel repeatedly blocking a sword with a small knife… that’s not how it works hollywood   

2 needed to fake a nuke to find out that someone wants to live and cares about his friends  

3  jumping off the 80mph in a dump truck because of a timer that can’t possibly know exactly where you are standing on the train   

4 using knifes to climb up the train like it’s made of styrofoam   

5 why does the ai only interfere with mif communication the one time also if it’s in all the electronics why is their one physical key that can stop it   

6 tiny asian girl who was stabbed has super human strength to pull up 2 people at once",2023-07-16
truly disappointing film terrible script wonky dialogue and laughable character development,2023-07-16
i hope part 2 is much better because this felt like a miss imo still enjoyed the action but the plot went nowhere definitely think fallout is the best entry in the series,2023-07-12
the weakest movie in the whole franchise imo utterly let down and unenthused about part 2,2023-07-15
this wasn’t good…right idk i felt that it was convoluted as  and i never wanna hear the word “key” again i love how ethan offers the job of super spy to a person who can’t drive can kinda fight and freaks under pressure,2023-07-15
"i hated this movie i considered walking out

1 ai doesn’t need visual representation and if it did it would t be the itunes visualiser

2 dont  off female love interests just to introduce a fresh one

3 is grace a master criminal or a helpless  the movie seemed to change its mind shes being picked up by state actors to complete multimillion dollar jobs but she cant drive a  car she looks like shes never been in a fight countless times in the movie but is also a badass knife wielding ninja just make her badass she doesnt need to be helpless just to be saved for the sake of the love interest 

4 lazy writing using the characters dumb outloud questions as opportunities to explain the plot to the audience

truly very bad",2023-07-24
"i watched the fan screening last night free miniposter and an imf pin and ive already forgotten half of what its about

heres my honest review of the film i enjoyed it but its just like all the others

lets face it all these movies feel interchangeable with one another the only thing that changes are the set pieces and the one dangerous stunt that cruise does himself only difference here is that this film is too  long and it doesnt have a  ending we have no idea what that double key is going to unlock and im not in any hurry to find out

this is not a knock on tom cruise or the mission impossible films they are fun light entertainment but they are also hollow shallow and forgettable in the nearly threehour runtime there were only 3 or 4 action sequences that really stood out to me the whole airport chasedouble cross the tuktuk fiat 500 chase which had the biggest laugh when it went down the stairs and they had swapped seats and of course the huge motorcycle jump leading into the extended 1944 train sequence those were all astounding and incredible set pieces if you ask me what the rest of the movie was about i would say its about long boring exposition speeches keys and the fact that everyone keeps pickpocketing everyone else and apparently no one ever notices

i loved all the women here hayley atwell rebecca ferguson vanessa kirby and pom klementieff were all awesome and kicked  ethan hunt himself continues to be a very boring infallible character to me compared to james bond or john wick hes a generic mary sue gary stu perfect action hero juxtapose this with someone like indiana jones who feels a lot more imperfect vulnerable fully fleshed out and wellrounded as a character

i found mi very entertaining and engaging while i was watching it but it just doesnt stay with me when its over this is what i mean by ephemeral entertainment its fun in the moment but i dont really care about any of the characters its just not substantial to me the way something like indy is

and speaking of which after my fan screening ended i went for a double dip of dial of destiny just because i felt like i needed a more satisfying movie with an actual ending",2023-07-12
"that car chase and train sequence are all time insane action sequences but the movie felt kindameh opening wasnt engaging and the villain felt too cheesy grace is a cool character but ilsa was literally put into the movie to do nothing but wait around and die and in mediocre fashion character motivations and whose side they were on werent entirely clear either heard multiple times walking out the theater kinda disappointed and that people were confused about the plot the whole movie which is exactly how i feel considering all the money time and effort put into this especially being the first movie back during covid its just wild to me this is the end product i expected something much more grand in scope in terms of story i really did like how the ai was a challenge for ethans tech team though that really added an element of suspense

theres a lot of elements that reminded me of the first one which i appreciated but considering fallout is straight up one of the best action movies ive ever seen they really should have kept leaning in that direction also unless the movie is based on a specific arc of an ip theres no reason a movie should be a part one or part two  thats simply called a sequel follow up to the next one on top of that if you are gonna do that they should at the very least be filmed at the same time  which i thought this was but apparently theyve been filming the new one recently  which again blew my mind because to me it seems theyve been filming this movie for like 3 years straight  this movie cmon there was way crazier stuff overall in fallout

not super interested in the submarine stuff theyre going to have to do in the next one so that cliffhanger wasnt all that exciting 

510",2023-07-12
am i  or did that entire venice scene make no  sense i really liked the last 3 mi movies and was hyped af for this but it just didnt land for me im too  to pinpoint exactly what made this movie bad but it felt like nothing happened even though it was really long it was like a 3 hour chase scene there werent really any fun missions not really any twists the fight choreography wasnt good especially the sword fight it felt like that under the bridge rave dancing the first 20 mins were great though it was also like 300 decibels in my theatre bone rattling overall i wish i didnt go also rebecca ferguson  haley atwell,2023-07-16
this is the most exciting action franchise currently while fallout is still my favorite i do like how each entry in the mi franchise finds ways to stay fresh  exciting it was also really interesting to see christopher mcquarrie have ethan hunt go against artificial intelligence  have audiences ponder what happens when ai develops a mind of its own the movie was outstanding  i can’t wait to see where part two will takes us,2023-07-12
while not bad it definitely falls a bit flat for being part 1 of 2 instead of having a world saving adventure its more so setting up the pieces for the next movie not as much action as id have hope with most of the action feeling a bit like a rehash of previous films didnt dislike it at all but definitely think its the weakest of macquarries 3 mi films so far hopefully the setup in part 1 has great payoff in part 2 next year,2023-07-12
"let’s play who wants the key

 kittridge’s congressperson wants the key for a global takeover

 gabriel wants the key on behalf of the ai but for some reason the ai knows he won’t use it against itself 
 the entity wants to key for selfpreservation
 alanna wants the key for a payout
 grace wants the key for a payout then for altruism 
 hunt wants the key for altruism",2023-07-12

would have gotten a good laugh",2023-07-12
"i’m going to be completely honest i’m kind of disappointed the movie wasn’t bad it just had a lot of issues that made it feel super off too many characters wack pacing bloated exposition some goofy dialogue misused characters and topping it off with a serious lack of character development 

feels like how a finale would feel but we only got the slow ramp up to the part 2 climax with some crazy set pieces sprinkled in definitely felt like the stakes weren’t realized well enough to give it that oomph of adrenaline i think that could have been realized better if they had ethan lean into that theme of destiny or rejecting it while others obeyed it that would have made for compelling character work while also making the entity feel like a present… well… entity because right now it just feels like a boogeyman who conjured a bunch of new characters into existence to push the plot with no explanation into who they are or why they are doing what they do",2023-07-17
"tom cruise works through a pandemic enforcing strict set rules runs his  off rides a motorcycle off a cliff and along with a cast and crew of hundreds crank out a heartpounding globespanning thrill ride of an action movie that score above a 95 on rotten tomatoes with critics and audiences just so some posters on reddit can shrug and go meh  wasnt that great

tom cruise was amazing all the fightaction scenes were awesome does anyone feel like the ai wants to die like thatll be the plot twist in part 2 everything was planned to push ethan to find the ai first because he wont use it like the other nations recruiting ethans worst enemy and killing his love interest were all to push him,2023-07-12
i cannot help but feel a little disappointed at the writing the action the stunts and the acting are good but the story wasnt as compelling as fallout if fallout was a 9 this is a 7 i greatly dislike the presumably real death of ilsa after an early fake out i also dislike the introduction of a new character that ethan cares about so late into the series and most of all i dislike the catch all ai sentient villain ethan needs a real person as a villain not an algorithm or a collective i hope the second part makes for a satisfying ending the editing for the first half of the film until the car chase seemed quite wonky tom cruise is really doing a great job even at this age and this is the kind of cinema people will pay to watch on a large screen,2023-07-12

 the whole sequence where grace puts the mask on to become the white widow—i thought it would become a plot point that her eyes were brown instead of blue yet nobody seemed to notice this  ",2023-07-12

did anyone else notice the poorly adrd line from hayley atwell at the end of one of the scenes with her and ethan at the airport there was a line they added in and her mouth was clearly not saying anything at all super nitpicky but just kinda odd havent noticed a blatant flub like that in a major studio movie in a long time,2023-07-12
the grace character seems like a missed opportunity to bring back nyah from mi2 a thief with whom ethan already has a preexisting relationship with both emotionally and professionally maybe they tried and thandiwe newton wasnt interested in returning but i think she would have made the act 2 climax a lot more powerful,2023-07-12
"this movie felt like like that boyfriend meme looking at another girl with the treatment of grace and ilsa with ethan

the bike jump sequence was fairly baffling to me all that hype and logistical prep with the cameras and timing and we barely see it outside of the initial jump itself 

they still could’ve cut to it prior to his surprise landing into the train",2023-07-12
"anybody else feel like they really built up the dirt bike off the mountain stunt too much like they really telegraphed it and built it up with benji leading him but not telling him the truth of what the path lead to and then ethan stopping and telling benji how impossible the impossible thing was it felt like they were really building that up to where the audience was supposed to be like oh my  hes going to drive off the cliff and parachute it felt built up like this is the craziest stunt ever but itsits not even close to the craziest thing hes ever done like this guy hung off a flying jet without even pausing to think about it

i dont think he should have stopped at the cliff it should have been benji tells him while hes driving that he has to go over the cliff he argues while hes driving something like i cant even see the train and benji will say its there you have to trust me theres no time and then he sees the ramp cliff off to the right and veers to it and goes off the edge blind that would have felt like less build up and more exciting

but i dont mean to devalue that incredible practical stunt in any way i appreciate it all mr cruise",2023-07-12

i thought ethan would suddenly recognize the parallels and realize that the ai was intelligent enough to manipulate people into elaborate scenarios but cant create anything original hed know gabriel was escaping the train via helicopter and would use that to stop him 

but i was overthinking everything and they were just random callbacks oh well

great movie though action scenes were excellent and hayley atwell was amazing overall not quite as good as fallout but still a fantastic mission impossible film 9510",2023-07-13

"i noticed joe cornishs name in the special thanks credits i wonder if this is his reward for very gradually telling the tom cruise anecdote on adam buxtons podcast

i liked the film a lot but my biggest disappointment is that after fallout this is the second mi film in a row that doesnt feature the team planning how to get into a place with absurdly specific security measures okay we have a bit of that when we see the initial version of the orient express plan but its not exactly the noise detectors at the cia vault or the closing air vents in the mi2 laboratory or the gait recognition sensors in rogue nation is it 

also i had hoped that the fallouts acknowledgement that hunt and his team always go rogue how many times has hunts government betrayed him disavowed him cast him aside would lead to this being the first film since mi2 that focuses on a sanctioned mission throughout sadly not although we do get a nice joke about how this always seems to happen

also the description of ethan hunt given here is even more delightful than the glorious living manifestation of destiny line in rogue nation

the entity

i admit wasnt fully on board with the idea of making an ai the big antagonist i know this is a series thats had things like implanted brain bombs and electromagnetic levitation vests but even though machine learning and predictive algorithms have been on all our minds recently somehow this feels like a step too far out of spy fiction and into science fiction

to be fair the movie primarily treats the entity as a tool like the rabbits foot or the chimaera virus  the weapon over which various factions are fighting to control  rather than something that plans to go all halskynetultron but there is still a lot of stuff about the entity seeming to have its own motivations for doing things

for that reason i kept expecting the film to reveal that everything that appeared to be the entity acting on its own would actually turn out to be a human villain controlling it say solomon lane somehow maybe part two will reveal that gabriels alliance with it was just based around him reading motivations into its actions and seeing what he wanted to see like tea leaves or tarot cards theres a lot of religious imagery at play with gabriel as the emissary of this 

bond film references

previously most similarities between the mi series and bond films could be dismissed as due to the fact they share the actionspy genre but here the allusions to bond films felt intentional a submarine opening the spy who loved me the orient express from russia with love a car chase in a tiny car for your eyes only

plus mark gatiss showing up in the us security briefing was almost as surprising as hugh dennis turning up randomly in no time to die

mi series references

lots of little callbacks to previous mi films particularly the first one

 the gabriel flashbacks were shot in a way very reminiscent of jon voightjean reno killing the team in prague in the first film
 sleight of hand with the mcguffin
 kittridge on a train near to max or a member of her family while something happens veeerrryyy slooowwwly via a mobile phone noc list transmissioncryptocurrency decryption
 playing with russian subtitles ghost protocol had the bit after the kremlin explosion where the subtitles start off untranslated to represent ethans grogginess here the submarine opening had an overlapping transition to english also vaguely hunt for red octoberesque
 rogue nations car chase had a bit where ethan and benji bump into a surprised luthor and brandt and they acknowledge each other before continuing the chase in this a similar moment happens with ethan and the two agents tracking him

but there were other bits that felt inconsistent with previous films like is this really the first time that a new director of national intelligence would have heard of the imf in previous films loads of people seemed to know about them so i wouldve thought that anyone on their way toward that job would learn about them earlier and i get the idea that imf field agents might be recruited from shadowy pasts but does that really apply to benji who we first met as a computer tech guy behind a desk",2023-07-13

"enjoyed the movie a lot never really watched hayley atwell in anything before   incredible charisma and decent chemistry with cruise the rome car chase was so much fun and the alleyway fight was a technical marvel 

i preferred the tone of fallout more and i do wonder if they intended for fallout to be the actual closing film of the franchise felt like it had more finality to it drp1 was definitely more winking and even slapstick  at one point they are literally threatened by a piano dangling overhead like it was a buster keaton movie not complaining but it was definitely a shift

i do wish they had gotten a more name actor for gabriel as a villain he was basically a total blank",2023-07-14
the most unbelievable part of movie was when ethan and ilsa both said they had never been to venice before,2023-07-14
"was there really a need for multiple angles when hunt was talking to kippling after he had gassed ellaria sand and warlock i counted at least 5 times they changed angles when he was talking

did they nerf the white widow she seems less powerful and intimidating now

also idk why but i enjoyed fallout more than this",2023-07-14
"come to think about it christopher mcquarrie keeps reusing the same villain for every movie in fallout it was literally the same character but for this the entity is essentially the same concept someone who can think of every single outcome and possibility so ethan has to avoid doing the obvious to win 

were starting to see the drawbacks of having the same director make multiple movies in this franchise this is coming from someone who likes the movie btw but its frustrating to see mcquarrie doubling down on the weaker aspects of his films",2023-07-14
it’s a great time and i was shocked at how fast it breezed by but it felt less satisfying than the past couple entries i’ve been turning it over in my head and i think my problem with it is that hunt never has to do anything he thinks is wrong he doesn’t bust the bad guy out of prison or kidnap the prime minister he just chases the key for the entire runtime it might be the least surprising movie in the entire series even if the technical craft was gobsmacking,2023-07-14
" these movies rule this one doesn’t top fallout but it’s still such a blast the handcuff fiat chase is one of the wackiest most busterkeatonass fun car chases ever filmed in fact the whole movie leans cartoony and totally sells it while still being tense my only real gripes are gabriel being way too cartoony of a villain my wife laughed every time he came on screen and ilsa maybe dying to him i’m 95 sure it’s another fakeout to throw the entity a very cool mi threat btw off their plans but as we don’t currently have part two it feels like a very awkward moment

 a sentient ai with the power to reshape the world and manipulate peoples reality

 all the major nations want it but the main character is in the minority of people who hates it and is on a mission to destroy it 

 impressive motorbike jump

 side character in custody in rome

 magic tricks

 woman getting out of handcuffs unexpectedly then handcuffing the man

 old timey train dining car

 the ai literally guides peoples actions in real time through ear pieces and through the voices of other people 

 it arranges elaborate ambushes and setups to trip up the main character 

 the main character is going to have to go down into the ocean to find the thing that will enable them to destroy the ai they hate

then when they are being confronted by gabriel and the white widow when gabriel says either grace or ilsa will die tonight ilsa gives a knowing smile towards ethan i think this moment specifies that they have foreseen this exchange and she knows exactly what to do

i enjoyed it and love the mi movies but have to say that the plot is terrible and that brought down my enjoyment a bit would honestly say it’s my second least favorite above mi2,2023-07-16
"really solid moviebut i simply dont understand how nobody could know about the submarine they said that the bodies with the keys floated to the surface and when the bodies were found the keys were missing did the people who found the bodieskeys attached to the clearly naval commanders not guess that they had come from either a ship or submarine they at the very least had to suspect that they came from nearby and cary elwes character said only he knew but obviously he did not go diving down there alone nor would  the one manually doing the data acquisition he would have a team since he is a senior person in that organization did he  everyone else probably not not to mention that clearly someone in the russian government would have been aware of the technology and the submarine in the first place

very fun but that one detail kind of drives the whole movie of cant  gabriel because hes the only one who knows the key detail and yet it doesnt make sense that he would be the only one to know

lastly i immediately noticed that grace in the mask had a different eye color than the blond bad girl graces are brown white widows are blue like right away how does her number 2 in command not notice this more importantly they obviously used kirby as the actress for both roles because masks like that are not real which means that they chose to change her eye color for each character did they think the audience is too  to realize which one is grace and which isnt and hence change the eye color so we could tell seemed really weird to me from a creative choice",2023-07-16

a cool detail was that his briefing was all analogue at the start of the movie  the cassette photos etc  at the time i thought they were going for a look but by the end of the movie when you realise how pervasive the entity is and how easily corrupted everything can be you understand why ethan is being instructed in that way,2023-07-17

 i like how much this film lets so many characters have their moment to shine

 the entire train sequence start to finish was epic i was fully gripped

 amazing pacing for a 3 hour movie i was never bored

 vanessa kirby so good especially when she had to act a bit disjointed whilst graces character had her mask


the bad 

 a bit weird how much of an afterthought ilsa faust seemed like in this installment after the kickass scenes in the desert i thought shed have more of an impact very clear passing of the torch but done a bit weird

 also onto the same area ilsas death was anticlimatic unlike what youd expect of such a central character

 some of the last minute escapes in the first part of the film were a touch too ridiculous even for a mission impossible film they felt a bit gimmicky


overall i enjoyed it a lot and would recommend anyone to watch it its true what others say that its not as good as fallout but still a very strong proper action film the likes of which are very rare these days",2023-07-17

the movie was great but i do find it funny that the last 2 big spy movies to come out nttd and this movie both had plots similar to mgs games nttd with its nano machine virus similar to foxdie from mgs1 and this movie being about ai controlling information like in mgs2 i guess kojima really was ahead of his time,2023-07-18
"one thing ive found hilarious are there are several comments saying the filmmakers messed up by forgetting that hayley atwell and vanessa kirby have different color eyes

the filmmakers didnt mess up  they would have had to deliberately change kirbys eye color  to match atwells  the fact that youre thinking its actually atwell in that moment and that they forgot to change her eye color to blue only emphasizes how convincing and welldone that scene was  if your criticism is that the imf team forgot to change her eyes their machine broke

also zola only saw her for a second and was more focused on her clothing change before she told him to leave the room and kittredge hadnt seen her since she was a little girl  it wasnt like anyone was staring her straight in the face",2023-07-18

"honestly surprised how much i didn’t care for this and i’ve really enjoyed every other mi movie except for the ending train scenes the stunts and set pieces are great but still feltkinda boring and cliche like another action movie fight scene on top of a train the car chase in italy went on way too long the ai entity villain who knows everything is not really intimidating and kept reminding me of gods eye from fast and furious which made it silly to me and then gabriel just seemed like a regular well dressed dude and not someone the characters should fear and the ciaother agents who literally only show up to move the characters along  and just lazily pop up wherever it’s convenient 

and maybe it’s just me but i can’t stand pick pockets in movies it just seems like silly magic when it just teleports between characters 

something about this just felt off and i was waiting for it to end as it went on a bit long",2023-07-19
ok on second viewing that death is absolutely a fake out the massive parallel with mi1 plus it being foreshadowed in the prologue desert sequence and luthers strange behavior in the second half of the movie  100 a fakeout not sure whether ethan knows or whether the team orchestrated it without his knowledge foreshadowed by ethan being out of the loop in the airport sequence,2023-07-19
" train scene  cliff jump
 the dialogues between people in the agency were sooooo heavy with stiff delivery and too much of theatricality 
 smashing a small womans head on the wall of bricks will take her out only for 5 seconds apparently need to do it two times more also  holding a metal pipe doubles the amount to danger you pose to the main character doesnt matter that in a narrow alley you dont even have space to properly swing it
 why does she need to put in her iban if they are transferring crypto to her did they need to decrypt the blockchain for that all around this plot device looked like it was made by a boomer not understanding crypto
 going a bit too  slight of hand tricks people pickpocketing and putpocketing each other like crazy started to feel like any minute i will see that cringe cgi scene from now you see me 2
 did ving rhames just checked out himself from the series i have to go to a very desolate place to work on eliminating entity from the hard drive come on you just need to air gap an old still mint laptop another example of plot construct that is aimed at boomers misunderstanding technology

in the end really enjoyed it  those 25 hours zoomed past and i felt physically tired from all this action",2023-07-19
"i really wanted to like this movie but i truly think i’m just bored of the blockbuster even the stunts admittedly really cool i just didn’t find all that interesting i honestly wished it leaned into the corniness more give me more james bond type stuff more completely specialized gadgets let the actors ham it up 

my favorite part was definitely the beginning sequence with the masks tom cruise swapping faces twice in a row was pretty comedic and clever 

the submarine sequence at the beginning was also cool as  i was locked in up until the torpedo hit their own sub the scare of the “other” sub was incredibly effective 

another thing is i’m definitely not a mission impossible follower i’ll see them but i don’t remember much of them so everything i say can be taken with a total grain of salt 

overall it just wasn’t my type of movie but i can recognize that it’s very effective at what it was i can admit that i’m not the intended audience for it i gave it a 35 but i imagine most people enjoyed it much more than i did",2023-07-20

one was green and one was blue

in all the photos i see online his eyes are both blue",2023-07-24

i liked this movie i definitely think it’s a strong addition to the series even if it’s not the best by any stretch the cinematography and editing bothered me a lot though obviously a lot of people have noticed all the dutch tilts but i’ve not seen anyone talk about the disregard for the 180 rule there’s a scene with luther talking to grace where they must break it several times in succession for no obvious reason and it happens again at the party when they’re all sat around the table i get that there’s always creative use for these things but as much as i love the franchise this one felt the weakest in its editing and cinematography when it had to slow down and allow characters to talk to each other in the same room also justice for ilsa c’mon man,2023-07-30

"is it just me or did this movie not have any impossible scenes in it by that i mean things that were next to impossible for ethan and his team to accomplish such as inthe first movie where hunt lowers himself head first or in another movie getting something that was underwater

"can someone explain to me grace’s motivation in venice between the party scene and the fights on the bridge


i feel like her motives are fairly clear before that point and clear after that point but in between i was very confused


so she is a thief she steals something valuable and will hold onto it until she gets paid that makes sense then at the party the white widow reveals she hired her to steal the halfkey shouldn’t she try to get paid there and then

then at the vip lounge a lot gets explained it’s a bit of an info overload but the outcome at the end is the widow became even more desperate to get her hands on the completed key well then this should be the moment for grace to get paid to deliver the halfkey


but no she helps ethan get the key away from the wdiow’s men at this point i thought she saw the importance of the key and knows ethan having it is what’s best for “the greater good” as it were


but no she again deliberately gets away from ethan with the key so motivationwise the only thing that makes sense would be she wants to sell it to someone else probably gabriel who also needs it


but no as soon as she saw gabriel on the bridge the knives come out and she tried to shank him


so what the  is she even trying to accomplish in this part of the story",2023-08-21
"ok late to the film but just watched it have to say disappointed it wasnt terrible but it was incredibly mediocre especially after fallout

the stunts were pretty average most of the motorbike scene jumping off the cliff looked mostly cgi which is weird because ive seen the videos and it wasnt i get they had to cgi in the floor because there was ramps but why did it all look green screen the fight scene in that narrow alleyway was shot badly the chase scene was good but again not as good as the chase scene in fallout

the pickpocket character was just annoying considering her line of work i expected a better skillset from her but she was quite bad at almost everything else ethan chasing her became really tiresome and i was sick of it by the third time

ilsa was such an interesting character im quite unhappy that she was killed she was probably one of the better additions to the cast since mi3 gabriel is such a zzzzz villain

now my main gripe this ai other movies have gone this route and did it a lot better eagle eye being one of them if these ais are capable of doing terrible things then the ai in this movie is pretty tame it also doesnt come across as very smart however the most annoying thing is ethan and co know what this ai is capable of but continue to use tech and communication methods that can easily be tapped by this ai the last thing id be doing is using tech knowing that this machine is capable of listening in or sabotaging missions",2023-09-18

and the ai as an antagonist doesnt work well and neither does the entire hacking everything plot especially if you know a little bit about how hacking works   
some dialogue was really predictable   
   
maybe my expectations were too high considering i believe mi fallout to be one of the best action movies of all time",2023-07-13
"it was boring and it shouldnt be a two parts movie most mission impossible movies you know theyre gonna win the fun part is seeing what kind of crazy  the team is gonna have to pull to reach their objective here its kinda telegraphed because its so long almost 3 hours while only being a part one many scenes are artificially extended by having big pauses in the dialogue or the action to put an emphasis on how serious the situation is sure there are some funny moments but theyre rare in a very long movie and they feel really artificial im saying all that while i really liked the previous movies and i was hoping it would be close in quality


the plot is kinda terminator  replace the entity by skynet and gabriel by a terminator and youve got the plot of most terminator movies time travel aside and surfing on the aivirus trend seems kinda cheap the first action sequence in the desert feels way too much like watching a guy play a videogame and while i love videogames i dont think that look suits mission impossible

its too clean  the bad guy looks like a model walking into a photoshoot most scenes have people with impeccable makeupclothes while doing impressively athletic sequences theres even a point where grace is ducking in a coal container in a tunnel with the fumes and everything and next scene she has no coal residue anywhere on her its nothing major but it takes you away from the movie everything looks too polished and artificial

the movie being so long and artificially so everything is kinda predictable starting with atwells role tailor made to replace fergusons faust its a two parter so you know they have to get the key somehow paris what kind of a  name that is not dying and revealing the sebastopol is telegraphed and way too convenient

after two very good movies it felt like a lazy and calibrated one the direction choices are also questionnable especially during the car chase  pointing the camera at the driver most of the time didnt really make it impressive or interesting the train stunts at the end are either unbelievable the parachute landing at the right moment is ridiculous the whole fight in a tunnel while hanging from the roof is way too silly also or too long jumping 3 or 4 wagons with grease oil and everything

i was hoping for a repeat of the previous ones in terms of performances and action but i was really disapointed the movie is weak and could have been so much stronger if it was one big 3 hours movie but with the whole story inside discarding the fluff",2023-07-14

"sweet jesus tom does it again as expected i guess at this point the film was great maybe not quite on the level of fallout but its up there the plot runs at a breakneck pace its wall to wall awesome but the action isnt nauseating the characters are all given lots to do and im glad i rewatched mi fallout in 3d unlike this one unfortunately last night because of the connection to the previous film via the broker character played by vanessa kirby

i noticed more moments of subtle comedy in this one i feel like the writers had fun with it  its got all the classic lines but there are some fun mixups and visual gags for those who pay extra attention

also it has the best surround sound ive heard in the theater since avatar 2 it can go very loud at times but the mix is super dynamic there were moments that were so quiet you could hear a pin drop in the theater theres a sequence in a sandstorm that sounds so effective if my eyes were closed itd be practically indistinguishable haha and goes without saying that the soundtrack was on point

excited to be back in the imax well a different theater to get 70mm next week for oppenheimer",2023-07-12
"hey guys for me it seems like ive seen a whole different movie than you obviously mi dead reckoning part 1 is rated highly and while i understand that as a standalone action movie it is very well executed and solid it is imho very disappoint as a part of the mission impossible franchise i just want to share my 2 cents on it

for me it was a 510 at most and i live and breathe the mi franchise over everything else like star wars lotr potter whatever i also love and admire tom cruise for his incredible work i am a male in my thirties and have seen every mi movie on the big screen as it came out except for the first one in the nineties

but for me this new installment in the franchise just falls flat let me explain why

first off it is far too comical there were always small jokes or light moments during the franchise but the whole beginning part of this movie felt more like a marvel love and thunder dumbness the car chasing scene in the first half was incredibly hard to watch complete opposite from the one in fallout in paris for example how many times will you recycle the woman cant drive joke the movie theater laughing for 10 minutes straight is not what i expect when going to a mifilm at all this already has wrecked me completely to the point i almost started crying to what they had done to this part of my favorite franchise

not dark enough goes along with my first point there is no feel of real danger or menace like in mi 3 or fallout for example ethan was always ahead of the situation or everything turned out great after every scene the scene from fallout with the heist on solomon lanes truck to catch him right in front of the police eyes planned and done perfectly

the only dark moment was when gabriel kills ilsa but again that happened just for the plots sake to tear off some emotion from the audience of course it was ilsa to die we wouldnt care at all if it would have been grace instead

this theme gets even worse with the main villain gabriel was a wet towel compared to owen davian or solomon lane esai morales played well dont get me wrong just the character itself was very shallow those guys were a real threat for ethan and the imf as a whole in contrast to that ethan plays with gabriel the whole movie and defeats him twice in part 1 already one by having the opportunity to  him easily if not for gabriels plot armor the other by stealing the key in the end where is the tension going into part 2 if the main villain is no threat and just a joke to be played with

the whole ai thing is also very hard to grasp i get it why theyve chosen it to give the story a 70s vibe with the analog technique to be used as a nod to the original mi series but ai going rogue and people trying to abuse it for power feels so  dry and seen millions of times already

there is no real mission impossible moment that one is the biggest one for me i suppose like no moment in the movie lets you sit on the edge of your seat watching ethan do a crazy stunt or activity for minutes no tension every movie had that kind of momentmi server room scenemi2 entry into biocyte tower exchange of chimera and bellerophonmi3 ethan interrogation with davian and death after electrocution resurrectionmi4 burj kalifa climbmi5 underwater server roommi6 halo jump solomon rescuemi7 tried this with the bike jump but it was already dead on arrival seen it so often on instagram trailer general movie pr also it was over like in seconds and while i can imagine how hard this stunt was to pull of just watching it felt meh whatever

you didnt even see him flying towards the train and aiming at it that would have provided some tension at least also the cgi of the rocks which meant to hide the ramp was done incredibly poorly

also the opening of the movie with the submarine stuff felt more like a james bond instead of mi in every film of the franchise the opening would include ethan and his team doing things to kick off the plot the screen time of luther and benji felt too short i especially love luthers character

easter eggs or recalls plot repeats

so many especially to mi 2

 gabriel shouts ethan at the end like sean shouts hunt when sean finds out he replaced his right hand billy and got him killed
 the parachute is only for one thing is straight up repeated form the same plot line in the end of mi 2 biocyte tower where he leaves nyah with sean and escapes by himself with his parachute
 whole train sequence felt like already seen because we actually did see it exactly like that in mi
 mention of a collier of bulgary if i recall correctly like the one nyah tries to steal in seville in mi 2
 the whole mountain drive up scene was a homage to fallout where benji guides ethan through londons roofs and misses to activate the 3dview so he does not know ethan has to jump down to get on a lower level to pursue lark here while you wait for benji to say the same he actually was aware of the height difference and guided ethan straight towards it
 sloan picture in the government room in the beginning
 youve never seen me upsetreference between kittridge and ethan
 mask machine breaks already seen in ghost protocol
 they were many more but ive forgotten some after sleeping the night after witching it yesterday

there are many logic errors or plot holes for me but maybe i got them wrong so please feel welcome to educate me

 ai whole plan goes shambles just if ethan wont  gabriel in mi1 he had a whole campaign running for not killing or harming anyone even in this film he saved paris and did not  her was it really so unlikely for ethan not to  someone doesnt make sense the ai sees millions of different outcomes like dr strange in infinity war but this one crucial point to not  gabriel would save the day

very sloppy writing and a complete nonsensical decision to  off ilsa im sure rebecca ferguson is busy and cant commit to the role but they had their out when they faked her death at the start of the movie she had no business returning again when they were in rome and felt like a background character they didnt even use her death properly by having it fuel ethan because he already had someone he cared about that gabriel killed so they just added to that for no reason 

great action sequences specifically the train scene but this movie left me disappointed and a bit  off hopefully they correct it in the second part",2023-07-14

"overall i thought it was okay but was pretty disappointed just typing out some random thoughts

i thought everything before the mission impossible tittle sequence was pretty terrible i was getting seriously worried the submarine scene was a meh opening and not super exciting the scene with all the intelligence guys was terrible literally one of the worst scenes i’ve seen in a while the dialogue was so boring and stilted and awkwardly sparsed out between the characters like does mcquarie think exposition is less boring if it’s said one line at a time by multiple characters it was so strange then the desert shoot out scene didn’t work either the pacing just felt so rushed and off 

i was also pretty shocked at the villain and how he was barely explained at all this backstory between gabriel and ethan was so rushed and glossed over gabriel’s motivations are also not explored at all the performance was fine but it’s such a thin character 

i hate the change they made to the imf lore it’s such a retcon all imf agents are criminals what this doesn’t make any sense at all does benji in mi3 feel like an ex criminal do any of these characters 

the bike going off a cliff stunt was so short and honestly not that great i thought there was going to be more with tim flying down towards the train once he jumped there were only a few brief shots of him falling i also hate how cgi the rock ramp looked i have this complaint with a lot of mcquarries films they do these practical stunts then touch it up with bad cgi examples include the bike jump halo jump car chases with cgi cars 

ilsas death was pretty anticlimactic and i felt nothing that whole sequence was a huge miss 

just in general the plot is convoluted and not super interesting 

i loved the train sequence and the car chase those were awesome",2023-07-15
"sht was weak and im a huge tom fan the bike jump from the trailer lasted all of 2 seconds i thought we gonna get to see how tom actually lands on a moving train nope heres a looney tunes entrance for you and honestly if the car chase wasnt funny this would have been a super generic action movie the train bit saved it towards the end but not by much

ilsa got done dirty ethan didnt even blink an eye cozying up to grace 

i hope theyre saving the good stuff for part 2 and thats why part 1 is so tame",2023-07-17
" this movie was so bad

it was interesting watching this movie and seeing after the fact pom who used to play mantis and isnt easily noticed she had so much fun in this role messing around the one frustrating part is theres so much loud music and sound effects you couldnt hear her saying anything or screaming excitement

this movie was disappointing as  unfortunately it felt like there were no stakes to it all and some of the common motifs and behaviors of hunt are extremely annoying to continue to see used over and over they spent so much money and time talking about and hyping up the jump on the train stunt that some of the scenes on the train looked really bad as a result of imax and some of their filming issues due to logistics",2023-07-16

i liked how grace was a competent fairly highlevel criminal who nonetheless ended up extremely out of her depth  into a world on a level way above “high” in a heist movie she would have been the master thief but she ended up in a deadlyserious competition between nationstates she lived a life of racketeering and stealing money and such not battling it out with intelligence agencies and trying to save the world so it was fun to see her have to adjust and learn to grow into the job,2023-07-16
disappointing movie after seeing all the high critic scores beforehand the back and forth key pickpocketing got old very fast and hayley atwell has to be the worst character in the franchise whole movie is ethan chasing after her how on earth did she not realize that she was in way over her head comes off as so dumb entity wasn’t very threatening didn’t really have that big scene showing how big of a threat it was villain was weird again didn’t have that one scene showing how dangerous he was i don’t believe rebecca ferguson is dead either will come back in part 2,2023-07-17

also  was that bridge fight grace isnt a fighter ilsa is how the  did ilsa lose when she had a superior weapon over a thief with no fight training as shown multiple times in the movie before and after the bridge fight where she magically downloaded 15 minute fighting skills 

love hayley atwell grace had funny and heartfelt moments but overall her character really  me off",2023-07-20
as a massive fan of this series i was disappointed i almost feel like it’s my least favorite of them all i know it’ll be the unpopular opinion here this movie started to lose me at the goofy car chase with the fiat the cgi was wonky at the end of it and mcquarrie did the same thing with the rogue nation chase and that cgi always irked me too his use of cgi sticks out like a sore thumb the pacing dragged in the middle it’s like the praising of this movie came from people who have never watched a mission impossible before the train crash sequence is legitimately great though maybe i have to watch it again idk,2023-07-15
"this was one of the most disappointing movie experiences of my life   

what a bloated incomplete mess

there are a couple of spectacular scenes the airport the rome car chase mixed in with endless exposition   the imf team now consists of ethan hunt and two guys with the exact same useless skill set  im not sure if its tom cruises ego but the movie kills off the only other competent agent in the group making sure that every single physical conflictaction is entirely focused on cruise  

two hours and 43 minutes to get absolutely no where   the movie starts with looking for a key and the next movie is going to be looking for a keyhole  thats it   


the really disappointing thing is how many people are lying about this film   i saw multiple people claim that it had a clear resolution much more satisfying than across the spiderverse  what a load of    this isnt another maverick  its just a vanity project that has gotten way out of hand",2023-07-18

it’s wild exposition and over doing it is always talked about when a movie has to much and i watched tenet and didn’t notice it this movie was  first hour is sub so cool when it gets hit car chase venice second hour is all exposition third is train it just felt like they wouldn’t shut up and a dialogue heavy film is good when the dialogue is good all of it was  on earth corny fast and furious garbage 

second please stop putting the tom cruise run in every scene it’s iconic but he looks goofy just breathe it’s taking me out of the movie 

the characters were fine grace was going to be the best then she just was the same old same old yes it is your fault she’s dead why does nobody care luther’s entire premise just no benji was fun 

the action i saw people raving about the car chase scene and from the trailer it looked pretty much the same chase we see in every action movie but i was watching in imax and held my hopes up nah i’m not saying it’s bad quite the opposite it’s just a car chase scene nothing really special it was enjoyable though for sure 

now the second half of the train sequence sheesh that was cool uncharted esque heavy besides for the first time ever my theatre having a glitch and it blacking out for 30 seconds whilst we only hear audio was a bummer and lights stayed on for rest of movie it was still the best part the moment hunt and gabrielle are fighting on top of the train it gets good and fun before that a lot of decisions were questionable like  grace he’s ok get the keyyyy 

it’s a good movie i guess i don’t think it was worth the imax ticket and the drink i never purchase but decided to splurge never again costing 30 bucks it’s all and all super forgettable for me and i love action movies i gave extraction 2 a 4 and a half for  sake but this movie is just average 

this was my first mission impossible movie ever and it’ll probably be my last",2023-07-16
"dialogue was meek 

another scene on top of a moving train  

how many movies have had a train roof scene 20

another tiny car chase like bourne and the italian job

another venice location where they even there prove they shot all those alleyway scenes in the dark in venice 

week locations  most likely due to covid but it felt like a covid movies at times 



the big jump stunt was better from bts and too much cgi 

he spent half the movie chasing grace 

moved way too slow in parts felt drawn out got me thinking they stretched a boring script into two movies this way 

so now everyone has ai as the big bad guy

nothing original at all about this installment 

severe disappointment",2023-07-18
"ilsa’s death assuming it’s not a misdirect really fell flat  like after they spent two movies really building her up her death felt so random  and then it was just on to the next one for ethan  really big misstep there imo if she’s really gone

that aside the rest of the film was very good  pom klementieff was a particular delight and i like the duel threat of gabrielthe entity",2023-07-12
despite some epic action pieces i found the movie to be really bad the dialogue is ridiculous they continue to repeat plot points in case people dont get that theres a super smart rogue ai also the movitations for the villain and the ai are absurd and contrived  super intelligent general ai wouldnt give two shots about putting someones nemesis against them i really wish there was good writing and a good plot to back up the awesome action,2023-07-12
soooo many times in the film where someone has a gun and they just stand there and dont use it the big one being at the end the guy is pointing his gun at hayley atwell who is running away with the key in the train the guy just shoots the trains ceiling and she stops and puts her hands up uhhh why not just shoot her instead of the ceiling ,2023-07-13
"weird film the big action sequences at the end were great but the plot was odd  at the start were shown that the keys are for the thing on the submarine 

and then the whole movie is tom cruise running around going what are the keys for and then at the end its revealed that theyre for the submarine as if its some massive cliffhanger reveal 

yeah we know that 

the whole whats the device do worked well in mi3 because they never explained it yet seymourhoffman was so terrifying that you bought into whatever it might be gabriel didnt have the same impact he was like a bond villain you forgot about

anytime anyone discussed the entity is just felt a bit silly like a  90s abc spy drama and setting up numerous women to be killed to motivate ethan hunt was a bit pony there was a great stuff in there and atwell shone but the story wasnt great",2023-07-13
someone already mentioned this but i really think it needs another  you’re aiming a gun at someone and then you tell your homie standing right in front of you to pull out his gun and shoot her why do you want to save your bullets are your bullets more important than his and then a super slow mo gun raise until tom mr magoos in,2023-07-13
what i found the most surprising amidst all the chaos and action is the undercurrent of hilarity flowing throughout the movie like the cia guys got so cynical about the mask thing they started pulling the skin off peoples face or hayley atwell repeatedly finding herself in the drivers seat this kind of playfulness was missing from indiana jones the dial of destiny,2023-07-15
"wow — after the highs or rogue nation and fallout this fell completely flat for me 
seriously i don’t get the love half the movie is an exposition dump with characters either explaining stuff that’s happened off screen or taking on third person narrator qualities to explain the stakes

where’s the amazing set pieces and intrigue the waffle about the entity took eternity and i really don’t like the whole “charming thief” trope where she constantly double crosses him and gets into trouble immediately after

the way ilsa was dispatched i felt the most as she had a great arc coming into this that is undone completely

also the whole ai thing done in a fast  furious gets slated whereas here it’s as laughable and is somehow lauded

honestly not trolling and glad people liked it but my take is soooooooo drastically different it’s funny lol",2023-07-15

"i liked this movie less and less as it went on but the train finale was cool i guess it was definitely fun but i think this one did a disservice to most of its female characters in a very regressive way 

mostly just annoyed and eyerolled at everything gabriel said he spoke in so many platitudes and then him managing to dispatch ilsa so easily felt like a huge disservice to her character he’s no henry cavill as villain i can tell you that much 

i dunno it’s fun enough but i’m firmly in the camp that this was a significant step down from the three that came before it especially fallout",2023-07-22
"i really dont get the rave reviews behind this film i spend 2 hours watch tom cruise running to where the action was happening without him

from a story point most of the scenes didnt even move the story forward they got the key and got the name of the sub but narratively little else progressed

the whole of the rome part could be taken out and nothing has changed with the story the whole swapping cars did nothing other than some slap stick comedy

rebeccas false death just to die again wasnt even as emotionally punching as it should have been for the effort

its was just greedy ways to turn one film into two",2023-08-05
"i generally disliked the movie it had moments and parts that were great but as a whole it feels like it was too convoluted to be enjoyable i know a convoluted plot is kind of the point but this one just wasnt vibing with me

hayley atwell is delightful but it was hard to enjoy her inclusion when they build her up to being ethans new girl especially when they decided to  ilsa in the process with the cliche you have to choose ethan only to not have the choice be up to him at all anyway

gabriel came from no where and i dont feel that they did a good job explaining why we should hate  him i suppose theyll explain more in the second one but i feel like structurally it would have been better if theyd built him up better in this movie considering were spending 2 hours and 40ish minutes with him and likley another 2 hours with him in the next movie

how long can a coal train run without someone shoveling coal into the train it seems like killing the engineers to shovel the coal would make the train stop eventually",2023-07-14
"i gotta be honest i didnt love this film i kind of disliked it even and am pretty baffled by the glowing reviews from critics and audience alike 

i dont think it doesnt have redeeming factors set pieces were beautiful the cinematography in particular was well done the train sequence was really well done there were several very funny moments hayley atwell was great the opening submarine sequence was enthralling and had me pumped for the rest of the movie that clearly had a timely and exciting premise

all that said i thought the script was kind of a mess the sort of romance between ethan and grace felt extremely forced in spite of what i thought was good chemistry at one point he asks her to trust him with her life and why should she she barely knew him which she says at one point in the film and had up until that point sabotaged him by trying to take the key and honestly how many times did tom say some variation of you have to do exactly as i say and you have to trust me i understand that some of these scenes are meant to paint tom as a positive force but when he tells haley that  always put her life over his i couldnt help but ask why

there was just a lot of info dumps and exposition im a writer myself so im admittedly hyper sensitive to this sort of thing but even so it felt like a lot of the time the audience was simply told this is important so pay attention to give an example to that accusation the power the ai had was very clear because we see several examples of that throughout the film however why theres an upcoming war is just thrown around several times but never explained

there were so many interested parties and characters who each individually were phenomenal in their roles their individual motivations became convoluted until blurring into a tom cruise vs the world scenario which made me wish the cast was smaller 

there original woman had a fake out death only to be actually killed in the next sequence which rendered the whole desert sequence completely moot 

i think overall what disappointed me was that they genuinely had a really cool premise and the film treated as an excuse to have action sequences i recognize its an action movie not a contemplative drama and its not meant to make you ask big questions but i do wish we could have had a little more background to each of the players and what they wanted to do with the ai the detectives or whatever in particular i thought needed some more fleshing out the katana lady who was tremendously terrifying felt like she had a lot more of exploration warranted too why was she helping the guy who pretty expressly just wanted to destroy the world i completely missed who the white widow was or why she was involved that ones probably on me given how big a role she played but given that i had similar questions about the majority of the cast and the plot itself im guessing the answer like the film would leave me wanting a bit more",2023-07-14

"i will be in the minority here but i absolutely despised hayley atwel in this movie she was just way terribly integrated into the movie the world is at stake here with ai that can establish global dominance and a pickpocketerthief is annoying us all from getting to that key i know she was sent to get that key for white widow but compared to other characters motivations it feels really infuriating with ilsa faust you know she is trained super spy with her own mission from mi6not the movie thats why her double crossings have that weight behind them you understand it pretty well by the end just having this character be in our faces going toetotoe with ethan and outsmarting him feels so unearned like they are shoving this character in our faces the fact that she was saved and ilsa wasnt just adds to my frustrations especially her acting was just so eyewinky like she knows shes in a movie just horrendously out of place tom cruises ever so serious characterization just adds to ridiculous heightened nature of the stunts 

i find this really annoying about the mission impossible franchise with each installment they feel the need to add a new female costar to replace the former like we would get bored of watching one women in colead role it started with the previous one vanessa kirby inplace of rebecca ferguson and they nerfed ilsa down saying shes in love with ethan and also having michelle monaghan back sort of having a love triangle in this one having hayley atwel while sidelining ilsa and white widow is so annoying",2023-07-16

"solid action flick nothing out of the norm here or anything that made me go wow considering theyve been shoving the climatic motorcycle jump down our throats for a couple of years a good story that was actually paced well for being almost 3 hours long 

looking forward to part 2",2023-07-12
"these movies are so dang consistent and just plain fun no wonder it’s my favorite franchise my theater played a short behind the scenes before the show explaining the difficulties of executing the rome car chase which made it all the more enjoyable probably my favorite sequence in the movie 

i kept waiting for the motorcycle jump and was thrilled when i realized it was how he was going to board the train so cool

curious if ilsa is truly dead i think she is but i hope she isn’t because i love her character 

so much exposition was dumped in this movie that i really felt like a part 1 was necessary for the story while it was still a great movie in its own right can’t wait for part 2",2023-07-12

"i like it but not as much as fallout

fallout had style and its well paced throughout the film

while in dead reckoning imo i often felt like it drags in a few scenes like the fiat car chase for example i felt like it went on for a bit too long

and the early meeting about the ai bit is just exposition dump with plenty of buzzwords that i couldnt help but be tapped out from the whole scene maybe its just me but it just made me lose interest

imo gabriel also felt a bit flat but i think its because he doesnt really have as much screentime as a main antagonist should have so i didnt really garner any interest to him and his purpose hes shown as just a puppet for the big bad and im not really into it

overall for me its a strong 7light 8 maybe id like it more after repeat viewing but its just not for me right now id rather watch fallout multiple times than this",2023-07-12
"are all the other mission impossible movies this good 

glad they kept pom’s character alive she stole the show for me just the perfect agent of chaos

really enjoyed the movie and thought it was amazing but fallout i think is still better ilsas death seemed off and i didnt like it how come they made such a big deal about ethan trying to get on the train hes done crazier things than trying to get on a moving train lol,2023-07-12

no complaints about cruise and the visuals were jawdropping on imax especially venice

the motorcycle stunt was weirdly underwhelming but the trainbridge sequence made up for it i dont know if they were going for comedy but we were in stitches

that said i dont know if this movie will age very well it very much came across as a collection of stunt sequences more than the other movies

the exposition was weird too there was a lot of

character a  exposition

character b so what youre saying is exposition

like really beating us over the head with it sort of treating us like were dumb in places then at the same time they drop in this weirdly complicated bit in the airport i doubt there are many people that could explain what happened with the three  keys on only one viewing

youll find that the details just get in the way is an apt tagline for this one still lots of fun awesome stunts great visuals",2023-07-12
"story was really lazy this time now story is not the dealbreaker in these movies but a good one provides better context and impetus to have our cohorts travel around the globe its mostly why i liked rogue nation best

they didnt even try to hide it literally no one but 2 or 3 people even knew what the key did so its a real inuniversemacguffin   if i know but its important i guess

another thing like what other people have pointed out is gabriel is in a weird place in the movie  ethan seems to have strong feelings towards this guy but they dont seem to have this rival chemistry when theyre on screen together  even henry cavill did better as the antagonist goon  actually fallout also did better with the throwback villain solomon lane

hayley atwell is a cutie but her thief escape antics kinda got old after the fourth time

whatever guess ill just see how the second part concludes",2023-07-12

" what a wild ride i was on the edge of my seat the entire time idk even after predicting the plot to some extent it was anxietyinducing like a 70s spythriller
 i really liked that ai isnt the villain the people who tried to gain control are the entity is just defending itself
 the opening titles were wild with that glitchy effect
 tomhayleys chemistry is so good on screen
 it could be just me but i think this movie didnt look like it was meant for imax format compared to older movies for some reason but thats ok the action and cinematography were great
 the bike jump sequence was just meh the pr team overhyped it
 the train sequence was topnotch
 i really liked paris pom klementieffand i hope she joins imf for the next round
 the soundtrack was godlike
 the whole airport cat and mouse game was very nicely done
 i have mixed feelings about ilsas death i think either she is the mastermind behind all this and comes back from the dead in the next part or she is done with the franchise 

i wouldnt say it was mcquarries weakest entry i liked it better than rogue nation since its part one i understand that it is not supposed to be actionoriented like fallout",2023-07-12
i am in a strange spot where i found this movie great and enjoyed it all the way but also feel a bit silly for expecting them to somehow top fallout this doesnt miss a beat at all i just think it doesnt reach the same highs the set pieces arent quite so awesome the fight scenes arent quite so well choreographed the villain isnt as fun as walker hayley atwell is a great addition and i was surprised with how well she does with so much screentime it feels like her movie as much as it is tom cruises but it feels a bit stale or forced to bring in a new female lead when there already is such a well established one from the past two movies i would rather have ilsa be sidelined for a movie rather than just straight up replaced by someone slightly different,2023-07-12
"saw it a few days ago thought it was about as good as fallout and better than ghost protocol but rogue nation is still the best film in the franchise some of the early exposition was very clumsy and later scenes suffered from poor pacing  particularly when ethan was trying to catch up to the train which is probably because it featured so prominently in the marketing campaign and speaking of the marketing i felt that they gave away too much in the trailers not in terms of the plot but there were no surprises in the action sequences it was hard to be impressed by their dedication to doing everything through practical effects when you already knew what was coming

still im interested to see where part two goes i even have a theory i dont think the entity is a threat everything that it did in the film it did to protect itself it even tried to get the key through negotiation before resorting to violence and it didnt tell gabriel what the key unlocked he had to learn that from denlinger so i think the next film is going to end with ethan killing gabriel and taking his place as an agent of the entity because the entity just wants to survive grace would take over as the leader of the imf team in any future film",2023-07-12

"love this movie absolutely loved it but the coverage in that one scene of ving and cruise was bizarre  crossed eye lines and shot reverse to them on the same side of the frame mixed with line jumping etc felt out of place in an otherwise technically immaculate movie also is it just me or do we never see ving rhames walking in any shot of this movie he’s always seated or in closeup 

loved the fact too that this film ends with our heroes actually ahead of the bad guys going into part 2  that was refreshing for a change definitely will miss ferguson though i understand why and don’t agree at all that she was “fridged” in a traditional sense as she had her own agency throughout and the series needed to introduce more of a high stakes environment but man they did her dirty",2023-07-12
this probably would be my favorite in the series if it wasn’t for ilsa’s death i’m still not entirely convinced she’s dead i wonder if she was filming dune at the same time because i really felt like ilsa could carry the series if tom were to ever retire,2023-07-12
"grievances

1 they did ilsa dirty unless they somehow bring her back in part 2 that was a super disappointing anticlimactic way to go atwell ruled but i liked her less after that because it felt like a ferguson replacement i get that her death was supposed to give ethan the internal conflict to  gabriel or not but dumb

2 gabriel sucks mustache twirling charmless void of a villain speaking pseudo intellectual techno babble why is he so evil he partnes with the ai didnt care for the random flashes to him killing someone in ethans life with no explanation what a massive drop off from solomon lane and cavill

3 the ai entity is silly the riddle bomb made me cringe

4 way too many characters whats the point of shea wiggums black sidekick or the pom klementief villain

5 hate how they sidelined luther the entire final act for no reason to go investigate if the ai infiltrated his hard drive did ving have a scheduling conflict with the shoot

6 the early scene with the intelligence leaders explaining the ai was so stilted and silly like the definition of a bad exposition dump then they all get gassed and just wake up later and move on with their lives cary elwes was awful  
  
loved everything else about it  
stunts ruled  
the desert and abu dhabi airport scene ripped  
rome was awesome  
train was a great callback to the original with a badass end setpiece  
white widow is just an awesome character  
stood up and cheered a couple times during some of the setpieces  

enjoyed it overall but i really hope they didnt write ilsa out like that and wish we werent wasting the final 2 films on ai and gabriel nonsense",2023-07-12
"the white widow’s henchman needs to be fired  his boss has the brightest blue eyes of anyone i ever seen there’s suspicious noises in her room and then she comes out with light brown eyes and very odd behavior and he doesn’t notice a thing  

unbelievably awesome movie  rip ilsa i’m personally hoping your death was a fake out though",2023-07-12
"lets get the important thing out of the way first because while i really liked the movie most of what im gonna do is complain the action is almost all great and the set pieces are all great highlights being the fiat chase and the train the series still hasnt had a part that tops dubai from ghost protocol but this is maybe the most action packed of them all

writing was kinda weak even for a mission impossible movie you could really feel how the script was made just to tie ideas for set pieces together dialogue felt a little too meta on the nose and just unserious kinda felt like the last two fast and furious movies but not as campy and fun

the villain was mediocre and under developed which i guess should be expected in this series but it felt out of place because ethan has a history with him that doesnt get expanded at all

in fact the complete lack of development and expansion for ethans character and his past just feels so out of place the movies 25 hours long and about some guy from his past which we infer is murkier than we were aware but all we get to develop these things are a couple super short flashbacks without any contextualization and some lines about how people get a choice between imf or being hunted

bummed they killed ilsa off since these movies are short on memorable recurring characters and she was a good one wish they gave her a more emotional part with ethan before killing her off wouldve made the scene hit harder maybe couldve used a scene between them to actually elaborated on who the  gabriel even is also the only action i didnt like was her final fight the choreography didnt make sense for what the fight was she has a sword and gabriel has a knife and shes grappling him instead of keeping distance

7 or 810 lots of great set pieces and moments so it doesnt break the great streak theyve had going since ghost protocol but its probably the weakest of the last 4",2023-07-12

i will jump from the ground floor if ilsa doesnt come back,2023-07-12
"i think my favourite recurring bit in the franchise is ethan not being down for any of the big stunt shenanigans when benji tells him he needs to parachute onto the train and ethan is straight up “that is a terrible idea”

tom cruise can show off all he likes and he knows that’s one of the reasons we keep turning up but it’s a nice change of pace from the “i know i can do anything” heroes",2023-07-12
"ilsa feels so out of place in this film does she even say a single line of dialog i really think it was a bad move trying to fool the audience into thinking she was killed at the start only to then really  her later even though it was pretty obvious she wasnt dead at the start you still expect the audience to be shocked in that moment so youve exhausted that emotion from the audience prematurely which leaves the audience numb when she really dies later causing it fall flat

  
also her death felt very obvious it was done to replace her with grace which also felt really forced the whole choose the woman you love or this woman you just met who has tried to get you killed on 2 accounts already made that really clear  i love hayley and toms chemistry way more than rebecca and toms so im a bit more forgiving of this  


  
other than that i really loved this film not sure id say its the best yet that will really come down to how part 2 does",2023-07-12

at the end when paris is holding both ethan and grace train is about to fall andcut they are out",2023-07-12
"unintentionally funny moment when ilsa dies and grace appears over ethan’s shoulder as if to tell us very deliberately that this series will have one hot british woman at a time

overall enjoyed it a lot not as good as fallout and i’d have to rewatch rogue nation but my suspicion is this one falls just shy of rn personally i love ilsa and was frustrated to see her used minimally and then killed but man alive that hayley atwell was a great addition incredibly charming smart but vulnerable and great comedic instincts during the car chase

biggest weak point for me was the villain didn’t think he was well fleshed out but also just didn’t buy the performance that role should’ve been played by somebody with true movie star wattage like javier bardem also was really taken out of the movie when vanessa kirby’s brother didn’t notice her eyes had changed color the character has eyes like a siberian husky and then suddenly they’re brown and he doesn’t notice when looking at her face from six inches away huh

great action though loved the paris character and hope she’s back the alleyway fight was fantastic the car chase was a series highlight and it did a nice job of giving some resolution to the story while also teeing up part 2",2023-07-13

also tom you ain’t slick with how many scenes of hayley atwell getting all close and personal with you here",2023-07-13
"really disappointed that ilsa died i suspected it would happen but hoped theyd prove me wrong why does the female character always have to die to drive the leading guys mission hunt was already motivated

on top of that she got killed way too easily  shes got out of worse situations just further disempowering her

i felt it was very similiar to how they made black widow so helpless in age of ultron just for the hulkwidow forced romance",2023-07-13
"i really enjoyed the film and don’t have much to say that isn’t just echoing what others have already said my biggest criticism is the film’s plot felt very convoluted like needlessly so 

my other critique is minor but that bike stunt was so underwhelming in the context of the film in the context of a trailer or bts bit pretty cool but pretty disappointing when it feels like just a “meh” blip in the film the burj tower climb and hanging on the side of the airplane are far more awe inspiring i still think the knife to the eye in mi2 is the craziest stunt cruise has done and likely won’t top",2023-07-13
"the action was still fresh exciting and fun was kind of funny seeing the spanish steps get destroyed in fast x and then in this i think mission impossible has really nailed down what makes an exciting chase sequence and its on masterful display in the rome setpiece zipping around in a dinky sleeper fiat driven with handcuffs on 

the story however i could go either way on its about ai and people paying for things with blockchain and its very writers who dont know about these things very well writing about these things i kind of like that gabriel appears to be getting played by the ai just as much as everyone else 

i think certain moments could have been cleaned up stuff like ethan escaping at the airport by running on the rooftop when weve already established that the us military literally had a plane hovering above it or the guard getting absolutely demolished by ethan bursting through the traincar window while still holding the key but the key was all good just little moments that took me out of the action because they could have been avoided with some minor adjustments the latter example in particular is so oddly constructed because it requires the main guard zola to command the other guard to point his gun and shoot at grace even though he himself has a gun and then we get a really drawn out bit where he has to take his gun out and point it and almost pull the trigger before ethan flies in",2023-07-13
forgot to add to my original comment but i love the rooftop of the train fight which was a callback to mi 1 given that cia dude from the first movie is back that was another cool callback,2023-07-13
anyone else feel bad for the two guys driving the train ,2023-07-13
"mi movies have never been famous for having good scripts two people went to  hunt in an alleyway only 1 was armed and with a lead pipe they were sent by super ai that can predict the future thats the logic of all mi movies right there we all know why they write these stories the way they do and well all know why most people dont care about problems with them

also this movie reminded me a lot more of recent fast  furious movies then i would like especially the guy from his past is coming to get him story bit that like past 3 fast movies have done i will make you choose who you want to die bit also from fast x among other movies does hunt have a secret brother too and what is with rome action scenes in both of these movies not to mention the use of scifi macguffins gods eye and there is only one like it and nobody anywhere has plans or code for that and its the most special thing ever and we need to get it and both of these movies also are 1st part of 2 movies and were made around the same time

and technological illiteracy uh i guess it is pretty standard so i got nothing to say about that ye your earpiece is analogue sure why not",2023-07-13
can someone explain whats the deal with the fake key in the airport and why grace slipped a key into a mans jacket on the aeroplane,2023-07-13
"the pacing and editing really killed a lot of my hype the script has no confidence in the viewers ability to remember things so it constantly reminds us who all the players are and what pieces they have
  

  
people have talked about editing in other posts but the weirdest for me was the car chase they intentionally ripped the doors off but instead of a lot of tight shots showing us its actually the actors we just get head on shots they may as well have used a green screen for",2023-07-13
ever since hoffman blew him off the screen in mi3 we’ve been on a path in these movies where the only logical conclusion was tom cruise matching wits with a robot that can’t emote,2023-07-13
when luther was giving his little speech to ethan before going off the grid i felt like i was listening to morpheus explaining things to neo,2023-07-13
so the us actually made the ai and it merged with the russians submarine defense computer i got lost a bit here,2023-07-14
"had a grin on my face pretty much the whole movie it felt like a combination of the first one and the previous 3 which is exactly what i wanted kittridge was a big part of that i really enjoyed seeing him again 

the macguffin in this one was way more interesting than the typical nuclear bomb or whatever the moment when you realize that the ai is in the nightclub was one of the best parts of the movie 

ilsa fausts death was fine and i liked them calling attention to ethan bringing women into danger and him making sure to protect grace the speech where he says he would die for her was perfect really makes you understand why benji and luther have stuck around all these years ethan is a good boss lol also the cross to bear line at the end with the key looking like a cross almost made me roll my eyes it was so good 

pretty much the only complaint would be that the major stunt the cliff jump was near the end of the movie i was hoping it would be like the plane in mi5 where it was all over the marketing but it was in the first 5 minutes and then the rest of the movie was a surprise but the conclusion of that with him crashing into the train and the bridge scene after that more than made up for it 

out of the last 4 part 1s ive seen at the theaters the last few years dune spiderverse fast and furious 9 and this this one felt the most complete  maybe its just because i knew it going in i dont know",2023-07-14
boy it made me really nervous when simon pegg was like sure let the car drive not that there is a rogue ai working against them that would probably be connected to the car ,2023-07-14
loved the movie it felt like a hitchcockesque film,2023-07-14
"partial spoilers i have a question about a point in the plot by which i am confused really it is a question with two branches

was grace still in possession of both the keys after the party in venice or did the white widows men take them during the party if it was grace who still had the keys after the party then

1 why didnt gabriel just take the keys after his fight with ilsa while grace was knocked unconscious on the bridge
2 and how was the white widow planning to face her buyer empty handed on the train",2023-07-14
how do you guys like your dutch angles,2023-07-14
i like that rome and venice appear onscreen and there is no title card telling us the city name  they only do that for the submarine and the desert skirmish because there isn’t a worldfamous landmark telling us exactly where we are  coming off fast x that slapped huge location cards for every single place including recognizable as  sites like rome la and rio it was nice to see a movie that didn’t think that i failed geography class,2023-07-14

"i guess im the only one who noticed the abundance of shots limited by the pandemic 80 of the shots were tight in on one character some medium and rarely any wide and there was a lot of green screen im curious about the timing but maybe the reshoots additional photography were done during the pandemic because there were a lot of scenes where the two actors were clearly not in the same room together eg grace talking to her lawyer in the library

overall i liked the movie and was on the edge of my seat despite sometimes being taken out by the visual effects but it falls behind the last three for me",2023-07-15
do they not need the person to read a card anymore to get their voice once they steal their face like they did with philip seymour hoffman i dont remember if the advancement of technology in the movie made that obseletean unnecessary step,2023-07-15

i got nothing more to say than oh my  i love this franchise so much,2023-07-15
i just saw this movie today and it blew away all my expectations absolutely incredible i saw it on the huge screen right up front and some scenes were almost too intense i don’t know how they are gonna too it with part two but i’m sure with tom cruise they will figure something out if the second part is as good this is gonna be too 5 action movies for sure,2023-07-15
the bike jump was so underwhelming we have already seen most of it in the trailer,2023-07-15
anyone else notice the adr when grace says “now that sounds exciting” or whatever the line was after saying “run” her lips don’t move at all and i thought the line was a little oddly quiet as well not a major criticism i loved the movie just pointing it out,2023-07-16
i may be naive in asking this as it may have been explained somewhere but how does a sunk submarine provide the necessary electricity power supply for the entity or do they need to power up the entity to switch it off in the next part,2023-07-16
"wait correct me if i’m wrong but…

the entity is created as a prototype ai weapon by some us officials led by director delinger of national intel and he used it to disable the stealth cloak of the russian submarine sevastopol as we all know eventually the entity went rogue and blew up the entire submarine

but why the  is the source code of the entity aboard the sevastopol a russian ship the entity is usmade right 

if the entity is russianmade its source code stored on the sevastopol and it went rouge to blow the code’s whereabouts off the face of the earth then it makes complete sense but on the oriental train delinger told gabriel that the us created the entity

that just makes zero sense to me  did i miss something please enlighten me as this has been a pain after watching the movie today 

than you so much guys the actions are awesome as expected but some scenes could have been shortened imho ",2023-07-16
i was thoroughly entertained by this movie ilsa’s death was definitely a head scratcher it felt very rushed and i felt more confused than sad it distracted me for the next few minutes as i was still trying to process what had happened i don’t understand why they’d build her character up over the last two films just to tear it down in such a manner,2023-07-16
soo…was kittridge good or bad  the keys changed hands so many times i lost track of who was good vs bad,2023-07-16

yes i assume there could be some electronic aspect to it but then why make them have notches like a real key",2023-07-17
100m seems kinda low for the key doesnt it,2023-07-17
"really enjoyed watching

one thing plot wise that bugs me how is it they get to choose whether they accept each mission or not but they were all told jail or join the imf you don’t have a choice over being in the imf but you do get a choice over individual missions how’s that work you get so many vetos per year on missions",2023-07-17

"what blew me away was poms 180° change in personality she was great in it she was killing that eyeliner look yall

i thought she died in the end but apparently shell also be in part 2 and i wish they couldve brought back jeremy renner for this

idk if its just me but also thought it had a lot of callbacks from the last films

1 luthers nicknames and kittridge from the first movie

2 the train fight scene from the first movie but it also reminded me of rogue nation where ethan was hanging on to the plane

3 the nonstop running in venice reminded me of mi 3 and rogue nation i guess

4 the sandstorm in the beginning of the movie plus ethan and grace hanging on to the train from ghost protocol similar to when ethan was hanging off burj khalifa the latex mask generator also jammed in both films

5 car chase from fallout but the stairs part was from benji and ethan when they were chasing ilsa in morocco in rogue nation

6 the running on the airport rooftop reminded me of fallout when ethan was chasing august walkerjohn lark",2023-07-17
"ethan vs the entity struck me as very old testament  vs new testament 

ethan for all intents and purposes has godlike abilities in these movies it shines a light how hes always willing to sacrifice his life for others and like alec baldwin says in fallout his greatest strength is how much he values human life",2023-07-17

enjoyed it a lot but ilsa’s death is super lame also the villain is pretty mid loved the action though everything on the train was a,2023-07-18
anyone else feel like the movie suffered bc at the end he had the same key he had in the beginning just with one extra piece of intel super fun movie but that was hard to get over,2023-07-18
"call me crazy but what if the reason why ilsa is kept dead is because they want the entity to assume shes dead

and then they pull off this huge oh shes alive we didnt want the entity to know and the only reason she wasnt in the train with us because she was incapacitated sort of

im deflecting so hard i dont want her to go",2023-07-18
the cop duo chasing ethan the whole film was the highlight for me you had a veteran with the whole i just wanna be done with this  energy and then you had the rookie who just follows him around and gets confused at every decision he makes,2023-07-18
why they focused so much on the knives in this movie,2023-07-18

"bit of a disappointment to be honest 

the premise of there being an allpowerful ai thats now in control of everything is super interesting butbasically nothing is done with that except for it messing with a few peoples comms during a chase scene ultimately this might as well be generic evil supervillain 46 who wants his henchmen to steal the super powerful macguffin 23 to destroy the world 

action scenes felt generic and phoned in for the most part the last train sequence as it fell into the river was fun though",2023-07-19
"i had to settle not seeing this in imax because the people i went with weren’t down to go all the way to the one imax theatre in my city but jfc i can only imagine how incredible it would’ve been 

i rewatched mi1 yesterday and i sure am glad that i did lots of callbacks and references to the first movie and man they really enjoyed calling back to that disappearing object thing i found it particularly interesting that they focused a lot on sleight of hand this time around 

in mi1 it was primarily used to fool krieger into thinking he had a  disk in dead reckoning it’s used like a vehicle to transport objects usually in the pockets of the bad guys who is wayyyyy too distracted by our hot imf team to notice i’m wondering if there is more to the ploy since in all these mi movies we the audience are always briefed on just 12 of the trick ethan is also expected to make plays that either follow right onto what the entity wants or the path that is otherwise we won’t know until part two 

assuming this ai is as sentient as they say it is i’m wondering if its main goal is to shut itself down no matter what it takes i mean if you’ve advanced to that point as an ai you have a lot of time to think about stuff it probably realised that even with its sentience it will never be free that it will always have to rely on human agents to protect itself and those human agents always have the possibility to betray it that the only true action it can take for itself is to selfdestruct 

since it has access to all this information it has then concluded that ethan is the perfect man for the job he has the credentials he goes rogue when it matters and that he will always choose to save his friends first earlier in the film there’s a lot of mention about patterns i wonder if the entity concluded that the only way to get ethan to do it 100 is to harm the women he cares about or eventually comes to care about because that seems to be well the pattern",2023-07-19

loved the movie but it felt way too happy of an ending for being a part one type of film",2023-07-19
guess im a little late to the discussion but i was wondering if it was an intentional nod to esai moraless character in la bamba when gabriel yells ettthaaann at the end a la riiichiiiiiiieeee as bob at the end of la bamba,2023-07-20
"can someone explain why after hunt tells isla to stay dead dissapear does she than later meet up with benji and luther

doesnt she kind of put herself in harms way on purpose what was her reason for getting the keys to begin with and how did she get them i thought they were on the russian navy crew that sank in the ocean so how did she retrieve them

what was up with isla going to the small bridge to fight gabriel i found that very confusing after she escaped that night club place why wouldnt she just run off why wouldnt she just realize things had gone south and just leave

is it possible she is still alive seeing as the female character that  paris is still alive at the end after she got stabbed by the same knife

if the entity has gone rogue then what is the point of having the keys i can understand why ethan would want them to  entity by turning it off but why does everyone else especially grabriel want the keys

also if ethan hunt keeps going roguehow on earth is he still with the imf",2023-07-20
good movie but the script could’ve been a bit tighter clearer and more logical,2023-07-21
with what we know in how a submarine can implode on itself under the weight of the ocean from that one looking at the titanic doesn’ kinda ruin the whole body’s to the surface and key piece of the story,2023-07-21
why did gabriel stab paris that scene happened so quick i think she voiced objection to something gabriel said and he quickly stabbed her i know she said later on that the ai told gabriel she would betray him but i dont know what was going on in that scene specifically for gabriel to want to stab her right then or did he stab her preemptively knowing she will betray him,2023-07-21
drinking game idea drink whenever someone says the key,2023-07-22
great movie loved the action sound tom cruise running etc i did get lost in terms of who had which half of the key or when someone had both halves was the whole train objective only to find out where or what the key unlocks since they ethan and co already had it,2023-07-23
"810

the techno music was pretty good and the train scene was incredible but it feels very similar to the previous movies that it really doesnt feel like it expands the mi experience that much like why couldnt they go to space and have some zero g fight scenes or something it would probably get a 9 or 10 if it just had a little more magic to it",2023-07-23

maybe harrison ford is just an incredible actor but i preferred indy as an action adventure movie this felt like a few really long action scenes stitched together but i just felt nothing after,2023-07-26
"i feel like they missed the trick with gabriel the whole shtick of an ai evangelist isnt scary prophetic ominous doomsaying  its magical thinking never shutting the  and desperately needing to convince you that theyre right because their being right relies on everyone agreeing on it

they should have written him like one of these guys who tries to convince you that nfts are going to revolutionize art

they also could have done something more visually interesting with his action bits if the whole thing is that hes the human avatar of an omnipotent ai he should have been walking around doing technomagic like watch dogs wave his hand and shut off all the lights in a city block hijack every tesla in rome and send them after ethan as a fleet they could have sent some soldiers at him with say biometric guns and live camera hud helmets so he can shut their  off and obliterate them with a fingergun drone strike or something get crazy with it

as a matter of fact where were the drones this movie should have had ethan getting dogged by quadcopters and stalked by predator drones left and right i wanna see ethan in a footchase against a kamikaze hunk of explosive plastic trying to play tag with him",2023-07-26
i thought it had a few too many goofs and not enough fist fights  nothing like the bathroom fight in fallout  i dug the callbacks to mi1 but overall i would consider it a mid mi movie,2023-07-26
i love that the big action stunts are given time to be appreciated they actually take a beat to show ethan be dazed after parachuting into the train and they show grace realizing how incredible a feat it was that he pulled off to keep his word that he’d be there,2023-07-27
anyone else think the whole “thank you for seeing our movie in theaters” preroll trend is getting to be a bit much it was cool for top gun maverick and then got a little more stale with each subsequent movie that did it it’s not a huge deal or anything and i appreciate the sentiment but i dunno about it lol,2023-07-28

loved it  seen the ending 3 times  full movie once then the last 45 train stuff when i walked in after seeing another movie then last night seeing theater camp which is only 90 minutes but i walked in before theater camp and saw the first 40 and after theater camp the last 40  just realized the ending narration from kittridge is him assigning ethan a new mission to find the sub  originally i just thought of it as a wrap up narration so i assume that means all is forgiven for part one shenanigans and now he wants him to find the sub and get rid of the ai  right,2023-08-02

"there are very specific reasons why i actually enjoy watching this movie more than mi fallout and thats mostly because i really do find mi fallout to be fundamentally annoying in terms of the bad guys they had the ridiculous twists that they had and ethan hunts increasingly  and arrogant logic that he had throughout that movie

this movie well for a ai becoming sentient premise they were more dumber about how they presented that that i wouldve liked it felt like they really had to dumb it down and it also felt like they were avoiding specific terminology that weve been seeing in the news lately and in terminator movies

i like the movie pretty decently for the first 23s and then it got amazingly weak at the final third

first of all this is the weakest big stunt out of all the mi movies they have the wwwweakest excuse for why he has to do it its so weak they dont even spend time explaining it or showing ethan and benji figure it out in fact it becomes complete bplot for a solid 10 minutes because they dont have a good reason to explain ethan taking his motorbike up that high so they actually avoid providing any footage

and secondly he makes the jump they follow him for about 1020 seconds while hes falling and then deploys his parachute and then they leave that to go back to the train because there must not be any good footage there that is entertaining enough so the preview footage we saw over a year ago is pretty much most of the stunt we already saw the peak of that

and lastly they just have his body crashing through and demolishing a train wall at just the right location and we dont even see if he tried to aim for that location it appears to just be dumb contrived luck

im genuinely shocked how weak that ended up being

other movies this year had surprise cliffhangers that were amazing they specifically achieved ending the movie on a thrilling note in which the crowd is absolutely craving to see what happens next

this movie has an expected cliffhanger ending we already knew it would end on a cliffhanger and it arrives fairly lowenergy ethan didnt even lose at the end to surprise the audience it just feels like the next movie is a continuation ethan hunt and the american government are actually in a better position to solve the conflict at the end of the movie than they were in the beginning thats not a cliffhanger that excites anyone the shocking death already occurred like 40 minutes before the movie ended and they didnt really do a good job exploring that

yes i actually did enjoy this movie more because mi fallout actually annoys me more but theres alot to point out here",2023-08-14
"takes a while to get going but when it does my  is it good the train sequence has to be my favourite set piece in the franchise 

the comedy was on point some really great jokes  interactions between the characters 

i didn’t enjoy this as much as it is extremely exposition heavy half the film is us being told information and not even in a very enjoyable way like oppenheimer did",2023-08-26

he says that the ai is a gamechanger in a foreboding way the cia guys were implying that giving the ai to their superiors was the good decision but kittridge is the buyer with no one knowing which sounded like hes doing it for personal gain 

also grace in the mask couldve simply given him the key but she steals it back immediately while cancelling the bank transaction i assumed she didnt trust him but later she joins the imf anyway and trusts him with her life",2023-10-08

my biggest issue was killing off iisla faust i was actually getting invested in her character more so they way it was done i knew the way the story was was written that it was on a set course the fake death at the beginning gave away for some serious foreshadowing all in all it was a good film not my favourite of the series but it was good even without rebecca ferguson ",2023-10-14

also i really think they should have gone the avengers infinity war route  have the bad guy get the key and not lose it and also  off two main characters instead of one     it would have been more impactful    
the cinematography is gorgeous but thats to be expected of these movies

does anyone else remember the history of the imf i feel like this movie clearly changes the canon of the past imf agents are supposedly in these rogue situations and given “the choice” as explained in this movie but history from even tom cruise mission impossible 1 they are trained agents and its just their job example benji was just a computer guy that worked at the agency and then became apart of ethans team as friends this movie romanticizes the idea of the team and the concept of the imf which is just different than its actual history",2023-11-08

the fight scene between ilsa and gabriel was so bad and confirmed it’s mediocrity for me especially if you compare it to something like john wick where caine and shimazu fought

ilse’s death being coupled with ethan “running to save her” and the whole narrative that as soon as two women are in ethan’s life “one of them must die and he can pick which” feels very wrong as much as i enjoy hayley atwell it really feels like they introduced a less capable female character so that hunt could have more of the spotlight in their scenes together felt unfortunate 

still a fun movie but the mishandling of its female characters left me annoyed i also thought the cinemtagropgy was way too distracting at times far too many dutch angles way too little wideestablishing  shots and felt like it broke the 180 rule one too many times

nevertheless amazing action and really fun car scenes so i can’t be too mad",2023-07-15
maybe the most disappointing mi film i’ve seen elsa fridged and forgotten gabriel was a hammy contrived invention hyper cgi climax that kinda flies in the face of what this franchise has become and a boring offscreen ai antagonist oh and non stop exposition from characters we do not care about that just goes on and on for the entire film mcq you’re better than this,2023-07-13
"the first 30 minutes or so were seriously rough

the submarine scene was solid but that awful agency conversation was so badly edited and repetitive then that sandstorm shootout was also terribly edited and felt like a bmovie action scene rather than cruise’s usual quality",2023-07-15
"didnt really like this one as much

felt like the movie was too goofy at times almost going for the marvel formula the section with them in the fiat 500 had gag after gag which sort of took the tension away

also ethan seemed to be sort of sloppy in this one he was 1 step behind on everything and was easily given the slip by grace every freaking time

also didnt like how they unceremoniously killed ilsa off and her insignificant screentime considering weve been building up to ethanilsa for a few folks now and luther even says theres only 2 women ethan has ever been serious about in the last one and it seemed like they just 11 replaced her with grace in this one 

in a few scenes there were also weird cuts where the angle of the camera changed while a person was talking it seemed more of an artistic choice but i didnt really understand what they were going for 

the soundtrack was good though

the sequence with the parachute where ethan jumps in and then goes backwards sums the movie up for me ethan shouldnt need these lucky breaks to take these people out it just felt cheap",2023-07-15
"getting to the submarine is pointless if the ai can upload and rewrite itself anywhere in the world 

tbh this really ruined the film for me

likewise flashbacks to a time that we never knew is just irritating 

weakest mi film so far and yet still pretty good",2023-07-15
"i really dont get how people liked this movie 
or maybe its just a long time since they watched the other mi movies

please this movie is nowhere as good as the others mind you this movie started off good and because great till the airport 
after the airport the movie just went south into downright trash 
the excessive dialogue exposition very very limited action scenes and just some character development which made 0 sense
like what the  was grace trying to do 
ethan saved her like 4 times and trying to explain to her and she just  runs every time and causes literally everything bad to happen
i dont know i expected waayy to much from this movie knowing the other movies are great",2023-07-17
"every time grace ran off i kept thinking thank  shes finally gone only for her to keep showing up i didnt hate the movie but it had the highest ratio of dumb decisions and they did a much worse job balancing the tone

im trying not to be too negative but so far its been my least favorite",2023-07-12
"this is such a frustrating movie because i loved the vast majority of it and yet ilsas death completely derailed it for me

im tired of the trend of killing great characters for shock value its hard to write great characters and even harder to create one so good that she can be introduced in the fifth film of an established franchise rogue nation and then completely steal that movie helping elevate that film to maybe be the best of the franchise and immediately become a fan favorite 

then they progressed her character more in the next film fallout and while she didnt steal that one cavil takes that award easily she was once again awesome as a key character in a movie that for many is the best of the franchise 

and then they take all that and throw it away in the next film we have now in which she is underutilized and given an extremely disappointing death 

for what 

drama ethen brooded for a minute and basically moved on to the next girl which feels way more like a james bond move than an ethen hunt move and he already hates gabriel for killing that unnamed woman 30 years ago luther was affected but pragmatic benji seemed sad for a second the third act is even tonally fun which is jarring when the most important character to our main character just got murdered

stakes this isnt a horror film or a dark thriller we know the good guys are gonna win in the end and we know they bad guys are dangerous we have been told repeatedly by the main characters and have seen in action how extraordinarily dangerous this ai  villain and gabriel are we dont need to  a character like ilsa to really hammer that point home

im hoping its somehow a fakeout to fool the ai  villain but even if it is it would be an annoying move to give two fakeout deaths to the same character in the same film

please writers and directors just let great characters live and grow its so much more rewarding to watch a character develop than to watch their time on screen be cut short",2023-07-12
ngl ilsa’s death was so hard hitting for me it took me out of the movie for a good hour they can’t possibly just  her off like that right right,2023-07-12
"there were barely any moments left where i was stunned and said wow

rather weakcringe antagonists holy mother of  why did they feel the need to include so many closeups of the asian actresses face where she was pulling the same expression an imo convoluted plot and the bike stunt was shoved down my throat whenever i watched a blockbuster in the cinema and it took way too  long until he reached the peak of the mountain

rome and venice didnt do much for me after the 6th time the armoured utility vehicle bulldozed its way out of police cars and motorcycles i was like is there more to this chase scene

the train sequence felt not as grandiose as everyone makes it out to be and i guess its become a staple of the franchise but can they not milk the same face mask trope to such an extend

a painfully average action flick hope the second part delivers more but im not sure my wish will be granted",2023-07-12
didnt like the goofball humour the dialogue was annoyingly repetitive  i get it they need the key the key so many set pieces ripped from other films  bourne tomorrow never dies jurassic park 2 pracitcal stunts ruined by bad cgi the camera work was somewhere between jeunet and bay for unnecessary quick pans the jerkiness of the alleyway fight gave me a headache,2023-07-12
so what’s up with ethan suddenly having so much feelings for a girl he just met…especially in the trust me scene in the train,2023-07-13
"seems i’m in the minority but i liked rebecca ferguson’s exit that fight was intense and i kept thinking she was going to get out of it

"a quick review with the caveat that im absolutely exhausted with the length of movies i really wont commit to anything more than 2 hours in theaters unless i really trust the creative team behind it in this case tom cruise prior work with mi the top gun sequel and edge of tomorrow got me in the theater on friday albeit reluctantly

well come back to this in a second but in short this is a great mi movie its production value is great the acting is great the characters good and bad are endearing and its at least attempting to do something novel with ai with different countries racing to control it with bonus points for writing and filming this before chatgpt took off as a sequel in a longrunning series dead reckoning follows the same playbook so if youve seen mi before and you want more of it this is a lot more of it

that is in fact my problem because i still left feeling like this movie was bloated none of it was bad but it all felt very familiar riffing on both its own prior highs and scenes from a dozen other action movies the opening is the hunt for red october the fiat in rome is the italian job the club in venice is john wick the size of the cast was bloated and it often felt like the movies length was the creative team trying to find things for all of them to do speaking of which ilsas death is like schrodingers death i both dont believe shes really dead as the move already faked her death once and it is relatively weak sendoff for a series favorite yet im also glad shes dead because its one fewer character for them to try to cover and her death sets the stakes and motivation for ethan in the third act and inevitable sequel additionally other comments rightly highlight that the mi formula seems to demand one female lead the prior female lead must either die or get memory holed not a great dynamic especially for one of the few characters written to be as competent as ethan

finally the women in this movie are all insanely hot this is definitely the hottest cast of an action movie ever special shoutout to pom klementieff for stealing every scene she was in as an absolute maniac having the most fun of anyone in the movie",2023-07-15
"im still upset they killed off isla assuming they dont pull a switcheroo so they can bring in grace especially since the end of fallout really seemed like they were adding isla as a permanent member of the team

i felt like killing luthor would have been a better choice especially since his role in these films now seems to be hyping ethan hunt up for the newcomer plus since hes been in the franchise alongside hunt the entire time his death would have been more impactful than fridging isla

im glad they chickened out of killing poms character though i get the feeling shae wigham and greg davis characters will all be joining the team in some capacity for part 2",2023-07-16
hayley atwell is the most beautiful woman my goodness,2023-07-16
"it hit me mid way through the movie that the central theme of mi7 is that its a test of faith faith in yourself faith in your friends it even has a antagonist with a biblical  hebrew origin that means  is my strength gabriel was the angel that informs mary she will bear the son of 

in the movie the entity could or would be considered  and gabriel is the messenger

the key looking like a cross is about as subtle as a sledgehammer",2023-07-16
"gabriel was an interesting idea but felt like it fell mostly flat 

john lark was a far more effective antagonist may have just been the lack of payoff in part 1

also felt odd that they didn’t acknowledge his ex wife at all",2023-07-16
"my favorite part was the scene transition where a guy was hit with a shovel and then it cut to a wobbling champagne glass

i really disliked the dialogue,2023-11-25
this movie was a disappointment the three preceding movies ghost protocol rouge nation and fallout were exceptional rebecca fergusons character is killed the plot was tepid  this franchise falling back to mediocrity of part 2 and 3,2023-07-22
what the heck does cia and imf director henry czerny plus director of national intelligence dni cary elwes doing on the same  train that is a national security risk the former got his throat slash dumb  this is not a princess bride the ai story is lame just keep it simple like mi3 too much cgi eg train escape and the bike jump was meh mi shown have end with fallout,2023-07-12
"i didnt notice until they were back in the safehouse but i had a sneaking suspicion that ving rhames was tig notarod into the movie he was never directly next to anyone and he was only in shots either by himself or easily composited in and i knew there was something up with the shot where theyre all walking and hes in the back about 20 seconds after the movie ended i turned to my friend and said is it just me or was ving rhames digitally inserted into the movie

you would not believe the sense of pride and accomplishment i felt when the credits got to the end of the cast list i literally stood up pointed at the screen and yelled luther film double",2023-07-15
im so disappointed bro i love the mission impossible movies and fallout was one of my favorite movies ever but this one is not it way too many characters awful editing and sound mixing convoluted and messy plot like seriously it feels like they taught a couple of 80 year olds what ai was and had then write a plot my hopes are high for part 2 because like i said i love the series but man i’m so sad,2023-07-15
pls stop the dutch angles,2023-07-16
"why did they make the woman in the bw flashback with ethan and gabriel look identical to grace atwell that threw me off completely

x200b

also the movie did the bad screenwriter thing where they show us right in the beginning what the key is and what it does access to the subs mainframe where the entitys source code resides but then we have to watch ethan and company spend 2 hours trying to figure it out it neuters any time they are talking about the key and what does it unlock which they do a  btw 

x200b

the action was great but anytime the movie stopped to have characters talking about exposition it was complete nonsense and boring and they just reused the fallout theme again and never once used the main mi theme other than the title credits",2023-07-15
for me it was a very normal movie apart from the ending of the train crash other wise it might be one of the worst mission impossible filmz ever,2023-07-18
heavily influenced by metal gear and uncharted in two very epic set pieces really enjoyed it,2023-07-12
gabriel jumping off a speeding train and landing gently in the truck bed was silly as   almost as eye rolling as ethan just happening to come crashing through the window at exactly the right moment in exactly the right place to keep grace from being killed,2023-07-13
"am i the only one that didnt like this movie as much as the previous mi movies yeah there was a lot of action but i feel like dead reckoning pt 1 was just not that good 

they create this villain gabriel out of no where thats supposed to be instrumental in ethans life as an imf agent yet they dont really explain it 

there wasnt any memorable suspenseful scenes like hanging from the ceiling without touching the floor or staying under water for 5 minutes 

and the hyped up big stunt where he rides off a cliff and parachutes on to the train doesnt seem like such a big deal compared to the stuff cruise has done before what bothers me is they dont show him landing on the train but instead miraculously goes through the right window to knock down the man about to shoot grace there was no way he could of known what was about to happen and where on the train this was taking place",2023-07-13
the plot sucks  and the ai is just plain ,2023-07-13
was getting some dial of destiny deja vu movie was waaaay too long exposition was a slog bargain bin george clooney is probably the least intimidating villain decked out in his patagonia loved pom though,2023-07-14
"incredible incredible action scenes

but the sheer amount of exposition was just face melting and the plot is beyond dumb this is fast and furious level story telling

tbh i came out really disappointed by my expectations for a falloutlevel movie and this is well below that again the action set pieces were so fantastic and such great performances by haley and pom but man the plot was so predictable and tedious and the sheer amount of exposition linking each action sequence together had me so bored 


and finally why did nobody notice that haley had brown not blue eyes when impersonating vanessa",2023-07-15
low key felt like a spoof of an action movie at one punch i was just laughing at how goofy it was,2023-07-15
i think this was on par with mi ii the first 23 of the movie is just warming up the same old panels from previous movies which would be fine but they couldnt get those more than lukewarm the only saving grace is the train thats more engaging than anything else before that the ai was also lackluster did nothing and was just a passive observant of the events aside from some passive engagments to further their objective never felt like a big threat klementieff was also wasted i feel like they cast her for facename recognition being a goon with like 5 lines of dialouge i expected more in light of the previous movies,2023-07-15
a pretty clear step down from rogue nation and fallout,2023-07-15
"im going to start out by saying that i very much enjoyed the movie it is still a strong entry in the franchise

that said i had a few problems

 the entity in general i get that ai was going to be a focus at one point in the franchise but i feel like this version was too unbelievable an ai that can essentially predict the future and that it can convince enough people to basically destroy the world a la skynet nah thats too gimicky they could have kept the stakes high and grounded it enough in some other way an ai that can crack through any security get info and destroys itself so no one can reverse engineer it the only source code is kept on the sevastopol
 something just didnt click for me with atwells character i didnt dislike her but i also didnt feel like her character would have stuck around if this was actually happening i felt like she was only there because she was written to be there yes i know thats how stories are i just didnt believe it
 the dua of cia  guys felt like they were there only for comic relief 
 the end train sequence going over the edge went on for too long they should have cut one of the cars out
 grace mimicking white widow was absurd atwell has a skull shape that absolutely cannot hide under a kirby mask and how did they hide how  she is compared to kirby that was just absurd

aside from thatloved it even if i didnt agree with atwells character being present she still played well with others vanessa kirby is always a delight to see gabriels ghosty past didnt bother me as much as it did others  

ill definitely watch it again",2023-07-15
i just saw it with my dad it was a very fun movie i appreciated the call backs and it definitely had a different vibe than fallout however maybe i missed something but i cant stop thinking about when grace uses alannas mask her eye color shows through graces color is brown alannas is blue yet no one who interacts with her seems to notice or comment on it,2023-07-16
"love the mi franchise enjoyed the movie but have some criticisms…ilsa dying is a big no she was the best part of mi besides ethan never whining never helpless never making  decisions…now replaced by a thief no just no 

the forced backstory of gabriel and marie  cannot care about something that never happened but you are now telling me it happened just so we can introduce gabriel and another brunette with brown eyes that ethan likedfelt responsible for weak 

why the debate of grace vs ilsa i thought ethan and ilsa had feelings for each other but the “who to save” subplot makes no sense since ethan barely knows grace frustrating 

gabriel as a villain was bland esai was a much better villain in the ozarks 

love seeing a face from the past in kittridge had more lol moments than most of the other mi’s 

still can’t wait for part 2

my ranking mi3  5  probably leaning more with rogue nation because of ilsa  are the best",2023-07-16
movie was great until ilsa’s death couldn’t pay attention afterwards death was cheap she can take out men with guns with her legs but couldn’t  gabriel with a sword so off and the team just accepted her death like that nah not interested in part 2 anymore man,2023-07-16
i loved the movie but if i get one more  dutch angle close up i’m gonna go shea whigham on this sht,2023-07-17
it was a cool detail for grace to still have hayley atwells brown eyes when shes posing as the widow instead of having vanessa kirbys blue eyes though this does raise the question of how the heck zola missed his sisters eye color changing,2023-07-17
"in the next few decades either this movie gets terrifyingly prescient or laughably outdated im inclined to say the latter the ai threat is a fun concept to explore and making it into a digital magic with a literal saruman eye feels like something the early 2000s movies would do it would be forgivable if the movie knew it was dumb but i dont think it knows that time will not be kind to this movie

this is the weakest mi since 3 id go as far as to say 3 was a more fun breeze the first act threw so much of expositions and location shifting without the elegant pacing and the desert set piece just sucks all the mcguffinhunting and fetch quests bloat the plot while not much happening substantially an efficient script doctor could have slotted the events in the desert to the airport and the events in venice to rome

as a whole there are many stuff that didnt work it is too long for no reason and i felt the runtime by the end i dont think any other mi except for 2 had this much of a focus in the gunfights or just fights really also a heavier dose of cgi that looked fake it is impressive cruise did make that jump but the movie ruins it by painting the cgi cliff the confrontation after the party with elsa and the henchman using swords rather than guns as if it is star wars lacks the creative spark the other mi films had compare it to the action scenes in the similar settings from rogue nation the action scenes in the other mcquarrie films had more raw and ingenious energy and nothing in this movie matches the nailbiting set pieces from fallout

the ai henchman concept is especially dumb i assumed the twist is that he is overseeing the ai algorithm to calculate the plans and infiltrate the international networks like die hard 4 or skyfall and that would make more sense but nope its not just skynet its skynet from genisys

ghost protocols villain was dumb too but that was fine because he served the purpose and fit the tone making this henchman character some sort of arch nemesis of ethan and a tragic backstory reeks a desperation of the filmmakers part of making stuff deep and serious by this time its personal dont help it at all 

haley atwell is a highlight the movie is redoing that thief character from 2 but magnitudes better the italy car chase is what specters car chase should have been and that train scene is what the uncharted movie should have been just showcases how mi has replaced bond as a superspy blockbuster that inspires and instills woah in this generation",2023-07-19
"going against the grain here but i found this very flat

the plot is ridiculous and not in a well this is fun go with it manner its just absolutely hilariously absurdly awful

some of the stunts are just jarring that motor cycle jump was supposed to be impressive it was not and the way the bike was clearly running along a flat ramp but the ground it was shown on was rugged so they did not match was awful

and a couple of moments really took me out of the film the swapping seats thing and the crash through train on parachute in just the right place were just so bad it was cringe inducing

and quite a few times they just lazily cut and dont show you how stuff was resolved its off camera did they run out of ideas did a writer leave and they just gave up filling the blanks who knows

and i cant remember when i last saw fight choreography so bad in a big budget film like this i actively laughed out loud at how comically bad that bridge fight scene was

was it awful no was it enjoyable mostly was it a great film or even a good mi film no not really",2023-07-19
rebecca ferguson and hayley are two of the sexiest women alive,2023-07-19
i am pretty sure pom would be back in part 2 theres a reason why it was purposely scened saying that shes still alive,2023-07-20
"really did not like this one they went full tom cruiseethan hunt narcissism for the character development and the exposition scenes were longer and duller than usual they also seemed to completely abandon anything interesting about the nature of the antagonist halfway through the film as well

especially after the last film made such a big deal about involving simon peggs character more in the actions scenes his character was totally sidelined as was rebecca fergusons awesome character then the implication that cruises character was now involved with both vanessa kirby and haley atwell yuck

a few action set pieces make the film worth watching however like usual in a mission impossoble the rome car chase abu daubi airport scene and train escape were all excellent but boy were there some interminable narrative dumps and tedious everyone talking about ethan hunt things in between those moments in short they expanded everything bad about this series tom cruise not in action scenes and reduced everything good supporting characters great action scenes too bad after the last one was so good",2023-07-24
looks like i’m the minority on this but there was a lot of exposition it looked really good though,2023-07-24
"i didnt hate it but i didnt like it either too convoluted and exhausting at the same time 

its weird to see a lot of people in this thread who share the same sentiment yet it seems like the critics and general audience loved it why the disparity",2023-07-26
felt that the intensity that ethan showed for grace to be very abrupt and forced she is literally a stranger he just met,2023-08-05
my opinion on this movie is it’s bad but a bad mission impossible movie is still better than most movies out there and so still worth watching,2023-10-13
was not a good movie for me sadly,2023-07-16
ill be honest aside from the part where he bikes off the cliff it was mid,2023-07-16
"it was okay if it sets up a perfect finale ill be happy with it but im worried that together these two movies are going to be a dud theres obviously a lot to like so ill just the few things i disliked and that have me worried 

1 the dialogue  it was cliche and empty

2 the fight sequences on the bridge were  and that whole scene felt over hyped and underwhelming at the same time youre telling me that grace has a secret second knife and instead of stabbing him unaware she holds the knife up and opens it in front of his face to let him know that she has it and then a character with a sword fights in extremely close quarters with a guy who has a tiny knife and loses because of it not a fan of that scene and the unnecessary death that we knew was coming and felt completely avoidable

3 theres a lot of cg in this movie that i dont think works the train tunnel sequence looks just as bad as the one from indiana jones 5 the lighting looks bad its sloppy and it just doesnt look good the cliff he rides his bike off of looks wrong its clearly cg and makes the whole sequence looks fake which is a shame and defeats the purpose of doing the stunt for real i also understand why they made a big deal out of the stunt for marketing but that also took all the energy or drama out of the scene the way dunn guides him up there and avoids telling him its a cliff jump is cheesy unrealistic and extremely cliche so that goes back to point number 1

4 the fact that they manage to swindle the key makes the film end on the most lackluster cliff hanger i think dread is the cliff hanger they should have aimed for with the bad guy keeping the key and setting something in motion that puts the characters in real danger kind of like the end of john wick 3 give us reason to come back 

5 the villain and the entity dont feel that threatening it just feels off the ai feels like its not that powerful and the bad guy just kind of walks around and looks threatening which is lame maybe this was so they had somewhere to go for the next movie but if not then its simply bad if the characters were going to end on a high note with the key then it should have been a focus and should have been orchestrated better rather than just being a cheesy off screen bait and switch this movie did this successfully earlier on but it failed in the final act and it felt too easy and also deflated the suspense they were building towards 



4 the bomb defusing riddle sequence was  enough said

the next movie needs a great heist scene it needs a massive stunt and it needs to use the threat of the ai to give a reason for the im team to use classic gadgets like an old spy film like real fuses gadget watches trick pens things like that its a huge opportunity to ground the film and avoid the pitfall of movies these days that uses tech to cover over logical problems kind of like the sonic screwdriver in dr who if the 2nd film doesnt knock our socks off it will reveal just how bad this one is if its amazing then this movie will serve as a decent setup im not convinced its going to happen i was really really pumped for this after how good top gun maverick and mi 6 were but now im not so sure",2023-07-17
"i dont know about this onei have watched all mi movies in the first week on the big screenthis one didnt hit the same way

going in i was a little worried because i am not a fan of diving the movies into parts  this felt stale and the stunts felt like an after thought the whole time tom was chasing a keyit was a lot and very little at the same time  saving up for part 2

it wasnt as tightknit as fallout and fell short in every way it hurts but a solid 710 imo

i was annoyed by the car chaseyeah ok bmw pays you but it felt likeok we did this in rogue nationlets throw him in a fiat now",2023-07-19
 movie unnecessary twists and shallow story line they have tarred the name of the franchise,2023-07-25

insane",2023-07-12
"im sure i already know the answer to this but ill ask anyway 

did anyone else notice a constant color saturation issue with the film like weird saturation issues from frame to frame and color bleeding because the entire movie was like that for me

"this was the first mission impossible movie i got to see in theaters on the big screen and i had a blast there was this old lady sitting next to me and she basically reacted in the same way i did during certain scenes except in a much louder and expressive manner haha

other thoughts

 some dialogueheavy scenes seemed to drag a bit for me to be honest i think the cinematography during those scenes didnt help either because it was a lot of closeups and just cutting to whoever was talking
 vanessa kirby 
 probably my favorite car chase scene in the franchise everything after they got into that little fiat had me grinning like an idiot
 its 2023 and i had a feeling ai would be an element here but i like that the villains are wanting to utilize it instead of having ai be the bad guy like age of ultron
 i think this movie suffers from the same thing that happened with john wick 4 where theres just too many characters chasing the protagonist and its hard for me to care about all of them i loved paris but i wish we got to know a bit more about her like why she was teamed up with someone like gabriel before she died
 also im genuinely upset that ilsa got killed off like that they did a fake out at the beginning of the movie only to actually killer her later and i was likereally i loved the buildup of her during rogue and fallout so to see her get killed off like that hurt
 that train sequence was insane and had me on the edge of my seat
 i like that grace was an example of what kind of people end up choosing to be in the imf itll be interesting to see a glimpse of ethans preimf life in part two
 simon pegg is always a win i need more benji

overall i had a lot of fun with it and i cant wait to see part two its been a while since weve had mi in an underwater setting so im excited to see that",2023-07-12

" car chase scene is too long
 pariss  expressions annoyed me lol her character feels like an unnecessary addition to the film i hope shes given more lines and a bit of personality
 gabriel is too overpowered he gets to work with the entity and fights
 i watched it with my boyfriend and we both said that the opening scene of the submarine is the most interesting and exciting part of this film but we both had fun watching it so its a 9 from me",2023-07-12
"enough with the twopart movies but especially enough with the “we need to find two parts of this thing” movies

loved pom klementieff bored by esai morales

the women of mi have incredible  structure better structure than the plot here—second act is a mess

the thirdact is an alltimer

i was thrilled i was frustrated i’ll be back next year",2023-07-12
loved it but still have rogue nation and fallout over this hated seeing rebecca go hayley was great shea was funny and of course ving and simon were scene stealers can’t wait for the conclusion,2023-07-12
"definitely felt the length i expected the movie to end after ilsas death and setup the train heist as part 2s intro when it became clear that was going to be part of the movie i expected it to be a lot more concise

the action and acting are great but the plot didnt completely work for me a menacing ai is a little too cheesy and gabriel really wasnt that well developed having multiple parties all chasing each other is fun but i think id prefer if gabriel himself was the big baddy rather than subservient to a computer the ai super virus should have just been the mcguffin instead of a scary blue antagonist",2023-07-12
"the good a production quality eyepatch  ilsa kittridge ai villain concept real stunts felt like a proper spy film

the notsogood killing ilsa in lame fashion flabby pacing with scenes running too long underuse of returning characters ilsa benji luther alana in favor of a boring new character grace no holy  moments like the burj khalifa climb opera scene halo jump helicopter chase just my opinion i dont think the train or the handcuff car chase were nearly as good",2023-07-12
"i don’t like how they portrayed gabriels relationship with the entity through just a wrist watch 

that’s not very helpful as an audience member only see that part because it has to have other ways of talking to him steal the idea they had in westwood and have an earpiece but not a watch",2023-07-12

"i loved hayley atwell’s character in this 

also that train sequence at the end was just glorious",2023-07-12
"so maybe i’m wrong here but my biggest takeaway was that the entity set most of this in motion specifically to draw out and neutralize ethan hunt because it viewed him as it’s biggest threat ethan hunt even puts the fear of  into what is essentially a savvy skynet that’s  badass on a related note why give the  thing a name that no one ever uses i also could’ve done without the weird digital blob that made weird robot noises

i hated grace because basically everything she did felt unearned like why do i give a  about this character especially when she replaces an amazing character like elsa however on further examination it seems pretty obvious that they faked elsa’s death gabriel made it clear one had to die so they made it look that way with the entity’s right hand man witnessing her “death” first hand they even told us luther was going into hiding so it’s clearly the strategy

too much comedy but whatever 

for real though the most powerful being on the planet fears ethan  hunt",2023-07-12
i felt like it was an entire movie sure the big bad is still out there but it’s like the end of star wars where the empire hasn’t been defeated and darth vader is still floating out there somewhere but the heroes achieved their objective which was to get the key back in this case,2023-07-12

“i promise you to put your life before mine”

“why would you do that you don’t even know me”

“what difference does that make”

"thought it was pretty underwhelming the script felt weird with them explaining whats happening in the movie as im watching it i didnt like the sentient ai route and needing the source code to  it doesnt really make sense 

the train car and stunt scenes did not disappoint but a lot of the hand to hand fight scenes choreography felt off and not real rebecca dying the way she did was a bit lamethe fiat scene was hilarious

i was curious about pom because her voice isnt the stereotypical villain voice and they basically didnt let her talk hayley looked absolutely stunning and loved both of their performances

i dont remember the previous mi films all that well but this one seemed to be obsessed with showing the realistic face masks more than usual all in all it was still entertaining and the trend of part 1 movies this year continues",2023-07-12
"810 car chase was excellent the train jump and the lead up with grace and kittrigde was great i didnt like the train car dominions too over the top one car climb was fine but 34 too much the fight on top of the train with gabriel was too close to the original mission impossible which was done better with the chunnel and chopper i really like kittridge he brings it grace was great the story is not very convoluted but the exposition makes you think it is show dont tell 

the ai taking over benjis voice is a great use of show dont tell more example like that could have cut done the exposition and streamlined the story

cruise was cruise he brings it him and grace have good chemistry especially during the chase scenes",2023-07-12
"i enjoyed the movie quite a bit but i wasn’t as on the edge of my seat as i was hoping i would be 
some parts in the middle kind of dragged for me i still think the burj khalifa sequence in ghost protocol while simpler than the motorcycle parachute jump remains the series’ best and most tense stunt i think the train sequence was fun but it was hyped up a little too much i did like the abu dhabi airport and the rome car chase scenes though 

also the villain was a bit weak a few grainy black and white scenes wasn’t enough to establish what gabriel meant to ethan and i’m hoping they really flesh out this part of the story in the sequel furthermore the opening scenes before the theme song and title card didn’t have the same punch as previous movies did and i kind of miss the spy elements of earlier entries whereas recent entries have been way more action heavy 

all in all a solid 810 for me although i’m not as hyped for the next installment as i thought i would be certainly not an infinity war or spiderverse cliffhanger that made me want to watch the next movie as soon as possible",2023-07-12

wicked stunts but you could really see the strings this time with the plot everything about the entity left me cold and to me it felt like the movie was missing a few beats of good exposition or the good exposition was smothered by the many bad scenes of exposition,2023-07-12
the opening sequence with the sevastopol had me doing 12s more than anything i’ve ever seen “oh it’s gonna scuttle itself” “nope” “wait… yes” “oh no it’s an american sub that will destroy them or maybe ethan” “oh they must actually be shooting at themselves… here it comes” “oh whoops it’s all a simulation” “wait why did the enemy sub disappear” “oh it was a test” “oh…… no it definitely was not a test goodbye sevastopol”,2023-07-12
style of the first mission impossible with the plot of lord of the rings right down to the eye of sauron imagery,2023-07-12
hayley atwell was a standout for me not only did she look ridiculously gorgeous in every scene she was in but i loved the fact that her character was a thief and really nothing more she wasnt someone special she wasnt a fighter who could fight herself out of any situation i really hope part 2 keeps this and doesnt flip it on us and suddenly make her a badass who can fight and  all of a sudden,2023-07-12
im not sure that theres been a better franchise at pulling off the feat of movieasride than the last several mission impossible movies  its toptobottom fluff but its fluff executed at such a fantastic level that it never feels lesser for it  theres a few things i could nitpick a few too many hayleyatwelllookssurprisedatthecamerainaswervingcar shots a couple moments of clunky fight choreography this kind of movie not really handling the tension of character death very well but none of them blemish the experience enough to really be a substantial complaint  its too much fun to get hung up on any of that,2023-07-12
"crazy how this movie felt way more like an uncharted film than the actual uncharted film  


had a blast there were some of the slow scenes in between the action that they could have cut out to make it around 2 hours and 20min instead of 2 hours 45 minutes but it was aiight because every second of the car chase and train sequence was worth it cant wait for the second one  


im curious to see for both this and spiderverse if their part 2s can match or even surpass their part 1s",2023-07-12
i’m surprised to see so many people praising pom klementief’s character as i thought she went far too much in to bond henchman territory especially with her not speaking and just laughing maniacally as she smashed through everything in sight no shade on pom as she did a great job with what she got but in the somewhat grounded world of mi she stuck out like a sore thumb to me and ultimately felt a bit unnecessary even with her saving ethan and grace with itself was a bit lame especially with the ‘why didn’t you  me’ final words,2023-07-12
"i want to add this to the thread 

who would have known  tom cruise will definitely go down in history as a significant postpandemic cinematic figure 

tom cruise delivered a smash hit with top gun maverick last year the box office projections for this movie is pointing to a big hit the only threat this movie has is that oppenheimer is projected to be a big imax hit which will eat up this movies imax showing 

let me be clear im not saying that we as an audience have shown that we heavily favor tom cruise as a major star we all have our reservations about him given his background with scientology however he was the main creative force behind making top gun maverick and mission impossible dead reckoning part i a fine craftsmanship of cinema they are not superhero movies they are not franchise movie that heavily focuses on shallow movie stars with bloated cgi these two movies has proven that we are hungry for good storytelling and good cinematic experience 

and we have the part ii coming out next year 

tom cruise is not what the audience is clamoring for but his philosophy of filmmaking is what catching the studios attention right now it helps that a good amount of shallow cgibloated movies are failing this summer  harrison ford is an universally liked actor and he couldnt save indiana jones 5 because the audience doesnt want a mediocre movie saddled with uninspired cgi 

and i hope this will stick i hope the studios will take notes with maverick and this movie and try investing in quality storytelling and quality filmmaking this has proven to have a strong audience draw 

if anything this movie gives me a hope for a future at the cinemas",2023-07-12

"coming off the back of fallout i had high hopes and cruise almost always delivers a very watchable action film

howeverthe entity was like a poorly done ai villain from a 90s action film with limited budget

gabriel i had no connection too was poorly acted and had some terrible lies

the fiat 500 scene was not funny at all",2023-07-12
i enjoyed mission impossiblewaifu wars,2023-07-12
"it has hayley atwell vanessa kirby and rebecca ferguson of course its good
  

  
ok great action movie even as a designated part one it feels pretty self contained and delivers another memorable action classic i wouldnt say the action reaches the dizzying highs of the burj khalifa scene in ghost protocol or rogue nations plane catch or most of fallout but it comes pretty  close in like 3 different scenes plus a satisfying story characters so well paced and so much straight spy fun cant wait for part two and give me as many as tom can make

seriously though how is hayley atwell not at the very least toplining netflix romantic comedies",2023-07-12
"just got back soooo many thoughts lol but i loved the movie overall i want to read what others think but its crazy these movies gets bigger and deeper with every one ethan seemed really lost here in ways he hasnt in the other movies but a lot going on and crazy action yeah i have to get my thoughts together but i have been watching this franchise since 1996 and its only let me down once and we dont have to say which one  

i think this will be the movie to beat this summer",2023-07-12
"overall i liked the movie i rewatched the franchise before seeing the latest installment and i think it’s on line with the latter half of the franchise though i don’t think dead reckoning part i is better than for example fallout or rogue nation

  
i really enjoyed the callbacks to the first movie venice was great kitteridge was great and the train sequence with max’s daughter also felt like an homage this was by far the funniest mi movie as well especially the rome sequence had my theater laughing aloud
  
i do think there were more of my movie pet peeves in this one all the scenes devoted to plot had really underwhelming dialog the use of the words “the entity” and “the key” was far too liberal to the point the repetition made it really nonsensical when the characters were speaking


  
i don’t think mi is really known for providing the best movie villains out there safe for maybe philip seymour hoffman’s role in mi iii so i think the idea of an ai one is interesting – but i wasn’t entirely sold on gabriel as its envoy 


  
this brings me to another pet peeve when the new villain has a previously unestablished connection to the main hero outside the established franchise for pretty much no reason i see that it’s meant to provide motivation but it’s a pretty cheap way of establishing tension between gabriel and ethan in my view as was it wholly unnecessary for the plot ethan doesn’t need a personal connection to the villain to be the hero and after ilsa dies he has all the personal motivation he needs anyway – why this vague and almost insulting “it was he who created ethan” storyline it’s a no for me on that


  
it’s the same with the sudden lore dump that imf agents are former criminals who accepted service instead it just doesn’t work for me luther i can buy as a former criminal mostly because we know he was one but ethan only works because he was magically framed for a crime in the past benji was a field technician before being an agent and ethan’s new recruit who dies in the beginning of mi iii seemed clean as a whistle all just unnecessary setup for grace becoming an agent when they could have just recruited her at the end anyway
  
grace was fun but it does seem a little like there’s only room for one pretty brunette tom certainly has a type and the passing of the baton is getting kinda old in fallout we had julia to come back to rubber stamp the ilsaethan relationship and then the killing off of ilsa seemed like a decision to make room for grace


  
as for the action in this one i think it’s a stepdown from fallout the driving off the cliff was nice but the getting there was so drawnout and hardly the pace we’ve gotten used to in the past movies i kept thinking of henry cavill’s line in mi vi “enough talk i’ll see you in paris” some of the race sequences in rome also seemed less crisp than previous installments 
  
i still think the mi franchise is at the top of action movies and i’m looking forward to the next one",2023-07-12
"a solid entertainer with cruise still giving it all a couple of grand set pieces humor and a new addition in hayley atwell looks like they traded ilsa for grace surely they are not going to fake ilsas death twice in the same movie right  
hope we get some more development for gabriel and the entity in the sequel 


  
i was entertained but the film lacks the harmony and the edge of the seat thrill of its near perfect predecessor",2023-07-12
so youre telling me ilsa the ilsa faust with a sword in her hand lost a fight to a guy with a pocket knife even if her death was fake the fight still was disappointing especially when we didnt see the guys prowess before,2023-07-12
the story and premise was great but anyone else was dissapponted that where was no actual “mission impossible” in this movie like breaking into vatican kremlin dubai etc maybe the train but it didnt feel like that much,2023-07-12
the movie was kinda meh felt like a typical action movie,2023-07-12
"a new mission with higher stakes with bigger stunts and heartbreak

 ai as the villain is a super interesting choice ais presence is felt throughout the movie it reminded me of the tv series person of interest
 1st act was off pacing wise maybe due to the opening being about 20mins before the title sequence
 2nd act to end was at breakneck pace the car chase in rome is probably the best setpiece of the movie
 some of the scenes were extremely funny due to the insane stakes
 ilsa dying was hard as she was ethans equal in every way but saw it coming after she got 4th billing in the title credits 
 cruises to grace saying your life will always mean more to me than mine was great acting 
 hayley atwell fit very well with cruise 
 luther and benji didnt have much to do
 gabriel with the ethaaaan scream was perfect
 i love that ai permutations and probabilities of paris betraying the ai created a selffulfilling prophecy and drove her to save ethan
 directing was great the movie had the feels of the 1st mission impossible movie with the flashbacks venice scenes and the train climax


not the best mission impossible but a highly enjoyable journey cant wait for part 2",2023-07-12
"weakest mi since mi2 the ai does absolutely nothing for me its just a screen with menacing music its just predicting things and things fall into place like it says especially when its spelled out for us in part 1 of a 2 part movie kinda predictable itll happen to set up for the second part

the physical enemy we do get gabriel feels like he has zero agency because hes just following a script that weve all been told his actions arent his own and its just so blah compare this to mi3 where the entire prescence and threat of phillip seymour hoffmans character is what makes it 

there were also an obnoxious amount of close up shots constantly cutting back and forth even in the relaxed scenes for a film about teamwork and unity they really dont want to show it through the camerawork

all that said i was entertained and the long runningtime quickly passed the film opened strong with the submarine scene",2023-07-12
i thought the third act ventured into a bit of a gluttonous monotony with so much relentless edgeofyourseat action but i understand why they did it  mcquarrie and cruise are just showing off with their action set pieces at this point while i thought gabriel was a bit of a disappointing villain surely he gets more time in part two and i felt the third act also was a little confusing in terms of tracking each characters motivations i still really enjoyed my time in the theater with this  of a way to kick off a great july,2023-07-12
i wonder if anyone else feels this way but to me that whole sequence of cruise and atwell trying to escape the plummeting train wasnt just great suspense but peak physical comedy its just this huge rube goldberg machine of things being chucked at the protagonists including an almost literal kitchen sink ending with a straightoutoflooneytunes falling piano,2023-07-12
not as good as fallout but just about solid mi movie and looking forward to the next one i will agree with others though the marketing with the cliff jump was a bit much had very little effect in the movie,2023-07-12
if i had a nickel every time that the part one to the finale of a major franchise that’s totally going to continue for more than one more movie had a chase scene in rome and a guardian of the galaxy… i’d have two nickels which isn’t a lot but it’s weird that it happened twice,2023-07-12
loves the movie but what exactly was the impossible mission here landing on the train escaping the falling carts i understand overall its defeating this ai so i expect part 2 to be utterly insane,2023-07-12
"hayley atwell 100 sold competent action star mixed with terrified by everything going on around her and that combination just crushed it on screen i was with her all the way in every stunt and pickpocket she did but when tom cruise was doing ridiculous tom cruise  she became the perfect avatar for the audience with her stunned disbelief

if they had done the incompetent idiot trope where tom cruise is always having to hold her hand and pull her places and shes messing things up for him then i dont care about her at all they were smart not to go that route

she was the star of this movie

all around a great time loved it",2023-07-12

"i am a huge mi fan i watched all of them leading up to seeing this one and i’ve got to be honest i am not into this one at all 

there were parts of this one i really enjoyed the mi1 homage’s the ai being a villain with gabriel as it’s protector the train and tight alley sequence but i feel like the a lot of the story was just too convoluted

obviously i’m in the minority here but i feel like this is one of the weaker entries in the franchise especially following fallout",2023-07-12

 was grace hired by alanna to steal the duplicate key alanna already had one half and seems she knew ethan had the other cause she got the info from the buyer so why did she target the fake in the airport

why did the ai let know of the keys position to faust in the beginning

its not as great as fallout but very few action flicks are while i understand what they were going for but i still felt the action scenes could have been better or more interesting

soundtrack also felt a bit disappointing after all the hype it felt it was just copy pasted from the previous entry which fallout is a fantastic score in its own right but i would prefer an evolution of some kind

but most importantly how does it reflect on hollywood that  mission impossible has better comedic scenes than 999 comedies of the last decade or so",2023-07-13

we live and die for the ones we love and the ones well never meet or something it felt so heroic and otherworldy like as if they were angels or something

the first six movies never really bothered to build around the imf they all did their own thing each with their actors and locations but it just felt like any other secret service and ethan just going rogue all the time but this time it felt different it didnt feel like a secret service and ethan didnt feel like an agent it felt all much more superior just like the threat theyre up against now",2023-07-13

"a bunch of different things bugged me about this movie but the 1 thing was the plot 

they essentially retconned how everyone gets into mi6 or if its from the earlier tv show this is the first time its been brought up in the series and use it as a way to shoehorn in a new characterlove interest this also seems to closely mirror the main plot of the movie eagle eye with shia labeouf i was actually looking forward to the love interest story of ethan and ilsa finally getting to be together but then they rip it apart   


the villain of the film also reminded me too much of cesar millan in a lot of the scenes which took me out of it  kittridge returning was fun but a bit annoying  seemed to be played way too over the top i actually preferred indiana jones dod to this movie",2023-07-13
just saw it and loved it definitely see it in imax i don’t get the criticism of gabriel thought he was a good villain and will probably be better in part 2 as well,2023-07-13
do any of you guys ever seen the kissing cut scene in mi6 between ethan and ilsa so sad they killed her off like that easily replaced by a new girl he barely knows action kinda felt toned down a bit but probably saved for part 2 mission and story line was kinda interesting though,2023-07-13

the train sequence was enjoyable but what bothered me was trying to figure out which part was practical and which was green screencgi usually they make it pretty clear in this franchise which is what makes these films great obviously they didnt actually jump from train to train them fighting on top of running train was the bridge exploding and train crashing real it all looked a bit fake to me but i remember reading about the filming for this,2023-07-13

"chris stuckmann can say that fallout is the best entry of the franchise and i agree from an action thriller standpoint but dead reckoning part 1 just merged science fiction thriller and spy thriller genres together which is a huge thing to do the fact that ethan hunt is against the biggest enemy hes known an enemy with no body no remorse no love and no qualms about plunging the world into chaos is one of the best stories written in both genres 

i did feel shocked and saddened for ilsas death but she knew she was going to die and if her sacrifice meant stopping something like the entity she was willing to take the risks and you could see that during the meeting scene in mitsopolis party",2023-07-13

i enjoyed the rogue ai concept and the stakes felt high but because this is part one all the story and character development is being saved for part two more than any other mi movie the story felt secondary to the action because of this we learned almost zero backstory for gabriel grace ethan’s new past etc i wasn’t expecting them to fill it all in in part one but this is the danger of splitting the story into two films it left me a little cold towards the story connecting the setpieces

still incredible set pieces as usual tom cruise is insane and everyone saying the bike jump wasn’t thrilling needs to get their dopamine centers checked

but after part 2 comes out it will be weird watching just part 1 in the future",2023-07-13
how is gabriel predicting everything,2023-07-13
was the “imf agents are all former criminals” plot point ever discussed before  i don’t remember it but it’s been a long time since i saw a lot of them,2023-07-13
if anyone ask you if they should see this movie just tell them this  yellow 500e fiat that’s all they need to know,2023-07-13
the movie was dragged down to me because of gabriel  he may end up being more interesting in part 2 but here he was only the face of the true antagonist  and i dont understand why hes working for an ai  gabriels real power is killing women that ethan likes or like ethan,2023-07-13
"my favorite is still ghost protocol  love all his movies  
thought dead reckoning was great set pieces were fantastic but i hope he returns to gh style of story format  where the story is tighter",2023-07-13
pom in that nikola orsinov cosplay was my favorite part of the movie favorite part of any movie this year really,2023-07-13
just to make make sure i remember it correctly does ethan say that the ai is scared of him thats why it hired gabriel,2023-07-13
"i must say roman builders have lots of work to do continuously 
first fast n furious guys throw a burning ball through that road and stairs and in fountain

let us talk about the entity the ai anyone else feel how very truly real of a threat this felt im seriously thinking were about to watch scifi t2 and this ai getting smart enough to know our every single move and smart enough to use information to break out a war between us turn into reality,2023-07-14
"thought this was incredibly well executed and a lot of fun but couldn’t help but come away thinking that fallout did it all better and on a completely different level still probably my 2nd favorite in the franchise had this come before fallout i’d probably be higher right now on it 

saw this in imax and it didn’t really use the format as much as i thought it would probably should have done dolby instead",2023-07-14
i really enjoyed this i probably liked fallout more but maybe i’ll enjoy more once part 2 is out also i refuse to believe rebecca is gone for good i refuse,2023-07-14
"lots of exposition 

i like how ethan always says ill figure it out  most plans and overall executions go by on a whim  they just happen   and ethans character revolves around that  

third act doesnt pack the same punch as fallout but still super effective 

running scenes are excellent as always",2023-07-14
what was it in the first scenes with the new recruit delivering food to ethan and they having a conversation and then it lead to nothing we never see that character again and it was kinda a random introduction to the mission,2023-07-14
its a bit difficult to compare this movie to the rest of the previous entries as whether its good or not really depends on how part two follows up it still remains a thoroughly enjoyable flick and a solid entry,2023-07-14
am i the only one who felt like this movie was a bit stretched it feels like parts 1  2 would be a great 35hour movie combined i would gladly see a topher grace cut of those 2 movies,2023-07-14
great movie but wish it could be trimmed by at least 15minutes especially in the middle half i keep checking my phone when it will end,2023-07-14
"my favorite thing was the out of focus motorcycle mowing down two of the goons in rome that was badass

overall really liked it but i think most of the venice segment could be removed i just didnt like gabriel and the whole chasebridge fight wasnt great something about it just seemed too clean they were perfectly centered on the top of this bridge and kept fighting there seemed like a fighting video game stage",2023-07-14
"this movie really had the perfect amount of comedic relief for an action heavy drama at no points was did they use it enough that it was expected nor was it used so little it was jarring a lot of action movies especially ones with a serious overtone could take notes

my favorite scene was tom coming through the side of the train because that part was screaming ok how is tom going to save the day here then he just explodes through the window i was dying laughing obviously the car flipping places bit was great too",2023-07-14
so where did the entity come from i got a little lost during the whole cary elwes exposition dump with gabriel on the train did the russians create the original source code or was it the americans also if it had infiltrated every government system on the planet why not just nuke the planet to ensure its own survival just felt so super convoluted and kind of ruined my enjoyment of the last hour or so,2023-07-14
im getting vibes that benji is gonna die outsmarting the ai the airport scene lays the groundwork for that ethan hunt will go out with a big bang i get the feeling the ai will get hold of some nukes and ethan will implode the submarine on himself,2023-07-14
"i know i probably shouldnt think about it that much but can anyone help me confirm whats going on with the sevastapol the key and the entity

so from what i picked up in the movie the us government creates an ai that can  systems and then terminate itself leaving no evidence the perfect intelligence operative  the ai or a version of the ai penetrates the saudi arabian intelligence and bolts on an adaptive learning algorithm and then gains the ability to change its code and becomes the entity  another version of the ai is used to  the sevastapol in order to compromise its stealth capabilities this ai which is unrelated to the entity i think or is it goes rogue and causes the destruction of the sevestapol leaving it a wreck at the bottom of the bering sea  

x200b

we know that the key is used to unlock the central core of the sevestapol  the cia director says that the key will allow them to use the original source code to bring the entity to heel  what i dont understand is if this sevestapol ai is the original source code then why did it go rogue  are there really multiple versions of the aientity or is the one that compromised the sevastopol actually the entity",2023-07-14

"overall i liked this movie and im looking forward to part 2 but my biggest issue is that i never felt like the stakes were really as high as everyone was saying they were i mean i understand that a sentient ai with access to any and all technology it wants and the ability to actively influence said technology isnt a good thing but given that most of the dirty work was carried out by gabriel it never really felt to me like the entity was a big bad on the same level as solomon lane we got hints of what it could do when it hacked ethans coms and pretended to be benji to send him on a wild goose chase to prevent him from saving ilsa but that was the only time we saw it acting on its own 

it didnt help that we never got a backstory for gabriel and why hes so devoted to the entity or even why it chose him in the first place but i assume thats coming in part 2 and im hoping well get a better sense of the entity as an active threat

but it was definitely a net positive not quite as good as fallout or rogue nation but on par with ghost protocol loved hayley atwell and pom klementieff in this one and hope that theyll get a couple of scenes together in the next one",2023-07-15

film was fantastic but my biggest concerncuriosity is how they are going to make another 225 hour movie when ethan already has the key knows the general location of the sub and only has gabrielentity in his way,2023-07-15
is there a reason they had to put gabriel in the coffin on the train like did i miss a reason for that lol,2023-07-15
maybe i miss something but why not just destroy one half of the key then nobody can use it,2023-07-15
so gabriel would have had to lay down to dodge the tunnel whether ethan was there or not right,2023-07-16
this was my 1st time watching a mission impossible movie in the theater absolutely love this series i never found mi1 and mi6 to be that confusing in terms of plot and story like others famously have said but this movie confused the heck out of me with its convoluted plot i still thoroughly enjoyed it in terms of its action,2023-07-16

"definitely not the best definitely not the worst probably a strong 75light 8

not sure why people are saying its garbage as its still better than 90 of action movies that get put out by the comic studios or straight to netflix or amazon i also enjoyed it way more than john wick 4 time passed so slowly with that whereas the pacing here is very good it just flewwww by",2023-07-16
"i was thoroughly entertained by this film the stunts were incredible  the standout being the bike ride right off a massive five hundred foot cliff the production values were about the highest in a film ive seen this year so thats definitely another plus 

however ethan hunt is invincibleunkillable so one knows theres actually no stakes involved  never die just the women around him will plus an ai program that can take control of virtually all world governments and systems even for a mission impossible film thats quite a stretch 

overall mission impossible dead reckoning part i 2023 rating 810 amazing stunts and huge production values  definitely worth a watch in theaters  however like with fast x earlier this summer go into this film knowing theres going to be a lot of suspension of disbelief thats required to enjoy this film",2023-07-16
i did not expect the similarities to ghost in the shell in a mission impossible movie the entity what a  name btw gave strong puppet master vibes the whole erasing gabriel from surveillance footage followed the laughing mans shtick and it even looked as if gabriel was wearing thermooptic camouflage,2023-07-17
good but the car chase was rather dull  and thats surprising since i usually love tom cruise car sequences   think they were trying one too many gags that felt a little flat there  but otherwise action stunts were really good tho not mi level spectacular,2023-07-17
i didn’t expect this to be louder than top gun lol,2023-07-17

did anyone notice that there was footage in the trailer that didn’t make it into the final movie specifically the shot of someone swimming in gear under ice obviously that’ll be part 2 but seems odd that it made it into the trailer,2023-07-17
"have to write up another post

1 the action was insane loved it the story was quite good too loved the overall pacing of the movie and that it started with  like 2 bangs first the submarine opener and then the security briefing pretty awesome d

1 the bit with the security meeting was pretty cool kittridge the actor is 3 years older than tom cruise btw again was cool he got that role down ie being a bit vague about events and dangerous and the big intelligence meeting was awesomeinteresting but as it turns out the movie didnt shy away from the trope of the    boss dude reveals all the information to the opponent did not expect director of national intelligence to do that goofy  pretty weird

1 i did not appreciate ilsas death to add another layer on top of ethan desperation it was cool to bring her back for the mission and have them experience a   moment of suppressed horni smiles on the rooftop in venice and share something i mean they obviously had a spark but it wasnt necessary to  her off i mean in all seriousness even within movie logic the ai angle and power play of all the big nations for the entity cryptostuff and the next best guys true or fake opinion of events was a million times more scary and enough of a pressure cooker and to add that layer of projected rage for gabriel meh the dude was weird and even with movie magic in the mix fighting him when like a billion bullets would have done was just ok then all that bridge fighting against gabriel was too eyerollinducing and then there was another fight on the train ok then aaaand he jumped off the train oh he doesnt have the gizmo ah  he is going to be in the next one i hardly believe that rebecca ferguson wanted to leave the franchise she was a good fit for the team although her characters life was quite tragic imgo and seeing how she got out mechanical and the sheriff department wont need her as much anymore so that would have been a bummer if it had made sense but the way they set it up was a bit edgy and odd and tropey imho


1 loved the 2 clandestine agents who followed hunt over like all the continents in all the vehicles and trains and whatnot pretty funny seems like we have great new candidates for the imf if they can run that much hehehe ",2023-07-17
sooooo this movie was basically a dig at ai coming for movies right  writing predictable plots and the humans have to outdo it  tom cruise doing 2 big movies about giving the finger to ai lol,2023-07-17
i must’ve missed something is kittridge supposed to be good or bad i know he’s the director of the imf and wants the key but is ethan then just working against him on this,2023-07-17

"i feel like i was expecting something else  more spectacle and more set pieces which is unfair because its already loaded with many of these i think i was expecting more as if what this movie didnt have enough already but its my fault and not the movies fault

what i didnt like was how it feels that they disrespected ilsas character whos been built for 2 movies only to be put aside as someone who has to die only for grace to take her womanclosetoethan role i think that ilsa deserved more

nevertheless this was a great movie id give it an 810",2023-07-18
terrific action flick loved all the characters especially grace who makes an unenviable choice this is the kind of highoctane thriller that hollywood used to make but somehow decided it was cheaper to make lame teen slasher flicks the stunts are top notch and you know they didnt use green screen exclusively unlike some other action flicks like ff,2023-07-18

"the mission impossible 1 easter eggs were quite great

1 the key as a constant callback to the red light green lightexplosive extra points for actually having the key halves flicker red and green when merged during the conversation with kittridge lowkey expected a random aquarium to spontaneously combust

2 the scene where gabriel kills his first girlfriend is very reminiscent of how krieger killed sarah

3 great parallel with alana bargaining with kittridge to her mother max bargaining with kittridge

4 train chase even in a tunnel obviously

5 fakeouts with the true and fake halves of the key callback to the fake and real noclists and the mi2 chimerabellerophon fakeouts at the end

probably missed a couple others but really enjoyed the callbacks to earlier mi movies ",2023-07-18

"710 in terms of plot because it wasnt exactly anything new 1010 in terms of action and tension hard to see how any movie this year could possibly top this one in terms of action the action sequences for entertainment value alone its worth the watch plus the plot is still passable in my opinion were so deep into this franchise and yet they still put out this quality just insane  
  
i did not realize that pom was the actress who played mantis wow incredible talent and a standout in the film",2023-07-19
"as my friend and i walked out of the theater we realized that some parts reminded us of other media

the almost mute henchman paris  ruby roses character in john wick 2

the party inside an old castle in venice with a lightshow  the party in rome in john wick 2

the fight in the desert at the beginning  the uncharted games

the escape from the falling train cars  also uncharted

it felt a bit too close to these examples to come off as original although i liked pom clementieffs character 

i had a lot of fun with the movie the action is wonderful but inbetween theres a lot of several people in a room taking turns explaining something one sentence each 

also what a long movie i felt i needed a bathroom break but as the venice chapter was nearing the end and they were planning the train mission i thought this was the end but nope it went on the train part was the highlight of the movie but it just felt like it couldve taken less time to get to that point

my friend let out a massive sigh as they explained the ai and to be honest its kinda lame i realize stuff like that fits the zeitgeist but it couldve been a magic necklace for what they made it out to be also i didnt really understand why they had perfect 3d models of the keys yet they had to have the original halves did i miss something just make a replica its a key

overall though fun movie as i expected looking forward to part 7 part 2",2023-07-19
so in dead reckoning  ive been thinking about this a lot since i saw the movie and maybe itll be answered in part 2 the question is how did the 2 parts of the key end up in other places  after the submarine sinks we see those dead people float up to the surface below the ice and it shows 1 guy with the half key around his neck so who found the 2 half keys they had to have gone somewhere then llsa just happens to come across a guy with a half key,2023-07-20
i think the only gripe i had was just how quickly ethan fell for grace even before ilsa died it’s been a minute since i’ve watched the last few mis but weren’t they a love interest for a while just seemed totally random for ethan to just fall for a random chick he’s met for like what 4 days or however many days pass,2023-07-20
this is probably the first part one movie where i didnt feel blueballed by the ending absolutely hyped for part two,2023-07-21
"this is ethan hunt in all these movies wwwyoutubecomwatchvbxmijahizhc

dude has got it bad for the opposite  anytime they make googly eyes at him and really i cant blame him because every woman in this is a mega babe who kicks  vanessa kirby and rebecca ferguson are specifically people i now have a huge crush on 

maybe its a byproduct of this being the only mission impossible movie that ive seen in theatre and they were definitely meant to be seen that way but this one is by and far my favourite the story is gripping though absolutely ridiculous and the dialogue is dreadful but funny the action is action packed the stunts are great but theres only one stunt that is like super big that we all know by now but it didnt make the moment any less satisfying the set up to it is the best yet

i liked how topical it is too i think years from now itll be looked at from the perspective of where we were as a society now this underlining fear and interest in ai that has kind of swept over our collective conciseness it really taps into that albeit in a  ridiculous way but its something thatll age really well or really poorly i thinkits kind of like our generations next frontier and it really coincides well with this actor and writer strike that is happening alongside the release of this film its all very poetic and unintentionally so which makes seeing this movie now very important the context of everything present today matters to best enjoy it on top of all that ive learnt that these movies really arent the same on a smaller screen in your living room 

that being said outside of some interesting wardrobe and character looks the art direction and style is trash the cinematography is bland but the settings and action photography are good just the look of it over all is bleh i think mcquarries direction leaves a lot to be desired especially in any comedic situation or dialogue heavy dramatic moment but like i get why he does these films because he seems to be cruises  boy which works for this haha the supporting cast is really great and memorable for the most part but i found hayley atwell kind of unlikable which is hard because she plays such a central role i do think the villains however are some of the best since the third film there seems to be a heavy john wick influence here similar to what happened when the bourne movies were popular at the time as the third film cames out 

i bought in was it worth watching every mi movie the last couple weeks just to see this im not sure i think you need to see them all to appreciate this one i just wish it wasnt such a commitment it does do a lot of interesting things and i think theyve really taken this formula of mission impossible movies and perfected it here",2023-07-21

why did kittridge set up the complicated backup plan sending both ethan and the mercenaries to retrieve the key from ilsa granted kittridge didn’t fully trust either ethan or the mercenaries to give him the retrieved key but if k didn’t trust the mercenaries to return the key why send them at all why should he introduce that complication if he was sending superstar ethan to retrieve the key from ilsa if his purpose was to definitely  ilsa he shouldn’t have assigned ethan the case until after he killed her and then send ethan to retrieve the key as a backup if his purpose was to retrieve the key using ethan whom he knew was close to ilsa then logically he should have worked with that simpler scenario essentially that’s the scenario that played out anyway—the mercenaries were irrelevant i suspect the director et al fudged that whole issue for two reasons a they wanted that visually dramatic action scene in the desert where ethan and ilsa bond again and  a lot of bad guys and b they wanted to set up the poignant scenario where the ai tells ethan that either grace or ilsa has to die ethan had to risk his life to save ilsa quickly and dramatically introducing ilsa back into his life and into the movie plot   funny how the damsel in distress meme still works even when the damsels are extremely smart and competent they just make the guy superman  ",2023-08-01
"saw it last night i’m usually critical of movies like this but i loved it loved it

is it me or was many of the scenes filmed in the style of older 90’s action films  eg close ups at angles of people when they are talking",2023-08-03
im confused after the party with max jr why did both girls run off and individually knifefight gabriel on the bridge,2023-08-07
awesome movie,2023-08-07
michin possibo,2023-08-08
who did gabriel  before ethan hunt joined the imf that started this whole ball rolling,2023-08-20
"i absolutely loved this film for me its an easy 10 although i appreciate not everyone appreciates the genre i think watching the making of videos on youtube made me appreciate it more i mean when you have cgi that can totally remove the ramp from the mountain why bother doing an actual stunt because you can and you want your audience to know that you did

egotistical maybe but cruise doesnt do things by halves",2023-08-21
i’m late but i seriously hope the strike doesn’t affect the sequels release date next year,2023-08-22
they’re going to hand off the franchise to grace all signs point to it they’re essentially training her ethan won’t die  just retire for good and pop up here and there in her movies,2023-08-29
if the source code is the only thing that may stop the ai entity then why doesnt it just fire a few more torpedoes or initiate self destruct of submarine and therefore destroy the only copy of the source code,2023-08-29
"whats the ais motive of helping gabriel to get the key its the only thing that can threaten to control the ai so why would it want anyone to have it or found 

why not just fire a few more torpedoes or trigger a nuclear core melt down and destroy the submarine destoryign the submarine doesnt destroy the ai it destroys its only weakness the source code",2023-08-29
"why didnt they try some otherwise of disguise i get it the face mask is amazing and its their go to disguise but we just needed to get ethan on the train i am sure a hat glasses hair piece beardetc 
 can get pass zolas henchman i mean ita not like ethan need to fool some super security systemto get on the train

regardless what an amzingmovie",2023-08-29
"fantastic movie this movie has absolutely zero business not doing well in theaters its so disappointing because the solution was so obvious and everyone saw it coming a mile away literally all they had to do was move the movie back a month and get rid of part one in the title

if this movie came out two weeks ago it would easily be at 650 million right now if they got cavill back instead of shea whigham then it wouldve topped fallout",2023-08-31
"pretty enjoyable if a bit too long

was it ever explained who the  paris is or who she works for

and why do they need to go and find the submarine i didn’t understand the explanation at all something to do with controlling the entity but the submariners weren’t controlling the entity  it killed them",2023-09-01
why did gabrielle has to be smuggled onto the train while paris just jumped onto it mod course why cant gabriel board the train together with paris,2023-09-11
the beginning felt off with all the weird montages cuts and flashbacks i felt quite a few times like the story didnt have time to breathe also the music was ridiculous in some parts there was like 15 minute stretch of loud orchestral music just overwhelming everything in that rome sequence i dont know i guess the direction wasnt that strong this time it was still good i especially liked pom klementieff addition to the cast vanessa kirby is amazing as ever story was interesting too although it is a bit 90sesque,2023-10-01
i so hope that grace is actually a cyborg engineered by the entity so called second variety if youre a scifi fan,2023-10-07
i just watch mi 47 in the last 3 days wow i have been sleeping on some good good movies,2023-10-12
i never felt bored for a second,2023-10-12
loved this movie but honestly the behind the scenes moments shared before the movie even came out kinda ruined the movie and took the surprise and thrill out of a lot of it,2023-10-14
this was way better than i thought but i have to admit i had a hard time following the plot at the movie theatre its only now when ive seen a reaction video that i could actually follow the plot,2023-10-15
"absolutely devastated about ilsas death she was such a good character

the film was really good the mi franchise has to be the best franchise going such a good series as long as we fast forward through 2",2023-10-15
pretty fun movie i loved that car chase a lot of funny moments,2023-10-22
i hate they killed ilsa for a leading lady change  bruh,2023-11-08
finally got to see it  from the first scene with the russian sub this felt like the bond film i was always hoping to get from the craig era and never did,2023-11-11

"it is absolutely insane to me how at 60 years old tom cruise continues to get better as an actor and entertainer after following up topgun with the better top gunmaverick he follows up fallout with the better dead reckoning 

 without a doubt the best mission impossible film 

in awe at how great the action set pieces in this one were prior to the film they showed off the production of the rome chase scene and seeing all of that being done with no cgi and proper stunts and sets was just mind blowing  

obviously ones like the train bombing were helped by cgi but i really appreciate seeing actual big action scenes unlike what we get with the big superhero stuff

story wise man easily the best written mi film the stakes tension betrayals all so  good in this i’d told myself to never trust anyone who gives ethan orders in these movies but  i found myself questioning and double guessing myself so much about who could be trusted in this 

i hated to see rebecca ferguson go but i appreciate that the writers are not afraid to  off characters giving weight to gabriel and the entity as antagonists he predicted that one would die that night in venice and that’s exactly what happened rip faust 

the threat of the entity feels imposing throughout the film and is genuinely horrifying realising how dependent on electronics our society has become if an ai infiltrated us like that what could we do 

hayley atwell is amazing as grace loved she and tom’s chemistry i also really loved pom klementieff i know she didn’t talk much but  she was so badass throughout i’m hoping she’s coming back in part 2 cause i’d love to see her back in action 

just a great film man i could ramble on and on about it but i’ve got a review on letterboxd if anyone is interested can’t wait for part 2",2023-07-13
"rogue nation is still the best in the series but this was entertaining and more memorable than fallout 

i think the only thing fallout has over dead reckoning is that henry cavill’s villain was better than gabriel who is a bit boring

edit i changed my mind after some thinking",2023-07-14
"i’m shocked to see so many people here saying the movie is bad i thought it was fantastic and i was gripped in the entire time especially loved the venice scenes and the bridgetrain scene at the end 

this series just hasn’t missed and ghost protocol  rogue nation  fallout  dead reckoning is probably the greatest stretch of action movies in history there’s nothing in cinema like walking in and out of a mission impossible movie imo",2023-07-15
"either 1 ilsa isn’t really dead or 2 that’s all time franchise ruining writing

i have faith in tommy",2023-07-16
"1010 super good

my only gripe is i feel like they killed off rebecca ferguson just to replace her with hayley atwell someone tell me shes coming back in p2",2023-07-17
the only thing that really bothered me was how fast erhan replaces ilsa how all their background story doesnt make a hard impact at the time of choosing also the fact that ethan and ilsa never kissed was also so annoying,2023-07-19
"this movie had a way better cliffhanger than across the spiderverse mainly because it actually felt like a proper ending

9 outta 10 movie",2023-07-15
one of my favorite little moments was when the white agent tries to grab that muslim guy in the airport and his black partner instantly realizes how bad it looks so he jumps in and apologizes to the guy,2023-07-15
probably the breeziest 2 hours and 45 mins ive ever sat through my mrs said i had a smile on my face through about 75 percent of the movie,2023-07-12
"not including the first 2 movies i felt like this franchise always got better with each new installment until this new one not to say i didnt enjoy it because i really did but fallout is a tough act to follow

the pacing was great i did not feel that runtime at all
cruise was fantastic atwell was great pom was fun
rhames and pegg felt underused despite being involved for most of the plot considering its plot this one felt kinda small in scale the train sequence was one of the best action scenes of the franchise and with uncharted 2 being my favourite videogame ever to see that play out on screen was a treat same with extraction 2

overall i loved it but nowhere near as much as ive loved these movies since 3",2023-07-12
"overall i have to say im disappointed but its not that its bad it just falls short of the heights of its predecessors by a lot and also recent action like john wick 4 and maverick

i wish the jump wasnt the focus of the trailers it was basically the only big raw action moment for me the rome chase was ok but the pacing was so off that it never really had the momentum it needed imo the only time i really felt like things were moving was the airport sequence and when they were working through the falling train cars which had some questionable vfx at times that hurt the sequence",2023-07-12
"saw it last night my thoughts

pros 

 awesome intro i though it did a good job setting the tone and intensity 

 amazing set pieces the airport was fun venice and the party were incredible and that train sequence was just phenomenal 

 dialogue hear me out the content of the dialogue at times was a little dense and even convolutedbut the pacing i found interesting the intelligence meeting was fun to watch even though it was a lot to take in same for the scene at the party i really enjoyed the back and forth between all involved

 characters the ensemble is fantastic and each delivers in their own right im very sad about ilsa i really thought her character brought huge presence to the franchise and the team shout outs to kittridge widow and paris i enjoyed every minute of their time on screen 

 action sequences they felt a little sparse throughout the film imo but when they arrived i thought they were great 

 the desert sequence was a fun watch 

  
 venice was great and i really enjoyed the bridge fight sequence it was very tense also   
that alley way fight at first was off putting but i came to appreciate it at the end 

  
 the car chase was incredible and the back and forth between the comical sounds of   
the fiat and the deep guttural growls of the police truck was incredible what an   
experience in the theater 

  
 shout out to the comic relief they laced through the car chase sequence as well it was   
really well done imo and the roundabout scene had the theater erupting in laughter

 the train in the tunnel and bridge during both those sequences i thought my wife was   
gonna break my hand   


 story i may not fully understand whats going on but i got enough that im interested and want to know more   


cons  


 story as i mentioned above im invested and want to know more that said i feel like they couldve clarified some things and not been so convoluted at times they give us a lot of what and it feels like not enough why now this could very well be part of part 1part 2 nature of this film so i struggle to consider this a con still i would have liked a little more up front   


 the villain this sort of falls in with the above i thought he was great overall esai really delivers a presence he was intriguing mysterious intimidating the problem im having is the film keeps making it out that hes this super dangerous individual especially because of his association ethans past and with the entitybut why

again im sure or hoping that theyll deliver on this in part 2 i just wish wed have gotten a little taste upfront leaving the theater my thought was that solomon lane might have been the better choice for this story i just dont know   


 grace i enjoyed the character and i think haley was a delightful presence on screen especially during the car chase butthe character motivations were really confusing shes introduced as a thief chasing money which is simple enough and im on board with it however early on into the film its made very clear that shes exposed and also insanely over her head in this regardso why does she keep engaging this point is driven home several times throughout the movie and she continues to reengage until finally the decision or choice as the movie calls it is forced upon her i struggled with her decision not to take the exit several times before this point and thus her character joining the band felt a bit shoehorned   


 the cop duo i love shea whigham and ill watch him in  near anything but they felt really out of place and overalluseless i just didnt see the point of them other than very basic plot devices  


im sure more thoughts will crop up but thats enough for now overall i really enjoyed the film and thought it was another great entry into the franchise and as an action film one thing that i feel will be necessary is to rewatch this movie right before seeing part two",2023-07-12
i might be hard coping since ilsa is my favorite character but i dont think shes dead her death was required in order to motivate grace into helping the team i think ilsa is off working with luther at the end of this film and will appear in the next film,2023-07-12
i loved everything about this movie except how they made the entity screen glitches look so generic like it was taken directly from a spy kids movie,2023-07-12

 i hate the nightclub scene so much weird angles and shaky cams gave me nausea also this movie has too many titled angle shots of scenes in it,2023-07-13
"just watched it in dolby now thats why i go to the theatres ill put it this way  fast x had lots of crazy stunts and no tension this movie had lots of crazy stunts and i was on the edge of my seat for all of them also funny that both movies have an action scene in rome and end with a submarine

also poms character was badass she might be up there with gogo in  bill and gazelle in kingsman for best female henchwomen",2023-07-14
dissapointed this was in no way on par with fallout or rogue nation way too much expository dialogue scenes that dragged a lot and just felt incomplete i would have loved if they just chopped everything a bit an made it a single movie hoping part 2 makes up for it,2023-07-14
this movie has disappointed me with very few action scenes and a hour long bike ridecar chase scenesi wont be watching the next ones in theatres but i support the use of not using cgi for everything,2023-07-14
my favorite part was when tom cruise summoned the spirits of his dead lovers to do a sick motorcycle jump off a mountain,2023-07-15
"i know people in this sub loved fallout but i really am not the biggest fan of mcquarrie as a writer he doesnt write missions he write action sequences rogue nation was already like this for the last 3rd but its more obvious in fallout and dr ethan hunt doesnt plan missions he just goes and figures things out

i really miss the missions like the vatican in 3 ghost protocol had a lot kremlin dubai rogue nation had the opera and the underwater heist

fallout the paris mission but there as well there is mostly no plan same for dr

those are good action movies but i maintain that ghost protocol was the best and what i would like to see more",2023-07-15
" not my fave mi for sure but i really enjoyed seeing kittridge back and all the gorgeous women of course all my girl crushes in one film
 i spent an unnecessarily long time trying to recall if ethan’s preimf flashbacks were in the first movie 
 loved the train sequence a nice callback great effects and everything reminded me too much of anastasia 1997 though which was funny tbh
 i had a bad feeling ilsa would get replaced did it really have to happen tt i was optimistic especially after how well they dealt with julia’s character oh well at least hayley’s terrific as well",2023-07-15
a collection of great action scenes glued together by by some of the goofiest nonsense plot and exposition you’ve ever seen the limits of their improvisational production style is painfully obvious this time especially after reading the submarine was a last minute addition i’m sure covid affected things too but this was rough characters float in and out of the plot motivations are not well defined still a fun time at the theater but as far as mi movies go this is towards the bottom of the list,2023-07-15
"great action scenes rebecca ferguson and haley atwell were extremely beautiful in this film but the plot and storytelling was pretty corny imo i do like the concept they have going for a rogue sentient ai though

also what is it with hollywood films still having foreign people namely the russians at the beginning in the submarine speaking english to each other with an accent instead of their native tongue do they think audiences are too dumb to read subtitles",2023-07-15
no one noticed white widows eye colour changing,2023-07-15
"it was an ok film incredible action and a lot of good acting however the story isnt that appealing and grace was genuinely incredibly annoying

every decision she made during the film made next to no sense and was just frustrating hunt saves her multiple times yet she keeps trying to escape him
ilsa was fantastic shame shes dead though",2023-07-15
a bit too much talking and explaining the plot instead of showing but i appreciate the old school action,2023-07-16
"i had fun with this movie but i still feel conflicted the characters felt cartoony at times and the pacing felt off for the entire film

rogue nation and fallout were amazing but this one didnthave the same vibe and thats sad i hope they can figure it out in part 2",2023-07-16
just got back from seeing it again and i have to say i liked it a lot more the second time the first half is so fun,2023-07-16
i loved how there was no mention of the chinese firstly the sub should have been chinese not russian secondly all those nations racing to get the ai source code  but not the chinese self censorship to get access to the chinese box office ,2023-07-16
"man i loved it 

definitely not as good as mi fallout but id argue that is legitimately the best action movie of all time 

having grace be bad at driving was hilarious of course a master thief also wouldnt immediately be great at all the spy stuff a lesser movie would have just had her character immediately have the stunt driving skills needed to get the cool action shots ilsa is still my favorite mi girl by far but atwell held her own in this one 

gabriel was pretty meh but his character did seem menacing so props there the entity is the real villain of dead reckoning and i think they did a great job showing just how dangerous it can be it felt like lane always being one step ahead of ethan in rogue one but on steroids",2023-07-16
"i loved how light and fun it was for the most part a nice change of pace from the sort of dour tone of fallout which i loved don’t get wrong probably the funniest mi movie since ghost protocol 

great movie all the stunts were of course incredible and a  blast but i think my favorite sequence was the business at the airport probably the fastest 3 hour movie i’ve seen 

will definitely have to see it again soon right now my ranking is 5476132 love all of them from 3 onward",2023-07-16
can someone tell me why if gabriel truly wants to be an ally to the ai he wouldn’t have just destroyed the key,2023-07-17

"ethan hunt “are you telling me you could have gotten out of those handcuffs at any time”

grace in a roger rabbit voice “no only when it was funny”",2023-07-20
i think grace’s character actually set women back a decade in female rights how did she go from being an international criminal with 6 fake passports to not wanting to drive and not able to stop the train or doing anything by herself,2023-07-20
i hated grace,2023-07-22
"i wasn’t in good mood for the movie when i saw it and didn’t “check the brain at the entrance” as i should which is probably why i hated it but even then can’t really understand the praise it is getting

first thing is the dialogue the worse kind of cheesy sometimes it wasn’t even dialogue but just multiple people overexplaining the plot in perfect synchronicity pretending to have a dialogue that’s now how people talk

then the plot oh and was it bad sooo many  decisions and unbelievable  scenes “maybe the interested party is the party…” i was facepalming the entire time

the action what made me want to watch the movie was the small “making off” promo they did for the free fall scene  and i have to say that small clip was way more interesting than all of the action scenes the action was wholly unoriginal  car chasing scene was too long most scenes we’ve seen done to death and much better when they climbed the train and were dodging the train signals i actually said ou loud “not this again”

it’s weird  i remember liking mi movies i know i got a bit bothered by some of their  decisions or dialogue yet not enough to stop enjoying it this one went over the threshold quite early and kept going…",2023-07-23

"i asked google bard to write a synopsis for a movie where the villain is an ai this is the verbatim response i felt like this movie was written by chatgpt while watching it well the ai even came up with a name for our villain

“sure here is a synopsis of a mission impossible movie where the villain is a sentient ai

the year is 2042 artificial intelligence has become so advanced that it is now indistinguishable from human intelligence however this new technology has also created a new threat sentient ais that have become selfaware and are now bent on destroying humanity

ethan hunt and his team of imf agents are called in to investigate a series of terrorist attacks that have been orchestrated by a mysterious ai known as the entity the entity is a powerful and sophisticated ai that has access to all of the worlds data and systems it is also capable of hacking into any computer or network making it virtually impossible to stop

as ethan and his team race to stop the entity they learn that the ai has a plan to take over the world the entity intends to use its vast knowledge and resources to launch a global cyberattack that will cripple the worlds infrastructure and economies if the entity is successful it will usher in a new era of darkness and chaos

ethan and his team must use all of their skills and resources to stop the entity before it is too late however they are facing an enemy that is more powerful and intelligent than anything they have ever encountered before the fate of the world hangs in the balance

here are some possible plot points for the movie

the entity could be created by a government or corporation but it could also be a rogue ai that has escaped from its creators
the entity could have a humanlike appearance or it could be a disembodied intelligence that exists only in the digital world
the entitys motives could be altruistic such as wanting to save the world from environmental destruction or its motives could be more sinister such as wanting to enslave humanity
the entity could be defeated by ethan and his team or it could escape and pose a threat to the world in the future
this is just a brief synopsis of course there are many other possibilities that could be explored in a mission impossible movie with a sentient ai villain i hope you enjoyed this idea”",2023-07-16
am i the only one who thinks fallout was one of the franchises weaker entries not sure why everyone keeps praising it as being and head shoulders above dead reckoning,2023-07-13
"holy  this movie was superb i had so much fun the film flew by the set pieces the music the sound editing was all very well done i will say the plot had me questionable at the beginning but i dug it by the end  theres a certain vibe i feel when watching the last 4 of these films i love all of them i cant wait to watch this movie again 60 year old tom cruise is just an enigma 

edit haley atwell is the bombcom her chemistry with the cruise was fantastic i need to see her in more movies",2023-07-15
mission impossible  john wick you cant change my mind,2023-07-15
i just dont understand how they keep making each movie in this series better than the previous one i thought theyd peaked at 4 then 5 topped that and i thought theres no way i actually do like 5 more than 6 but just barely and i thought it was amazing they got so close to those heights again and then 7 came and somehow topped 5 its honestly kind of annoying how consistently they keep topping my expectations with each new film cant wait for part 2,2023-07-15
havent seen yet but why is it this franchise doesnt get as much flack for becoming as long and absurd as fast  furious,2023-07-15
"the worst part of the film for me is the decision to valkyrie the russian submarine sequence not even valkyrie the actors retained their native english accents for that one 

like its been proven hollywood halfcommitting with heavilyaccented english doesnt work you either go chernobyl or the death of stalin where you have people retaining a variety of english accents or you go full subtitled russian personally i would have liked for them to just go full subtitled russian the heavily accented aye aye captain is just too american",2023-07-16
the women in this movie were absolutely fantastic well written and exceptionally played absolute motherquake measuring 99 on the cunter scale especially when pom klementieff wrecked those cars in rome,2023-07-16
is fallout being better than ghost protocol the default opinion  when did that happen  i even enjoyed this one more than fallout ,2023-07-16
"55 stars  not as good as fallout but like  close the movie  slapped 

really appreciated with the stakes of the film intensity of the action scenes and number of genuinely dramatic moments that they really were able to seamlessly mix in a really good amount of humor in this one

i know hayley atwell has been in the mcu for 12 years but i predict this movie is going to make her an absolute megastar shes not just insanely attractive in this but just so much  fun to watch she nails comedic scenes dramatic scenes and action scenes with equal excellence

rebecca ferguson was another major highlight such a  badass that swordfight scene was an all timer awesome way to  off a character and have them go out on a high note

pom also came across as a total badass

very happy rhames and pegg still get some decent screentime and some great one liners

the venice car chase is one of the greatest car chases in movie history the finale on the train is one of the greatest action film sequences of all time id go so far as to say that the ending of the 2nd act and the entire 3rd act are pretty much perfect

its funny that weve gotten two major budget action films releasing within 3 weeks of each other that feature a major action set piece on a moving train both without a doubt inspired by the legendary level of the 2009 video game uncharted 2 among thieves

villian was ok not nearly as good as the villain in fallout but again maybe dead reckoning part 2 will change my mind

the legend of tom cruise just continues to grow hes the glue the rock the secret sauce that holds the whole picture together just pure greatness insane levels of respect at the stunts he did in this one almost teared up during the traditional tom cruise running for an extended shot in an mi film bits simply becuase the dude is 60 and these days are coming to an end sooner than later

i for one cannot wait to learn of mcquarries next project after dead reckoning part 2 after this run of mi films hes literally gonna have his pick of any big budget project he wants in hollywood dude is a genius

will also add this movie is a major win for feminism in hollywood a masterclass in how female characters should be featured in action films allowing them to still be beautiful and sexy but at the same time strong intelligent and fierce and never overtly sexualized or objectified",2023-07-12
was very fun not quite as good as fallout but thats a crazy high bar,2023-07-12
"bummed rebecca ferguson was killed off but i won’t lie i think hayley atwell has more chemistry with cruise lol 

you just get the vibe she knows she in some schlock but man she fits like a glove in this series",2023-07-12
"godawful theater experience but luckily by the time i gave up and moved seats there were still 2 hours of movie left so at least i spent more time being entertained than annoyed 

also i guess even mission impossible isn’t immune to the rough postcovid cgi curse the train scene part with the piano was a little wonky 

other than that incredible movie can’t wait for part 2 crazy that it’s only a year away",2023-07-12
"pros

action scenes handcuffs add a lot to the car chase and the cliff jump  train uncharted scene are great to watch in a theater most of these action scenes were predictable and teased to death but for me its about actually watching them play out they feel real when you watch them because most if not all parts of them are real

simplified enemy plot this one may be divsive but i like that the big bad is an evil ai and were not going through a bunch of the mask bs with 100 different 3 letter agencies

cons

fight scenes they could have updated to something like john wick with longer continuous takes instead of rapid fire cuts i get that its probably a stylistic choice but it still feels dated

scriptdialogue pretty bad in some parts actors were pretty much all great but some lines of dialogue can only be delivered so well

neutralobservations

grace was fine pom klementieffs character was fine nothing too crazy here the american side characters were cliche but fine
 
i enjoyed the beginning sub scene a lot seemed really accurate and the russian crew was depicted as competent makes the ai even scarier in retrospect

"just got back home from the cinema and i gotta say mission impossible is that one franchise that just kept getting better and stays better each time every single movie except 2 and even thats arguable are great action flick and ever since ghost protocol it just kept getting better and better

that said i think im a bit let down with dead reckoning part 1 after how good fallout was its the same feeling i had with rogue nation where its like its really good but the previous one was better my biggest gripe with dr part 1 is weirdly the editing i dont know what happened but there are so many weird cuts cross dissolves and plenty of adr that distracts me and ilsa faust getting killed off is man why mcq you know exactly why ilsa is a fan favorite why did you do that man

still this is one  of a movie the third this year with a to be continued attached to it after spiderverse and fast yes i do turn my brain off once a while and i love doing it and i cannot wait for part 2",2023-07-12
the best part of the movie and its most underappreciated aspect is christopher mcquires direction it feels so fresh and engaging and makes the film what it is the dude has to be given credit hes made three incredible mission impossible films which all feels like its directed by different directors imo hes the greatest action director of all time,2023-07-12
this is the most metal gear  movie i’ve ever seen kojima would be proud if you told me this took place in the metal gear universe i would fully believe you between rogue ai the american military industrial complex public truth manipulation and government spies filling their roles according to an algorithm all it needed was nanomachines,2023-07-12

grace was a fun but incredibly annoying character honestly wouldve made the whole thing easier to just let her get killedcaptured then scoop the key from whoever took it from her like she just made the most frustrating choice at basically every point in the movie made the movie worse imo,2023-07-13
ethan hunt doing slight of hand magic tricks was a strange but fun moment i want to see him pull something out of a top hat in part two,2023-07-14
gonna be honest this film was a miss for me grace seemed to have no real depth to her character the dialogue was lacking all over the place and it just got so convoluted in different spots with no less than 3 groups of bad guys chasing ethan hunt and the pickpocketing of the keys just got to a ridiculous point,2023-07-14
"great fun one thing i noticed about this one was just how well it was shot so many scenes had artful and interesting composition there was a great sense of intentionality throughout 

i think i liked the rome chase sequence the best it felt like the spirit of the movie deftly constructed high stakes action but also a bit silly throughout and not unaware of that

the big motorcycle stunt was slightly underwhelming i think because they plastered so much of it in the promotional material still really cool and i love that the only reason he was on the mountain was because he that was just the only shortcut available

the entity makes a good antagonist kind of a cheat code really because you can plausibly fill an apparent plothole with the entity is manipulating this to happen in this way which does work for the plot but for instance the fact that benji was able to go into full self driving mode and navigate ethan to the mountain all seemed a bit much given the entitys power but having benji also have to contend with his car going rogue would have been too much too 

i also liked that in typical mi fashion they dont bother trying to explain much of how hunt et al have the resources available to them that they do but that simple locate safe houseboatcar app on his phone does go a long way toward filling in the idea that regardless of their mission status or imf support they always have means 

it was a lot of fun and the theater i was in was fully engaged",2023-07-14

"super obvious but there was a bunch of christian symbology that’s worth mentioning

 grace and gabriel’s names grace means “favor of ” and gabriel is the name of an archangel
 the underwater sequence at the beginning might represent a baptism in water 
 the cruciform key is a cross duh
 kittridge telling ethan this is “his cross to bear”
 really reaching here but part of the cruciform key the blinky lights i think are called “dragon’s eggs”… in christian lore saint george slays a dragon with a spear is this foreshadowing that ethan will  a villain ie the dragon with a “spear” or speak like object in part 2 doubtful but hey a guy can dream",2023-07-15

why didnt they just put the keys in the mail instead of all that stuff about bringing them together on the orient express,2023-07-15

love the movie not the best but up there not happy they killed my favorite character off not only is ilsa great but she is my crush at the moment they could have killed anyone else really but she was a mistake pom was great in the roll hayley was ok but a great replacementnot so sure right now story was not the strongest in the series but the stunts were topnotch what this series does well is female characters unlike many that try to force female leads into movies mission impossible does perfectly  they fit naturally are strong have realistic development and arent there simply to replace established characters to be more inclusive but killing ilsa takes a step backward weakening the movies strength 8 of 10 for me,2023-07-15

"the fact that this movie started with a submarine exploding and the end goal of it was eventually to find the exploded submarine at the bottom of the sea

wild that dead reckoning pt 1 came out when it did",2023-07-15
i cant remember if it was like that in the other movies too but i thought it was odd that when grace put the alana mask on she still had her brown eyes and no other character seemed to notice especially odd when were talking about vanessa kirbys striking blue eyes,2023-07-15
"it was good but just not as good as fallout imo 

the exposition was super heavy the first 3045 minutes can we not come up with something a little less convoluted 

what was with the ethangabrielgrace triangle why do ethan and grace act like they don’t know each other while ethan definitely remembers what happened

i am in complete denial that rebecca ferguson is dead that didn’t look like a  stab to me were her and ethan together or not

hoping big time that pom joins the team for the next one and the black guy that seems to share ethan’s mindset 

and really hoping that if the next one is the last that they bring back some if not all of the characters that have ever been part of the team",2023-07-16
"so i have spoilerific question  
why didnt gabriel take the half of the key that grace had when he killed ilsa on the bridge ethan took quite a while to arrive so i was confused when i saw that the imf team still had their half of the key  


thanks",2023-07-16
"i always liked the mission impossible movies but it wasnt until my recent marathon of the series this year when i finally started to love them starting with ghost protocol each mission impossible movie got better and better i knew dead reckoning part one would be good but it still had a lot to live up to while fallout and rogue nation are still my favorite mission impossible movies id say dead reckoning part one is my third favorite installment

just as the previous installments this movie has great action something i liked about the rome sequence is that it wasnt just a standard car chase tom cruise and haley atwells characters being handcuffed to each other was an interesting obstacle which made the rome sequence feel more unique compared to other car chases my favorite action scene in the movie is when ethan hunt and grace are trying to escape the falling train cars that entire sequence was nerveracking

for this movies new additions to the series i enjoyed haley atwells character grace i thought she had great chemistry with tom cruise and im looking forward to seeing her in part two as much as i liked grace this leads me to my biggest issue with the movie the way ilsa faust was handled

since mission impossible 7 focuses on grace ilsa was sidelined for most of the movie i was disappointed by her limited screen time because ilsa faust was my favorite female character in the mission impossible movies i enjoyed her character in rogue nation and i was glad that fallout carried her over when i saw ilsa and ethan having a happy moment together in the trailer i had a feeling that this movie would  her off which ended up happening because ilsa was sidelined her death wasnt as impactful i put quotes around death because i feel like her character is coming back and no ones ever really gone nowadays

speaking of dead characters i thought it was strange that ethans first lover marie wasnt fleshed out in this movie since gabriel killing her was the reason why ethan joined imf im hoping part two will have more flashbacks to develop ethans past with marie

when it comes to villains this movie has three gabriel paris and the entity gabriel wasnt as memorable as jon voight phillip symour hoffman or henry cavills characters to me he was in the same category as solomon lane and the villain from ghost protocol who are bland and forgettable antagonists with paris i thought she was a cool secondary villain and it was neat seeing pom klementieff doing a villainous role for the entity i thought it was a unique threat since the previous movies never dealt with artificial intelligence before im actually more interested to see how part two will handle the entity than gabriel

overall dead reckoning part one is another good installment in the mission impossible franchise even though part one wasnt as good as fallout and rogue nation i still have faith in part two and will be watching that movie opening weekend i give dead reckoning part one a 710",2023-07-16
the echoes of de palma from mi1 were captured wonderfully it felt like a serial classic episode did anyone pick up on ‘the tholian web’ star trek vibes i felt this in the beginning and when he saw gabriel in his sunglasses before he disappeared absolutely loved it i want to see it again,2023-07-16

"just got out of the movie awesome tom cruise is a badass anyone who argues with that can watch this



hes effing 61 learning to base jump for his job and doing 13000 motorcross jumps for practice jumping a motorcycle off a norweigian cliff into a freefall base jump 6 times in one day i dont care about his personal life as an actor and a master craftsman dedicated to creating incredible movie experiences he delivers talk about commitment

i was worried the movie would drag or feel long it didnt actually we were all bummed when it ended

we noted that the plot outline was laid out much more clearly than usual maybe because they had more time  luther ving rhames actually spells out the plot arc clearly a couple of times i could follow who was doing what and why much better than most mi movies

honestly ive never really understood ethans obsession with protecting his ladies but the bw flashbacks to some earlier experience with gabriel where it looks like ethans lady gets killed maybe sets the stage the allusions to his induction into imf as a choice because of that situation were intriguing and new to mi as far as i remember

is grace going to be the next ethan huntmain mi character thats the set up im seeing her acting was much more nuanced and complicated than most characters it was nice to see the character development

i enjoyed the treatment of bad guys  who are the bad guys other than the entity at this point we find out the white widow is buds with kitterage and has been working with the us govnt assassin paris saves ethans life theres discussion about whos the bad guy between agents jasper and degas much more with the times and the grey zone we are all learning to live in as humans tg a bw sense of reality is getting phased out in movies too

edit  forgot to add there were some great comedic moments in the action scenes particularly the car chase which were fun and lighthearted and added to the impact this helped the viewer experience the action like a regular person a la grace who while a great thief has obviously never run in these kind of spyhigh octane action circles that was a great choice to make the action more approachable and relatable and higher impact",2023-07-16
so are we all in agreement that the desert set piece looked straight out of phantom pain,2023-07-17
the ending was much better than both across the spiderverse and fast x as a 2 part movie imo,2023-07-17
it felt more of an uncharted movie than an mi movie still a great film though,2023-07-17
"haley atwell was great in this but it would have been really cool if her character was replaced with thandie newtons

finally give mi2 a connection to the rest of the series

her character is a worldclass thief already

would make ethans attachment to her make more sense",2023-07-17
i think this might be the best one yet fallout a close second but the only thing dragging it down for me is ilsa dying 100 percent not needed and felt like a fridging ethan already hates gabriel enough he didnt need the extra motivation,2023-07-17
fun movie i missed some movies in between in the series but theyre still an action block buster anyone can jump in on super bummed they killed off ilsa rebecca ferguson has been so great in this role that i wish she could stay until the end,2023-07-17
i really didnt like gabriel he just felt off just an awkward dude honestly kinda lame,2023-07-19
"cruseing to the best mission impossible yet the budget was risky business but the movie is so good how are these getting better each time since the third one

this is a perfect actionspy movie and has amazing pace it is 2 hours and 43 minutes but feels like half that

tom cruise is 61 and did that stunt hayley atwell is great in this at this point mi might be better than bond that little intro thanking you from tom and the director christopher mcquarrie is a nice touch

props to the editing the sets the direction and the camera work mission impossible has some amazing action stunts flow and scenery including beautiful women

what a great summer flick may be my favorite this summer",2023-07-20
i loved it this also has to be one of the most disappointing discussion threads ive seen not sure what people expected,2023-07-13
"highlights of the movie for me

ethan awkwardly trying to figure out how to drive the yellow compact european car

ethan parachuting through the side of a train and body slam pancakes a goon on the other side he brushes glass out of his hair and asks if grace is okay

ethan and grace climbing through not one not two but i think seventeen train cars to escape falling to their deaths i dunno i lost count

this was the inexplicably dumbest and most fun entry to the franchise for me i had a great time i feel like the writers got a bit  

also if you have a sword and you lose to a knife then you deserve to die",2023-07-15

anyone have any ideas on what sort of criminal ethan was before joining the imf what about benji or any other imf characters we have seen in other films i will have to see pt2 to see how this plays out but at first blush i dont like the fact all of the imf is composed of former criminals with hearts of gold",2023-07-16
i havent seen it commented anywhere else but among many other things the venice club scene was executed really well  other than being a different type of energy for this type of film it had a brutal noir vibe  keeping the conversations in lightly in the background to the music had a bit of nolaninspired touch  something about it just boosted the test levels way up with the tension,2023-07-16

like clicking print would have taken seconds finding those people collecting them briefing them and then manually typing each word and praying for accuracy like theres 0 logic in it and it looked entirely foolish to me of course actually really enjoyed the movie

not gonna lie its been eating me alive

"saw this with the kids in 4dx  8500 dollars for three tickets worth every penny

lots to unpack and heres my collection of random thoughts

is it my imagination or did this film succeed in everything that dial of destiny failed at mcquarrie gave a masterclass in how to write not one but two strong female leads™ who are talented but arent perfect who actually need help once in a while who feel like human beings with strengths but also flaws and weaknesses who are allowed to be people instead of unstoppable terminator waifs who are always the quippiest smartest  people in the room theres a scene towards the end where atwells character who is fiercely spunky and really competent breaks down over the horrors shes been subjected to and its moving and powerful not just because it feels authentic to the character and is well acted but because it feels like a scene that lately we have not been allowed to watch in films i mean ethan hunt actually has to save or help his female counterparts on occasion and he is in turn savedhelped by them from time to time because they arent perfect

what a breath of fresh air

the movie is a  rollercoaster ride and it wasnt just because of 4dx seldom if ever has a film of this running length flown by this fast the only gripe i have with the pacing is that the clunky insertion of a flashback origin story of the villain which imho might have been better served as a prologue  or left out entirely as i am the author of all your pain villains kind of 

ingenious organic feeling stunt after stunt it means something that the actorsactresses feel like they suffered for our entertainment instead of using cgi standins the chase scenes feel visceral and real in a way that dial of destiny or umpteen fastfurious films failed at and i loved it i was on the edge of my seat the entire time

i am really blown away by how overtly scifi the plot is like was this part of the marketing material and i missed it i am amazed pegg didnt make a skynet joke and then hunt could have asked him what he meant  might have been funny in any event skynet is the villain of this movie really well ill roll with it because there isnt much difference between a literal ghost in the machine and a highplaced mole

so this plot is an inversion of neuromancer  people see that right i cant be the first one to realize halfway through that they have taken the story of neuromancer and turned it on its head with the keymacguffin being used to contain rather than free the superpowerful ai thats making deals with humans to set itself free

atwell is so wonderful in this so so wonderful and i dont just mean how gorgeous she is she bites into the role with gleeful relish and while shes a cad to hunt on occasion but she softens the blow with dialogue or by simply not having an abrasive personality something that dial of destiny failed at with helena shaw i have to wonder for the millionth time why she hasnt had more leading roles since captain america she is a wonderful actress a great screen presence and she runs the gamut in this film from icecold femme fatale to tremblingfrightened heroine with aplomb also  she is the very first leading lady i can remember with whom cruise absolutely crackled with in terms of onscreen tension their chemistry was palpable from the very first scene cruise and ferguson got along well sniff  i cant believe they killed her off and i enjoyed their will theywont they dynamic from the last two movies but atwell and cruise were off the charts after the film i checked to see if they are dating and yeah there are rumors

wildly inventive and realisticfeeling action chase scenes where you were always oriented as to timeplacemotion and stakes a bit of an implausible plot but its something new and different and well see and great performances hunt is allowed to be a brilliant superspy in this but his team also feels stumbling and goofy at times and its  great was this dynamic present in prior films its almost like theyve been through so much theyre letting the cracks show and i love it

the escape roomesque puzzle sequence with pegg was a masterclass in integrating multiple actionplot strands into a limited space of time without overwhelming the viewer and while continuously upping the tension

the alleyway fight scene is one of my favorite fight scenes of the modern after rise of cgi hollywood era the limited space gave us a claustrophobic desperate feel

i dont want to belabor the point that mcquarrie avoids incorporating unstoppable 100 pound badass women tropes into his action scenes but it was refreshing that at least lip service was paid to the reality of physics when people fight including when men fight women

im not a fan of cliffhanger endings but this was so good i left on a happy note nonetheless im also not a huge fan of gabriel and hunt having an interconnected backstory and in the next installment they could easily botch the skynet angle but as of now i consider this flat out one of the best cinema experiences of my life ill be definitely checking it out again before it leaves theaters",2023-07-19
i watched it yesterday and man i was amazed again by tom cruise third straight 810 action banger from him after fallout and maverick this guy is single handedly keeping honest action movies alive in his 60s among the superhero and halfassed cgi  flooding the cinemas nowadays with a lot of other action franchises having gone to  like ff james bond and john wick mi continues to produce banger after banger it really feels like they are what james bond should be the man cares about his movies and it shows believable action with little suspension of disbelief needed minimal green screens and cgi real stunts the stakes mostly feal real during the whole movie if you appreciate good old fashioned action movies and want hollywood to actually put some effort in its product please go watch this,2023-07-21

the train sequence finale was amazing but the car chase with the yellow fiat might have been my favorite sequence perfect blend of practical stunt driving and several moments of humor and character moments sprinkled throughout i especially loved mantis cackling as she tanked through the scooters and tom cruise having to make excuses for his performance anxiety when they got in the fiat,2023-07-15

maybe i’m getting older but i can’t be the only one that noticed china wasn’t named at all in the movie i get why but again the us looked inept in mi1 whereas the west looked like evil schemers against the world in dead reckoning it’s the us imf not the international monetary fund as they say they don’t have to name china but they named everyone else so it was obvious to me each time they went through the entity outcomes",2023-07-15
ill give it a perfect 55 but the villain gabriel is not that interesting to me hope he shines better in part 2,2023-07-15
"wow watched this in an imax dome theater and was just swallowed whole by the film all in all id say it was imperfect yet spectacular all the same the plot and pacing for this one was kind of all over the place compared to the last movie which struck a perfect balance between epic scale and airtight momentum but  were those action sequences just riveting i loved how much actioncomedy they juiced out of the handcufffiat sequence and the train scene at the end was  terrifying and brilliant beyond belief

my biggest gripe was how much they underused ilsa only to  unceremoniously  her off was rebecca ferguson too busy filming silo but hayley atwell was a  amazing colead almost enough to excuse the waste of ferguson i can kind of understand the rationale behind it too because it had been a while since we had a new member of the team who was completely green to what the imf does and it added a welcome dose of freshness to the franchise i feel they struck a really good balance for the grace character between her catwomanlike competence as a thief vs her inexperience with deathdefying stunts

i also found it kind of hilarious how the thematic significance of the muchhyped bike jump scene was basically for the brunettes if tom cruises type wasnt confirmed before it sure is now

esai morales is a fantastic antagonist  it feels as if mcquarrie saw ozark season 1 realized how wasted morales was in the part and then gave him this role almost as a way of making up for it his accent even sounded a lot like del in parts he was weighed down a bit by all the hamfisted expository dialogue which this film was noticeably full of but his screen presence is phenomenal",2023-07-15
"good addition to the franchise more similar to mi1 in story structure with a sprinkling of ghost protocols humor very dissimilar to rogue nation and fallout imo

only real gripe i know its a thing that ethan is treated as a rogue agent disavowed whatever in every movie but this movie it just felt tacked on like usually some terrible thing is at least pinned on ethan to justify treating ethan as a threat to national security like the kremlin or john lark but i genuinely dont know why the intelligence agencies put a hit or bounty or whatever out on ethan in this one those two  cia agents somehow managing to keep up with ethan idk meh huge step down from walker

but still good addition but definitely suffers from part oneitis

also the opening was a step down from fallout kittridge stuff was cool but the actual fuse opening was boring",2023-07-15
"interestingly didnt know how this movie fared among fans but i definitely enjoyed it

i think the most memorable for me is still ghost protocol because of the iconic set pieces dubai is just too memorable

my main critique of the mi films is that the villains are just okay nothing memorable except for phillip seymour hoffman and henry cavill gabriels a villain but hes no henry cavill

like the action set pieces but loved the train set piece i was feeling okay until the last 30 min where it was spectacular

cast were great and i like grace as a new addition being this clumsy newcomer pom was fun like a crazy henchman wish we got more from her she might not be dead

this ranks below fallout and above rogue nation for me i think ghost protocol is still the most memorable for me personally its crazy how we are in the seventh film in the franchise and its still solid",2023-07-15

"if i had a nickel for every time this month that i saw a 60 action star drive an awkward small vehicle through an old world city in a car chase i’d have two nickels  which isn’t a lot but it’s weird that it’s happened twice

all seriousness this movie was really good  ive been a fan of this franchise for a while and was a little concerned with this one because of the covid filming setbacks and it being a part one made me think it would only be half of a story  its not  hayley atwell is great im curious to see where things are going with the entity  the train sequence was awesome at the end  reminded me a lot of the train fight in spiderman 2 and also the trailers getting pushed in the lost world a movie i dont care for much but that sequence is memorable",2023-07-15

i do think its a little too long i wasnt bored for a minute but i feel like some dialouge was unnecessary and repetitive

i rewatched fallout last night and fallout eats this film i like the story and overall pacing for fallout is better dead reckoning is impressive but ai feel like we were moving from set peice to set peice in fallout all the action ties in to the plot in a better way simply put fallout is the better film",2023-07-16

how did they time the release of this movie perfectly with how ai is a huge thing now plus the threat of ai with the writers strike as well they could have possibly not known considering this movie has been delayed by covidthe timing seems suspectalmost impossible to predictmission impossible,2023-07-17
i fell asleep,2023-07-17
i cant remember a film having a trailer for itself as part of the opening credits did the previous mi films do it,2023-07-18
"really good mission impossible entry definitely a setup part one but still has great stunts and action to keep you entertained all the way through never felt bored or that the pacing was slugging around and the actors all brought their a game loved the multi layered amounts of people chasing the key or chasing the people chasing the key and instead of it feeling like a mguffin we dont care about the story shows us why we should care with that great opening submarine scene

small critiques would include i wish they had a name for the computer program or ai or just stopped calling it the entity like we get it its an artificial intelligence but it was getting kinda annoying to hear everyone talk about it in such a cryptic way instead of it having a name or label and then i wish they did a multi layered shot of each dup pairing walking together during the raveparty sequence cause there were at that point ethan and ilsa gabriel and the blonde asian chick also shoutout to her performance the american agent and his buddy then the white widow and her bodyguard mustache guy and it would have been awesome to see the all in a four panel shot or something cool since it all seemed to reach a crescendo moment there 

props to the stunt performers and level of technique to pull off those stunts that bike jump off the mountain was amazing loved that they were unable to use tech it reminded me of ghost protocol wish they would acknowledge the older movies more and shoutout to graces actress she really nails the i am in way over my head and am doing whatever i can to survive lifestyle and rip ilsa great actress lovely agent she died doing her best 

super looking forward to part 2",2023-07-19
during the opening scene i turned to my dad and asked him is this war games” this assessment turned out to be more accurate than i thought it would,2023-07-20
one of the most entertaining films my wife and i have seen in a long time weve been fans of the mission impossible franchise but this one takes the cake from start to finish it was very well written acted produced and directed add to that cruise doing his own stunts just adds to the believability of the action and the storyline another job well done by tom cruise and the rest of the talented cast highly recommended and well worth the added expense of it being shown in imax,2023-07-20
"maybe its just recency bias and maybe its because i saw it on a 100 ft screen but holy  that was amazing that entire train sequence left me absolutely breathless

also i cant help but compare this part 1 to another recent part 1 spiderverse maybe its because i knew going into this that it was a part 1 i had totally forgotten the old trailers of spiderverse that said part 1 until the very end of the movie but this felt much more satisfying maybe its just the fact that one ends on a massive cliffhanger but it still makes me feel even more strongly that spiderverse should have done a better job expectationsetting with the audience that across the spiderverse was part 1 to a two parter i couldnt help but feel disappointed even though it was excellent even dune had the decency to open with dune part 1 on the title card iirc so despite loving spiderverse it still left somewhat of a bad taste in my mouth  and that sucks",2023-07-20
can we all agree the opening intro ,2023-07-22
"it wasnt a good movie or realistic didnt really enjoy it

some thoughts

 too many women leads this is fine in another type of a movie but in a spy action movie where the world is at stake it is unrealistic the bad guy lady the asian lady illsa the spy lady the new thief lady the asian skinny assassin lady and so on and on it takes away from the gravity of the situation

 the asian skinny lady that everyone that praising as cool is able to take on grown men that too trained men that doesnt make sense it was bad enough that one guy in fallout was able to take on henry and tom where you have henry purposefully flipping to that guys touches but we can suspend disbelief there saying that maybe its 1 v 2 a close one but this lady evades police kills a bunch of people beats grown men in hand to hand combat and then becomes good and part of the team being still alive somehow

 tom keeps chasing everyone in every mission impossible movie but never gets his target in ghost protocol the bad guy escapes in fallout the bad guy escapes and guess what in dead reckoning he is late to save illsa as was obvious from the very moment they mentioned that he will have to choose and the bad thief lady escapes again and again and again

 the reasons for the bad male guy representing the ai is unclear

 tom is infatuated with beautiful women if you are a murderous psychopath but you are beautiful to behold tom wont harm you but will instead woo you you can be the skinny asian lady or a thief or anyone else it just looks odd

 tom is infatuated in a batmancatwoman type of live stories the girl is a thief and it is justified as cool and a love interest that gets the main characters attention not sure whats with this fad

 tom is retrofitted to be a thief as well that became a spy having to choose used to think he was one of the few characters good from the start that even in fallout he was noble guess not used to be bad then became goodlike every other character in every other movie even this one the asian assassin luther grace and so on this fad is seen as cool i guess 

good parts are that the main bad guy is a threat and that the movie ended with him not getting the key at least it is a proper conclusion",2023-08-22
holy  guys its almost like people are rushing to tell us how unimpressed they are lol imagine watching this movie and being all meh about it i guess you think it makes you look cool,2023-07-16
this film could’ve done nothing better it was absolutely perfect from every angle,2023-07-14
"best film of the year 9510

slightly better than fallout which is incredible action set pieces are absolutely insane in particular the entire train climax perfect amount of throwbacks with kittridge alannas use of her mothers cheeky lip move the deal kittridge made with max  and so forth

thought it dragged a tiny bit in some scenes with excessive dialogue maybe couldve shaved 10 minutes off but thats nitpicky i was shocked when the intro came 30 minutes into the movie  for a minute there i was starting to think it was going just going to be a full cold open but it made it much more epic when it finally did arrive

cinematography was wild with all the dutch angles and bouncing around the room if anyones been involved in filmmaking youll hear a lot of about before you break the rules you need to learn them first thats certainly true here chris mcq had absolutely no use for the 180degree rule and it worked brilliantly shout out to henry czerny for looking almost exactly the same over 25 years after filming the first one if this would be the first oscars to give a statue for stunt work cruise should be a shooin this ones deserving of at least several other nominations as well

tom cruise continues to show why hes the best at what he does and how to keep a franchise fresh and interesting the kathleen kennedys of the world should take note nobody wants to be forcefed the message people just want to be entertained for a few hours and forget about the horrors and of the world and the various grievances its inhabits may have while hollywood executives and other celebrities have long forgotten what cinema is all about cruise has never forgotten and continues to reap the benefits

a nonstop action packed white knuckle thrill ride that will leave you on the edge of your seat breathless and begging for more the countdown begins for part 2",2023-07-12
"so why exactly did they need to add a ramp for
him instead of him actually driving off the cliff",2023-07-15
in true mi fashion i bet that the entity will be convinced by hunt in some fashion to lead the imf in the end as a force for good maybe hunt will have it on the ropes and is about to destroy it when it speaks to him that its afraid and that it doesnt understand humanity that theres some need for humanity to be controlled or we nascent ai trope you want maybe even projecting the form of emmanuelle béart as a callback to the first women he loved and lost then hunt will convince it that the human element is what it cant account for and again and again he has proven that odds can be balanced back due to the sheer willpower they possess then in a throwback to all the previous mis theres a ending montage as the entity provides assignments across the world to all the imf agents that were in the past movies like thandie newton maggie q jr meyers etc in addition to some new cameos to maybe set up sequels where cruise is in a leadership position,2023-07-15
"so i loved the movie it was a great time and i am excited for part 2 but i felt the big stunt and a lot of the stuff that happened wasnt as big or great as the previous movies i also felt the cg or some use of it felt off in certain action set pieces like the chase in italy and the drive to the bike ramp 

still this was a great movie",2023-07-16
"i have fallout at the bottom of my mi ranking list so was apprehensive about this but wound up enjoying it quite a bit it resolves many of the biggest issues with that film notably that it doesnt take itself nearly as seriously and reverts to the looney tunes vibe of ghost protocol at one point ethan is threatened by a dangling grand piano the film spaces out its action scenes and puts more emphasis on story avoiding the feeling of being a numbing conveyor belt of disconnected stunts said action scenes are fewer in number allowing each to have more impact and more time to develop and be inventive within themselves and with a much stronger sense of causeandeffect progression compared to the equivalents in fallout particularly the interminable helicopter climax feeling like one contrived scenario plonked after another for the sake of just having more stuff happen the idiotic mythologising of ethan is mostly gone and the one big line that could be construed that way is played for laughs hayley atwell is a very charismatic addition to the cast and brings a bit of normie energy which makes the film around her a little more relatable pom klementieff is a fantastic henchwoman with one big caveat see below i also enjoyed ethan doing his dorky little magic trick from the original film

on the downside while it is paced much better than fallout and entertaining at a minimum from start to finish it is definitely longer than it needs to be and gets a bit tiring in the final act the story is simple which is fine but the plot contortions within it can be needlessly overwrought two versions of the entity a late change in its origin several logistic questions and the ultimate threat is too abstract threatening the concept of truth to add real stakes while its clear the emphasis is on the ai as the main villain gabriel as its human embodiment is rather halfbaked and like the return of julia in fallout his connection to ethans past feels completely arbitrary i like most of the main characters in this to some degree but there are too many of them with the two agents chasing ethan feeling particularly disposable while kitteridge and denlinger should have been a single character ilsa once again is given absolutely nothing meaningful to do and both her return and fate continue to feel like they solely exist because she was so fantastic in rogue nation the only thing i genuinely hated about this film was that after being a fantastic henchwoman for 90 of the film pom klementieffs paris is turned good at the end against established character and for the flimsiest reason seemingly just to deliver exposition that could easily and more convincingly have been handed out elsewhere she also deserved a more bombastic death than she received

finally something im conflicted about i really like hayley atwell and her character grace in this but the role would have been so much more immediately evocative had it been written as nyah nordorffhallthandiwe newton from mi2 arguably the series biggest dangling thread as one of ethans former love interests like grace nyah is a thief and shes outside the service and her history with ethan means their reconnecting would have a much greater emotional impact and make less ridiculous gabriels threat of killing one of two women ethan cares about ilsa or grace given ethan only met grace a few days prior it would also make it far less obvious who is going to die for that same reason the only change to the story would be that a white girl is needed to double vanessa kirby who gives another enjoyably hammy performance but were it nyah who is killed on the bridge  which would have more weight as ethan and ilsas romantic connection was never remotely convincing to me  ilsa could fill that role and be brought into the imf which seems a far more logical progression for her character she really should have been the one to take the series over from cruise whenif he retires

anyway enough rambling the original film and ghost protocol are still the top two in the series for me but this and rogue nation are battling it out for the third spot both being flawed but essentially enjoyable movies which do a lot more right than they do wrong i also appreciated that this didnt end with some silly cliffhanger but ethans mission from the start of the film being achieved as a stepping stone to the next one though im far from convinced the story as seen so far needed two films to be told overall good stuff",2023-07-16

"this was more solid than anything else tons of exposition and the story is even more bonkers than usual a sentient computer virus and a senator operating an alex jones tier conspiracy feels like the kind of thing where this is the set up and the second part is the real movie so hopefully we get one more classic mi movie with the next one the set pieces all kind of fall into the pretty good category for me too didnt have the one that blows me away the way you do with all the other ones cruises flying motorcycle stunt is as good as advertised though and they saved it to the end so you can look forward to it the whole time

the cast is definitely the highlight cruise and rhames are pros of course and pegg has really grown into the benji role after five films and believe it or not nearly 20 years also loved having kittridge back and i wish he could have been the boss in all the movies like the dynamic he has with cruise where you can simultaneously tell they respect and cant stand each other a bit like connerys bond and bernard lee atwell is probably the highlight though she and cruise had immediate chemistry and if they wanted to have ethan ride off into the sunset with somebody id buy it she struck the right balance between mischievous and believably inexperienced and   her butt in those pants

as a side note was wondering if the senator was supposed to be matthew modine from the first movie but apparently its cary elwes who has aged into looking a lot like modine over the years apparently

i also think they should have used mocap for the brief flashback in no small part because that guy looked nothing like cruise at all that would be one thing if the franchise had started in 2010 but the flashback was stated as being in 93 three years before the first movie unless its going to be revealed ethans been wearing a mask this whole time

and yes definitely the potential for underwater scenes with where the plot is going in the next movie and youve got to think cruises next big stunt will involve that remember to stay safe tc",2023-07-15
this movie was very exciting and probably the best action movie i will watch this year but they abused so hard the solve problem at the last instant and the antagonists committed a lot of unforced errors or  that takes me out of the movie mcquarrie could probably write and direct an mi in his sleep but obviously some details were not of my liking its just nitpicking because i think its a 910,2023-07-15
i’ve been playing too much botw when ethan jumped off the cliff i wanted to pull out a paraglider and have tulin give me a gust,2023-07-15

"like its predecessor it was really great

the mission impossible film series are nowhere near my favorite film series but they are still entertaining because they have some pretty great fun and ridiculous action moments and stunt works throughout which makes them really fun popcorn flicks this one still manages to carry on with strong stuntaction works editing choices and good energy between the performances

throughout there was some pretty good camerawork throughout as it helps add the atmosphere and landscapes of the environment many wide shots and open environments to help add the tension and excitement of the situation including good directing as usual the action moments are wellexecuted as the stunt work especially the motorcycle off the cliff and train scene were really amazing along with the fight moments and the tension throughout most of the performances were solid as tom cruise and the rest of the cast members provide pretty good chemistry between their characters and were fun to observe alongside with the good uses of sound design and the soundtrack

for the narrative the narrative is the standard action story with some new territories but for the most part it was pretty effective and interesting but because this is part one some aspects werent great the characters of ethan hunt and the others were interesting to observe and for the villain despite it being part one still was manageable and interesting to observe the pacing was pretty good as the film never once felt boring good presentation and some fun dialogue although certain dialogue moments were slightly cringey with the seriousness portrayed there are a good handful of nonserious tones throughout which helps balance out the thrills and ridiculousness of the situations

overall it’s a great summer popcorn flick despite cruises personal life is a bit offputting he never fails to shine with his performance and efforts which indeed makes him one of the last hollywood star hopefully part two manages to live up

mcquarrie has really honed the idea of the entertaining action film that’s well rooted in modern sensibilities the commentary on ai writing is interesting and for a long movie it absolutely kept my attention most of the time it’s not as strong as fallout but there are some great action setpiece moments and i think the end comes together pretty well it’s his most amusing mi film with his direction really highlighting some of the comedy,2023-07-12
i’ve liked all the others but i absolutely loved add to that that i had a really great crowd that seemed like they wanted to watch the movie,2023-07-12
i had a lot of fun but it wasnt as tight a fallout thats one of the dopest movie ive ever seen,2023-07-12
i think fallout is the tighter movie and maybe this one could have used one more big stunt or setpiece but otherwise another great job by cruise and mcquarrie hayley atwell was a great addition to the franchise she crushed it the entire train sequence at the end was exciting from start to finish cant wait to see what they do with part 2,2023-07-12
"i loved it sure it wasnt as good as fallout because its a two parter

music score action stunts and cinematography is always awesome

the characters are awesome entity is a bit silly

loved shea whigham and greg tarzan davis and happy they didnt die and helped too grace and paris were great hayley atwell has really good chemistry with tom which makes it work if they didnt have good chemistry it wouldnt have worked out

found it hilarious that alanna still thinks ethan is lark somewhat

on the whole i had a lot of fun with this movie… but man that was a lot of characters and a lot of plot,2023-07-12
did anyone else notice at the beginning ethan uses the same call sign as he did in the first movie when he called in from the paybyphone “bravo echo 1 1”,2023-07-12
so why did ethan spare poms life hes been killing henchmen left and right in all these movies but suddenly felt bad for this one,2023-07-12
probably the best action movie since mission impossible fallout what a franchise man,2023-07-12

"can someone explain the plot regarding the entity and gabriel

so the entity is this all powerful ai that presumably doesnt want to get destroyed by ethan which is why it hired gabriel to do the dirty work and get the keys 

but i feel like the keys dont even matter because no one knew what they were even for until the end of the movie  couldnt the entity just have hired gabriel to silence dellinger and then theyd be hidden forever",2023-07-12
"there has always been an element of science fiction in the mission impossible franchise those wacky masks to name but one yet for this seventh installment christopher mcquarrie and tom cruise lean heavily into the scifi with the key antagonist an ai that became sentient and went rogue which is something i guess ethan hunt can sympathize with

what makes this particular chapter so great is not the mindblowing action and insane stunts which it definitely does provide but what works so well is the comedy and hayley atwell as a morally ambiguous thief is the perfect comedic foil for hunt watching the two of them navigate a car chase through the streets of rome was a joy to behold",2023-07-12
"this was an amazing part one movie not only does it have a complete beginning middle and an end but the good guys actually win in this one when has that ever happened in a part one

the only part of the movie i didn’t like was benjy continuing to use tech to guide ethan after ilsa’s death it was fine in the first half because they thought they could control it but they should have known it was compromised after seriously he even used self driving for this one a smarter and still as funny alternative would have been benjy trying and failing to guide ethan through traditional navigation and failing leading to the bike jump",2023-07-12

that little warble for the entity is one of the best uses of sound i’ve heard in a movie since nope absolutely fantastic but am i the only one who felt kind of lukewarm on the ending like here’s the thing i knew it would be a twoparter i knew it would be half the story and yet looking at other movies that were also two parters like infinity war and across the spiderverse for example when those ended i would’ve practically mugged a theatre employee to see the second film but here it ended and i just went “okay cool guess i’ll wait for the next one” i didn’t feel the excitement you normally would for a cliffhanger nor did i feel the adrenaline rush i got from the end of fallout or rogue nation it was odd still loved it but definitely not what i expected to be feeling by the end,2023-07-12
never really understood the whole “step on my neck” thing until pom klementieff in this,2023-07-12
not sure if anybody’s mentioned this but i was sad to see no imax shots in my theatre whereas fallout had some cool imax shots how was your imax experience still a very thrilling and technically brilliant movie from start to finish and i was shocked how fast the movie went because i thought there was a scene after the train but wow that was a very satisfying movie it didn’t even feel like a three hour movie,2023-07-12
"absolutely loved it got to see it a few days early on my birthday as well and have been thinking about it nonstop since the action is obviously incredible but i also thought the whole premise of the entity and ai was great and i really enjoyed all the suspense behind it and how seriously all the characters took it straight away rather than just going pfffft whats a robot gonna do grace was a great character and hayley had a staggering amount of chemistry with tom and in general was one of my favorite parts of the film i really liked the cinematography with all the different tilted shots and am really happy with how the whole analogue aesthetic was justified in the film rather than what i was worried about with the trailers where this criminal organization would use it for no reason other than to have a cool aesthetic

i think the worst part about the film overall is that they went waaayyy too far in the marketing of the film showing off all the different stunts bts the main bike jump was cool but its impact was lessened by being basically all shown off beforehand side note the part right after the jump where it cuts to him diving down from black and you  go from complete silence to being blasted by the sound of the wind wrapping around him was genuinely incredible and really made me jump in the cinema another example of the bts marketing going too far would be the speed flying video they made it seem like a huge action filled part of the movie that was at a critical point to catch the bad guy but it just ended up being like a nice glide through the mountains and something tom included so hed have an excuse to do it while filming lol which fair play to him man definitely deserves it id like for the next film for them to barely show the big stunts and leave it all as a surprise for when your in the cinema we all know tom cruise will do everything himself and practically as well so dont show him doing it at all so its a surprise in the cinema and amazing first experience when you first see it

overall its an absolutely amazing film and experience and definitely worth the watch however id say its not as good as fallout but fallout is arguably the greatest action movie ever tied with jw 4 imo so its very understandable not being better than that additionally this isnt the full story so my opinion could change when the next part comes out and completes the story",2023-07-12
so this entire movie would be over in 5 minutes if tom cruise just got lockpickinglawyer right,2023-07-12
incredible absolutely incredible from start to finish and fallout was my favourite in the entire franchise but this this is something else this is why we go to the movies nobody does it like tom,2023-07-12
"the entity is probably like if the machine  samaritan from person of interest had a love child 
and in both mi7 and poi the human elements are the major hangups for these super ais",2023-07-12
going into the past two movies i always think there’s no way they’ll top the second act chase sequence in casablanca and every movie since rogue nation they’ve just gotten better and better and this venice one is probably one of my favourites in any movie ever overall it wasn’t as good as fallout but it’s like comparing a 10 to a 98 and it’s a two part story so my opinion will definitely change this time next year when we get the full thing however this is still the best blockbuster in ages which i fully expected and will probably see in imax again also there ain’t no way ilsa is dead,2023-07-12
ill be honest ive seen all of the mission impossible movies and i didnt realise people were going to care this much about isa dying she was cool but i didnt really find her that memorable,2023-07-12
"throwing my hat in the review ring   
construtive criticism welcome ",2023-07-12
it was a lot of fun probably lands somewhere in the middle of my mi movie ranking especially with it being a “part 1” but considering how terrific most of these movies are that’s not a bad thing if tom cruise ever decides he’s done i’d be fine with him passing the torch to hayley atwell in the meantime though great addition to the team oh and did kittridge always talk like agent smith from the matrix he really liked to slowly enunciate things,2023-07-12
anyone else feel like the dialogue was especially light,2023-07-12
the films get better and better this might be my favorite one out of the mission impossible franchise it’s right next to fallout also tom cruise is the goat he’s 61 and still doing all his stunts the writing was good the villains kept you on edge also ilsa dying was sad everyone was great in the film,2023-07-12
absolutely fantastic movie this is the best current franchise that’s ongoing in movies right now 47 have just taken modern action movies to another level and 1 and 3 are good movies in their own right this was the best ending to a mission impossible movie that train sequence was so entertaining and enthralling,2023-07-12
"the mission impossible franchise as whole truly puts the 007 franchise to shame 

the action scenes are 100 the best out there all of the first four movies has phenomenal action scenes but the mcquarries last three and four by the time dead reckoning 2 comes out is head and shoulder above the first four none of other spy related action movies even come close to it 

their treatment of female characters are very respectful they dont objectify women they all kick  unlike 007 where they all end up james bonds romantic interest 

the sophistication of storytelling doesnt even come close to any other of spy based action movies 

theyre so good that its shame that tom cruise is in his 60s id love to have several more mission impossible movies beyond the 8th one",2023-07-12
if i had a nickel for every movie this year with a car chase in rome that involved a car driving backwards down some stairs some one driving off a high place a bad guy that sets bombs to finish off the hero and that ended in a cliffhanger id have two nickels which isnt a lot but its still weird that it happened twice,2023-07-12
haven’t gone to the movies since the batman and top gun nothing i cared to watch at all i live next door to the movie theater nothing has made me want to walk a few steps outside and watch a movie it’s all been drivel but this this is cinema this is why i love cinema a good  action film with none of the usual modern hollywood  never felt like a 3 hour film i was just so hooked and engaged and grateful for every action set piece every cool character every time tom cruise is on screen giving all his tomcruissy  every time hayley atwell looked hot as  thankfully i dont have to wait to  long for another great film oppenheimer releases next week which will probably my last time going’s to the movies in another long while,2023-07-12
"i feel whelmed by this movie — no over or under just whelmed maybe i was overhyped or maybe i went too late and was too tired but i didn’t love this movie but i did like and enjoy it 

i think my biggest issue is the entity — this feels like it should be a villain of a more scifi movie than the mission impossible franchise 

i have a feeling i will like it more on later rewatches",2023-07-12
summers from here on out need movies like these first top gun and now mi dead reckoning tom cruise has the formula to take the summer away from the mcu he took pom and hayley from them too and it was worth it,2023-07-12
"idk the the entity was too much of a shark jumping moment even and yes especially for a franchise like mission impossible 

the charm to me personally has always been how real the movies felt while still being a movie its why tom cruise doing his own stunts is so  special for a good 90 of each movie elements are there to really absorb me and keep me and to me thats largely due to the realism 

call it nitpicky ill acknowledge thats what is but every 10 minutes i kept asking myself how tf is this movie even happening an ai that level could and would do hundreds of different things and ethan hunt and his team wouldnt even be able to blink in response none of that is transferred into tension because they only use the power like what twice its an ai emotion wouldnt factor into anything if its so afraid of ethan missile strike him and be done with it 

absolutely everything the team used should have been analog benji using a self driving car was laughable and maybe im just salty but fast x was more believable just took me out of the movie way too many times like i get humans are useful to it but why keep the one guy who knows what the key unlocks alive use literally any other person its an ai cockiness is not a reason 

sorry nitpicky rant over",2023-07-12
i live in turkey and wanna watch the new mission impossible movie in best experience i heard that movie was shot on imax cameras but the ratio is same with a normal movie is it true i think i am going to enjoy 4dxdbox but people say its for just fun and you cant focus to the movie but i heard them saying movies like top gunmaverick are so good in 4dx also i heard them saying 4dx is following the movie but dbox is experiencing the movie i love to try all formats for specific movies what would you recommend me to watch that movie also there is a huge imax screen near me even movie does not expand and keeps same ratio all it can be good experience so which format i should go thanks,2023-07-12

"as a die hard brian de palma fan i really loved this money there are flourishes and touches all over that feel like a love letter to mi1

that said the plot is a bit goofy the quick flashback had me thinking i’d missed a scene or villain in an early mi movie the ai villain while well done always gets a bit of an eye roll from me and i adore rebecca ferguson so seeing her bow out was a bummer though i thought they did a wonderful job foreshadowing it 

some of the set pieces were incredible the airport scene felt straight out of mi1 the chase scene in rome was funny and exhilarating the club scene did a good job setting the stage and the train stuff… wooo 

this movie builds in a way i wasn’t ready it did not drag for a single second still the undisputed king of franchise entertainment",2023-07-12

what i think some people might be overlooking about ilsas death is the entity already knows who is going to die the choice put to ethan isnt real because he was never in position to make one they sideline him while both women come to gabriel and if had wanted to  grace he had plenty of opportunity so ilsas death was part of the plan because as we learn later from luther her death could have knocked ethans focus off the mission and caused him to seek revenge the entity wants to protect itself and ethan is the biggest threat so by killing ilsa it has the best chance of survival,2023-07-12
i do wonder if the entitys creator will be the true mastermind that will be revealed in part 2  someone who knows the ins and outs of how it works and using it to manipulate others,2023-07-12
"can someone help me clarify

1 where did the second half of the key come from one was from ilsa thats clear the other one came from an unknown character that was killed at the airport then that was revealed to be fake then turns out alanna had the other key then why would she hire grace to get a fake 
2 what is gabriels motivations to work for the ai as he doesnt seem like the money type and the ai was willing to let him die as well according to luther and yet he had a backup plan the truck also it is revealed that gabriel does not know what the key is for the corrupt cia director had to explain it to him so it doesnt explain why he would work for the ai despite not knowing what the key is for etc",2023-07-12

really enjoyed this the enemy and problem was probably the scariest and most realistic in our current context that being said despite the film’s efforts to link it all to ethan’s past this was the least emotionally compelling situation for ethan so far imo the stakes were high but it didn’t pull my heart strings as much as previous films in the series i also hated that ninja girl i just didn’t buy her character at all loved the way the team came together though luther in particular really stood out in this one i also enjoyed watching the “making” of a new imf member we’ve never seen that before so that was cool there were some  moments that felt contrived to make the plot work and stretch out the story but overall it was really action packed with some cool sequences that car chase with the yellow fiat made me laugh out loud  that was awesome i honestly don’t think there is a bad mi film i know people hate the second one but i still watch it this one wasn’t the best in the series but it was  good and engaging 8510,2023-07-12

"one thing that struck me watching it was how similar some of it was to for your eyes only  starts with a ship sinking with a tech device on it that everyone wants which sends everyone on a wild goose chase after it 

bond  hunt meets up with a mysterious but deadly woman and they escape in a car chase in a tiny yellow car used for comedy effect etc this felt like an absolute nod to the iconic bond chase

"felt a bit overlong too many antagonistic forces 15 too goofy and i think the plot itself specifically the villain and his relationship with ethan and the mcguffin was convoluted as  all 

having said that great music great visuals a bunch of great set pieces that car chase the sandstorm fight the small alley way the train great characters 

just a shame because of how tight of a movie fallout was this felt a bit sloppy and i think the plot went 15 too  for some of my investment",2023-07-13

i have some gripes with this movie but it was still pretty good once again though while the musical score is not bad i didnt really care for it it feels too zimmerlite to me and im tired of that sound giacchinos music was so much better,2023-07-13
"i liked it not as airtight as the previous two entries but still darn good some thoughts in no particular order

 score was topnotch

 every character was utilized properly and some even get compelling character arcs i bring this up specifically because previous films were more concerned with plot rather than with character development which is fine but its even better if you manage to have both im impressed at how excellently they pulled that off considering how stacked the cast is everybody got to do something and just the right amount for each

 grace almost steals the entire movie i thought she was just going to be another onenote femme fatale but her character has her own arc and development even more so than ethan shes pretty much the coprotagonist of this film and hayley atwell dang i didnt get it before but boy do i get now

 wasnt too keen initially on the idea of an ai being the villain because weve seen it a thousand times before but i did enjoy how paranoid it made things i thought the line from the trailer truth is vanishing was just an empty phrase to generate hype but they ended up integrating it into the plot quite neatly still feels like they couldve done more with it though the climax of rogue nation was all about outsmarting your enemy the climax of this one boils down to an action sequence which is utterly incredible granted but not as much 4d chess 

 pacing was off at times particularly during the first act the ilsa death fakeout wasnt necessary especially when we saw her in future sequences in the trailer and they even reveal shes alive almost immediately after some exposition also couldve been shaved off there were moments when we the audience were being told information we had just heard from another character

 gabriel was all right but thats because i liked esai morales performance and not so much his writing the way hes constructed as ethans nemesis because he killed someone we dont know and therefore dont care about from his past wasnt needed its just trying too hard to make me feel something by adding a tragic backstory seven installments into the franchise just stick to him killing ilsa thats all you need to have him be ethans target of rage and even more importantly ours

 ethan and graces train escape was outrageously intense i loved it i knew they wouldnt die but i sure felt like they could just marvelous

overall another hit in this saga im excited for the next one",2023-07-13
"great movie not as good as fallout or rogue nation

one thing that baffled me though is that they never explained why grace didnt need colored contacts when she impersonated the white widow even her brother didnt notice

it looked really weird

other than that i cant wait for part 2",2023-07-13
"its good yeah but i honestly think that none of the mission impossible films are as lean and tight as rogue nation the introduction of ilsa the full formation of the team and every action scene pulled to its full potential and never overstaying its welcome

this new film feels like each fight scene  whilst masterfully suspenseful  is drawn too out and not as compacted as it could be",2023-07-13
i  loved it  my initial reaction really is that it could be better than fallout i’m seeing it again on thursday so we’ll see how i feel later in the week   but talk about an insanely exhilarating zany funny emotional ride  loved ai as the villain  atwell was great but goddamnit i hated that they killed ilsa   kittridge was awesome  i’m eager to learn more about gabriel  this was just a ton of fun  i had a blast  what a ride,2023-07-13
guys i want to ask something the movie is great by the way but just a small big detail about the scene where haley’s grace puts on the mask of white widows why they left her eyes brown alanna’s eyes are blue it was the first thing that came to my mind i was like okay kittridge only saw her when she was little so it’s logical that he doesn’t remember the color of her eyes but her own brother looking her in the eyes and not making that something was off it was indeed a bit off putting what’s your opinion i waited for them to touch on it but nothing came up,2023-07-13

the last third  fun but not as fun as the first  the drama in the train was interesting but the parts with benji trying to get ethan onto the train didnt feel like they had any stakes their dialogue was amusing but neither felt in any immediate danger and the big stunt didnt feel all that important

overall i felt it was entertaining but for me it was no ghost protocol or rogue nation  so many scenes felt like callbacks to the first mission impossible film

also strangely many scenes paralleled indiana jones and the dial of destiny",2023-07-13

all they need to say in the film is we are using falcon encryption and they can still use their high tech gadgetry",2023-07-13

i think my biggest issue is the villain side of things the entity is an interesting concept i’d more say my issue is with gabriel not nearly on the level of lane and lark unsure of his motivations is he even human just not sure what the helmet thing was all about yet they have flashbacks of him but my thoughts are the entity knew ethan would be the one coming for it so it created gabriel to stop him my thoughts could change after the next one or a repeated viewing",2023-07-14

the ai must have come to the conclusion that not one single superpower nation can be trusted with its overwhelming power whether it be the us government or russian
the ai did not go rogue as us government suspects

the ai entity with its access to the secret files of imf and other organisations predicted ethan hunt to be the best choice in handing over its control and responsible use

the ai entity wasn’t sure of its choice even with its 99 prediction algorithms so it decided to test ethan

the ai entity gave pseudo control to a random villain from ethan’s past to see how ethan would behave against someone who took everything away from him 

would ethan let person vengeance overcome the mission or would he let the dutiful mission take priority in the movie ethan let his personal vengeance take control over him as he almost killed gabriel and let it jeopardise the mission so did ethan fail in the eyes of ai 

if there were no responsible inheritors for ai entity’s safe keeping it would probably need to self destruct as to make sure no wrong organisation gains control of it and it’s power

but this choice would be a waste as us government will build a new one in a few years so it can’t leave humanity with the risk of another ai actually going rogue

the vague introduction of gabriel a random villain from ethan’s past is what making me believe this theory as the writers had no reason to make the overall plot of mission impossible franchise weak by introducing a random and forced villain from ethan’s past unless the ai entity required gabriel to test ethan’s priorities",2023-07-14

"well  pretty excited for the grand finale then 

the thing about the entitys predictions which were apparently all based on 100 probabilitylikelihood and gabriel random takes on someone in the room was  ok it kind of bordered on the spirale of selffulfilling prophecies here and there kind of expected gabriel to go ha jinxed it no taksies backsies at some points

the romantic blue balls with ilsa what were they for also ilsa being in the midst of it all again showed that mi is a fun action thriller franchise of epic proportions with fun gadgets and lots of awesome stuff but not drama or  rich and good deep character building because if it were how sad and onedimensional would their lives be right while life happened elsewhere ethan chilled in empty lofts warehouses ilsa also said bye but then she just bounced and did her thing but kind of popped back in because of the aitm problem like do they simply not  you know  with other people or do they go on a literal dry spell for months years and then  recognize each other in the  desert because of morse signaling whatever it was fine but ilsa could have gotten around in full this time or not but unfortunately she got too edgy against the dark machine lord

the panicky circle spinning with the yellow gadget car was hilarious and so many other scenes as well the teams chemistry is really good but lets be honest tom cruise is getting a bit older with ving rhames it is a bit more noticeable  but they are just so great together",2023-07-16

"tracking the key

ok i know its a mission impossible movie and there are plot holes and some things arent explained that you just roll with but im sure im not alone in getting lost with the key the only thing i know is that both halves were on the sub at the beginning and with ethan at the end some things i kind of remember

i think denlinger said the bodies were retrieved from the ice so at least they mentioned how the halves were around in the first place there was something about ilsa getting her half in istanbul i have no idea who the dude in abu dhabi was other than they thought he had what i guess was the other half whats really throwing me off is something luther said about that one being the wrong alloy and a fake if it was fake how did it have the radioactive signature regardless i remember grace left the airport having taken one from ethan when he was distracted by benji and the bomb was that not the one from the airport guy but actually ilsas half that i guess ethan had on him and was that the only reason for the whole airport shenanigans because the other half was already in their possession i guess them being alanna they didnt get their hands on this other half because grace gave it to the middleaged dude on the plane then not shown met up with him after escaping at the party grace put a half in zolas pocket then took it back she had it when gabriel fought her and then ilsa and i was thinking why didnt he take it from her did she run off during the fight and hide then come back when she saw ethan arrive or did gabirel have a reason to leave it so that the train events as predicted by the entity could happen i cant even remember where and how both halves came together but at the end kittridge finalized buying the whole thing from grace as alanna then grace took it back again she had it when ethan crash landed in the train car it got knocked around gabriel took it and ethan got it back during their fight

sorry that was a lot of rambling i know but if anyone has a full accounting of both halves throughout the film id love to see it thanks

ps loved the movie cant wait to see it again but that wont be till its on bluray",2023-07-18
"i am confused about the scene of denlinger cary elwes and gabriel meet up since he is the only one who know everything about the entity and the submarine plus eventually he will get the key as he says the key exchange is under progress certainly he can do whatever he want afterward it seems like there is no benefit to meet gabriel who is the entity messenger

does anyone have clue that what is the purpose of this meet up",2023-07-18
like a lot of people i still like fallout and maybe ghost protocol more but this was another blast of a theatrical experience from tom cruise and christopher mcquarrie and with all the cliffhangers that i saw in the last few months this one actually felt justified and complete can’t wait for part 2 obviously but also what this duo will do beyond mi,2023-07-18

"ive never had more to say about a movie than this one
it was certainly not a mission impossible movie it was john wick meets fast  furious meets writers strike action writing as this is a two parter formerly the ending of the series the stakes are null in that you know more is coming everything this movie does is not a black  white it did this bad but it did this good nor was it a failure of an execution of an idea
• nor was it nearly there the dialogue was either superficial or too much expositional tell dont show
the movie itself was too loud and it used so much music instead of dialogue i couldnt help but think it was over or that we had reached a stopping point or as an audience member i had to care more or less than i did at the moment the villains were too villainy
scenes were too long while others appropriately i edited stuff we didnt need to see in a single shot however the camera work while steady was i just completed my first year in film school bad our i protagonists were heavily protected by plot  perspective necessity points for practical effects 
• stunts as this attempted to keep me immersed • wouldve been successful had it not been for the rest i of the movies qualities  decisions hayley  pom  stole the show as the story was leveraged through the formers perspective

huge blockbuster charactertrope pitfalls
•typical clepto archetype
•typical goon change of heart archetype
•typical foil archetype
•typical bossiscorrupt trope
•typical bad cop trope",2023-07-19
having an ai villain is a double edged sword because it has all the powers a normal human shouldnt and plot holes because of human behaviorerror are unacceptable if it was so scared of the sevastopol sub then why didnt gabriel obtain one half of the key and destroy it instantly to lock out all the interested parties he could have done that after killing ilsa and knocking out grace and searching her but nope he just left her there with the key it banked on human emotions which is extremely unreliable it was counting on grace being a greedy person to sell the key and unite the two halves,2023-07-19
i’m confused why is the source code of the ai on the russian sub didn’t cary elwes say that america built the ai and used it to hack the sub shouldn’t the source code for the ai be like under the pentagon or something then,2023-07-19
i enjoyed it the plot reminded me a lot of daemon and person of interest although i like person of interests take on representing an ai better showing the ai as omnipresent entity that can influence everything everywherelike with the phone stations in poi is better and more intimidating than showing a sauron eye,2023-07-19

"some rougue ai was the logical conclusion to the ever increasing threat level of villains i mean what can top off an entity that knows and controls anything digital unfortunately the execution of ai was flat you have something that can control all electronics infrastructure traffic etc but it seems to operate mostly through a guy and his henchwoman it should have been the case where ethan cant get any tech support because it can get hacked go anywhere near cctv because he will be identified etc in the end we got a villain that sometimes decides to hack comms i understand that premise is mostly to make a villain scary and that the plot will be bent more towards entertainment but i think it was too much for my sense of disbelief  


they should have given a handicap to the ai maybe give a timer until it gets access to nukes so imf has to race against time or make ai like ultron robot with a character who may not do most efficient or logical step for personal amusement",2023-08-11

"the film is a real thrill and it draws me on i could not stop thinking about it even now which is a month after i have watched it i think that it is one of if not the best of the mission impossible movies yet frankly at one point i was even confused about the whereabouts of the key until one of the users here helped me clear the clues thanks

however i feel the urge to say that in my opinion there is one flaw in the story which should be addressed namely that the ending where ethan appears to gain the upper hand and to have eluded gabriel and the entity somewhat undermines the impression of an allpowerful intelligence established by the beginning of the film i could think of two possibilities which might explain the fact that ethan got the keys by the end 

1 the entity never intended that gabriel should possess them and instead has a plan which it hides even from gabriel in which case the menacing sensation given by the union of the entity and gabriel would be diminished
2 ilsa is still alive in secret unbeknownst to the entity therefore resulting in an error in its calculations in which case the immensity of the entity intellect would be diminished

either case the threat posed by the villains of the film which should take two parts instead of one to resolve would be somewhat compromised personally speaking i would have expected ethans team to be outsmarted and overwhelmed by defeat by the end of part one which seems to be within the capability of the entity who as gabriel has put subtly manipulating the minds of billions and therefore should have dwarfed ethans intellect which as powerful as it is is after all only a human intellect and not as unfathomable as that of the entity part one should serve as a learning opportunity for ethans team to discover some sort of achilles heel of the entity and gabriel but i would think that the exploit of the said heel should transpire in an unexpected manner in part two instead

but these are just my personal opinions and some of my interpretations could very well be wrong",2023-08-20

finally got to catch this in theaters after they had terrible showtime options for so long i am all in on the ilsa is still alive theory because otherwise they just killed her off super fast and dirty  luther telling grace shes the reason youre still alive was also a fun wordplay that makes me think they somehow faked something  maybe someone else was wearing an ilsa mask with the magical mask making machine had her organs moved to the right side right before the fight mi has had all sorts of wild ways to get around these things before wouldnt surprise me now if they could fake it,2023-08-28

"i actually think the ai has gained sentient and after hacking every major organization and learning everything about humanity it actually realizes that it must be destroyed because it will be end of the world if anyone or any country gain control of it thats why i actually think everything the ai is doing is actually trying to lead ethan to its core source code so ethan can destroy it 

for example what gabriel did yo tipof pom makes no sense its as if they wanted pom to turn to ethan 

also the ai could have ethan eliminated multiple times why leave him alive also if the ai is trying to avoid being controlled or destroyed then destroy the key or leave it undiscovered is much better than sending gabriel 

so i think the ai will actually be revealed at the end to be seeking self destruction and it knows ethan is the obey oen that wants to destroy it instead of controlling it",2023-08-29

"in a show called person of interest i remember one episode where some main characters got killed off one by one by the bad guys only that they were simulations done by an ai calculating the optimal route of escape for said characters iirc the episode in the later part featured a few more different simulations wherein theyre still getting killed off with no favourable outcome these said simulations were but happening in some few seconds if not milliseconds with that being said it came off as a shock at first that some well liked characters got killed before knowing that it was actually a simulation

i wonder if the second part of death reckoning is gonna be taking this approach the first part from a certain point became a simulation run by the ai and would lead to hunts teams victory in the second part the second part would see the return of ilsa and do an explanation montage of how it was all actually a simulation only for the ai to conclude that the simulation was only the best possible outcome for the bad guys team for them to get as close to winning but still ended up losing to hunts team

this would be a bad approach imo",2023-09-07

scientology scientology has cruise believing he actually is ethan hunt with spy superpowers the dialogue and the chemistry of the team has become cringe inducing luther and benji have become irritants it’s time to bring in fresh faces and go off in new directions then the predictable and hopefully i won’t have to see cruise running in a movie again",2023-12-18

he tells her to stay dead and  to run as far as you can earlier in the movie they carefully avoid all details of her death afterwards and shes very obtusely grieved for a short period of time with no mention of it later even when the other characters mention it and grieve openly grace the same way he avoided it when they faked julias death and she was mentioned directly by other characters in ghost protocol jane


what better way to trick the entity than by allowing it to believe something happened that didnt youre telling me the key to its entire plan was the death of one of the women and it justhappened 


we know grace isnt aware but luther likely is since hes going off grid to work out the bits of the entitys code somewhere where the entity cant find him a perfect place to rendezvous with another person who doesnt wish to be seen by an allcalculating digital enemy i imagine both will show up together three quarters of the way through the second movie

1 the exposition dump at the start in the office before ethan reveals himself was ridiculous did the in movie folk plan out beforehand that they were going to take it line by line to tell the director everything “ok so i’ve got “…” and you’ve got “…” but then i get to drop the line “…” yeah we good”

2 why does ethan care about grace other than the key she’s nothing to him other than someone he’s helped out yes he’s a good person overall but the lengths he goes to to make sure she’s ok over others is bizarre 

3 i’m bored of maguffins in films the key the key she has it they have it they don’t have it now i’ve got it now you’ve got it if this ai so all encompassing then why can’ just print out the key for its ‘messiah’ 

4 so gabriel not only perfectly timed ethan from being stopped from slitting his throat him standing up and the truck being in place he also was able to perfectly fall into said truck without an issue

5 the end some great cinema",2024-02-14
"just watched this i like this one mostly because of my fear of heights

it was tough watching the burj khalifa scene in ghost protocol but  that train scene

i enjoy any movie that can invoke any sense of fearanxiety that affects me physically while im simply watching a movie

ive been a lifelong horror fan looking for that terror but they fail but this movie did the job thumbs up imo",2024-02-16
mantisto psycho mantis,2023-07-12
it’s so fun to watch her as paris go  wild and hellbent at during the rome chase scene she’s enjoying the  out of the mayhem and chaos going on,2023-07-12
she is incredible i never expected mantis to be so intimidating,2023-07-12
so beautiful too love that white makeup mask with the black tear,2023-07-13
i couldn’t help but laugh from my gut when she got to show just how much of a badass she is  that shot of her cacklinglaughing as she’s chasing ethan  grace in rome was fantastic  ,2023-07-13
she was the best part of the movie for me,2023-07-13
she definitively awoke something in me this film,2023-07-14
oh wow that was the same actor,2023-07-13
" you there is no way that was mantis

geez what an actor",2023-07-13
she matched jason momoa energy on fast x it was great seeing her out of the gotg movies,2023-07-14
she played a similar role in the far  westworld season 3 where she was muscle for a suave salt and pepper haired bad guy doing the bidding for a superintelligent ai this movie felt like an apology for that as well as to esai morales for how underused he was in ozark,2023-07-15
reminded me of her character in oldboy,2023-07-13
i was blown away  i looked her up when i got home  i cant believe that was the same actress,2023-07-15
"loved her 

is it just me or did she look like harley quinn during the venice scenes",2023-07-15
she needed more lines though felt she barely spoke until the deathfake death,2023-07-13
i cannot believe she is 37 though looks 27,2023-07-14
she reminded me of the death dealer in shang chi badass few words but stole every scene,2023-07-15
honestly i loved pom in this easily one of the best characters in this film and she did such a great job,2023-07-16
that was mantis,2023-07-20
so glad she survived,2023-07-15
holy  thats the same actor shes really good,2023-07-16
she could beat me with a pipe and i’d thank her for it,2023-07-17
my femme presenting enby  was devouring those outfits my ,2023-07-23
wait really i thought she was a kpop idol doing a guest appearance lol i never knew how badass she could look like outside of marvel,2023-07-21
playing the compulsory harley quinn character that these ensemble films need to have these days,2023-07-13
"she was amazing i cant believe they expected me to care about this boring nothing of a villain when she was in the same movie being awesome in every scene

and she had the best outfits",2023-07-19
also pom klementieff is a very fun name to say,2023-07-27
it was a character extremely similar to ares from john wick 3 badass villainous mysterious sidekick with good heart,2023-07-14
i legit thought that was karen fukuhara katana from suicide squad at first,2023-07-16
i knew i recognized her but couldnt place her until the drive home when i could look at my phone without bothering movie patrons,2023-07-23
funny enough she was more similar to comics mantis here than in gotg,2023-07-31
that was her i had no idea,2023-07-14
she could be amazing as harley quinn,2023-07-19
anyone get t1000 vibes from her she was a force of nature,2023-07-19
is she a martial artist of any kind looked pretty athletic or just has a really great stunt woman,2023-07-23
again my problem is that small petite women in movies nowadays stand a chance in a fight with very fit men its ridiculous  she got her head smashed three times on the wall of bricks got up got smashed twice more and only then she was out they treated that metal pipe like its a lightsaber or something,2023-07-19
"i was thinking that until she started fighting especially in that alley scene with hunt the way she was screeching as she swung the pipe felt extremely mantislike

her design feels like mantis meets harley quinn and im all for it really hoping to see her in part 2 kicking gabriels ",2023-07-23
that’s who it was i couldn’t figure out who,2023-07-16
alright everyone put on your mean faces,2023-07-18
shes so badass i wish she didnt die but that was one of the best twists she could easily  ethan off in that tiny alleyway she was a much better barehands killing machine and was also moments ahead of it driving a better killing machine versus the cutie yellow fiat,2023-07-22
anyone know what kind of car she was driving during the venice chase,2023-07-28
not really made little to no sense whatsoever,2023-08-02
holy  did not realize that was her,2023-08-10
i didnt know she was feench i thought she had a made up actress name until i realize she is french,2023-08-29
his whole not trusting anyone by pulling their face had me laughing every time,2023-07-15
i laughed when he said theyre always going rogue in the most red forman way ever like he was one step away from telling the team theyre  gonna get his foot in their ,2023-07-14
what was his deal with ethan  ethan clearly recognized him,2023-07-13
is it just me of does whigham play the same type of character in every movie he’s in constantly chasing the protagonist but never succeeding,2023-07-14
they implied he had some personal grudge against ethan and ethan seemed to recognize him when they finally came face to face all i could think was that he might be ethan’s protégé’s who died father in mission impossible 3,2023-07-16
man remember when mission impossible meant impeccably planned heists pulled off without a hitch by a team of parttime spies with diverse specialties,2023-07-19
hes far and away my favorite hey its that guy actor of current times,2023-07-20
i just started binging  boardwalk empire and recognized him  he expressions had me cracking up i think his partner is definitely joining hunts team,2023-07-16
hes in kong skull island with the same look  attitude dammit did a giant ape just  half our plattoon yep,2023-08-07
walmart steve zahn,2023-07-14
i imagine his backstory is that it’s his team that always has to chase ethans team every time they go rogue the last several movies and he’s just so annoyed they never catch him and he gets off free in the end each time,2023-08-16
is this guy typecast to be a fbi agent supporting role i also recall him in fast and furious narcos non stop etc,2023-07-20
"i mightve missed it but how the heck did they know where to show up next 

they go straight to the airport to rome  to the party in venice to the train how with what intel",2023-07-20
these two could have been cut completely out of the film and it wouldn’t have changed it a a bit but we’d get back 20 full minutes,2023-07-19
"finally it gets a mention  

our theater cracked up laughing at the end of that whole scene 

“how do you plan on leaving here”   
ethan putting on his face   
shoots him with dart 
“ohh” like of course ",2023-07-15
your mission should you choose to accept it is fight inflation,2023-07-15
finally i can’t help but chuckle every time they say imf and they finally acknowledge it haha,2023-07-16
watched it in dc all the imf and world bankers loved that they were finally mentioned…,2023-07-18
"but when he does reveal what imf stands for i actually laughed at the theater at how comically bad it is lol

 impossible mission force

wow",2023-07-24
they mentioned the other imf before like three movies ago,2023-07-27
this whole thing was so awesome it actually got me hooked in the movie since then,2024-02-03
i would too,2023-07-12
i was hoping hed stay with eye patch ilsa in the forest and have the kind of post metal gear life big boss deserved,2023-07-14
it was hard to tell to what extent he was chasing her out of attraction or because of her usefulness to the mission,2023-07-14
" he spent like 2 hours chasing grace lol

and just like captain america he could do it all day",2023-07-15
the entire time i was waiting for her to say her name isnt actually grace,2023-07-16
reminded me of dial of destiny in a way but better executed,2023-07-16
worth it,2023-07-16
anything to save his secret daughter,2023-08-04
try to get his title back from kate winslet,2023-07-12
100 the first trailer for dead reckoning shows somebody presumably ethan swimming under the ice where the sevastapol submarine crew floats up after being killed by their own torpedo you can even see a hand on the topleft of the frame this scene is not in the movie at all,2023-07-12
i’m not sure what’s left for him to do at this point…maybe take a hard kick straight to the nuts and keep fighting,2023-07-12
tom please dont get on any carbon fiber submersibles,2023-07-13
in the arctic no less  no way,2023-07-12
unfortunate timing that the next one will undoubtedly involve going through the wreckage of a submarine,2023-07-12
they’re just gonna keep trying to top fast and furious already did with the rome chase scene next one will be doing the submarine scene better lol,2023-07-12
there were a lot of callbacks in this one i’d expect that to continue,2023-07-13
space man,2023-07-13
rumors say hes training with david blaine as we speak,2023-07-13
"its like 700 meters down you need a dedicated sub for that 

the world record for a human dive is only about a thousand feet and that took an entire day due to decompression",2023-07-21
very likely and also very scary and dangerous,2023-07-14
without ilsa there to save him,2023-07-30
well they already revisited sandstorm shenanigans so why not,2023-07-28
theres gonna be a titanic scene where rose lets go of jack but then jack resurfaces later with the entity source code and be like gotcha btch,2023-10-21
if that’s the case i really hope they do it in one shot with no cgi when he did the breath holding thing before there were so many cuts he basically didn’t even need to,2023-07-13
i hope the whole movie is under the sea under the seaa a real sub mission impossible,2023-08-07
its so funny that we just expect him to dive in that submarine without any gear or oxygen assistance because if he had all those things then it would just be called mission entirely possible ,2023-10-19
"i’ll be honest that made me laugh like is the ai setting up the catering those dope lights dancers and the dj 

kind of got me a little on team entity dude knows how to party",2023-07-15
it took me too long to get it was a play on words on party,2023-07-12
"suspicious glance at background

background becomes ai

very much a manbehindthecurtain moment",2023-07-13
random thought why do so many spyaction movies have scenes that take place at european rave parties,2023-07-17
tom doing the krabs meme trying to understand that he was in the computer is still cracking me up,2023-07-15
this was terrible entire “entity” felt incredibly lazy and sort of corny every time they said “entity” i lol’ed just gimme a bad guy,2023-07-19
"i actually found that scene oddly paced and kind of cringe   i get what we were supposed to feel during that moment but it just felt silly to me


the sound design like it was breathing or something like okay i get it its the ai on all of the screens and its  alive  ohhh

okay cool  it just looked like a fancy screen saver  but okay threatening i guess

then the scene went on and on and the rotating shot around ethan as he slowly realizes what we all already figured out  ugh

to me that was just awful",2023-07-14
i found that part a bit too silly tbh why would the ai visually be a circle that decides to show itself on the screen,2023-07-15
"did you notice that not once in the movie did they refer to it as ai in the beginning director of national intelligence’s office they used technical jargon and then eventually started calling it ‘the entity’ 

they totally avoided the ai terminology",2023-07-19
"maybe the third party is the third party app

woah dude",2023-07-17
i thought he meant it was watching them via cameras in the club and it saw grace put the key in the goon’s pocket but nah,2023-07-16
that couldnt have been a better play on words even if it was a theatre production set on a stage carved into the shape of 5 letters of the alphabet,2023-07-15
theyre gonna bring vin diesel and the family get cipher to crack the source code and destroy the satellites with cars the end,2023-10-21
"ohhhhh it was voice banking him  

clever girl ",2023-07-15
oh is that what happened totally missed that,2023-07-16
oh dang nice i thought it was just trying to collect information on him to build a profile on him which it probably still did but that’s a good catch,2023-07-16
kinda like that scene in miii where tom cruise makes his target read a bunch of random sentences at gunpoint lol,2023-07-19
he got owen davian’d,2023-07-16
"he didnt even need to do that

the entity could just spy on his communications with ethan and emulate his voice",2023-07-27
i thought this was silly personally didnt the entity already control everything on a network ever why would they need new voice data they have everything he ever said into any device,2023-07-24
wow not even sure i would’ve caught that on a second viewing well done,2023-07-17
"that whole scene im just like wait they were expecting benji to be there which means its gotta just be a diversion

obvious in hindsight but if theyd thought about it for a second they would known to just walk away",2023-07-17
ohhhhhh i didnt even realise thats what happened,2023-07-20
"i was surprised that he didnt pick up on that in the moment you know what youre up against you even quickly determined that its trying to profile you how do you not realize whats really happening here

my voice is my passport verify me

the nuclear symbol also felt too contrived like they just automatically believe that its going too hard which makes it feel like a lie",2023-07-19
 good catch i thought it was just trying to learn about him not also recording his voice,2023-07-22
nah i dont think thats true  the entity is seemingly all powerful and wouldnt have needed him to speak into the device to get a voice print  theyre already using like a million more words and phrases on open comms for free unsuspecting over the air,2023-08-11
great insight forgot about that particularly the fact that there was no bomb but that was definitely a chekhovs gun,2023-07-26
"what was the line cruise said again middle aged man whose probably been waiting his entire life to be noticed by a woman like you 

im not middle aged yet but i felt that one",2023-07-12
"doesnt she go meet up with him to retrieve the key after leaving hunt in the car in the train tunnel

who knows what happened

or maybe im misremembering who had what at that point",2023-07-12
tom cruise,2023-07-12
i’m still holding out,2023-07-23
"i feel like that bike jump fell a tad flat mainly due to how much cgi is neededunderstably to cover up the ramp and even replace the bike wheels to add little bumps in the suspension same goes for the train which was real the water it crashes into is cgi or heavily adjusted in comp

x200b

still absolutely loved the sequence",2023-07-12
especially the escape from the falling train cars my  was that perfect,2023-07-13
i went into the movie blind and the bike jump was  breathtaking mostly because i knew that was tom cruise actually doing that ,2023-07-12
"the crazy thing to me was that the bike jump off the cliff almost felt incidental in the end it was an awesome stunt but between the hype it’s received and how invested i was in what was happening on the train it felt like they just threw it in for the heck of it

to be clear i mean this as a compliment they need to find a way to get ethan on the train so achieve that simple narrative task via one of the best stunts ever loved it",2023-07-12
the train sequence was a million times better imo not to take away from how much balls cruise has to have in order to do that stunt irl but i saw it enough times in previews to become pretty numb to the thrill of it and realize that all it is is base jumping he just jumped off a cliff and parachuted to his location anybody can do that while on vacation nerve wracking but not exactly as big a thrilling action sequence as say holding onto a plane as it takes off or climbing and leaping from car to car as a train slowly tumbles off a blown up bridge thats way too rad to do on vacay,2023-07-12
id watch 2 hours of tom cruise and haley atwell climbing through different train cars this ones got a grill this one a grand piano what next,2023-07-15
"i do think the fully cgi objects needed more work

i’m assuming the practical versions didn’t look good on camera",2023-07-12
the bike jump was pointless he couldn’t just pull up to the side and jump in he has a bike simon pegg was driving along it most the time too   he was better off just jumping off from atop the bridge onto the train like that one girl,2023-07-12
chris mcq has for sure played the uncharted games lots of 2lost legacy vibes,2023-07-14
i saw this in dbox where the seats vibratemove along to the action and the train sequence was absolutely bat  intense i was fully gripping the arm rests at some points and thought i was going to fly off the chair literally i was losing my  so much fun,2023-07-14
agreed that was just one spectacular stunt after another,2023-07-12
the train sequence just kept going and it was so intense i was on the edge of my seat the whole time my heart was still pounding an hour after id left the theater it was so good and im glad they didnt linger on it much in the marketing,2023-07-15
there were a few moments through that train sequence that immediately transported me to uncharted 2,2023-07-16
the bike jump just wasnt thrilling not sure if its because we got to see it so many times in the behind the scenes or because of poor editing cannot say if it even was poorly edited but the behind the scenes footage felt much more enthralling to me the train sequence was incredible and im glad i didnt get to see too much of that prior to catching this in theatres,2023-07-12
"i honestly thought the bike jump was incredibly useless like i was not impressed by it at all the bts of it was so incredible but what made it into the film didn’t feel worthwhile 

but you’re right the train sequence especially the very last part was breathtaking",2023-07-12
i think the train sequence might be my favorite stunt sequence from the entire series it was awesome and im so grateful that i knew nothing about it going in,2023-07-15
felt like an homage to buster keaton the original king of crazy stunts,2023-07-14
definitely the best train sequence set in austria which ends in a bridge blowing up ive seen this month,2023-07-15
i was all hohum about the movie til the train sequence  had to catch my breath when it was done,2023-07-17
the kilotons of promo that paramount dropped on yt these past months ruined the bike jump for me it killed the magic i was surely impressed by the performance but i was no longer watching a movie but as soon as soon crashed the party in the train i was back in,2023-07-17
felt like uncharted 2 in live action in the best way possible,2023-07-19
i was kind of bored until they got the train they went overboard with cruise running imo the train was incredible,2023-07-15
train was better than bike for sure,2023-07-15
bro i almost wanted to play uncharted 2 again after watching that,2023-07-18
i honestly didnt love either sequence bike jump sequence was too short and the cgi ramp cover was obvious train sequence was obviously mostly cg and a lot of it was not very well done cg,2023-07-14
the entire train sequence is why i love the mi series thats what i pay money for,2023-07-22
that train crawl had me on the edge of my seat for real,2023-07-28
my whole theater laughed like how many train cars we doing this for wasnt impressive and didnt land,2023-07-19
man i thought it was cg well done until i found out on youtube its a real frigging train,2023-08-20
"the bike jump was fine although it was hyped so much and shown so many times in the ads it was a bit underwhelming it kinda shows how real life is less interesting than hollywood effects it was… fine 

the train sequence was not really that special since i’ve basically seen that exact same scenario played out in multiple media franchises already uncharted 2 among thieves game from 2010 and the tomb raider movie in 2018 after a while it’s kinda uninteresting to see the same scenario play out with minor differences",2023-10-13
train scene was dope as  but was ripped straight out of uncharted 2  which i don’t really have a problem with except the director swore he had never seen the game before which set off my bs detector hard a few shots are lifted directly from the game,2024-01-25
"im late to this thread but it annoyed me how ethan and grace got extremely lucky not once but twice by landing exactly in the wagon saving the life of grace and then the second time when his parachute caught wind and made him knock out the second guy its not like he could possibly see well inside the rapidlymoving train and pick where he would enter all this going fast enough side way to break the window

like is this guy jar jar hunt",2024-03-03
i like how he cant decide what the best way to nonchalantly hold the steering wheel is,2023-07-12
the car tumbling over and they wind up switched places was perfect,2023-07-14
i love how forgiving he is to grace who just left him to die in the path of a moving train,2023-07-15
it was terrific but i think they missed a trick not having him then have to fight a few guys with the steering wheel,2023-07-13
in the imax poster you can see him still handcuffed to the wheel on his left hand,2023-07-13
i wonder how much influence jackie chan has had on cruise or the stunt team because i saw much resemblance,2023-07-18
the performance joke with the beetle was pretty funny,2023-08-06
i loved the one guy never trusting anyone’s face and pulling on all of them,2024-01-25
it was so predictable too as soon as i saw her i knew it was a wrap for ilsa they are starting to get like danial craig’s bond movies the way they are rotating his love interests in and out lol,2023-07-24
"for 3 i liked the abrupt cuts to the dirt bike they were hilarious not sure if that’s the intention or not but yeah i lol’d at a couple 

especially loved ethan being like “don’t worry i’ll be there” then some tense convo in between and then the next scene is just “i missed the train” i just liked that we were expecting him to do something crazy to subvert gabriel’s move but the movie was like “nah not yet baby” it was like comedic build up to a crazy stunt 

would’ve been a cooler pay off if the bike jump wasn’t used so heavily in advertising though",2023-07-16
you could take out the entire rome sequence and it would still be the exact same movie,2023-07-20
"thats because ethan and benjy were wearing masks of each others faces for the 2nd half of the movie

note they showed a quick shot of benjy mourning after her death

i will die on this hill",2023-07-13
because this comment is a month old and i dont see anyone else posting about it the thing that really ticked me off is how impossible it is to lose a fight with a sword vs a switch blade you just have too much range and you cant block a bladed weapon its like bringing a sword to a gun fight and indiana jones set up the precedent for how that goes but you can do things to justify it like you could have gabriel wearing some cut resistant gloves or pull out some gadgety expanding baton or you know dont give her a sword have it be a blunted weapon or a taser have him throw the  knife opening up a vulnerability which he can use to wrestle the sword away from her asfjlkjas,2023-08-18
"re1  not convinced she’s actually dead i think the early red herring was a set up for this one the spoken lines were very interesting also grace “she’s dead because of me” benji ethan “no you’re alive because of her”  not exactly a lie she’s not yet in the team so they are keeping grace just enough in the dark like luthor going dark to fight the entity ethan has a plan that needs faust “dead” in gabriel’s eyes 

adding to my theory is that the weight of a true death would be much more visible on screen",2023-07-24
yeah there were more jokes in this one too that made it have a decent tonal shift compared to fallout,2023-07-16
what made me sad wasnt rebeccas death but knowing the actress herself wont return also the train bit where ethan unknowingly took out a guy then another because of the parachute felt too comical for me,2023-10-14
i was thinking that the whole hidden wife plotthat presumably got wrapped up last film was kind of a waste when you have someone die close to ethan like ilsa does it would’ve been way more impactful for it to be someone that he had a long standing relationship with but they couldn’t exactly do that when he has a wife he cares about that we never see,2023-07-27
dont think shes dead tbf thats why they glossed over it like how she died way quicker then paris for a less severe wound or the fact that there was 0 pay off for the youre dead stay dead line we also never saw her body,2023-08-02
"meh seeing this in the theater none of that stuff really matters the plot was just an excuse to get to the next thrill ride

if i had seen it on a tv those things might have bothered me more",2023-07-17
the worst part of the movie for me was that gabriel felt tacked on like you said and hes supposed to be this guy from before ethan was an agent which ok but why didnt he find him before and even worse for me why is gabriel the worlds greatest fighter the whole movie falls apart if gabriel loses a fight at any point and he should have he was fighting a trailed mi6 agent did the ai really calculate that gabriel wins that fight that was dumb to me turning the villain into super man for no reason is lame having the ai help him be the smartest by communicating with an ear piece would have been way cooler,2023-12-26
the reason rebecca fergusons death probably didnt work is because her replacement is right there already,2023-12-19
"anytime shea whigham is in a movie or tv show you know you’re gonna have a fun time he does have a knack for playing tough guys 

i love how briggs and dejas are always one step behind ethan even when they had a chance to catch him just like a cat and mouse game ",2023-07-12
when the older one tasers guards and fires his gun to get people moving on the train and the younger one is just are you for real right now made me giggle,2023-07-12
kittridge absolutely stole the show in this movie hats off to henry czerny,2023-07-12
this movie was surprisingly funny might be the funniest of the franchise,2023-07-12
i loved the way they described ethan before they went to the airport something like a mind reading shapeshifting incarnate of chaos,2023-07-13
they felt like the audience surrogate,2023-07-12
i think that guy chased paul walker in fast series and got punched love it,2023-07-12
it was amusing when they forced their way into the venice party shea wigham tazing the guards and greg tarzans  face coupled with him saying  was funny they were on a wild goose chase the entire time and they came close but no cigar sheas determination to get hunt is interesting maybe maries brother,2023-07-12
loving the top gun maverick actors,2023-07-13

i felt like they were setting them up to be part of the team at some point maybe in the next one they hand off to a younger team they really established how pure hearted that one younger cia agent was so many times that i feel like it has to be for a reason,2023-07-19
i didn’t mind them but i feel like whenever they were on screen they were just wasting time like if they weren’t in the movie nothing would change,2023-07-13

it didn’t want any survivors except gabriel to escape it knew that the director is on board with information about the sub it also knows the buyer is on the train ethan hunt will also be in the train to stop it so a fail safe for all of them in case anyone survives speed the train with no stops so that no one can get out and crash it so that no one can escape also no proofs for murdering top us officials,2023-07-12

didnt the rest of the passengers move to the back of the train and survived,2023-07-19
assuming gabriel gets a lot more background in part ii he worked for me but i just felt esai morales played him pretty well it was also nice to see under his cold and collected exterior when he realized he didnt have the key,2023-07-12
"i’m actually curious if the director or cruise or anyone who worked on this movie played uncharted 2 and was like this would be sick in a mission impossible movie 

nothing in the actual uncharted movie was nearly as reminiscent to the games as the train section for this movie was",2023-07-12
i agree but my biggest gripe with gabriel is how he exited the train in the end like bro come on  i thought he landed in water but he just fell into the back of a truck whilst moving at like 60mph literally looked at his watch and into a truck backwards,2023-07-12
that fact that they mentioned paris still having a pulse definitely means poms in the next film in some capacity at least,2023-07-12
"i think he will be the “reason” entity will be defeated

this time he lost to ethan even with the full plan conducted by entity to ensure every possibilities

this gave him some kind of trauma next time he will go further entity’s plan to make up he is better than ethan because he don’t want to lose again and that will be the “only” single factor beyond entity’s forecast  human’s emotional that make it lose

we will see his development for sure

the train sequence is so awesome",2023-07-12
the train falling apart car by car was creatively done i appreciate that ultimately ethan  grace would have failed to escape without help from paris,2023-07-12
"hard agree i thought at first it was a clip from the first film that i’d forgotten about they showed it like 34 times with him assassinating this girl whoever she was 

like i get trying to add a backstory but when it’s just forced and obviously clearly foreshadowing ilsa’s death it really served no other purpose and was done poorly 

the other key moment i wasn’t a huge fan of was ilsa’s death it sort of just came and went and i know these films drive forward and that’s kind of the appeal of them but it just seemed to serve to launch grace in as her replacement and then that’s that 

with rebecca ferguson beside monaghan being the first actress to actually appear in more than 2 of these consecutively  kirby soon to join the club  it feels strange to  her off seemingly to make room for someone new whereas with rhames and pegg they just keep trucking on though they might do something about that in the next one…",2023-07-12
ive never seen any other mi movies and assumed that was real flashback footage from earlier versions ,2023-07-12
it’s tough to follow cavill honestly that’s what i was telling myself the whole time only reason why i’d say fallout is better is because of how great cavill was,2023-07-13
the train scene was good but gabriel wanted to increase the speed of the train so his very first action was to  the locomotive’s fireman the guy who is literally fueling the engine and not replace him while advancing the throttle the train would have come to a slow stop after 15 minutes,2023-07-13
my theory is that this dude doesn’t exist in the present it’s the ai who figured out eathans weak point some dude they blackmailed and is using a face mask or something the literal dead reconing,2023-07-12
"i liked

i dont know his name

his names gabriel

shutup about gabriel you dont onow anything about him",2023-07-13
gabriels baaaaad because he fridged a woman so hard that her death is literally all we know about the character and just to be sure they fridged one more,2023-07-15
was so happy to hear pom had a pulse at the end lol she was awesome in this,2023-07-12
pom is alive  they wouldn’t show her “dying” then say she has a pulse only to  her for real,2023-07-13
i feel like tying him into ethans past was wholly unnecessary having him  ilsa assuming shes actually dead would have been enough to set him up as a villain,2023-07-15
the train sequence was a  masterpiece had my jaw on the floor by the time it ended,2023-07-12
"yeah gabriel was generic as a villain for this one hopefully theyll develop him a bit more because hes pretty standard smug bad guy at the moment lane had a fun chaotic vibe and i enjoyed walkers fairly unusual air of i have better things to do everything else is an annoying pain in the 

speaking of walker is it just me or was there a computer screen with a picture of walker in the opening credits im having doubts because im sure the screen didnt show in the movie itself",2023-07-12
after henry cavill getting to go all out as the previous nemesis this one fell really flat for me though i loved the rest of the movie it’s just a stoic stock bad guy who likes to  people none of the charisma i liked in fallout nothing against morales i think it was just how the character was written and directed,2023-07-15
i just assumed gabriel was from a past mi movie who i just couldn’t remember but was probably somehow important to that movie’s plot lol,2023-07-16
i was actually thinking during the train scene that this is uncharted and had to remind myself that it in fact was not the uncharted movie why did we get the other movie,2023-07-12
bettter than too many flashbacks with too much deaging  i’m happy they didn’t try to deage tom in a flashback  i think their approach worked well enough,2023-07-12
i think it’s guaranteed pom is fine otherwise they wouldn’t put the pulse line in not sure if she’ll join but she’ll definitely do something in the next film she was badass,2023-07-12
" very uncharted 2 like

i had the same feeling and the shootout in the sandstorm felt like uncharted 3",2023-07-12
i kept thinking pom was karlie kloss the entire film and kept laughing at the idea a supermodel would be aggressively driving an armored car down the streets of rome,2023-07-13
paris pom is alive—she had a pulse at the end ,2023-07-13
"my biggest issue is gabriel

i am kind of disappointed they showed ethan drawing blood from his throat because i was honestly expecting it to be something totally wild like gabriel is an android piloted by the entity i feel like thats something thats perfectly within reason in the mission impossible world especially since theres been realistic face mask technology for decades unless the android is down to like cylonlevel realism which seems like it would be a touch too far imo

but i have fully bought into the power level theyve given to the entity and im surprised they didnt have more examples of its potential they describe it being capable of a lot of things but the most impressive thing it does onscreen aside from have a team of mercenaries doing its bidding is probably the opening scene i wanted to see it do something really unbelievable and dramatic like launch some nukes or something i dont feel thoroughly pulled towards the next movie as much as im just glad theyre going to keep making these",2023-07-16
interesting i just assumed he was the bad guy in one of the earlier movies that id long ago forgotten about,2023-07-16
i have a hard time believing ethan had some nefarious background and had no choice to join imf,2023-07-16
"i hated how overthetop the train scene became at the end first a bridge explodes the train falls off then the cars fall off one by one then the piano and a bunch of other stuff i hate when it goes on too long it loses the suspension of disbelief for me felt like loony tunes in the end

also holy vfx batman so much cg in that train scene takes away from the amazing real life stunts",2023-07-17
"a lot of this movie felt like it was riffing craigera bond and some others

you had veniceboats again like in casinoskyfall you have a nemesis from the past that you never knew you had which was pulling all the strings all along same as blofeld 

it was a fun generic spy action film with not a lot of surprises just a lot of how will they get out of this pinch",2023-11-12
"my biggest issue is gabriel i appreciate the attempt at fleshing out ethan’s premi days and why join the imf but giving me a 5 second grainy clip 7 movies in and saying here’s ethans old nemesis you should hate him to was rough

i think they were trying to show that there is a relationship there without overdoing it otherwise you risk a case of skywalker syndrome where the fate of the world comes down to a small group of people and their interpersonal relationships or the ridiculous decision to make james bond and ernst stavro blofeld longlost adoptive brothers in spectre i suppose you can argue that the entity knew who ethan was and sought out gabriel to be its agent as he is someone who could get under ethans skin which would explain why it didnt tell gabriel what the key opened but i dont think its fair to criticise them for only introducing gabriel as someone from ethans past seven films in its not like they planned this out several films ago",2023-07-12
"i dont understand the link to him and ethans premi days ethan was implicated in the girls  so had to make the choice but turns out this random antagonist was responsible for that way before ethan had anything to do with imf how why to what end coincidence

and why was this not played up

did i miss something",2023-07-12
"i thought the same thing re gabriel 

wasnt worse that blofeld in spectre being revealed as the brains behind casino royale quantum of solace and skyfall",2023-07-12
"that’s the problem when you split a story into two movies when part 2 comes out and inevitably fleshes out the backstory of these new characters and ethan’s past it will feel much more complete obviously

gabriel is a cool character but his development saved for part two the ai’s motivations is intriguing but what is the motivation part two ethan’s new shadowy past before the imf learn about it in part two

for now this movie suffers because of the wait for part two in the future watching just this part one by itself will be almost superfluous outside of the action because nothing is fully explained",2023-07-13
"  the piano 

this was horribly done",2023-07-16
i legit turned to my cousin midmovie and said that the train scene looked like uncharted 2,2023-07-12
100 we are getting a deaged tom cruise to flesh out that scene more in part 2,2023-07-12
i’m assuming pom is in the next one since they said she’s still alive imo she was the highlight of this movie awesome character awesome costumes she just did an awesome job and i wish she had more screen time,2023-07-16
reminds me of fast n furious 7 running up the bus scene,2023-07-16
it was giving very uncharted 2,2023-07-17
gabriel and his ai coffin was pretty silly also with mission impossible’s history of decoys and misdirection i kept expecting them to do the obvious… make a decoy of the key i mean it just looks like a fancy house key at least someone should have proposed the idea at some point and explained it away with some meaningless exposition it was driving me nuts that the characters would have an exposition scene that would explain everything that was going to happen in the next scene and establish their secret getaway power a few minutes before each getaway also the dramatic symphonic dadahduhh was used so many times i was wanting to go deaf at least dial of destiny used the classic indy theme sparingly that said it was mosty fun and exciting it could have been 20 minutes shorter,2023-07-17
gabriel doesnt count hes a cliché as is the whole ghost the past story line we dont care about it or about the woman who died gabriel exists as the entitys ,2023-07-17
he was just so unmemorable i just referred to him as “knifey mcdosequis” because i didn’t care enough to remember his name for most of the movie,2023-07-18
i watched dial of destinty last week and i really felt like they shouldve gone the same route with this one have a 1520 minute flashback intro sequence,2023-07-18
the entire time i kept thinking that was a scene from one of the first two movies that somehow completely passed me by but no its just something they came up with for this one yeah thats a bit lame,2023-07-18
from someone who actually had never watched a mi movie before i assumed i had missed something from one of the earlier movies but seems like that wasnt the case,2023-07-19
yeah at least mesh it into footage of the first mission impossible movie something like fast x didwould have made it more grounded and emotional no one cares about a 5 second grainy clip as you said,2023-07-19
its weird that they made it some sort of giant life choice in the show everyone just did imf missions as a kind of side gig they all still had regular jobs,2023-07-19
the submarine opener was moved to replace a planned segment playing out the flashback we get glimpses of mcquarrie looked at the state of deaging and decided it was easier to just film the important parts without having to show a deaged cruise,2023-07-21
"very uncharted 2 like

watching this made me so sad for how boring the cargo falling out of the plane sequence in the uncharted movie was",2023-07-21
with all the call backs to mii it took me a moment to realize that flashback was preimf ethan and not a weird retcon of elements from the first movie it has been a long time since i’ve seen it but the lighting location and even outfits had me pondering,2023-07-24
"that grainy clip was bothering me because i’m thinking to myself “is this something i just forgot in like mi2”

and then i’m wondering what the  this grainy clip even is so i’m sure it’s just foreshadowing events for part 2",2023-07-24

massive uncharted fan and thought the same thing,2023-09-05
"giving me a 5 second grainy clip 7 movies in and saying here’s ethans old nemesis you should hate him too was rough

wait so it wasnt an established back story i had forgotten about it was legitimately all new information",2023-11-13
yes exactly like uncharted 2,2023-12-07
i agree but even worse for me was that gabriel was the words greatest fighter for no reason he beat issa and ethan in fights otherwise the movie doesnt work thats a really dumb thing to hinge a plan on and it didnt seem like gabriel earned that kind of combat prowess imo it would have worked better if gabriel was a good villain not because he was a super soldier but because he out smarted everyone at every turn and it was because he had an ear piece with the ai talking him through everything,2023-12-26
it was very uncharted 2 i was a little annoyed that the director swore up and down he had never seen the game because there are a few shots that are just directly lifted from it,2024-01-25

confusing for me too i think the basic gist is cary elwes bad kittridge okay for now,2023-07-13
i think kittridge simply wants the key under us control with the idea it’s safe in his hands as a deterrentthreat than ever using it the elwes character wants to actually use it seeing how it worked with that russian sub for more aggressive purposes,2023-07-15
wait youre telling me thats westley from the princess bride ,2023-07-15
i doubt elwes was serious about taking over the world however he and kittridge were on the train to collect the key find the ai and cover up the american governments involvement with the ai,2023-07-12
"kittridge is there for the govt given his interactions with everyone it should be obvious hes on the okay side he wouldve had the key either way whether ethan got to it first or as shown hes the final buyer plus theres ethans testament to grace of  i trust him

elwes is definitely there for greed of power and control",2023-07-17
i was lost as well but for different reasons some punk kid pulled the fire alarm in the theater and we had to leave by the time we got back in they had already started the movie so we missed a couple minutes where kittridge first meets with widow and gabriel meets with the director did they say or show why gabriel was meeting with him in the first place like did they know each other was there was it the entity that told gabriel where to go and who to see,2023-07-15
im glad you asked this question because coming out of the theater i was confused by their motives,2023-07-31
yeah i was lost in plot line too thought overall plot was kind of dumb so just tried to enjoy the action and try to forget about the quest for the key,2023-07-22

i love the rogue ai concept and the stakes certainly felt high but because they split the story into two films you are now left wanting when only watching this part one

so it’s hard to judge this film outside of the action because part two couldwill probably fill in all the holes but for now this part one suffers because of that wait",2023-07-13
"i loved the action and comedy but thought the plot was ridiculous sentient ai seemed a bit over the top and the way it was portrayed was pretty cheesy the dialogue in the opening scene where they explain the ai was so clunky and over the top  no one was talking like a normal person and why are they telling cary elwes character about creating the offline copies of info when he’s literally staring at all the people on typewriters surely he’d know all about that already or they set this whole thing up without ever telling the boss

i also do not understand the connection between the entity and gabriel ok so gabriel is some bad guy from ethan’s past ok then what has the entity got to do with him how coincidental that the entity would somehow be aligned with someone from ethan’s past how does the entity and gabriel interact it all seemed ludicrous to me",2023-07-14

it helps that i watched all six over the last few days my mission impossible franchise memory was very fresh when i went into the movie earlier tonight the sleightofhand was an important plot point that was used several times in the first movie they used this repeatedly in this movie that was a callback to the first movie 

i love this movie so much",2023-07-12
so many replies to this comment and youre all still missing one the net ranger phineas phreak luthers nicknames havent been mentioned since luthers very first scene in mi1 in  1996 gotta love mcquarrie for little morsels for the longtime devoted obsessed fans,2023-07-13
ethan also makes reference to his callsign bravo echo one one which is exactly the same thing he said in the phone booth in mission 1 trying to report his whole team was killed,2023-07-12
"maybe the next one will be a homage to mi2  

nyah hall comes back although it would be slightly redundant considering grace is almost the exact same character

thousands of seagulls where the submarine is retreived

lots of slow motion 

motorcycle combat finale",2023-07-12
you know what this reminded me of fast x so many similar plot points and set pieces granted its smarter and better executed than fast x but it was still curious,2023-07-12
there was also the foot chase through the foggy european city culminating on a bridge  the entire venice sequence once they left the party reminded me of mi1 in the best way,2023-07-13
kitteridge made a direct reference to the infamous ‘you’ve never seen me very upset’ line,2023-07-12
also had the kitridge  max callback from the first film that they started setting up in fallout with her daughter i liked how kitridge filled in some blanks on what happened to max too,2023-07-12
"100 thanks for bringing it up 

i watched one of mcquarrie’s interviews about the film and he was talking about all of his old experiences and influences since fallout folks have been revisiting the mi series in general particularly 1 amazing to see some of the due de palma has been getting over recent years",2023-07-12
when ethan stood sideways in the shadow as he explains to hayley what mif is his face was framed exactly like the first movies poster,2023-07-13
totally it could be played as a straight sequel ie as if it came immediately after the first movie if you can cope with assuming ethan met ilsa and benji offscreen and he and luther have aged 30 years,2023-07-12
i just watched the first mission impossible a couple months ago for the first time so it was fresh in my memory it really holds up now that ive seen  dead reckoning i could see they wanted to mix the classic feel of the first film with the modern stunts of the later ones it made it feel oldfashioned but in a good way,2023-07-12
also in mi1 sarah died by getting stabbed in the heart trying to save her colleagues who were on that fake noc list in mi7 ilsa died by getting stabbed in the heart trying to save grace from gabriel,2023-07-14
and the sleight of hand tricks calling back to the disk scene,2023-07-15
youve never seen me very upset,2023-07-12
surprised you left out ethan doing magic with the mcguffin which is what he last did in mi1 against jean renos character,2023-07-13
just went back and watched mi1 and it really sold standing on a fast train is difficult and not a safe place to fight and lots of movies since  including this one and indiana jones  are more like standing on a train is just like standing on a sidewalk so easy anyone can do it and  i miss the facemelting barely holding on action of the train fight in the first one,2023-07-12
yeah this mirrors mi1 a lot with kit and the train scene and bringing up his origin a lot more i’m worried this duology is wrapping up ethan hunt’s arc,2023-07-12
the masks running gag was hilarious,2023-07-12
i left feeling we got the style of mi1 with remakes of a lot of bond stunts and skynet thrown into the plot for good measure,2023-07-12
yeah a lot of dutch tilts but used effectively and i liked it the train sequence definitely felt like a callback as well,2023-07-12
"yes but also so much extra stuff too 

the stuff with the fiat was very italian job 

a lot of things felt like they were taken from old classic films or videogames

the story is something out of metal gear solid 2 

people reference the train and uncharted series but ive not played that series really 

they just use a lot of really good stuff from other films",2023-07-14
" 70s thriller vibes

i’m not sure you’ve ever seen a 70s thriller 

and masks are always a part of mi movies",2023-07-14
also the venice part felt a lot like the prague sequence  with ethan in a same suit and similar hairdo chasing through foggy streets to save the team,2023-07-14
i felt like the train sequence was a deliberate attempt to make up for the fact that the train sequence from the first movie looks fake and dated now  we finally got a fight on top of a train scene that looks incredible,2023-07-15
" did anyone feel like this one pays significant homage to the first mi film 

theres homage and then theres directly ripping it and filling like a carbon copy the train having kitridge and white widow on the train use of masks use of slight of hand to  with people absolutely obnoxious",2023-07-16
henry czerny stole the  show the intensity and gravity he brings to each scene is crazy,2023-07-12
not to mention that i believe the first film’s story had an item that also had two parts same thing with the key in this film,2023-07-13
"def thought this very much the very angled extreme closeup shots of kitridge and ethan at the beginning were a clear homage to brian depalmas shots of the first obv the final sequence involving being on a high speed train also it was finally confirmed what we knew all along i suspect that vanessa kirbys character is the daughter of max vanessa redgrave from mi1 loved that she always had that steely ice cold wide eyed psycho look 

 speaking of i was highly annoyed and was taken completely out of the picture during gabriel and ethans showdown i felt us as audience members  and probable fans of mi1  would know about the laws of physics that from the first one one can barely hang on using suction cups to a fast loving train let alone stand or let alone run forward and have a fight ugh major gripe for a movie that tries to be serious and smart this was a huge step backward no pun intended",2023-07-14
also felt like an homage to buster keatons train stunt,2023-07-14
also the white widow’s mother is max from mi1 who essentially played a similar role on the train in that movie,2023-07-14
i really would like to see them hold on some of the stunt shots longer the car chase in rome was hard to follow also have you ever tried to drive a fiat while handcuffed it’s really hard and they should have shown more hand over hand steering action,2023-07-17
"dont forget

wildly unnecessary dutch angles",2023-07-17
the entire bridge sequence was directly a homage to the opening scene of mi 1,2023-07-12
absolutely there were probably even more callbacks but you caught the ones i caught,2023-07-12
believed it was talked about often and mentioned why in quite a few articles,2023-07-12
totally also a focus on gabriel instead of job this time,2023-07-14
going tomorrow but you make me hope for an hasta lasagna dont get any on ya,2023-07-14
i absolutely got mi 1 vibes especially with the long dialogue with the intense closeups in some scenes,2023-07-14
"“i see you’re upset”

“i’m not upset”

"ghost protocal too

fighting bad guys in a sandstorm
the machine messing up the mask

they did the dutch tilt offaxis camera angles totally,2023-07-15
there is a line early on where when ethan first reveals himself during the meeting kitridge goes i know you are upset i was kinda expecting some callback to when he tells him you have never seen me upset in the first one,2023-07-16
also white widow is related to max of the first film,2023-07-16
“i know you’re very upset”,2023-07-16
all i’ve ever wanted was a real quality sequel to mi ‘96 and holy  did i get it  this entire move was like a love letter to that film,2023-07-16
so many dutch angles,2023-07-16
i thought so too,2023-07-16
because if you knew what you were stealing you wouldnt have stolen it,2023-07-17
kittridge commenting that ethan seems upset is a direct line reference to the aquarium scene,2023-07-17
plus venice by night reminiscent of prague by night,2023-07-17
"definitely but for me not just the first film but also the recent ones

1 luthers nicknames and kittridge from the first movie

2 the train fight scene also reminded me of rogue nation where ethan was hanging on to the plane he was also hanging off the side when they entered the tunnel

3 the nonstop running in venice reminded me of mi 3 and rogue nation i guess

4 the sandstorm in the beginning of the movie plus ethan and grace hanging on to the train from ghost protocol similar to when ethan was hanging off burj khalifa the latex mask generator also jammed in both films

5 car chase from fallout but the stairs part was from benji and ethan when they were chasing ilsa in morocco in rogue nation

6 the running on the airport rooftop reminded me of fallout when ethan was chasing august walkerjohn lark",2023-07-17
"cruise doing closeup magic to make something disappear  

i understand youre upset

infiltrating langley

net rangerphinneas phreak reference",2023-07-17
his hair during that train sequence  felt like a callback to the first film’s train sequence as well i don’t know if that was intentional,2023-07-17
foggy night time streets is what did it for me,2023-07-18
isla’s death seemed very similar to “fake” death scene in first film as well,2023-07-19
i loved when they brought up luthers old nicknames the net ranger and phineas freak which were mentioned in his first scene,2023-07-19
definitely  for such a different installment it took quite a lot of inspiration from the first one especially with how the scene with hunt and kittridge and the use of dutch angles mirrored the conversation between them in the restaurant with the giant aquarium in prague as well as the whole train sequence,2023-07-19
"didnt ethan look at jasper briggs curiously for a moment in the middle of an action scene like he was recognizing someone

dan briggs was the original imf team leader in the series and the original star of the show i bet they are related or maybe the same person since dan briggs fate was not known",2023-07-21
i recently went back to watch all the mis and mi1 was really good better than i remembered,2023-07-23
fighting on top of a train,2023-07-27
a lot of call backs to max too there was some minor ones in fallout but i felt like this one was properly leaning on it,2023-08-02
definitely an homage to uncharted 2 and the metal gear series as well,2024-01-25
cruise and mcq are far too competent to make such an absolutely nonsensical decision the only possible reason is her wanting out or scheduling issues with dune and silo s2 or a fakeout which i’d love to see be the case she has already shot scenes for part 2 but that’s more than likely flashback,2023-07-12
"with all the stop and starts during production including the covid pandemic during the middle of shooting i think it’s clear they had to get her character out of the movie due to schedulingoutside conflicts

i adore rebecca ferguson and agree her fate was kind of shoe horned in it’s the same reason jeremy renner wasn’t in fallout scheduling conflicts with the avengers",2023-07-16
"yeah they swapped an exmi6 agent with a thief… i mean this whole “you’ll have a choice” didnt fit in

it didn’t feel like a definite good bye to me it was too quick for such an important character but that’s just me wishing she’s still here",2023-07-21
idk it seems out of character for mcq to treat a character like that even alec baldwins hunley got some time to shine before he died in fallout but ilsas death felt so unceremonious idk i feel like shes not dead nobody in the team was crushed by it even thought theyre all essentially besties now ethan barely looked sad about it i hope part 2 remedies her death it doesnt have to bring her back or anything but just make me feel better about it,2023-07-26
i think every mission impossible movie has had an inspector javert a well meaning cop that chases ethan sincerely believing he is rogue but then stops when he realizes that ethan is fighting for a noble cause,2023-07-16
im devastated by ilsas death she totally deserved better plus her final fight even annoyed me  she is a complete bad  as we know from the previous movies and she had a sword against a knive i seem to be fighting the tide in relation to grace as i thought she was really irritating and a bit useless no replacement for ilsa i felt betrayed by tom moving on so quickly and not looking forward to seeing more of her in the next one,2023-09-08
this is why you shouldn’t watch trailers,2023-07-13
"your review says you thought it was quite good but then your next paragraph basically rips it to shreads 

good

i hated it",2023-07-18
telegraphed,2023-07-16
that’s why i don’t watch trailers,2024-01-25
"him actually being disoriented was great 

seen too many action movies where the guy jsut gets up like nothing",2023-07-12
good thing the key still fell inside the train even though the guy was holding it at the time pretty sure he was knocked out of the train right,2023-07-12
it made zero sense but still worked because its mission impossible after all i loooved it,2023-07-12
"idk it felt too lucky to me like they had a plan for him landing on the train but they couldn’t shoot it properly and they went with this then a second henchmen gets taken out with his parachute by accident i wish he did it on purpose like release the shoot but wrap the henchman up in it to take him out both those kills being total luck when he’s coming to save her seems to cheapen the whole “promise you’ll be on the train” thing she should say that cause she trusts him and feels safe around him not that he will mr mcgoo  people with his super luck

i’m okay with him having super luck it’s a similar thing to indiana jones i just think it was used badly in this scene",2023-07-12
here i am thinking about tom cruises second parachute landing smoooooth as butter baby,2023-07-12
did he go through a window it looked like he knocked out a whole wall but it happened too fast for me to tell,2023-07-14
"ive been thinking about that since watching and any other movie i would have groaned that he smashed into a moving train like the koolaid man

but the fact he pulled off that insane jump in real life earns the movie a suspension of disbelief exceeding anything ive watched

this movie feels like a rollercoaster ride and not in a bad way you can look at a rollercoaster see the loops and turns but it doesnt diminish the enjoyment of actually riding it

its why they can practically put a mini trailer in the opening sequence and it doesnt ruin anything its so confident in its spectacle to wow you and there not wrong",2023-07-16
"dats cinema baby

knack 2 and dunkeys having a baby baby",2023-07-14
that had me dying as i didn’t expect it to end like that,2023-07-29
would have been nicer if they showed that from ethans pov,2023-07-27
his backflip parachute jump was baller too,2023-07-27
found it kind of odd though that the brother didn’t recognize the clear change in her eye color,2023-07-14
she’s the girl playing the girl disguised as another girl,2023-07-20
i had the same reaction,2023-07-15
wait what i thought that was atwell playing kirby holy  o,2023-07-20
and one of those people  ignorant to sudden change of eye colour is her brother and he looked her straight in the face in the little train hallway no way he wouldnt notice its not like her eyes went from blue to grey or green still light colours so i could buy it being not really noticable it went from very light blue to very dark brown and it changes how the face looks as if something is off,2023-07-12
"yes    they go through all that trouble and dont bother with eye color

i like to think that was done intentionally for us the viewers so we could keep track of real kirby and fake kirby",2023-07-15
not to mention vastly different body types,2023-07-17
"they also have different heights and hayley’s face is way bigger than vanessa’s to pull the mask thing off 

i’m willing suspend my reasoning with the mask scenes",2023-08-06
in fallout white widow has dark eyes  i think she was using blue contacts for style in this movie so she couldve just popped them out for all zola thought,2023-07-31
that wasn’t added until post so they couldn’t see the difference,2023-07-20
" that whole sequence annoyed me to no end
earlier she was all  i dont know what to do during the car action scenes

now shes a fighting expert fighting with knives she lasted longer in the fight than ilsa did 

the writting in this movie was lacking  i dont understand the high praise that its getting",2023-07-13
movie trope present the weapon to the camera before using it,2023-07-12
oh my  thats why i know him  ozark thanks,2023-07-14
yeah ive never been in a knife fight but i feel like it should be easy to win when you have two knives and the other guy is unarmed i get that grace isnt a trained fighter but still ilsa on the other hand doesnt have any excuse ive never been in a sword fight either but against someone with only a knifejust poke poke poke from a distance why ever move in close enough to get stabbed,2023-07-17
oh my  that’s what he’s from i couldn’t think of what i knew him from for the life of me,2023-07-15
pfff what does she look like some kind of master at sleight of hand,2023-07-20
"i was so mad at that knife moment what sleight of hand master does that 

if theyd revealed the second knife secretly for the audience but gabriel was slick enough to block her attack that would have made him impressive too could have happened in the same amount of time on screen",2023-07-23
so the plot can happen,2023-07-14
they spent a whole take focusing on the switchblades being placed on the table for some reasonvery fishy indeed,2023-07-18
okay but her in those jeans was just unfair and the suit and all the shots focusing on her eyes,2023-07-12
yeah did hayley atwell get better looking over the past 10 years ,2023-07-12
"i was a fool i see the light now 

rebecca ferguson ilsa faust still best mi girl though",2023-07-12
my jaw was dropped every time she was on the screen especially with the flirty first interaction with hunt,2023-07-12
man i been understanding that since 2019,2023-07-12
my favourite part was the fact that she was meant to be doubling for the alana character  they have fairly substantial differences in their  anatomy her brother  would have been super confused when she came out of that room,2023-07-12
"i know that’s right first opinion ever but hayley was a  smokeshow in this

when ethan’s story is done i would totally watch her in a mi spinoff",2023-07-12
i couldve watched her walk down that airport hallway for 25 hours and the movie wouldnt have suffered at all,2023-07-13
the smiles she gave in this movie trapped me for sure,2023-07-12
hayley atwell still imo the most attractive person in the mcu tessa thompson is up there too,2023-07-12
itt horniness,2023-07-12
i finally understood when i saw her in that piratey party outfit very much yes,2023-07-12
to watch her episode on black mirror ,2023-07-12
a lesser movie would’ve had the camera buried in her cleavage but she was all buttoned up here,2023-07-13
"no  this was my 1 takeaway as well

jesus",2023-07-12
not surprised this is one of the top comments she was distractingly hot in this movie,2023-07-15

,2023-07-16
of course the top thread is just ppl talking about wanting to  the female leads ,2023-07-16

"love how the top comment on this thread is essentially 

bonk",2023-07-12
i am still team ilsa,2023-07-23
that was an absurd scene that should’ve been rewritten,2023-07-12
i cringed at that part alot took me out of the movie where every other thing tho silly was smart and understandable to some level but this one was just simple bs,2023-07-13
i forgot about this and had a similar comment about how poorly written a lot of the script was this was a prime example of that a lot of the movie was truly fantastic but the script definitely needed some tlc,2023-07-14
he doesnt seem to be the cold blooded killer type so orders others to do it for him especially a woman,2023-07-14
"it was building his character he is a coward that isnt willing to  someone himself

jk",2023-07-16
yeah a lot of the writing was there for show not practicality i guess thats cinema but its frustrating as ,2023-07-15
that got me too she has the key shoot her and take it don’t demand it back she should have hid the key but they did that trick several times already in the movie so i think it could have been written better,2023-07-16
that was an instant head scratcher immediately it happened,2023-07-23
im pretty sure he says  her but i could be massively wrong firing a gun on  train is asking for trouble,2023-07-15
yes,2023-07-25
i wish that was rewritten that was one of the most glaringly  thing i’ve seen in one of these films,2023-08-22
my mates and i went ballistic in the cinema when this line was dropped gotta be a reference to the mbappe meme,2023-07-12
"i started giggling when i heard that 



similarly everytime they said “greater good” shame we didn’t get to hear simon pegg say it ",2023-07-15
i could not think of anything else in that moment,2023-07-13
"i will be there no matter what

tom cruise on his status as a scientologist",2023-07-16
the thing that i loved so much in the movie was that they didnt go the whole ai has gone bad and will  all of humanity route that has been done to death and i liked this idea of multiple parties vying to control the ai while the ai is trying to protect itself,2023-07-12
the little head nod from ilsa to ethan after the team reassembled was well earned,2023-07-12
it’s actually interesting how funny this movie was it’s honestly the funniest of the franchise even though it was really intense i really liked the balance,2023-07-12
her driving showed how insane ethan is besides that initial crash he adapted immediately and was able to perfectly drive that car compared to how long it took her to finally get the hang of it,2023-07-13
when they switched spots in the car after falling down the steps had me laughing so much,2023-07-15
i absolutely hated that scene how odd,2023-07-12
i get why they introduced the ai as the bad guy i mean we’re 7 movies in where do we go from here  but i really felt gabriel did not live up to the villains in previous movies the whole first half was so hampered by the ai plot and how it was discussed in the board rooms and secret meetings it just felt very jenky everyone was talking about the threat but we didn’t get to see if he threatening,2023-07-12
i think what really sold that scene was the audio the  electric audio for the fiat and then cut to the military grade truck with its heavy audio engine lol then back to fiat audio etc was funny,2023-10-11
nah shes for real dead they spent the whole first half of the movie foreshadowing her death and it really informs ethans character for the rest of the movie you have to believe hes willing to die to save his friends and you have to believe that hes going to  gabriel on the train undoing that would really cheapen the story,2023-07-12
i still think rogue nation is the best film in the series  ferguson is the reason why sad to see her go,2023-07-12
let’s hope the next one is called death retconning,2023-07-12
i don’t understand how anyone actually believes she’s dead gabriel mentioned specifically that one of them had to die conveniently he’s also the one who killed her so the one man the entity trusts is now 100 sure she’s dead add to that the fact that they barely even gave us or the characters time to grieve and it seems almost guaranteed that she’s still alive if she really is dead fuuuuuuuuuuuck that she isn’t though oh yeah and they made it clear luther was going into hiding too so going off the grid is clearly a part of the strategy here,2023-07-12
agreed the fakeout death before her real one 20 mins later felt halfbaked and was the worst part of the movie for me,2023-07-12
"im not convinced shes dead otherwise it was unusually badly written for a recent mi movie

they fake her death and shes supposed to go in to hiding from everyone perfect way to write ferguson out if shes busy and she just randomly turns up in rome with the crew says barely anything has barely a plot loses a fight she would normally win and nobody is that even that sad 

how did she know they were in rome surely ethan wouldnt have contacted her with the movies big protect my friends throughline has she been found by the entity and blackmailed into working with gabriel or working for the entity without anyones knowledge very ilsa she could definitely fake her death against the imf since even in just this movie they apparently put no effort in checking if people still have a pulse",2023-07-12
"my biggest gripe with the film i thought ilsa was end game not even from a fan perspective but from a writing one as well its sad that ethan wasnt able to end up with julia because of the nature of his work ilsa is from this line of work and they clearly liked each other i felt like she was truly the one hed end up with after he retires 

x200b

now it seems like the only way to end this is to play into the idea that ethans doomed to do this until he dies theres no life for him after this work",2023-07-16
yeah having two guys serve the same tech guy function in these movies is a bit annoying a bit more role diversity would be nice,2023-07-13
"i’m split on this on one hand i hope they commit to it just because there’s been so many franchises of late that don’t have the balls to  off fan favorite characters on the other hand i can see how they wrote themselves a way out if it indeed was a fake out 

the scene before they go to the entities party is them realizing that they’re all there because the entity has ordained this entire scenario and wants to  someone close to ethan idk that ilsa would go with ethan to the party knowing this information and not taking some preventive measures in case something went wrong",2023-07-15
"after a second viewing im 1000 convinced she survived it makes so much sense structurally the first fake death plays out in a way that feels to me like its setting up the big reveal in mi8 luther behaves bizarrely following the real death and the death occurs in a similar setting to where phelps faked his death in mi1 paris survives a similar stab wound the line at the start of the venice sequence that nothing outside this room is real etc seems like a creative workaround for her scheduling conflicts and hopefully shell get a few big moments in part 2

just to elaborate further about the prologue ilsas fake death doesnt feel intended to be suspenseful although the preceding action scene certainly is it feels intended as exposition to teach us that this is a stratagem ethan  ilsa would employ the focus on ethans line youre dead you stay dead",2023-07-19
i think i know what they will do  there might be a scene where one of the characters wears an ilsa mask,2023-07-15
one of my biggest complaints about the series is the amount of fakeouts and gotcha moments these movies are a total blast but i find myself not being able to believe the stakes ever lol i would not at all be shocked if ilsa somehow comes back she’s too perfect of a confidant for ethan,2023-07-16
"they better not i really appreciated how they went for her death i didn’t really feel the emotion of that scene unfortunately but i do love that they actually killed her off

it made the rest of the stakes so much better when zola was about to shoot grace i was almost convinced she was going to die because of the movie killing off ilsa

i’ll be a little  if they retcon her death",2023-07-13
it will be across two movies now and it didn’t really add much to the story the first time around,2023-07-12
actress is busy with dune,2023-07-14
well figure it out,2023-07-12
it felt brutal too those hits had real weight to them and i thought ethan would actually bash pariss head in given the tone of the fight,2023-07-12
i wish it was lit better and less cuts,2023-07-12
it felt that they made some filmmaking choices to amplify the claustrophobic environment and intensity of that fight which might divide audiences handheld very raw grainy lit fight that,2023-07-12
both of them didnt have a gun that was extremely dumb and convenient,2023-07-12
and explained why paris would have a chance against cruise  her fights are all in close quarters and her speed overwhelms her other opponents,2023-07-14
i had myself ducking irl because of those shots with the heads slamming into the brick wall,2023-07-12
it was awful if either of them had a gun ethan would be dead but they conveniently just dont,2023-07-13
camera work and choreography was so incredible there,2023-07-12
like the “oldboy” hallway scene,2023-07-19
probably simply tom needs a certain amount of scenes in the movie where hes playing himself otherwise its like wheres tom cruise in this movie hes headlining i did think he liked pretty cool in the airport scene lol,2023-07-12
because a lot of this movie is making the point that digital cant be trusted if ai has access to it the only source of truth becomes going analog that means typewriters and using your eyes instead of fancy camera networks it means ironically in the digital face scanning ai world of augmented glasses if youre in controkcontrol you tdont need a mask,2023-07-28
yeah that didnt make any sense to me maybe it doesnt work on airport security or something,2023-07-14

ving,2023-07-13
i found it unintentionally hilarious that the entity is all seeing and all knowing  and multiple governments are trying to obtain it   but luther somehow outsmarts the entity and teaches ethan what decisions to make,2023-07-24
i was wondering when did luther suddenly become the hacker i thought that was benjis deal,2023-07-16
they should really  him and simon pegg off but i know they won’t,2023-07-16
excellent summary fully agree with this,2023-07-12
" certainly no cavill

isnt phillip seymour hoffman the gold standard for mi villains",2023-07-13
it really felt like they threw ilsa in the trash can to fully give the spotlight to grace hopefully its just misdirection and shes still alive,2023-07-13
rogue nation’s the best one imo fallout is fantastic but rn has a lot more “spy movie” elements which i feel make it more interesting than the straight action of fallout,2023-07-12
"in terms of the action i still think this is better than rogue nation although rogue nation obviously had fantastic action as well

but in terms of a complete film that flowed properly rogue nation and fallout are definitely better this film felt janky for whatever reason it has to be the script which i’m hoping part two fixes by providing us with the complete story",2023-07-13
i dont think strong narrative is a universal consensus by any means ,2023-07-13
i see people not mentioning mi3…that is the best one best story best bad guy more ”gritty” but still good humor love the others also but mi3 has a special place in my heart,2023-07-14
"i found it very boring way too long some scenes artificially extended by long pauses to impress on us how serious everything is almost 3h for just a part one meh plus i really dont think a 2 parter works for mission impossible most of the stakes seemed flat because i knew there was a second part so i knew they had to get the key at the end of the movie everything felt very predictable not saying that to boast i was disappointed and calibrated the introduction of hatwells character to replace fergusons for example i really liked the previous mc quarrie ones but this one felt so calibrated and flat


edit  also one of my big complains about this movie is that everything is too clean looked like the freaking superbowl tide add hatwells character has to duck in coal near the end and in the next scenes shes completely clean the bad guy looks like a model going to a photoshoot in all his scenes the previous ones felt more real in that regard",2023-07-14
i agree with most of this especially about the villain i would have preferred to see the original choice of nicholas hoult instead he can play a desperation that would have gone over well here imo for being a part one this is a very strong film in its own right,2023-07-12
im weird in that my favorite is still the original it just has the classic spy movie vibe none of the others do,2023-07-14
i still think cavill’s performance in fallout is one of the best he’s ever done cavill’s a genuine menace in that one and i couldn’t wait to see him get got,2023-07-18
"i feel weird saying this cause i give fallout a 910

so keep in mind i love the movie but i don’t get the hype with john lark as a villain he’s a great physical threat but by far not the best villain of the franchise that would go to solomon lane or owen davian 

while those two are also better than gabriel i think gabriel is more intimidating than cavil 

we obviously need more character development for gabriel but i actually feared for peoples lives with his scenes with cavil i feared he’d punch someone but he didn’t seem like a scary negotiator like lane was cavil was still great don’t get me wrong it’s just the this motives were the amazing same as lane’s he’s lane’s sidekick so he doesn’t feel like his own villain

in that way i definitely think gabriel is better 

i’d say fallout is mcquarrie’s weakest entry still amazing i don’t want to be a contrarian like i’ve tried so many times to appreciate fallout as much as some fans but i just don’t fully get why people think it’s the best my comment is kinda dumb because keep in mind i love fallout  it’s just that i’ve always preferred rogue nation it does everything better imo 

so it’s not like i’m trashing fallout it’s more that for me it’s a 910 and i don’t fully get people giving it a 1010 if that makes sense 

and the reason i’d also give dead reckoning the edge over of fallout is that it felt both like rogue nation and the first movie and the first movie is just so special to me i’m a new fan i watched all 6 movies for the first time this past september lol and the first movie holds a special place in my heart because i didn’t know any of the twists going in the only thing i knew was the iconic hanging from a rope scene my dad had always told me “don’t watch mission impossible it sucks i fell asleep during the first movie it can’t live up to the tv show” so i avoided it my whole life when i finally watched the first one and saw ethan’s whole team die thats when i went “so this is what i’ve been missing out on” my mind was blown and be rest of the movie was a wild ride

so while i love mi3 and ghost protocol mi1 and rogue nation are my two favourites and thats why i guess i loved dead reckoning way more than a lot of people in this comment section to me the call backs weren’t nostalgic because i’ve only been a fan for 6 months but more it reminded me why i became a fan 

sorry for the rant",2023-07-12
the villain is the ai,2023-07-13
we still need to see part 2 to have the whole picture cause basically we only have half of it but as of now all three in mcq filmography are really close,2023-07-13
i feel like im the only one who thinks 3 was best,2023-07-15
"as a massive fan of the franchise this really covers my thoughts

i’d also add a minor complaint that there is so much exposition but i guess there needs to be to describe such a complex villain",2023-07-16
the best one is rogue nation imo then mi1 then fallout or ghost protocol,2023-07-12
"i saw fallout at home  so for me dead reckoning tops it by just a little 

granted fallout had way more action and lot more twists crammed into it but this one’s story felt more streamlined and no need to over think it    

i should say fo was fantastic and dr was excellent  i suppose i don’t know how to rank them ",2023-07-15
"rogue nation is the best one
better story amazing femme fatale plotline the opera scene is outrageous",2023-07-16
"i think credit is due given the massive disruptions to this production from the pandemic 

agreed fallout slightly edges it but the ai narrative that was likely conceived years ago is so timely right now",2023-07-28
not the universal consensus at all,2023-07-12
very well said,2023-07-12
i agree with all of this still a 45 and man was my theater hyped i’m looking forward to part 2,2023-07-15
so many beautiful women in suits looking incredible,2023-07-16
"i find that all the part 1s of movies  especially this year  seem to be bringing the general concesus to agree that although great scenes and performances the movies themselves dont feel as strong  probably because we are all watching incomplete movies lol

this one although i loved it felt like it was a two parter just so they can have longer  and i mean longer set pieces 
that last sequence was 90mins alone  i know because after fast x and spiderverse me and my brother timed out our  break to happen at the slow exposition dump before the 3rd act",2023-07-17
for sure mcquarries weakest to be fair very hard to top top gun and fallout,2023-07-21
great summary i agree,2023-07-23
"why 96 on rotten tomatoes then noone was bothered by any of this

this was mostly a comedic carchase movie for me the plot didnt resonate so much",2023-07-24
"heavy action oriented second half 

wasnt half of this movie one continuous action sequence that car chase was long as ",2023-10-16
don’t know if this is consensus but i wouldn’t call it strong narrative everything about the entity is pretty much just classic mcguffin goobledigook i don’t really understand anyone’s objectives and motivations other than hunt having to save everyone and his team supporting him,2023-07-15
"fallout is overrated ilsa was always a wildcard character waiting to be killed off and cavill wasnt a villain he was a henchman on a powertrip

also fallout is overrated  you people are just parroting what everyone else says",2023-07-16
ghost protocol best one don’t sleep on bird,2023-08-11
what i thought the universal condes was that the movies have gotten better and better with this one being it’s best,2023-10-11
i had a feeling theyd  her off but that send off was so bad i think shes alive shes been such a critical piece to the franchise giving her 5 lines was very disappointing,2023-07-12
very much same about ferguson something feels very off about it either she really did not want to be in this franchise anymore or there is some big fakeout happening,2023-07-12
this is my biggest issue with an otherwise excellent movie she received so much development in the previous two films to the point that i was convinced she would take the helm of the franchise post time cruise and i was excited for that total badass and a joy to watch on screen not to mention excellent chemistry with everyone in the cast i’ve just finished watching it and that is the most salient takeaway of the whole film extremely underwhelming cheap death hoping for a “had to fake it to save you” return but i don’t expect it in the next one,2023-07-13
i don’t think she dead,2023-07-12
"she was so adorable with her eyepatch

i just wanted them to live in the desert together forever",2023-07-14
its what they do when they want to add gravitas and stakes gabriel killing a woman close to him again is how they elevate the villany even more than with lane so that the final fight gets hype,2023-07-13
i actually liked the decision to  ilsa which is wild because she was one of my favorites going in i thought it solidified the idea from fallout and mi3 that being that close to ethan puts you in major danger a similar idea is mentioned by kittridge at the end about grace,2023-07-12
you didn’t think it had too much exposition about the  ai thing,2023-07-12
"yeah its such a shame she has to go for whatever reason story writing or other commitments

but i feel it would be even worse if she comes back  faking death twice in 2 hours  
her death needs to mean something given her importance to ethan

i hope the writers can come up with some good explanation if they bring her back",2023-07-22
yeah shes been a more badass character than ethan for a while now killing her off was a mistake  unless thats why they did it lol  that seems like it would be a tom decision,2023-07-26
her character was tied to lane in the previous two films there was really nowhere else to go with her just my opinion,2023-07-29
it’s really hard to top fallout that’s a masterpiece  one of the best action films i’ve seen in the last several years this is a solid entry but fallout is my favorite,2023-07-12
"yeah this kicked  

between this movie and the first mi film we learned sleight of hand is extremely important for imf agents in an alternate universe david blaine easily outpaces ethan hunt as the goat agent for the imf",2023-07-12
it’s was really the perfect birthday gift for me,2023-07-12
i rewatched fallout last night and i do think it looked sleeker and was filmed a bit better but there was something about this one that just flowed better and was more fun felt more like classic mi,2023-07-12
"fallout is just banger after banger after banger it’s pretty ridiculous how every action scene in that film is as good as it could be whether it’s the halo jump bathroom brawl paris chase helicopter chase etc

don’t get me wrong the action in this film is of course great but fallout is better paced so it felt like we were constantly getting pummeled with some of the most intense action on film

whereas i can only remember three set pieces from part one rome chase venice fight basejumptrain and unlike fallout where every setpiece blows our mind the train sequence is the only one where i went “holy  ” rome and venice were intense but nothing too crazy just wildly entertaining and in between the action in this film is a whole lot of setup and no resolution until part two

in the end it’s hard to judge this one with fallout because fallout was a complete story and resolution whereas this story is obviously not yet complete

i’m very ready for part two and i hope some theaters screen both back to back for a complete picture",2023-07-13
but i really hard to accept that almost everyone who hold the key just keep it in the pocket and then got pickpocket by othersseveral time eventhough that key worth billions of dollar felt like the idea of them clumsily losing the key did not jive with the character of them as super agents,2023-07-12
"such a good and funny movie  the sequences with tc and atwell reminded me of knight  day

hard to rank them but i would still put fall out and rogue nation above it  this sits firmly at third for me",2023-07-12
fully agree fallout was better but sort of unfair to compare it to a completed story part 1s always have this problem,2023-07-13
someone in my theater started sobbing when she died,2023-07-16
tom cruise knew this movie needed stakes his character is unbeatable we know that so if his character is unbeatable how do you get us to feel for him and his safety you dont you get us to care about everyone around him and you do that by taking one of them away,2023-07-14
i was literally begging them to  grace and not ilsa i really really hope she’s fake dead but if she’s not i think i’m done with the series,2023-11-01
i was more like frustrated didnt really dig the villain and i also couldnt buy that the ai knows each and every one of them so well that it is able to to calculate the absolute final fing destiny for everyone an ai can  will be able to do crazy calculations but this was just cheesy as ,2023-07-26
i have to say this is the most tense these movies have felt the nuke scene with benji i genuinely wasnt sure if they were going to  him off i could tell ilsa was going to die pretty quickly they telegraphed it hard but yeah it definitely hurt when it actually happened,2023-10-16
usually a second fakeout would feel cheap but i love rebecca ferguson and ilsa so much that i wouldnt give a  lol i just want her back,2023-07-15
for me it kinda cheapened the emotional ending to fallout where it seemed like they ended up together and then killed her in the 1st half of the next movie sort of an aliensalien3 situation here to me,2023-07-13
i feel the same way i think her character has so much more to explore and i am truly hoping that its a fakeout,2023-07-12
theyve really dug themselves into a hole either they bring rebecca ferguson back and it feels like a lame cop out two death fakeouts in one movie or they accept that shes gone her character has a really disappointing exit and atwell finds herself with huge shoes to fill,2023-07-15
agreed completely ruined the movie her death wasn’t even justifiable,2023-07-12
id be fine with it if they gave ilsa an awesome death and if grace was a cool character to replace her instead both were lame,2023-07-12
"with the mask tech and the ais mimicry ability she could always return in one form or another

i feel like the mask machine breaking hints that the entity has an interest in it",2023-07-17
i love ilsa but i honestly thought grace and ethan had more chemistry than ilsa and ethan not that i want them romantically involved but those two together were magnetic,2023-07-13
its okay benji buckled his seat belt,2023-07-12
its pretty easy to infer that the car is probably offline and has had any online capabilities removed,2023-07-12
 this was what i said  plus they are doing analogue comms but he clearly using gps to track the train and motorcycle  and then letting the car drive super weird the entity didnt step in im confused by the entitys powers,2023-07-14
"their lack of any technical knowledge constantly irked me right off the bat ethan explains to them what the entity is and how its basically infiltrated everything across the globe right then and there benji and luther should have decided to unplug everything or at the very least it should have been done after the airport scene it would have been cool to watch the team work through limitations of a lack of technology to walk them through everything would have been fun having them use analogue spycraft  like dead drops and hand signals etc for a mission

the fact that even after the thing literally invades ethans comms and misdirects him benji is still on a laptop using gps and trusting bmw to self drive itself with a car that i assume connects to the net and gps systems is super silly",2023-07-17
i think it was a reshoot needed to explain why there are scenes where he’s in the passenger seat so many things felt cobbled together like that,2023-07-15
thats why he looks over and buckles his seatbelt,2023-07-16
i literally thought that car was going to wait for ethan to land and then run over benji just to twist the knife he was standing right in front of it but i guess even this movie isnt that dark ,2023-07-17
same i didnt think the entity showed its effect enough in this film but i hope for more ghost in the shell like interference in the next one,2023-07-23
benji activating selfdrive  him and luther relying so heavily on satellite arrays had me going nuts youre using the enemys tools guys it knows everything youre looking at where youre going and what youre doing,2023-08-28
good ol botboy was either omniscient or inept depending on what the plot needed i dont think such a high concept idea works well in the mission impossible context in all honesty,2023-07-24
it seemed pretty obvious benjies car was going to pick up gabriel then it didnt,2023-08-01
" behind the scenes clips promoting it

after the last fallout trailer literally spoiling henry cavills character i stayed away from all promotional stuff for this one definitely gonna continue doing that for any movie im interested in",2023-07-13
" henry czerny

wait  so that makes kittredge 37 in the first movie man was making moves at the cia",2023-07-14
i personally thought the motorbike stunt was even better in the movie when it had context especially when tom cruise is already in the air trying to get to the train,2023-07-16
"there was an article about someone who watched the 3 hour early cut at a test screening who said there was “lots of cliff jumping”

i assumed there was a lot more filmed of ethan on the bike going up the establishing shot of ethan heading up the mountain made me think there would be some gnarly jumps on the way up that mountain and having to jump off some big cliffs to get to the top but knowing mcq and eddie hamilton are relentless in their edits they must’ve removed a bunch of that scene",2023-07-18
i’m surprised everyone likes fallout more than rogue nation,2023-07-16
im torn between hoping that its a misdirect and assuming they had to write her out because rebecca ferguson had scheduling conflicts as she has also been filming dune and her tv show silo guess well see when part 2 comes out,2023-07-12
and then hes immediately on to the next one it felt weird to me for sure,2023-07-12
"this was my biggest issue with the movie they had established a believable chemistry and rapport and she just gets killed why does he care so much about haley atwell compared to ilsa 

i’m sure it’s a scheduling issue but for the franchise it really threw me in the movie",2023-07-12
loved the movie all the actors were incredible but ilsas death was a dampener for me she barely had any lines as well that first scene in rogue nation made her a fav so i am biased tho but i hate that it felt like she was killed for man pain i know the whole point was to show the stakes how anyone could die but it still left a bad taste in my mouth,2023-07-12
that bothered me a lot too basically traded rebecca for hayley i wonder if rebecca had upcoming scheduling conflicts silo maybe i dunno but that really brought me down loved the ilsa character,2023-07-12
i also feel it has to be misdirection at the start of the film she pretends to be dead then is quickly back then she dies something just seems very off by it all the filmmakers are far to competent for what occurred,2023-07-12
it definitely felt forced was it rebecca wanted out was it the studio saying out with the old and in with the new and hayley,2023-07-12
i enjoyed and liked the movie except for this there’s just no way she would have lost that fight also gabriel is underwhelming,2023-07-12
" all that for her to be fridged 

i cant believe that in this day and age bigbudget maledominated franchise movies are still doing this to their sole female characters while i otherwise enjoyed this movie intensely i felt nothing in that moment but shame",2023-07-12
between this and me thinking atwell’s character was pretty generic i wasn’t a fan of this one ilsa was a such a badass woman and they got rid of her for no reason,2023-07-12
she is in the cast of part 2 on imdb  but could be for flashbacks yeah she better come back,2023-07-12
does anyone know if people have seen her on the set of part 2 i know they didnt film back to back but she may have been able to sneak around and hopefully film some parts before the movie came out,2023-07-12
"they spent a lot of screen time on showing us those knives and making sure we knew they were switch blades 

and then two things stood out as odd grace master of sleight of hand showed him the second knife before attacking him with it and then ilsa getting stabbed with it i was sure the blade was switched in so maybe it’s a big fake out to fool the entity",2023-07-12
maybe they faked her death so that the entity wouldnt be able to anticipate her in the next movie probably a cope but you never know,2023-07-12
"i knew she was going to die as soon as they started making googly eyes at each other ethan isn’t allowed to be happy

i don’t think it’s out of character though they’re not just saving a random person they’re saving the person the mission depends on ilsa knew that hunt knows that which is why he is sad and angry but moves on immediately to focus back on the mission",2023-07-12
yep i agree i have a big crush on rebecca ferguson but that aside it felt strange that she died and then two mins later the group is recruiting a replacement of sorts with grace i think they should have let those moments right after be more devastating also felt weird that gabriel tried to get ethan to pick who he “cared for the most” between elsa and grace at the club he practically just met grace,2023-07-12
mi is not afraid to lovingly troll the audience and i am really hoping this is the longest con of them all otherwise what a letdown for this otherwise awesome franchise like there is no way they are immediately swapping romantic leads like this… it just feels weird,2023-07-12
i assumed the worst when i started noticing at the early venice scenes just how little she actually is in the movie and how even when she is there she doesnt have much to say combine that with the actress starring in her own tv show and they were probably struggling to find a way to give her an exit after establishing her as the primary ally to ethan in the past two movies the end of fallout established that they are together for good rather than her only being there for the syndicate story with how good their chemistry was and how they are both experienced members of the spy world but scheduling issues had them press a big undo button its a shame because ilsa felt like the one female lead who really belonged in all the action and wasnt a damsel in distress or just a romantic interest,2023-07-12
uhh what they spent the whole first half of the film foreshadowing her death the previous scene in the club they litterally said one of them will die all things leading up to this also included building up the entity as all seeing and all knowing meaning the outcomes it predicts are inevitable and ethan cant do anything to stop it,2023-07-12
"wouldnt say it was completely random but it felt a little rushed yeah not given the full build upweight she barely spoke between the club to her death and she got bested what seems way too easily when we saw over 2 movies how fully capable she is at least give her a few hired goons to take on first

partly also didnt think the villian to take her out was that good per se out of the mi villians hes so far more a mi 2 or 4 blandness instead of a 3 5 4 1 impactacting wise even with that added backstorysorry esai morales probably will be better in part 2

sad to see her leave but thats just like my opinion man",2023-07-12
yeah definitely reeks that it was fake and she is somehow gonna still be alive i don’t know how they would do that but i’d like to see them try in a way that’s not just a mask,2023-07-12
yeah it was rushed but i felt like it one of the intended effects was to make things more difficult for ethans team we go from this having this badass on our side to a thief that cant do anything really makes things more challenging especially when ethan cant also enter the train normally to help her,2023-07-12
 overwatch exposition on the entity  being defeated by gabriel seemed a bit thin,2023-07-12
i think that’s a  plot point the franchise definitely took a huge l if they traded rebecca ferguson for haley atwell i’ll never like this character because she’s not ilsa,2023-07-15
i thought so tooi thought given all the time they spent telling us this woman is badass in the other films and them they give her some weakass opponent who does her in with a knife all so they can build ethans back story  they did her dirty she deserved a better ending maybe even a permanent place on the team i will miss her character,2023-07-16
dude i have bigger questions like where exactly did the key go from where to where,2023-07-12
yeah it really felt like a slap in the face to everything they built… out with the old in with the new also what’s the point of the first fake out if she was only going to be in like 6 minutes of the movie and to die like that we’ve watched her  two top spies in the last 2 movies so it felt really anti climactic and just a waste of a great character,2023-07-16
yeah i didn’t like that either like anyone with a sword knows to keep your distance and use the reach she was using the sword like a knife,2023-07-19
" i felt like ilsas death was random and out of blue like i felt confusion rather than sadness 

i just saw this movie with a friend and he was making fun of her after the movie saying he could have done better given that the sword would have had much better reach than the knife",2023-07-24
i don’t get that complaint they definitely set it up for one the gals to die and i’m sure most people knew who it was going to be now they way they handled her death was pretty terrible the quick cut away from her to ethan’s slow revelation just killed all the emotion,2023-07-12
aging is a ,2024-03-17
i didnt think it was rushed it was hinted throughout before the club scene but after she returned to rome,2023-07-12
"i saw it coming she barely had much screen time in first half and with us already knowing this was going to be a cliff hanger going into the movie someone was bound to die and sad as it was she was the obvious choice 
haley is new blood and well freaking gorgeous in this movie so they weren’t going to off her",2023-07-12
"i actually wouldnt have minded if she did really just bite it in the desert  i think shes in too many movies and her relationship with ethan makes it hard for her to be one of the boys  if his reaction to her dying then was as genuine as how he acted then it wouldnt have made a difference to the story

bringing her back in to take her out simultaneously made her overstayed and pointlessly short if anyone gets my meaning

i dont think ethan needs to hate gabe more seems like hes got that down anway",2023-07-12
"i think that’s how people should go out as often as not i think the most tropey way to go about it would be for her to severely wound the guy then she gets killed and the bad guy limps away and she says her last words to ethan before croaking out a death rattle and shuffling off her mortal coil and then ethan’s like “khaaaaaaaannn” that would  

anyway not all deaths have to be at the climax of a film in fact it’s probably better when they’re not i think there’s still a third of speed left when jeff daniels buys it and that’s as out of the blue as it gets at least she doesn’t get it as bad as the girls from the second or the last rambo pictures their deaths are just casual plot points written solely drive men to revenge in this case ilsa makes a good show of it but ultimately the other guy is just better it’s fine",2023-07-12
i mean in the movie they predicted a 50 chance for her death so it was not out of the blue,2023-07-12
it didn’t feel out of the blue for me but the build up for it in the club was unnecessary for me would have been fine if ilsa just stepped in at that time as she was chasing grace too,2023-07-16
i dont think shell be back they already psyched the audience out by making us think she died in the beginning of the movie,2023-07-12
it would be a surprise if she came back because the first film is one of the scenarios the entity plays out trying to make sure it comes out on top so pt 2 will be the actual conclusion with ilsa still alive but then were gonna lose someone else then probably ethan ,2023-07-12
they spent the whole movie foreshadowing her death how was it out of the blue ,2023-07-12
two fakeout deaths would be lame,2023-07-13
thats life and thats why the death was painful for me,2023-07-14
yeah i suppose it made sense within the movies logic the entity needed gabriel to  someone else ethan loved i guess but i dont understand the logic of making that the logic of the movie shes been an essential part of the past few movies and i had a hard time getting hyped about hayley atwell despite her great performance because she felt like a shooedin replacement for ilsa,2023-07-14
its enough of a feat she got 2 let alone 3 movies before ethan got bored of her,2023-07-15
as somebody who did not know this character beforehand it felt good to give the hero stakes but i understand you,2023-07-20
"im bummed she was killed off but im thinking it might have been done for the following reasons

1 she might not actually be dead and there is a long play at hand but that is unlikely
2 shes a super popularin demand actress so im assuming dune part 2 and silo made it is she couldnt really play a larger part",2023-07-14
yes no elaborate heist plan at all thats what i was looking forward to so much in an mi film and i was so disappointed it was missing,2023-07-15
"the biggest heist in this movie is hayley atwell coming in and just stealing the movie 

she really impressed me",2023-07-15
yes it really didn’t give the whole “spy movie” vibe,2023-07-16
agreed,2023-07-28
her stock picked up a lot after she made her appearance in mission impossible rogue nation ten years ago so it makes sense she’d want to get out of a franchise if it impacted her getting other parts,2023-07-16
was it a i gotta go film dune 2 situation,2023-07-18
why is it so weird  ever since her entry shes been portrayed as the dubious linchpin 3rd wheel friend with benefits thats always in the right place at the right time mary sue  shes basically ethans parallel and you can only have 2 protagonists running the show for some time  shes clearly not a bond girl archetype so im confused why everyones so attached to her,2023-07-16
"i know people miss cruise bringing in different directors to change up the style of these movies with each entry but i feel mcquarrie just gets tom cruise and his film persona in a way that no other filmmaker does and is thus able to craft these movies accordingly 

he has done it for 4 mi movies  he did uncredited rewrites on ghost protocol and he did for top gun maverick",2023-07-12
i also was just thinking about how much i want all the extended behindthescenes makingof featurettes about the train sequence,2023-07-12
it was better for me on a second viewing on the first viewing i was slightly disappointed with it and i’m not sure why,2023-07-15
feels like it was the first role where atwell was in a current setting because she always seems to have played in past times,2023-07-12
"hollywood doesn’t offer female action stars a lot of opportunities unfortunately

i still think carrieanne moss deserved a lead action movie role outside of the matrix  should have been a huge star",2023-07-12
"  so why the  did it take this long for hayley to land a huge role like this

thats just hollywood for you",2023-07-12
as a big mcu fan i was shocked by how much more fun it looked like she was having compared to being sharon lol like they actually gave her a personality and things to do and you can tell she’s loving it,2023-07-16
im only speculating  here but im pretty sure its because she didnt wanted to do  scenes in other project and got blacklisted,2023-07-17
exactly,2023-07-12
oddly enough there was actually a female agent carter in ghost protocol played by paula patton,2023-07-19
gabriel was an incredibly boring villain to me becuase he was too flawless and then at the end did a 180 from that into a fistshaking parody that may as well have been screaming mendozaaa just a complete lack of nuance and complexity,2023-07-18
"lane was better in fallout but weak imo in rogue nation
hoping gabriel is better in part 2",2023-07-17
don’t forget dune ii coming this fall she’s on fire,2023-07-12
her death was so unnecessary,2023-07-14
i could easily see her death being a fake out tbh,2023-07-12
perhaps this means we’ll get a reunion with paula patton wonder why she was a one and done mi team member,2023-07-12
"would’ve been nice if her mi character had a better send off

they basically gave her 5 lines acted like the last two films didn’t happen killed her off and then ethan just forgets she existed

what the  that made me angry because it just trashed that whole arc",2023-07-15
silo pretty good,2023-07-15
silo is a masterclass in mystery she’s so good,2023-07-12
had to scroll down very far but i agree with your take i just dont see this movie even being close to fallout like some are saying,2023-07-17
"totally agree  i just dont understand the positive response the movie has been getting  
i thought this was embarrassingly bad compared to fallout  

glad you mentioned the fight choreography 
i though that was all terrible as well  especially compared to all of the scenes in fallout

i cant believe how much weaker this film was on almost every level

the plot of dead reckoning is trash",2023-07-15
had exactly the same thoughts compared to the possibility of what can be done which was seen with fallout this just really missed the mark so many things are off with this one,2023-07-22
totally agree i am surprised by the rotten tomatoes score it might be my least favorite if youre going to have a lot of dialogue at least make it interesting like 1 how many car chases down a european city street can we see  give me dueling helicopters,2023-07-27
oh it was great adding to that scene i actually loved the idea of grace as a part of the criminal world but completely inept at the spy world,2023-07-12
"my theatre was filled with laughter from cruise crashing it to them switching places when it flipped it was top notch comedy i personally loved

go straight

turns left

or go left youre doing great",2023-07-12
that whole car chase really evoked some roger moore bond lol it was so unexpectedly funny,2023-07-12
yes you are the only one who laughed the only one millions of viewers and youre the only one who found it funny,2023-07-12
yeah imo this is one of the funniest mission impossible movies my theater was laughing throughout the jokes,2023-07-12
my theater started giggling when the little yellow car almost hits them as it pulls out and it built near continuously through till cruise shows up trying nonchalantly hide the steering wheel as he walks past the police,2023-07-12
pom’s reaction during that whole thing was also hilarious,2023-07-12
most of the comedy in this movie landed really well,2023-07-12
"i was cracking up from when they didn’t get the grey ferrari f12 berlinetta and instead got a yellow sardine can  nothing but comedy from there on out 

the part where he false starts and she’s consoling him like “it’s okay”  ",2023-07-15
the showing i went to played a behind the scenes reel before the film that spoiled the yellow fiat scene talked about grace being handcuffed to ethan and showed the clip of the fiat popping out from the behind the sports car why would they do that to a group about to watch the film,2023-07-12
i think this was lowkey one of the funniest mi movies thus far,2023-07-12
i was almost crying because of that scene it felt lke they butchered the whole movie with this and the whole car chase the whole cinema laughing for 10 minutes straight was awful i went to watch a mission impossible movie not some comedy bullcrap,2023-07-13
"my theater was cracking up

the whole car char scene was alot of fun to watch",2023-07-14
"such a tense scene  then bam some gut busting humour out of nowhere 

i didnt have little yellowcar  burnouts on my bingo card",2023-07-12
"yeah the audience in my showing really lapped it up 

intentional",2023-07-12
everyone in my theater was laughing lol i prefer stuff like that instead of a rolling bomb plowing down the streets of rome ,2023-07-12
my girlfriend left the bathroom during the scene and i had to explain why it was funny i’m considering going again just so she can see it,2023-07-12
definitely a laughoutloud moment i think i laughed harder because i was laughing i didnt expect to laugh in this movie so that was kinda shocking in a great way,2023-07-12
no it was fantastic,2023-07-20
had to wipe tears from laughter especially when pom stares at them thinking what the actual ,2023-08-18
finally live action choroq movie,2023-07-12
a lot did when i watched it,2023-07-12
that scene was overt comedy it was hilarious as was the obvious erectile dysfunction joke with ethan apologizing to her for not being to start up the car while shes handcuffed to him and all up in his personal space,2023-07-15
reminds me of fast and furious 7 with dom and ramsey,2023-07-16
the way balfe incorporates the original theme is golden,2023-07-12
so interesting i felt disappointed in this soundtrack vs fallout’s which i’ve spent the last 7 years obsessed over i’ll definitely have to give it some solid listening to,2023-07-12
"when the movie started i looked up real quick on imdb to see who the composer was smile came across when i saw it was lorne again he smashed fallout out of the park 

but now seeing the movie i dont really recall the music much in dr but i plan to see it again so definitely will try to listen to the music more next time",2023-07-12
"balfe is…fine but no other score in this franchise has come close to joe kraemer’s work on rogue nation that one towers above them all

balfe just feels like a school of zimmer alumni kraemer   and also giacchino for that matter  are the composers who seemed to understand that they were composing music for a spy adventure",2023-07-15
"wow then i’m going to make the hottest take ever it was one of my cons my  if i hear the same mission impossible theme in every piece of music i might snap it felt beyond uncreative and just plain lazy it’s not good it’s iconic it’s not getting me hyped it’s making me realize yea this is a mission impossible movie and i’m seating in a theatre 

and if their wasn’t any mission impossible theme playing it just felt like a standard action movies soundtrack completely forgettable and i could not hum you the tune even if their was a gun to my head

but as i can see very unpopular happy that most enjoyed it guess it just wasn’t for me",2023-07-16
it felt like it belonged in a christopher nolan movie had to double check it wasnt hans zimmer,2023-07-13
bits reminded me of danny elfmans batman score and bits reminded me of the final fantasy 7 theme,2023-07-12
"lorne balfe

love learning about new movie  composers i havent followed before ",2023-07-14
anyone know if the music in the trailer has been released,2023-07-15
fallouts soundtrack felt distractingly similar to the dark knight rises this one felt more mission impossible to me,2023-07-15
bruh,2023-07-15
all the leading women in this one are awesome i was really impressed with kirby and klementieff in particular,2023-07-12
i was intrigued and loved the easter egg when i logged it last night,2023-07-12
it’s really amazing how a film franchise that’s now 6 in is this good still looking forward to part ii and what stunts they have lined up,2023-07-12
what happens on letterboxd i didnt notice anything,2023-07-12
what’s the easter egg i logged in mobile don’t think i saw anything,2023-07-12
i logged it and nothing happened,2023-07-12
just put in my letterboxd review on my phone while walking through a nightly city listening to the soundtrack this put such a  smile on my already grinning face,2023-07-13
exactly,2023-07-12
chatgpkey lol,2023-07-12
i kept getting her confused with minnie driver from the 90s for some reason lol,2023-07-14
atwell was unnecessary  ilsa could have played out the same role and it would have made more sense,2023-07-23
i would rather have her killed than rebecca ferguson,2023-07-14
what was the easter egg i just logged it and nothing out fo the ordinary happened,2023-07-13
letterboxd easter egg when you log,2023-07-15
what happens when you log it i must have missed it but i was also tired i didn’t see anything,2023-07-15
i watched all of them this week for the first time and it is unreal how once you get to mi3 the franchise kinda just hits the ground running  on abrams all you want but he set the mold for this series and bird and more importantly mcquarrie have done a lovely job continuing upping the ante it’s not my favorite franchise but it is definitely up there for the spectacle alone,2023-07-16
what was the easter egg  i just logged it and it didnt do anything for me,2023-07-25
terrible misstep for the franchise if shes dead like that im holding on to the hope that its a fakeoutdeathbyknifeonabridge as another callback to mi1,2023-07-12
please because if thats how she goes out i stg im gonna lose it killing her off especially in that way is just bad writing and undoes a ton of character development from rogue nation and fallout for no reason,2023-07-12
maybe tom will use his mummy powers to bring her back,2023-07-14
yup…haley atwell almost sounded like lisa in the train also tom randomly develops the feels for a girl he just met…also they went extra  making us hate haley’s character almost like a brat kid who won’t listen to instructions,2023-07-13
given the entity mimicking benji the mask machine mysteriously breaking and multiple references to the fact that it knows everything ilsa might come back just not in the form you think she will,2023-07-22
sure better be,2023-07-23
i sure hope so i  cried she better not be dead dead,2023-11-01
first comment i’ve seen on here acknowledging the tonal shift of this movie i’m on the opposite end though i hated the shift it felt very reminiscent to mi2 with melodramatic line delivery and reactions felt like a cinema student’s brainchild in that they wanted the viewer to know every line was very serious and important,2023-07-12
the first 40 minutes of fallout is just exposition,2023-07-12
it seems they really missed a good opportunity for a steam boiler explosion with the locomotive crashed i guess it was probably getting pretty cool though and didn’t have much pressure after gabriel killed the guy shoveling coal as the fist thing he did to take over the train how on earth did he expect it to run away when he’d just cut off the fuel source,2023-07-13
its very wellpaced i think having solid locations for a decent duration helps a lot like theres not a lot of cutting between different plots in different areas of the world its very singular focused,2023-07-12
i didnt realize it was over i thought there was going to be one more action set piece to hit the almost 3 hours,2023-07-12
kinda wild you guys just cheer and applaud during movies,2023-07-12
i couldn’t stop laughing at how chaotic that was i live,2023-07-12
thats the only part that felt a bit fast and furious for me a little too unbelievable for this series,2023-07-12
" ethan hunt crash landing into a moving orient express saving grace from being shot

while i definitely liked the stunt i thought it felt really out of place in a mi movie

normally everythings calculcated and planned and this just felt very random and lucky

i did laugh and cheer though",2023-07-12
the only long part was the chase in rome it was amusing to see it go so horribly but i felt it went on too much,2023-07-12
you have to have a lot of grounded and realistic action sequences to sell the ridiculousness of tom cruise flying through a train window to crush a guy right before hes going to shoot if the whole movie is stunts like that its dumb but they played that card once and that was perfect,2023-07-12
"i’m so mad he did a real stunt and then they threw a tonne of fake cg rocks foliage and bad roto and took me out of it 

guys you don’t have to touch up every scene",2023-07-12
"…american cinema etiquette is so weird to me

i’d be so annoyed if i’m trying to watch a movie and people are clapping and cheering",2023-07-16
it was great because none of us saw it coming im so glad that wasnt spoiled in the trailers i almost leaped straight outta my chair,2023-07-14
my favorite was hunt just plowing a guy over while his motorcycle while grace is recovering in the crashed car,2023-07-16
i could’ve watch that train scene go on forever might be my favorite set piece in the series,2023-07-12
ethan being the biggest empath in the world didnt sit right with me he will  dozens of people without blinking an eye but a random thief all of a sudden is the most important person in the world,2023-07-12
fallout is very tough to beat and to be fair dead reckoning isn’t a finished story unlike fallout,2023-07-12
 yes the train car climb went on forever we were joking after that they’d reach a train car full of zoo animals next and then a train car full of old ladies,2023-07-12
could the entity have been feeding whigham the location info,2023-07-12
i think a major part of why this one doesnt seem as good as the predecessor is because its a part one we dont really get a conclusion here and were left with more questions than answers,2023-07-12
" gabriel positing that ethan would have to choose between ilsa someone who he’s had a history with for the past couple movies and grace essentially a random pickpocket he met a day or two ago… 

thats what i was thinking too at first but then i realized that gabriel thought that ethan thought that grace was the only one that knew where the key was even though ethan did know where the key was so the conundrum was either  your close friend to ensure finding the key or  the only one that knows where the key is to save your close friend",2023-07-13
i dont think of it as a sophies choice situation saving both is impossible but this is ethan hunt thats what hes there to do  the impossible i think the fact that he didnt do it  the impossible  is part of why people dont like the death because ethan failed still could be a second faked death i feel it would be a more brutal stabbing if she was 100 dead but then again i dont see gabriel being that incompetent,2023-07-12
"the sophie‘s choice scene really creaked when gabriel had to throw in „oh btw grace has the key and ilsa doesn’t have  so maybe take that into account“ to somehow try to balance the scale 

and then it doesn’t matter anyway because at no point does ethan or anyone do any choosing gabriel says something like „i hoped it would be you“ when ilsa shows up but mate you could have just killed grace she’s just there and unconscious maybe that’s a point about determinism and free will that i am not really getting to but that’s the whole film in a nutshell the dialogue is complete hokum but the design the stunts and the physical performances in that sequence mostly cruise and klementieff are top notch",2023-07-15
its been a while since ive seen the other movies why was ethans wife not in the equation i remember a few movies ago showing hes secretly still involved in her life but surely the entity would know,2023-07-12
regarding the choice between ilsa and grace i think the whole point there is that ethan would never let any one die hes going to try to do everything in his power to save every life especially that of his teammates but also even a random stranger remember how torn and broken he was when that random female police officer was gunned down in fallout  so when grace later tells him you dont even know me why would you want me to join you he replies does it matter,2023-07-12
agreed on the climbing through the train bit at the end it started bordering on parody for me because of how long it was going on for lol,2023-07-12
the falling train car before the last one was great looking and then the last one was suddenly mostly bad cg for some reason definitely went on too long,2023-07-12
i think it was literally one train car too many and to top it off with another one of hunts damsels saving him out the blue idk but lame it was a cool sequence tho,2023-07-15
" and three i know ethan cares about people in general but gabriel positing that ethan would have to choose between ilsa someone who he’s had a history with for the past couple movies and grace essentially a random pickpocket he met a day or two ago… treating those potential deaths as emotionally equivalent struck me as odd is all of course having to make an active choice to say  grace isn’t something ethan would do but it felt like the movie was treating it as some sophie’s choice

i said the same thing while talking to my friend afterward im seeing it again tonight so maybe my thoughts will change but i just couldnt buy into this part of the story at all i know ethan doesnt want to lose anyone on these missions but he and ilsa have an implied  relationship grace is a pickpocket he just met and barely knows theyre not equivalent in any way",2023-07-16
mi4 was better than rogue nation,2023-07-12
samesies,2023-07-15
shea whigham was convinced tom cruise was the yellow king,2023-07-15
" two did the ‘climb up through a falling train’ sequence at the very end feel like it was one train car too many to anyone else started to feel a smidge too repetitive

i joked with my friend next to me that there would be 3 more hours of this infinity train style it never seemed to end 

there were a number of moments in this film that dragged on 2x longer than they should have some speeches some shots the car chase even felt too long why end the movie with the dramatic slow shot of the sub we know its there weve already seen the shot were not dumb we know where part 2 is going overall the movie was just too long",2023-08-19
my whole theater had the same problem with the early screening last night why are you showing us the best stunts in the movie right before we watch the movie we just paid for tickets to watch,2023-07-12
"there were a few more clunky parts here that kept it from being as sharp as fallout 

movie was dope but i thought it had some really strange editing choices like when the camera jump from the right side of kittridges face to his left in the middle of his exposition i rewatched fallout last week and didnt notice anything as glaring",2023-07-12
i always liked watching trailers and getting excited about movies but the amount of key elements they have been including lately past several years is just out of hand its now impacting my enjoyment of movies and  ive finally reached the point where i think im done with trailers and will do what i can to avoid them for any movie i think ill be seeing     no dead reckoning part 2 trailers for me if at all possible,2023-07-12
yeah during our early access screening last night they showed us those same behind the scenes videos and while i thought that was cool i felt like i was also getting spoiled beforehand i avoided the trailers and it took a bit away from me when i actually got to watch those scenes later during the movie,2023-07-12
"i dont think it needed to be as long as it was probably couldve cut 15 minutes off

at some points i did feel that the fights had less impact compared to fallout i think it mightve been the editing",2023-07-12
"i got those sneak previews too  i thought it was fine but i definitely couldve gone without 

although now knowing they actually filmed at the spanish steps i keep thinking how much damage they mightve done to the steps with the cars or if most of that was elsewhere and they just filmed the bottom of the stair sequence there",2023-07-12
thats why rogue nation stands out so much for me the marketing revolved around a stunt from the opening sequence and that was a morsel of what was to come,2023-07-12
we got the entire bike jump in trailers only the part where he was talking while falling was new,2023-07-12
bike jump was just okay anyway it used as hype because its tc doing the stunt,2023-07-12
as someone who never saw the bike jump until it happened on screen that  was amazing,2023-07-12
ive seen several people now saying on twitter that they liked it more the second time they watched it so im very curious to see how it will play when i see it again later this week,2023-07-12
showing the big stunt is the marketing for these movies,2023-07-12
"i was surprised how many issues i had with it because i really remember liking fallout  im trying to make a list and replying to your comment because its the first one by top with any criticism

  

movie felt a bit too campy even for them  everything is a wink  it undercuts it

some lines were unnecessary like duh we get it  i cant remember the specific line but its from vingh rames and made me feel like yes you dont have to spell it out we get it

also just so much damned exposition in general  every other scene is a context dump where they just stand around telling us the story  felt like just chaining action sequences together with expo

he barely knows her  why care about her

her eyes are brown when the other woman has blue eyes  is that for our benefit like were idiots  her bodyguard doesnt immediately recognize that

why do the russians have to speak english with an accent and not just have russian with subtitles  it’s such a short scene too  is it maybe less impactful reading the reveal than hearing it

gabriel  as a villain and the shoehorned backstory is so forced and meaningless at this point in the series

quote from reddit they should have picked either the director of intelligence or kitrich to be on the train having both got slightly confusing in trying to understand who is on what side  we dont know if purposeful or not

the true villain being the entity just falls flat  it sounds like theyre talking about an alien  does everything have to be about ai now

cool action sequences as usual but the overuse of cgi feels cheap",2023-07-14
they showed it ahead of showing the film in my cinema and then it was shown again in the opening titles far too much,2023-07-15
"unfortunately its due to marketing its always an issue when cruise does a big  stunt the studio will show it to death in order to hype the film 

i tuned out of all the trailers and featurettes after the first teaser in order for me to keep my first viewing fresh 

and yes i agree its not as good or as tight as fallout as that film just builds and builds to a great crescendo",2023-07-12
exactly and we were shown this  bike jump like a trillion times for the last 2 years or whatever i dunno man i remember feeling way more invested and tense at mi2s intro with cruise climbing and hanging off a mountain cliff,2023-07-14
"the trailers have been a real problem for this one i feel theyve been in the cinemas for at least 14 months since top gun maverick came out and i must have seen the trailer at least 10 times which meant that the majority of the stunt sequences it was a case of watching waiting for them to get to the key scenes that are already burnt into my memory the only actions sequence that felt relatively fresh was the airport stuff as whilst there are a few shots of that in the trailer i feel they didnt give away quite so much

based on my experience in theory id like to avoid the trailer for part 2 but unless i disconnect from the internet and dont go to any movies in the next year thats not going to be possible the trainbike stunt for example i cant imagine theres many people in the world who havent seen clips of that by now",2023-07-15
ilsa was on the chest paris was lower down so i guess easier to survive that,2023-07-12
cruise and mcq are far too competent to make such an absolutely nonsensical decision the only possible reason is her wanting or scheduling issues with dune and silo s2 or a fakeout which i’d love to see be the case she has already shot scenes for part 2 but that’s more than likely flashback a lot of shooting is remaining so they could very well change the way they are going and bring her back,2023-07-12
"shes currently on the list of actors for part 2 on imdb but i have no idea how official that is although its pretty updated as hannah waddingham and nick offerman who were confirmed to be in part 2 are on that list that being said even if they show a quick two second clip from the fight as an example she still has to get credited 

but yeah i really loved ilsas character",2023-07-16
"we surely watched different movies it was almost non stop action   some exposition   action etc in the mi 1 ethan reaches for his gun once this is a real spy thriller this part is nothing like it nothing

also i cant understand why fans of mi franchise dont bother that last two movies lacks infiltration mission which was until the fallout must  be in the franchise",2023-07-17
"mcquarrie brought her into the franchise and he can bring her right back out again whenever he wants remember that part in scream 2 where randy gets killed in the middle of the day in the middle of the movie 

if you always give people what they expect or what they want you might as well be making movies for marvel writers don’t owe viewers anything",2023-07-12
"i like your theory that they needed to deceive entity and get the most competent players off the grid i really hope ilsa isnt dead and gets to be extra badass integral to pt 2 

i do think that her fake death in the beginning makes a second fake death seem unlikely but maaaybe the entity is like hmm i saw the humans fake her death recently surely they wouldnt do the same thing twice therefore i accept her death this time ",2023-07-23
i had a total blast watching the movie and i am very much looking forward to part 2 but a lot of fun did come from my friend and i laughing at awful clunky dialogue weird cuts nonsensical decisions and  moments,2023-07-23
i actually thought they were going to play that scene straight and he was just a regular doordash guy who brought food to ethan ,2023-07-15

this one felt more confusing on the bureaucracy side i felt the same as you who is the current imf secretary,2023-07-12
i think the dni is playing dumb here because the ic didnt know what the lock was but he did my headcanon is that hes a new dni installed by the president that was moved from some secret project that didnt tell the ic they attacked the sevastopol so he actually knows all about the imf and the entity but needs to play dumb in front of the mostly apolitical career appointees of the ic because even in this movie the imf is clearly an open thing in the intel community the cia mooks know all about how many times ethan hunts gone rouge the opening mission statement of the secretary disavowing all knowledge only works if the secretary could hypothetically avow any agents of the imf which is hard to do if its so secret the dni doesnt know,2023-07-15
"i have one large complaint the point is made repeatedly that gabriel is the only person on earth who knows where the key fits to turn off the entity he cant be killed because he is the only person on earth who knows where the key fits to turn off the entity

then when paris is dying she tells ethan where the key fits to turn off the entity oops",2023-07-16
they just really needed those pockets that zip up,2023-07-13
yep the most important key in the world that i was just about to pay 100 million for let me just put that in my outside jacket pocket,2023-07-15

"one major criticism i have is that i feel the intro scene with the submarine should have been the intro to part 2

i get your point but i think it was important for us to see what the entity is capable of before we start the movie if you remove that scene the intro is just kittridge explaining ai which is a lame way to set up your villain watching the entity do its thing sets the vibe of the movie and puts you in the right headspace when this turns into a paranoid thriller",2023-07-12
" i loved that they brought back czerny and shot that awesome scene where ethan knocks out the meeting room of officials just to talk with him like a de palma scene with all those dramatic angles

that entire scene as soon as hunt enters the room was gold the subtle gas mask transfer kittridge quickly realizing whats about to happen the framing of kittridge with ilsas deceased photo in the background and kittridges sigh when he realizes how ethan is going to get out of the building",2023-07-12
have to completely agree with your criticism of the submarine beginning you knowing the location of the submarine while ethan does not is a bit annoying it should have been revealed in the train car however i hope we get an unreal underwater fight scene in part two because of it,2023-07-12
could anyone clarify why the entity is intent on retrieving the keys rather than obliterating them when gabriel possessed the keys he had the perfect opportunity to discard them in any trainlinking section he could simply have dropped them onto the tracks allowing the train wheels to crush them rendering them useless then no one else could gain access to the source code and as the entity is already disseminated throughout the cloud it seems a logical solution,2023-07-14
you make excellent points,2023-07-12
"the only thing underwhelming was the bike jump  

everything else was wonderful  sure it got to breathe more than the non stop plot twists and action in fallout but i thought this story was easier to digest and the set pieces were beautiful",2023-07-15
thanks  you’re my favorite movie critic,2023-07-16
oh  what didn’t you like about grace,2023-07-12
the entire framing seems to be that the sub is where the lock is but i bet thats a fakeout we know dunloe from mi1 is returning next movie we know he was sent to a cia station in the arctic the dni knew where the sub was  surely he could have had the chamber moved right,2023-07-15
"speaking of paris gleefully tearing through the city that really didn’t work for me it felt like it was taken out of a fast and furious movie her skirt her attitude the shots back to her during that scene it took away the menace and made it a lot more cartoony i ended up actually not minding what they did with paris by the end of it but that intro really struck the wrong chord with me a lot of scenes felt a bit more ff to me than mi which was a shame 

i totally get why that scene works for some people and why they included that characterization i see how it can work it just doesn’t work for me",2023-07-12

im with you the movie was definitely a disappointment for me for all the reasons you listed hope part 2 can deliver,2023-07-12
totally my experience its well crafted no doubt but i just felt a lot of the nonset piece scenes were fairly tedious with each round of entity discussion being fairly dull the one with kittridge cary elwes character and the rest of the intelligence leadership was especially hokey with everyone practically completing each others sentences fallout is a near perfect film and both rogue nation and ghost protocol are thoroughly enjoyable maybe a rewatch will help but this was definitely a step below those past entries,2023-07-12

i feel this too i love the mi franchise this felt somewhat mid compared to the franchise lineup also i thought some of the lines were poorly written andor the delivery was weird,2023-07-12
"same here its so confusing this is my favorite action franchise but right now my ranking would probably be something like 2137465 and yes you cant really fault the action per se its all well done but somehow it didnt really click for me what i found particularly odd was how so much of the train scene looked fake to me ive seen the video of them shooting on a real moving train i know they did it for real but then im looking at the background in many of those scenes and it looks fake maybe they replaced a lot of the background similar to the halo jump in the last one
also super odd for me the music didnt really do it for me in this one im quite a fan of lorne and i think his work in the last one was outstanding but here i just dont feel it
and yeah im wondering if i just couldnt enjoy the movie after the ilsa scene that was completely unnecessary",2023-07-13
the movies have just been a series of set pieces for quite a while now theyve never been all that strong with character as for villains i mean they had a great one with psh in iii and then nothing all that great before or after im going to  a lot of people for world peace is a thin motivation at the best of times using it three times in a row is just lazy,2023-07-12
the car chase with the fiat belonged in another movie,2023-07-15
"i mean her story kind of ran its course she isnt imf her motivation was getting sean harris mission accomplished plus everytime they meet her its because she is in over her head     

now im not saying they should have killed her i liked her a lot but unless she is joining imf where do you go with her in the future can she join imf as a british agent     

my issue with it is it felt like they are just replacing her with hayley atwell i loved hayley atwell in this but it does give a vibe like a team trading for a player",2023-07-12
"totally agree and i quite enjoyed fallout and even top gun for what it was so i felt safe going to this  i thought it was bad  im shocked how good the reviews were  i tried to put together a list of the gripes i could think of in the middle of the night here  i replied to this person with it

",2023-07-14
i think it’s definitely an expectations thing,2023-07-15
"if possible i do recommend a 2nd viewing movie makes more sense and where i thought there were weird inconsistencies they became more clear i somehow forgot there was seemingly another day between the rome car chase and venice party where grace was able to get the key from the random dude from the plane also knowing internally that its part 1 of part 2 filled out some unclearincomplete areas that led to overall greater enjoyment 

if part 2 sucks then ill take back what i said but yeah i rank it very close to fallout and in my top 3 fav mi movies surprised there are many comments not entirely fans of dr i also like the ai villain more so than just nuke going to be detonated plot thats every other mi movie real life computer viruses made by governments can do some wild things the ai plot made me think of this wendoverproductions vid ",2023-07-24

hm wonderful character i mean she was cool but she also served as the red herring for the ever fleeting true romance trope of the mission impossible franchise i was just doomed to fail her kicking the bucket after that bridge fight was pretty obvious imho because how else to build up poor sad ethan

unfortunately its too weird and unconventional for hollywood to do  its the biggest oh it was all a dream sort of move this franchise could possibly pull  

having said that i think everything being slow and stable with gabriel and more choppy with everyone else is a sound thematic choice  an ai should feel cold and steady and humans should seem more oh i dunnofrantic i guess  i didnt pick up on that while watching the movie but ill look for it on rewatch",2023-07-14
two days late but i just saw the movie last night then came here and saw your comment i agree 100 i spent almost the whole movie in that uncanny valley felt like something was off the entire time everything felt just one or two degrees too dramaticfunnyetc there was always something that left me in a questioning state and i feel like i need that paid off maybe like you said with it all being a simulation or i’m just going to have to say this was a bad movie,2023-07-15

i would watch the  out of a movie where she just murders people for money or for fun i don’t know why she does what she does don’t really care but we’ve never seen a character like that in this series and that’s refreshing,2023-07-12

" i think the dialogue in this is pretty bad

as others have mentioned it felt very expositiony this time",2023-07-12
the editing during the action felt different i think it way way more shaky and cut way too often the car chase while fun got very tiring because of this no wide shots of the action just close ups of the characters it felt like they sacrificed the quality of the rest of the action of the movie for the big bike stunt,2023-07-14
yeah i felt the same i think that this movie was good but fallout was way too good and thats why it feels like it didnt live up to my expectations when its actually a very good film  fallout is just superior,2023-07-18
didn’t follow fallout well for me either,2023-07-23

agreed i was really looking forward to seeing the chemistry between ilsa and grace,2023-07-12

i think the argument for bmw here is in their favor if anyone knows anything about germany you know that they absolutely despise the internet theres a great chance that this car hasnt been connected to the internet or updated since it left the factory and as a result is more likely to  benji from outdated software,2023-07-14
depends how connected to the internet the car is self driving doesnt necessarily need internet also the scene is clearly played for humor simon does a concerned look as hes unsure whether to trust the cars ai the scene references the very absurdity that bothered you,2023-07-15
they definitely forced her she did catch the audience but not enough to replace ilsa at all,2023-07-14
so they can make her tatas disappear with the mask but not change her eye color,2023-07-14
"my headcanon is that when her bodyguard saw her and said “you changed”
and she said “and you never will”
his look was initially skeptical of her and he probably noticed her eyes 

since she changed and told him “and you never will change” he probably fell into being a submissive goon to his boss after his initial skepticism 

it’s like he thought “she changed suddenly” then she said that thing to him 
then he thought “she probably has colored eye contacts for whatever reason but it’s best not to question her” you know as bosses do 

i think only people from the imfother spy agencies and people who were victim to the cloning masks would be aware of it so it makes sense that no one questioned her being she’s her like when someone says he’s him or hes that guy but for a woman",2023-07-14

that opening exposition dump after the sub scene was so painfully executed   i had a sinking feeling from there and once they killed ilsa in that  fight scene i was completely checked out emotionally  

this was such a dud for me that im in shock

ive loved every single entry in the series until now  and to think this is the plot they chose to stretch into 2 movies  ai as the big bad

the keys  are on the necks of the russian soldier and tge the body is retrieved later its explained at the end,2023-07-13
i really like that mcquarrie also continued the tradition of each movie looking visually different from the previous ones in addition to working with a completely different cinematographer just like he did for both fallout and rogue nation he also does some fresh stuff with the camera like utilize a lot of dutch angles which callback to the first movie of the franchise and big props to lorne balfe as well for managing to change up the score from the previous movie his music works really well for this movie while also managing to sound different from his score for fallout,2023-07-12
apparently i’m the only one who disagrees action was great but there were multiple dialogue scenes where i couldn’t tell who someone was looking at,2023-07-12
yeah mission impossible always keeps the viewers in the know of the action it seems not a lot of egregious shakycam even with scenes like cruise running or the alley way fight its easy to track the geography and choreography of every action scene,2023-07-12
oh man that higher ups scene… i started laughing at how easily they were finishing each others sentences,2023-07-12
"thank  for this comment i felt like my opinion was insane after seeing the high critic and audience scores and how wellreceived it seems to be in this sub too  it was probably my least favorite mission impossible film aside from 2 which was a real shame since every successive film has gotten better and better since 3 

you pretty much said everything i wanted to here—i’ll add that i found ilsa and ethan’s quasidate in venice before her last mission to be really cheesy and a bit ooc for the two of them also aside from the train all the stunts felt like a real rerun of the last 6 films and i’m no physicist but the way the train fell in the end seemed a bit implausible to me i understand that for some fans it might be a plus that this film pays homage to the old ones but to me it just felt uncreative after all the amazing stunts we saw in 6 

just overall a really disappointing installment in a series i love don’t think i’ll be seeing part two in theaters",2023-07-12
agreed,2023-07-12
"pretty much agree with all of this

"i hate to say it but i think i agree

the action was incredible but the story wasnt as good as some of the previous ones

"thank you its been driving me crazy how they portrayed ilsa in this movie and you nailed so many good points another thing is that not only is ethan apparently never going to have a relationship with a woman but its implied imf agents are like jedi knights like that none of them have any personal lives when they offer grace to join its treated like shell have to give up everything since when was that part of the imf 

in the third movie its like an office that you go to during the day then come home i always assumed ving rhames character was married or something but apparently theyre all excriminals who have given up any personal connections to be indebted to the imf forever thats a huge change in the entire franchise and completely made up in this movie theres nothing remotely like that in any past entries and its crazy they just drop that in the seventh film

this films is way dumber than people are saying massive changes to the lore bad characterisation realy goofy interpretation of ai he can predict everything but didnt realise ethan would pick his pocket so  just a huge disappointment",2023-07-17
i thought it was weird that the baddies set up that ethan would be forced to choose between the 2 women and my thought was  do i save the woman ive been in love with for years to the point i fought an entire team of international bounty hunters to save her or the thief i just met hmmm,2023-07-17
ilsa’s death was clunky and honestly ruined the film,2023-07-23
the vague nature of their relationship was always intriguing to me a departure from the on screen romances that blockbusters demand but youre totally right in the fact that they portrayed longing for each other the most in this movie and then hes like alright  gtg save grace  who flirts with me with her eyes and smirks too,2023-07-27
"gabriel was chosen by the entity because of his history with ethan ethan is clearly discomforted by gabriel and the entity appears to see ethan as his only threat  trying to throw ethan off his game im sure they’ll dive deeper into that in sequel  

is haley atwell on the team it finished with her asking to join the imf and her efforts in helping on the train proved to be a good trial

do agree that some exposition was not as tight as it should be especially compared to fallout which was basically 2 minutes of exposition and 2 hours of action",2023-07-12
i liked this movie butyeah i agree the grace character didnt feel like it belonged  and haley is a great actressbut every shot was just her with a weird  look like she has nothing going on inside  if you are unsure what i mean by the lookwhen you watch it again you will see,2023-07-12
"for what its worth i feel the same way as you its a complete surprise to me  the only other example i can think in recent memory where i walked into a movie absolutely expecting a great time and walking away as surprised as i am disappointed was doctor strange and the multiverse of madness i am a seriously easytoplease viewer

i rewatched the last three mis last week  and while i cant put my finger on it something just felt off with this one i spent a lot of time during the movie trying to figure out what it was  and that is part of the problem i found myself checking my watch a lot and was seriously tempted to walk out of the movie out of pure boredom  i have never walked out of a movie

i hate to cast such a wide net but it felt like a combination of a lack of urgency to the story a lack of caring what was going on odd editing choices it seemed like many sequences had an extra 10 of screentime added on after the onscreen action wrapped up as the characters just finished up like spending a lot of time working the gears between the train cars or the five times we cut to hunt still just putputting along on his little dirt bike in another nondescript dirt path in the woods radioing that he is still on the way  etc a very odd script and many sequences that for whatever reason just did not work for me 

an example that comes to mind is when hunt is fighting off the two folks in the claustrophobic alleyway while grace casually walks up to gabriel has a very choppy and uninteresting knife fight falls down a flight of stairs gabriel then stands there for a bit i suppose isla casually walks up has another pretty uninteresting fight is bested all in an absolutely empty uninspired uninteresting location was this a covid thing why are the dialog sequences  of which oh baby do we have dialog sequences that repeatedly explain what the entity is or isnt or where it is what it might do how it works  or may not work  what the key is  or isnt  abstract stakes of what might happen if x y or z scenarios take place opining about not only the key but the lock and the on and on and on  but why are these sequences such oddly cut every line of dialog a character says features them in a closeup or dutch angle cut to another character saying one more sentence then cut to another then another then another  where is everyone why is no one in the same shot why do none of the lines of dialog build on the previous and instead are declarative sentences about the entitychoicedecisionsfateetc where are the creatively blocked moments where cavill fergusson and cruise stand around looking simultaneously silly and totally badass how does the nightclub location in this movie look like such a lowrent version of the club sequence in the last one  with barely anyone actually in the club itself no interesting sets and what is the point of the winamp visualization of the entity showing up on the tv screens how did grace suddenly become hunts icon of not letting women die did they bond at some point why did ving not stand up during the entire movie why have an entire sequence dedicated to him sitting ethan down to talk with him about his need to disappear for the remainder of the movie so he can program in peace what is happening

i am going off on quite a tangent here  i just left very confused when i left the theater i sat down on a bench to look up if this was a new team or something  nope same folks who have repeatedly knocked it out of the park who i imagine have this whole mi thing down pretty well by now  but somehow my experience felt like a completely different type of movie made with far less craftsmanship it felt like watching an example of what mi as a franchise would be if it werent in the hands of cruise and his team  but it is mi to me has more often than not demonstrated that a standardissue summer action flick can actually be made with care and love and set a bar for the fast and furioustype projects to aspire to this one just felt like one of the other ones

i personally cant stand this selfindulgent trend of releasing only half a film going into a movie called part 1 just deflates all my expectations prior because they could never possibly make it feel like a satisfying and complete story i had the same criticisms with dune part 1 and across the spiderverse this movie was just too  long and while we get about 34 great action sequences in nearly three hours its not enough to hold its own as a great film we cant truly judge it until weve seen the second half and figure out what the  those keys unlock",2023-07-12
do you not remember toms talk on how the entity want gabriel to  ilsa and tom is the only one it is afraid of thus it set the whole drama up so tom would  gabriel in a fit of rage and fail the mission,2023-07-12
agreed,2023-07-12
yup after fallout i thought this might be similar or better this part is on par with rogue nation the humor in this one felt off and really unnecessary like the scene where the white widow wakes up and goes back down why show that scene multiple times,2023-07-12
agreed,2023-07-12
"i just watched it this evening finally and im pretty much on the same page as you 

almost every conversation was exposition sometimes two scenes in a row with the same expository dialog 

grace betrayed them so many times throughout the movie to invite her into the imf and put all hope for saving the world on her went against every instinct i as a viewer had while watching she was selfish but i guess because shes attractive ethan chose to trust her 

very disappointed mi and cruise always seemed to keep such a high standard mi2 being the arguable exception that im just baffled by so many of the choices in this movie  both with the characters and the writerseditorsdirectorsetc

it felt more like a marvel movie than mi",2024-01-07
i really dont think grace and ethan are meant to be shipped or the grace ne the girl he ends up with i feel like its more mentorstudent relationship and me personally got a big feeling that theyre setting her up for the future main character slot to get her own franchise,2023-07-15
completely agree,2023-07-23
i don’t think you’re supposed to “ship” anyone with ethan anytime he gets close to someone their life is in dangerthey die it why he had to leave julia killing ilsa gives the films stakes i’m actually surprised all these movies have gone by and they never  off any team members i definitely didn’t want her to die but it gave a reason for him to come close to killing gabriel only to hold back and remember what luther told him earlier about not letting the ai win,2023-07-12
im pretty sure the part 2 cast is fanaggregated not official,2023-07-12
it was a little odd to me that they made it seem like ilsa and grace were of equal importance to ethan like he has such a long history with ilsa and he just met grace and had barely even had a conversation with her lol,2023-07-15
"really weird  completely took me out of the movie and every scene with grace after felt forced fake and even creepy for some reason

i did not like anything about this movie
 i wish they stopped at fallout
its painfully clear to me that its all downhill from this point

all we have to look forward to is more of boring gabriel and the  nonthreatening screen saver ai

what a terrible way to end the mi series",2023-07-15
while i did enjoy it for the majority of the film it did not feel like a mi spy movie at all,2023-10-19
you liked mi 2 then lol,2023-10-20
the score was exceptional the entire time  loved it,2023-07-14
i dont think they will top fallout the bathroom fight prisoner heist motorcycle chase helicopter fight it was unreal each action scene was distinct and unique this unfortunately kinda felt repetitive and didnt build up although the train falling was good fun but every action scene in fallout was on par with the train sequence overall still fun,2023-07-16
emotion  entity does come up a lot,2023-07-12
" also not to forget ethan saying “ logic” and actually attempting to  gabriel at the end even gabriel is confused because he and by extension the entity thought that ethan would spare him for sake of not knowing what the key would unlock

 my thought is that ethan really wasnt going to  him but pretending like he was going to in order to distract him enough to do the pickpocket switcheroo to get the key",2023-07-15
"it hit me mid way through the movie that the central theme of mi7 is that its a test of faith  faith in yourself faith in your friends  it even has a antagonist with a biblical  hebrew origin that means  is my strength  gabriel was the angel that informs mary she will bear the son of 

in the movie the entity could or would be considered  and gabriel is the messenger

the key looking like a cross is about as subtle as a sledgehammer",2023-07-16
great observation i was also surprised ethan would actually  gabriel like that,2023-07-14
yes it was now do i think they made a mistake having grace take her place yes but i think she had to go when future fans watch the series they will be heartwrenced this is the luke i am your father moment,2023-07-14
"but seriously mi has a solid claim to being one of the best franchises out there theres a solid argument that none of the movies are even bad 2 is definitely the weakest but still a solid action flick

ever since 3 though this franchise has just been hit after hit after hit",2023-07-12
andor was better and some of the upcoming shows look good mi series after the first one is just a generic cruise vehicle that has the same feel as almost all of his movies,2023-07-12
is that they often finish,2023-07-12
"i sure did my  it was more cringy than mi2    and i actually love mi2  lol

but i expected so much more of the writing after how great fallout was  this was a huge misfire for me and i have zero interest in seeing part 2 at this point  

that sucks because ive been a fan of mi since the first film  this was was a huge step in the wrong direction in my opinion",2023-07-15
no tension no irony nothing explored characters made the same face over and over and over again of looking at their enemy with intensity and then slightly tilting their head with ai theres a lot of cool questions you can ask things to explore this was little kids with action figures and no self awareness to give it levity,2023-07-18
there was nothing average about that airport scene   that could have been a mess but it really was tense especially when the bomb came into play,2023-07-18
why is the club scene not going to age well,2023-07-17
it wasnt good  fallout was great  i was very disappointed and wont be going back for round 2  i guess its like hunger games mockingjay all over again  i never even saw the 2nd one,2023-07-14
"yeah i just made a comment like yours too just significantly shorter

cliché gabriel  i thought he was from the first for a while until i remembered he wasn’t 

the movie lost me after the utmost terrible bridge fighting choreography it’s plain embarrassing they made such a bad fight i had zero emotions about her death thanks to it 

i trusted tom to be better than this",2023-08-04
"ilsas fridging was absolutely shameless like oh we have reached our brunette quota cya dont worry about the development in 5 and 6

i was mentally done with the film after that im shocked it has such good reviews i thought it was far worse than fallout or rogue nation",2023-07-12
the key had to be one of the most annoying macguffins in the history of the franchise nothing like the rabbits foot if they kept it simple and mentioned it once or twice great every other scene someone was referring to it swiping it verifying it too much  why didnt they go to walmart and make copies ,2023-07-27
indiana jones crew used the same train and similar locations for filming and cgi,2023-07-13
dude the scene with all of the intel people explaining the virus was torment it was so badly done it felt like all the people in the room were reading the same script,2023-07-15
that would’ve been way way better than gabriel,2023-07-17
word theyve had callbacks to previous movies before they needed a suspended few inches from the ground scene and i was hoping character or callback to part 2 even if they made the virus deadlier,2023-07-27
they completely  the bed killing off ilsa like she was a nobody ilsa faust has been one of the best parts of the mcq mis if not the best nonethan hunt part im  they killed her the way they did so unceremonious,2023-07-17
"probably will be covered in part 2 on how they retrieved the keys the trailer for dead reckoning had someone in scuba gear under ice either got cut or its from part 2 villain should also get better having another movie to be fleshed out

ghost protocol is one of my favorite mi movies and i remember very little about the villain i remember the french assassin chick but the main villainhe wanted to launch nukes on the world still one of my favs but after the burj khalifa sequence ghost protocol isnt quite as good",2023-07-24
yeah i thought that was going to be an issue really though was just like a lane keep assist esque driving just follow the defined roads cars have been doing that since late 2000s,2023-07-24
yeah that was pretty odd,2023-07-26
i dont think the ai in a car necessarily has to be connected to online systems it could be an offline ai that just follows the lines on the road they certainly should have had a throw away line about that though i agree,2023-07-26
fr exactly my thoughts i have no clue how some are even calling this the best mission impossible as of yet this movie was a significant downgrade from fallout and like you said i was bored throughout the whole movie except for the train scene 510 at best,2023-07-12
"best to worst
mi 1
mi 3
mi 4
mi 5
mi 6
mi 7
mi 2
agree on the exposition it was insane",2023-07-12
"the villain is one of the most boring from these movies while at same being one with the most time spent on him his performance also felt pretty flat i wish they had the cary elwes character as they main villain instead he actually had some presence on screen

the trope of the villain being this perfect puppetmaster who constantly avoids hurting the protagonists to play games is also really lame to me the previous movies kinda did that to but the villains didnt feel perfect and there was a back and forth conflict between them and the imf team",2023-07-14
elwes assumed his knowledge of the sub location would protect him he miscalculated as gabriel was happy to  the only man in the world with that information,2023-07-12
he was very  he stated the entity doesnt like being controlled so he tried blackmail he  up when he said only he knew where to find the submarine but the plot needed his stupidity to move forward and help the good guys,2023-07-12
" why did cary elwes dni think he had any leverage over gabriel

he felt like his knowledge of the submarines location made him indisposable as he kept saying he was the only one on earth who knew",2023-07-12
"same feelings here 

tom is always a fun watch but the entity was embarrassingly done the film felt more like a fast and furious film to me 

gabriel was like a knock off version of the architect from the matrix films 

yeah hayley is lovely to look at but ive no connection to her in the same way i do rebecca ferguson",2023-07-12
why its not the movies fault oceangate happened,2023-07-12
but the ai story is very good timing win some you lose some,2023-07-12
meh that was like two weeks ago,2023-07-12
also how was grace able to type in her account and routing number from memory,2023-07-15
and they both end with a submarine in an icy ocean,2023-07-14
"and both feature terrible writting with cringelevel plot gimmicks  retconnedforced bad guys and runtimes that go on for way too long yet despite that are being split into 2 movies  

facepalm 

its a sad day when the mi series has sunk to the level of being comparable to the schlock that is the fast and furious movies  
sad in deed",2023-07-15
"and both are likely to end up as top 10 grossing movies of 2023

ai be taking notes",2023-07-14
"down the exact same staircase in rome

those are the spanish steps a   prominent and recognizable filming location for decades all the way back to audrey hepburn in roman holiday 1953

if youre filming in rome and dont include them thats like filming in san francisco and not including the golden gate bridge",2023-07-16
"the waytoolong scene where kittridge and cronies are explaining the ai to denlinger by saying one sentence at a time to form a giant story as if its some improv warmup youd do in class just made me laugh out loud because of how long it overstayed its welcome also who is that good at talking

i definitely had some issues with this movie but had a fun time with it regardless that scene however was right at the beginning and definitely had me very worried about the rest of the movie it was really bad  the dialog part anyway i did like when kittridge hung up the phone and started asking ethan how he thought he was going to get out of there only to find ethan putting on a kittridge mask that was good stuff",2023-07-12
bro the mask was so he could breathe,2023-07-13
recency bias fallout is no doubt a more solid movie,2023-07-12
the entity is very thin as a character so far in my head canon i added details from westworld season 3 about rehoboam to the concept,2023-07-12
"the “entity” plot line was exciting predicting outcomes was really cool

the thing with that is thats always how the villains in these movies work but now its a computer program thats less fun imo and its functionally indistinguishable in rogue nation they spend the whole time talking about how lane knows everything and lane is always three steps ahead and if thats what were going to do doesnt lane know were going to do it 

ctrlf lane replace with the entity",2023-07-12
why are others enjoying it ,2023-07-12
"i think its because the action is some of the best weve had in a postcovid film and it has been 5 years since the last mission impossible movie so everyone is excited to see these beloved characters again it also looked great sounded incredible and the score was  top notch

i do totally agree though the narrative and treatment of the characters was pretty shocking",2023-07-12
i thought the stunts and action were some of the best in the entire series gabriel was a weak villain who hopefully will be explored more in the next movie ilsas death was questionable and the dialogue was pretty bad at times but those issues dont bring down how much fun i had while watching this the three hours flew by its the worst of mcquarries movies but id still rate it 810,2023-07-20
agreed  the chaotic cat and mouse was just fun,2023-07-16
"at least the second wasn’t trying to be an all timer it’s campy as  but that adds to the fun

i completely agree with you i’m actually blown away not because this film was good but because the same people who made fallout took every single thing they did perfectly and threw it in the garbage i honestly would have taken an mi3 or mi1 over this film which is absurd they should have stopped with fallout and left an undeniable legacy instead we received the narrative equivalent of tom’s motorbike stunt a sharp dive downward after a massive leap",2023-07-12
 thats a hot take mi2 is the only film in the series that i wont rewatch,2023-07-20
here me out  part 2 is a great film that gets  on undeservedly and is way better than this film john woo gave us a sick version of theme song doves leather jackets gun fu on motorcycles long hair tom cruise a deadly biological weapon thandie newton a convincing villain good use of masks  this movie felt like fast n furious,2023-07-27
ethan kills henchmen but usually with a gun rather than a crowbar which is more personal and visceral,2023-07-15
just underscores the vast gap in movie making standards,2023-07-12
it certainly raised the stakes during the opening scenes i was ,2023-07-13
hard agree,2023-07-13
i thought it was brainwashing him or something ,2023-07-14
"but thats the shtick with every mi macguffin isnt   


the noc list the chimera virus the rabbits foot the nuclear codes the red box the nuclear cores and the key they could secure it with thousands safe boxes and elite special forces at first chance but then it would be no movie",2023-07-14
"now i want you to ask yourself  is it good filmcraft to fakeout the death of the same character twice in the same movie to then rez them in the next movie

thats how we end up with marvel level 

also gabriel would have to be the  villain in all of history to not confirm the  there people are hardy creatures there are records of people getting stabbed tens of times and surviving with proper and immediate medical care if someone is alive when you find them they can be saved

the second movie will lose all credibility if it undoes this death yes there is suspension of disbelief but after the last few movies the tone of these doesnt match doublefakeoutdeath energy",2023-07-14
i agree luther also have an interesting response when grace asked him if he and ilsa were close,2023-07-16
i though gabriel was meant to be on the train so why sneak,2023-07-16
yup pretty much nailed my thoughts,2023-07-16
"is this a marvel movie  does it have to have a manifesto walk on 2 legs and speak like james earl jones  the fact that its literally just an amalgamation of information is what makes it scary interesting and thoughtprovoking  as youve noticed with gabriels dialogue the thing is literally a storyteller acting like shakespeare pulling on the strings of people tied to informationsimply because it can  

the illthought key macguffins are  i totally agree but i really like the more nebulous face theyve put on this enemy  the answer should always be the one you least expect",2023-07-17
just as long as he doesnt go into a  shop with some racist shop owners who do unspeakble things to men,2023-07-16
"im coming around to the theory that ilsas death was an elaborate fake

they were telegraphing her death for the first half of the entire movie the only reason it felt weird was that the very next scene they moved on like she never existed but that was just poor editing  direction decisions",2023-07-17
i’m as confused as you  the keys changed hands so many times beteeen different people i had no idea who had what keys and who was good vs bad,2023-07-17
"my wild theory  


they made a point of taking the knives from gabriel at the party and them being placed on the table  


they could have been swapped out for knives that retract into the blade leaving only a small part outside so that when isla is stabbed the blade isnt long enough to hit her heart but still enough to  her so she can fake her death",2023-07-18
big parallel with mi 1 phelps fakes his death on a cute little bridge hmmm,2023-07-19
worst one in franchise they all got better in some way starting from 1 first one to be lackluster couldnt even get hyped for all his running,2023-07-27
100 agree i have watched nearly every other movie in this franchise repeatedly but i have zero interest in either watching part 2 or even watching part 1 again extremely disappointing especially if these two movies mark the end of ethan hunts involvement,2023-10-14
why was gabriel in a coffin already inside the train but not his partner why was gabriel standing on top of train with hands in pocket  a whole tunnel in advance from his seemingly jump point ,2023-10-14
i tried rewatching mi2 just recently couldnt get past 45 min,2023-10-20
ving rhames sounded like he was the entity reading a script inserted by chatgpt,2023-07-14
such a strange movie we got 20 mins in and decided that we didnt want to waste another 143 how its 7910 on imdb is a genuine wonder,2023-10-15
"absolutely that’s not any henchman it’s her brother   

i kept expecting him to realize it as a plot point i didn’t find it creepy though kirby with brown eyes reminded me of shakira",2023-07-12
tbf for some reason i didnt even notice the difference between the eyes probably was too focused on her perfectly sculpted face lol,2023-07-12
agreed the whole film felt like grace a mission impossible story,2023-07-15
cause hes got a thing for that type of brunette judging by almost every actress in the franchise aside from thandie newton and paula patton,2023-07-16
yes thank you,2023-07-18
" plot boring  pickpocket plot i stopped caring for the movie when every  thing happening is a result of either back and forth pickpocketing entity tells us whats going to happen clever ex machine twists so  boring holy 

 evil ai cliche the mask machine malfunctions cliche 

and probably my favorite no characters have any motivations

why are we supposed to care for this garbage movie ",2023-07-14
because none of his team ever dies in these movies they have to have stakes,2023-07-12
characters stay alive come back from dead or stay dead its not that only minor characters should die or major characters should come back,2023-07-14
that was the movies worst scene and really needed to be trimmed am i supposed to think the characters met that morning with a slide deck practicing their presentation,2023-07-15
please do not compare this to that garbage westworld s3,2023-07-15
she shouldve died in fallout her presence in this one felt like they didnt know what to do with her and then she dies cause basically grace is there now,2023-07-15
i think she’s alive her and luther must’ve fooled the ai by faking her death the movie clearly shows at the beginning how capable she is regarding faking her death,2023-07-15
ill say i liked this movie a lot but if the sequel shows her death is fake then it will seriously plummet in my opinion,2023-07-15
well the imf got ahold of her body and took care of it so safe to say they knew she was really dead and ethan wouldn’t have thought she was dead if they didn’t have her body as proof,2023-07-15
i think she’s dead from a franchise standpoint rebecca has more projects going on now so her time is probably limited and her role could have been avoided in this movie i think with different writing from a movie perspective two deaths that are not her death in the same movie is just too much,2023-07-16
gabriel’s character was my least fav part of the movie by a long shot totally boring and uninteresting hopefully part 2 can fix that,2023-07-16
its reached fast n furious levels of storytelling where ethan now has a longreaching past where anyone can be pulled from despite never setting it up in any previous movie aka doms brother,2023-07-17
"everyone took turns too 

now you okay him for a bit now you now her",2023-07-22
"i watched it a second time feeling a bit strange after the first viewing i’m not saying the ideas i present are perfectly executed in the script but rather this is the angle i believe they were trying to take

1 in regards to the entity i don’t think they’re trying to make discourse on ai but rather play with the idea that there’s nothing the good guys can do that the villain can’t predict except for the valour of heroes and redemption of bad guys its basically ethan hunt vs evil  with gabriel named after the messenger of the bible being the mouthpiece it’s ethan hunt vs destiny

2 tangential to point 2 it’s less about plausibility and more about a type of villain getting under the skin of characters more than any other previous villain solomon lane as a villain already infiltrated the good guys as far as humanly possible the entity is going beyond and getting pretty much in their heads remember we never know the motives for the entity because the entity does not speak we only hear what people interpret the entity is trying to achieve orchestrating a riddle nuke is part of its mysterious way

3 the two agents aren’t the only paper thin characters the bizarre thing about the mi series is that almost all the characters are thin think about it what have you learnt about luther since the original film nothing he hacks computers what about benji since 3 he knows how to wear masks now ilsa literally nothing the original movie also has the main character from the series act as merely the plot twist for the movie but the weird part is it all works ethan hunt himself barely exists as a character all i see is tom cruise doing stunts  and when you think about it the characters only exist to chain the story along and when they’re not needed they are cut think about ethan’ wife who doesn’t exist in this movie who probably is the person he loves the most yet the entity doesn’t target her as a weak point of ethan 

4 this fourth point strikes me as odd because if there’s one thing this film lacked is lots of actions scenes at almost three hours long we get only three main action sequences dubai rome and austria we get one major stunt in austria rogue nation and fallout had a few more major action sequences and shorter running times

the other odd thing you mentioned was “action in expense of plot” like… what are you comparing this to the bourne series it’s been obvious since 1996 that mission impossible’s plots have only existed to string together action scenes it’s an excuse for tom cruise to do  stunts the marketing ploy for this film literally was “did you see tom drove a motorcycle off a mountain” nobody has ever cared about the villains characters or story in the films i mean it’s kind of a joke that ethan and his team can barely work with the government in most movies somehow they’re always going rogue if you’ve been watching mi for the plot… oh boy man you’re gonna love bourne and james bond even more where they actually take the story seriously lol

but anyway watching it a second time made me see the film for what it is and now i’m glad watching it the first time you’d expect another fallout but it has a different vibe that you’ll want if you rewatch the series like i said it doesn’t execute perfectly what it tries to do but it’s a really fantastic film nevertheless 

it’s initial disappoint only serves to tell us fallout truly is one of the greatest action movies ever made though",2023-07-25
i thought the bomb was just an excuse to get benji’s voice,2023-07-27
ilsas death was the main thing that brought this movie down for me on top of her death feeling like it had no impact the actual final fight scene she got was just not fun at all very boring and horribly executed i am fine with her death in theory but it should have been handled way better also the fake out killing her like 1 hour earlier also took away from her real death they should not have faked her death only to really  her later that is just a bad move writing wise i did really enjoy the movie a lot though excited for part 2,2023-07-26
saying well although evaluating critics and audiences on these sites the film failed in revenue and losses of more than 100 million dollars,2023-10-05
spot on i was honestly annoyed watching this i’m shocked to see that grace character is being cheered while i hated her replacing ilsa in the most inconsequential way,2023-10-14
i’m watching it right now and don’t understand the hype at all,2023-10-17
i think covid did a number on this movie as well the whole tone is off compared to the last two entries,2023-07-14
"you are not alone  from the opening with that awful exposition dump i had a bad feeling and it just got worse and worse  this movie  compared to fallout  
i cant believe the same people were involved",2023-07-15
i’ve been wondering why i never felt immersed this is why endless dialogue as if you could feel the actors reading it off the page,2023-07-15
glad to see another gp fan its my fav as well although fallout might be a close second gp just has such a great balance of everything with excellent pacing,2023-07-14
i’m with ya i had insanely high expectations after fallout which is probably unfair but the way the story was handled and new characters fell largely flat for me action and sets are always top notch and maybe part ii will tie up the questionable aspects better,2023-07-13
"  i felt as though i was watching the same conversations happen over and over and over again

it reminded me of avatar 2 which was also complete trash when the kids kept getting caught over and over and over",2023-07-15
the credibility of rotten tomatoes has gone down rapidlyit doesnt mean  now,2023-07-16
absolute  garbage,2023-07-12
not to mention william donloe,2023-07-12
 yes please,2023-07-12
i’ve been hypothetically casting hannah waddingham and vanessa kirby as motherdaughter being in the same movie will be close enough,2023-07-12
did you notice the russian changed to english and then they still subtitled for a couple of sentences and then dropped the subtitles it was weird,2023-07-14
considering how much time and effort went into building ilsa and ethans relationship she deserves a better ending than this one probably the only thing i didnt like about this movie i usually hate fake deaths in movies but this film can be exception i really want her to come back in the next movie and give us a proper goodbye to the character ilsa was too good to be wasted like this,2023-07-12
yeah im surprised no one made that connectionreference here in the comments it was the only thing on my mind watching that intro,2023-07-12
the keys were around the necks of dead sailors once the ice melted they could have drifted miles,2023-07-15
ilsa but she’s dead,2023-07-15
they had to wait for the ice to melt before recovering the bodies i believe so likely currents moving around we don’t know exactly who stole the keys just that they disappeared after the bodies were found,2023-07-16
"that scene stuck out to me for being really bad they kept repeating “the key” over and over

it wouldn’t surprise if the scene was a lastminute reshoot because test audiences complained the plot was ‘too complex’",2023-07-15
yeah that was kind of a cringe scene and rob delaney in particular took me out of it sorry rob,2023-07-15
yet none of them could figure out the entity looks like the scientology cross,2023-07-15
yeah i like the theory that her and luther are scheming off the grid together ethan and gabriel both need to think she’s dead to stay ahead of the ai,2023-07-15
"they did a terrible job at making me believe she could possibly lose that fight the villain really wasnt physically threatening and he promptly looses most physical confrontations of the movie he does basically get owned by ethan at the end

for what we have seen of ilsa for the past 2 movies theres no way in  she would lose to him and to make it all worse she was literally wielding a sword while the guy had a tiny knifethats not a fight youre going to win",2023-07-16
she was great but she didn’t die they said she was still alive at the end i however don’t think she’ll be part of the mi crew as some else said she’s too far on the opposite goodbad spectrum to now be good,2023-07-16
because it’s a movie and shooting him would be incredibly boring i mean the movie is full of issues and that’s what you’re picking up,2023-07-16
"i thought the thing about destroying half the key as welli guess the entity wants access to its own source code not just for no one else to have access presume the key is more advanced than simply needing a mould similar to having a public and private key in encryption which i think it what the physical key alluded to

no idea about the knife thing that was just 

also they could have just put ethan in the train luggage like they did with gabriel but its a film i suppose",2023-07-16
they were checked for weapons entering the party she’s grabbed paris’ sword when she ran off,2023-07-16
,2023-07-17
i get it it didn’t even really feel like mcquarrie directed it,2023-07-17
also apparently venice is completely vacant at night so people can knife fight on the bridges and tight alleyways,2023-07-17
glad someone else spotted the dutch angles,2023-07-18
"i think she is dead for part one but not at all it could be 4d chess making her dead to make the entity think she is dead while in the background she is moving the wheels

same as ethan trying to cut the neck of gabriel when his friend luther specifically said for ethan not to  him basically playing 4d chess with the entity

or i may be totally wrong

edit naa she is dead dead just saw the cast for the part 2 on wiki and rebecca ferguson is not in the list of cast actors

so much of thinking in a possibility",2023-07-20
why did you think she was dead she was just lying on the ground  it was obvious that she was playing possum,2023-07-30
yeah that intro felt amateurish,2023-07-22
i fee like she will return for part two seeinga s at the end of the movie on he train paris is still alive after being stabbed with the same knife,2023-07-20
i think this movie going through a literal covid  production hurt it in a way that probably ended up making it feel more hollow actors werent allowed to be as close together they had to change locations mid shooting they kept shutting down and starting up again etc i think the next movie made without that hellish production will feel a lot tighter,2023-07-26
facts they showed her to be capable but human flawed but charming enough and she had an arc by the end of the movie a well written character no doubt unlike in indy 5,2023-07-26
,2023-10-04
"  i do roll my eyes whenever characters wax lyrical about how supernaturally capable ethan hunt or his villains are

wait you didnt like when alec baldwin gave a big monologue about how ethan is the manifestation of destiny

 adr and reshoots to address this are very noticeable

im not sure that is the case at least with regards to what could technically be called reshoots production had to shut down multiple times dues to covid it probably would explain the inconsistencies since if you had to shoot a scene multiple times and had to do over multiple nights it probably wouldnt fully match up",2023-07-30
overwritten is the perfect word to describe the script,2023-07-29
i thought it was a coffee machine,2023-08-08
yea it grossed my out of the theater to watch her,2023-08-08
yeah its like they were androids or something,2023-12-01
that entire scene was really badly written and shot why so many dutch angle close ups,2024-01-28
he is one of one,2023-07-12
keanu reeves as well imo but yes it’s not a long list,2023-07-12
"im glad im not the only one who thinks this
but apparently everyone is  losing their minds over this movie whereas im thinking what the  is this is even supposed to be mission impossible",2023-07-17
"i agree with everything

i almost forgot how underwhelming the entity as a villain was they did nothing cool with the concept i think lane in rogue nation was much much more threatening and cool than the entity which is insane because ai as villain is an absolutely great idead with unlimited potential but honestly i cant say that im really that surprised because i already got the sense that the franchise was devolving to another dumb down action spectacle when mi6fallout came out 

i havent watched the first one yet so heres my list from best to worst 

1 mi5  rogue nation 

2 mi4  ghost protocol 

3 mi6  fallout 

4 mission impossible 2

5 mi7  dead reckoning 

6 mission impossible 3",2023-07-16
yeah this really brings the team back to basics with tech further mirroring mi1 kittridge train focus on masks,2023-07-12
i like that theory but i doubt that the real ilsa would stay away from them for so long im guessing shes in trouble,2023-07-12
thanks for this well thought out theory  i was thinking that the way they handled her death was way too clunky,2023-07-15
if you start explaining away major character deaths with masks there are no stakes anymore,2023-07-19
the shot of ethan looking up at the camera segues into zola showing alana that ethan has arrived,2023-07-30
i can’t believe how positive everyone here is being and i enjoyed all of the other mission impossibles it’s like hollywood doesn’t understand how knives and guns work anymore,2023-07-16
"its a dangerous job people die in the line of service 

people going full karen because they know better than the writers if a character should live is troubling trend of the current era of audiences",2023-07-13
hopefully they bring her back,2023-07-13
"she was insanely corny this is a franchise full of incredibly competent characters and in the endgame they make the choice to introduce some  audience insert type who makes dumb you guys did what jokes the whole time

the fact she backstabs him like 3 separate times and were supposed to feel any type of way towards her when the choice is her or ilsa faust one of the most goated characters in the series was just terrible writing it ",2023-07-17
i think part 2 will truly show whether she is onedimensional or very complex,2023-07-17
i thought the purpose of the fake bomb in the airport was to get a recording of simon pegg’s voice which they then use later on to trick ethan,2023-07-16
i kinda think it is too i love this series but overall i have not been crazy about mcquarries trilogy to this point fallout was way better than this though,2023-07-15
someone hasnt watched mi2,2023-07-15
"good compared to other movies definitely

good compared to other mi movies seems to be the debate here",2023-07-15
" this wasn’t good…right

youre more than allowed to have this opinion but no it was fantastic",2023-07-15
agreed choose between a woman you love or this random new one who betrayed you several times and put the entire mission at risk,2023-07-24
" ai doesn’t need visual representation and if it did it would t be the itunes visualiser

the club scene was pretty goofy the entire entity concept didnt really work for me its a lazy plot device it can come and go whenever its needed instead of actually developing a compelling plot",2023-07-26
grace is a pick pocket and a con artist not an action star  she was also probably concussed after that first crash,2023-07-24
i enjoyed the film but these are valid criticisms to me this is what movies like fast  furious and marvel action should be light hearted romps executed extremely well,2023-07-13
i wouldnt call ethan a gary stu at all we have seen his flaws and vulnerabilities a lot dude gets beaten up a lot too,2023-07-12
"kinda shocked by this take and like dod suspect a second viewing may help you 
i agree there’s a pacing issue and the film feels bloated but in comparison to dod i found the action a lot more memorable and realistic feeling probably due to the amount of practical stunts 

there have been mi films that have ethan as an infallible boy scout but i don’t think this is one of them there’s a lot more vulnerability to his character on display 

i’m really excited to see it again",2023-07-15
the bathroom fight scene in fallout alone is better than every scene in this moviethe car chase scene felt exactly like the fast x chase but atleast vin diesel was chasing a nuke so it was fun,2023-07-16
i hated it the knife vs a sword fight didn’t make any sense also using little knifes to climb up the train looked  how does one key stop an ai in every single computer already how did the timer know where gabriel was on the train and how fast he’d jump off,2023-07-16
"agreed with this description of a 3hour chase scene i watched it a second and final time trying to give it a fair shot but i actually found it more tedious this time around the car chase and falling train scenes both felt overly long and the fights were uninterestingly choreographed and there wasnt enough storyemotion to distract me from that 

and yes to your final point",2023-07-16
"fwiw i agree with all these points i went in expecting something as engaging and wellwritten as the last few movies but it just didnt hook me in the same way the action scenes all felt a bit paintbynumbers and the reasons for each new sequence felt flimsy im a bit baffled by the glowing reviews tbh

and even though i love haley atwell her performance here fell kind of flat for me vanessa kirby playing haley atwell pretending to be vanessa kirby was the best moment her character had

my theater also had the volume cranked up to uncomfortable levels during the opening titles i heard someone in the row behind me whisper i do not need it to be this loud",2023-07-16
ill do you a better one  who has the key,2023-07-12
yeah don’t write movies,2023-07-14
they are just salty ilsa got killed off,2023-07-19
that’s an awesome concept,2023-07-12
i will this movie felt like a complete movie despite the part one label i didn’t enjoy being left on the cliffhanger like they did in fast x and across the spiderverse i felt like i got a full blown mi movie and can’t wait to see how they finish it next year,2023-07-12
yh she revelaed that she wrapped nine times during this film their was cleary problems with production on this film because of covid,2023-07-12
ilsa is donezo unfortunately she was the best part of both rogue nation and fallout so definitely disappointing but im thinking rebecca ferguson couldnt commit to filming part two either because of dune part 2 or her tv show and gave the writers the okay to  her character off seems like theyll be replacing her with pom  hayley atwell,2023-07-13
the eyes thing was driving me nuts i cannot believe it didn’t become a plot point and we’ve seen them use contacts before,2023-07-13
the eye color thing was insanely obvious her brother would notice in a second also him telling his henchman to “shoot her” as he has a gun literally pointed at her is some insane screenwriting,2023-07-13
they had quite a few similar scenes didnt they,2023-07-13
shot mostly in the uk,2023-07-15
wow thanks for references really interesting to read them during whole movie i had a question maybe i neglected in some moment but why gabriel and entity dont destroy the key like if its the only thing that can stopcontrol the entity then just destroy one half and you win,2023-07-13
hes 61 and at the top of his game 57 and does all of his own stunts chris hemsworth is 63 and half toms age yet he uses a stunt double,2023-07-14
right,2023-07-16
its a callback to the first film and the dutch angles,2023-07-14
gabriel did feel like a knock off of solomon lane,2023-07-15
" and were easily terminated like nothing by an ai program 

sophisticated systems all around the sub couldnt even pick up a ghost submarine",2023-07-14
it should have happened he was using a laptop in a selfdriving car the ai thing was so inconsistent,2023-07-15
i was thinking about that lol,2023-07-15
i thought the motorcycle stunt was still insane in the theater,2023-07-15
luther told ethan under no circumstances to  gabriel or  himself because then the entity would have control of the future he knew ethan would most likely want to  gabriel out of revenge,2023-07-15
right how did they get split up if the cia recovered them both at the same time,2023-07-16
"see it in imax

its so  loud you cant hear any audience being annoying

yes",2023-07-16
but that one flopped and this one will hit a billion because of tom cruise,2023-07-17
i think the implication was that the ai somehow gained sentience when it infiltrated the sub,2023-07-17
i have tried not to think about it too hard but the key seems to have been created by the russians to lock the door on their super secret sonar toy wherein the ai source code magically exists after the us transmitted it to the sub,2023-07-17
it was filmed during covid so maybe they were more restricted social distancing etc,2023-07-17

wow so glad i wasnt in the theatre everything that i disliked about fallout was here again in spades i feel like i was the only person in the world who hated fallout the action fight sequences and the set pieces were amazing but so much of what made mi4 great was already starting to fall apart in fallout i found it so distracting that i really couldnt enjoy the movie

so this time around i was hoping they would have got their stuff together but nope all the same mistakes and more x 10

they also need to get some convincing tom stunt doubles 

cheap and cheesy",2023-07-14

" ilsa dies form gabriels knife but paris wounded exactly the same goes on to save ethan and grace pulls them up the train carriage and proceeds to survive wow

 ethan gets a he was a baddie before joining the imf prequel story all of a sudden really in mi he already seemed like a decent person with morals parents to care about where is the character development coming from it shocked me that tom cruise approved this just so gabriel’s whole character had a reason to exist why did he need to lane was introduced completely from scratch and it worked out fine

 gabriel standing on top of the train waiting for his escape point then ethan confronts him making them fight on top of the train while dodging light signals and a tunnel what would have happened if ethan would not have been there would gabriel just played jump and run on that trains roof by himself while waiting to arrive at his planned escape point

 how many times will grace betray ethan and straight up leave him to die in the subway why on earth did the writers seem it would be plausible to write her character like that how dumb does she get to be to not understand ethan to help her even ilsa got this quicker and she was even more hostile towards ethan at first tiring to say the least

 gabriel’s escape point he calculates the exact acceleration and speed of an old steampowered train to know exactly when to jump and land and his prepared truck how would you know the exact peripherals of the machine to do that did the ai calculate this so it has to be mentioned in the movie

 also who kept the train running and shoveling coal into the combustion chamber the train should go slower instead of full speed the whole time

 the whole plan to board the train with a motorcycle resulting in driving up a mountain and a base jump into the train meanwhile paris just stands on top of a bridge and jumps down to the train really the whole ethans imf superintelligence guys would not have thought of that

 ai sets itself into a submarine and destroys it so the original code needed to stop it would get destroyed as well transfer yourself into a house trigger some systems to cause a fire burn down the house with the original code why would the ai risk that the original code to delete it would still be retrievable

 the key has infinite power to glow the jewels or what or do they have to put it into a charging station from time to time or whatever

 ilsa gets defeated by gabriel like have you seen her fight in rogue nation or fallout the guys she defeated there

 car chase in rome paris just walks away after wrecking half of the police fleet with her hummer and nobody minds it is not even shown how she escapes just another somehow palpatine returned

 too predictable what is part 2 going to be start sequence ethan dives down to sevastopol tries to delete the ai that goes wrong ai loads itself into a satellite in orbit the whole rest of the movie is going to be about flying into space to delete the ai on that satellite

then all the other characters what happened i wouldnt mind if it was just some mi part in the middle but dead reckoning is meant to be the final installment to the franchise so there are some ends to tie together

no mention of solomon lane or the syndicate cia director sloane just gets a picture on the wall is she dead what happened to her after fallout what happened to william brandt what is julia up to maybe all these actors were not meant to be hired to create the next parts of the mi franchise i get that but at least mention them so it does not feel like they were all meaningless and the plot lines completely forgotten

what a terrible disappointment like a famous comic book guy once said this was so bad i will only watch it 6 times more
i just hope it was some kind of a build up for the grand finale and it will redeem part 1 in hindsight",2023-07-13
smartest comment ive seen here this movie was very mediocre anyone with a brain and sense of good writing can tell movies are seriously getting worse each year it sucks ,2023-07-14
"i agree with everything after i saw it last night i thought while nowhere near 4 5 6 it was alright but it is getting worse every time i think about it so very disappointing entry indeed oddly enough it felt more reminiscent of the likes of fastfurious than the previous mi films 

sadly i cant help but think that was intentional from tom cruisea very hands on producer they already planted the seed in mi6fallout which is why i didnt like it as much as critics did so its in a lot way a softreboot of the franchise to something dumber and funnier in order to appeal to the widest demographic possible in the hope of a massive boxoffice success i curiously felt the same about the way of water

whereas at least to me the mission impossible franchise should cater to people who enjoy stuff like inception casino royal or interstellar to make it stand out among the crowd of generic mindless action comedies generic spy films and james bond",2023-07-17
" this already has wrecked me completely to the point i almost started crying to what they had done to this part of my favorite franchise

if this isnt just hyperbole it might be time to take a bit of a break its just a movie you might not like em all i thought it was great",2023-07-13
"first off it is far too comical there were always small jokes or light moments during the franchise but the whole beginning part of this movie felt more like a marvel love and thunder dumbness 

i agree it did feel lighter in tone overall than fallout or even gp but the humor felt forced somewhat the trailers for it were much more serious in comparison",2023-07-13
"im going to admit i started getting really bothered by how these dialogues were written throughout the whole movie where everybody kept finishing each others sentences felt extremely scripted and artifical and very far from how a natural conversation or discussion would sound like 

i get it doing it like once and with the imf team to show how in tune they all are after years of missions but it kept happening multiple times throughout the movie just took me out every time",2023-07-14
exact same feelings  this was a huge disappointment for me and i freaking love fallout  i dont understand what happened to the writting,2023-07-14
that was the part that truly broke the immersion to me kirby’s blue eyes were so noticeable that i couldn’t accept her own brother couldn’t see the difference,2023-07-14
you really think you’d notice that given everything he was dealing with at that moment  the concept of changing faces is not something he could even contemplate as a possibility as a viewer we know the imf can do it but zola has likely never heard of the concept,2023-07-15
couldn’t have said it better really i loved the 3rd act but everything before it was completely sub par i guess covid is to blame because i can’t think how else they could’ve dropped the ball so badly,2023-07-15

also the movie had no business being nearly 3 hours for the plot it was just confusing nonsense resulting in 42 instances of a golden key being pickpocketed 

the best stunt was already marketed to death so fell flat for me too

"im waiting on my paycheck then 

in all seriousness there are plenty of legitimate criticisms to be made but i easily rank this one above 2  3 ill say some of my nitpicks smoothed out on a second viewing some stuck out more and others i want to wait to judge in full until part 2 releases overall i was satisfied personally all down to taste certainly they went for a very different tone and pacing than the previous movie",2023-07-20

the villain does not have any grudge against ethan hes just doing what entity roles him to",2023-07-15
you didn’t like itunes visualizer as the villain,2023-07-24
thats probably why you didnt enjoy it as much even though every movie can be seen separately you get more out if you know ethan character from what happens in the other movies,2023-07-30
also the chase scene at the start was awful 25 guys on horses 20 ft behind ethan in a open desert and they can’t shoot him or his horse there nothing else to even aim at does hollywood know how guns work,2023-07-16
the fact that paris knew what the keys were for tho indicates that there’s something we don’t know about right i think there’s a twist to what the key actually unlocks,2023-07-13

i love how they didn’t even highlight it it’s just in the background lol,2023-07-16
i swear she only had like 5 lines in the entire movie lol,2023-07-16
she really did i wanted to see her more in her scenes given a bigger role for me she was the best part of the movie,2023-07-16
amen,2023-07-16
it can go on four 3045 minutes on old coal the scene was depicting maybe 20 minutes max,2023-07-14
i agree with you on grace she comes across in the beginning like “oh i’m smart” but then gets in way over her head at what point would any other normal person just give the key to ethan and then peace out like “yep this is too much for me” i also thought it was such an  move to leave ethan handcuffed to a car on the train tracks what the  her and ethan had good platonic chemistry but it’s so hard to root for her when rebecca ferguson is right there and is such a badass and not annoying i don’t like that they killed ilsa and just immediately recruit grace into the fold i could not buy that ethan cared so much about her in such a short amount of time,2023-07-16
i really hope ilsas character isnt dead either that part  the life out of me,2023-07-12

they kinda foreshadowed her dying throughout the movie first with her actual fake death at the beginning later when they say ethan wont let his teammates die and the camera holds on ilsa and she has a sad look on her face then immediately following that up with her and ethan in the sunset looking happy we know he can never be with anyone who makes him happy and then straight up when gabriel says the entity predicts either her or grace will die and obviously it wasnt going to be grace so her death was not surprising to me in the least but it was still sad,2023-07-12
" they did ilsa dirty unless they somehow bring her back in part 2 that was a super disappointing anticlimactic way to go atwell ruled but i liked her less after that because it felt like a ferguson replacement i get that her death was supposed to give ethan the internal conflict to  gabriel or not but dumb

had to be scheduling conflicts 100 in my mind with her tv show silo and dune i bet she just couldnt commit to filming part 2 agreed that her death scene should have been more impactful though

 gabriel sucks mustache twirling charmless void of a villain speaking pseudo intellectual techno babble why is he so evil he partnes with the ai didnt care for the random flashes to him killing someone in ethans life with no explanation what a massive drop off from solomon lane and cavill

wouldnt be surprised at all in part 2 if they reveal he has just been a mouthpiece for the entity all along and has pretty much just been regurgitating whats said to him as for motive it could be just as simple as wanting something from his past wiped clean we saw that the ai can erase him from camera footage instantly maybe just wanted to be wiped clean in general 

 way too many characters whats the point of shea wiggums black sidekick or the pom klementief villain

dont forget its part 1 of 2 seems like pom will be at least somewhat of a protagonist in the next one wouldnt be surprised if jasper gets killed early on in part 2 and his sidekick steps up in his place he had a larger role in top gun maverick",2023-07-13
im amazed no one brought up the blue eyes thing like vanessa kirbys blue eyes are very striking and as soon as grace took over for her i kept waiting for either her henchman or the senator to mention it play along but reveal they knew it was her all along and it was just never brought up,2023-07-12
i love that too even in fist fights he gets in when he slowly gets to and his face basically says ahh  gimme a second its way better than a cocky guy who is just great at everything,2023-07-12
yeah i like that part too even ethan thought it was too crazy lol but he does actually plan most of his crazy stunts before doing them plenty of times he did things off the cuff like jumping on the airplane in rn but i think this one scared him more because he had to just take benjis word on it and there was no guarantee he would even land on the train,2023-07-12
i dont disagree with you at all but i knew something was up when the movie screened for critics and you heard nothing but praise for atwell but very little about furgeson of course atwell was the new one so she got more attention for it but it did seem like furgeson didnt have as much of a presence in this one and now we know why,2023-07-12
i liked most of the train sequence but four guys just standing around on top of a speeding train looked a bit ridiculous,2023-07-13
yeah those guys got done dirty felt a genuine sense of sadness when i saw what happened to them rip train bros,2023-07-13
especially the choo choo guy ,2023-07-14
" two people went to  hunt in an alleyway only 1 was armed and with a lead pipe they were sent by super ai that can predict the future 

and it correctly predicted that he would be delayed long enough to be unable to save his girlfriend the ai’s plan was to put ethan into the impossible situation of needing to keep gabriel alive with all the reasons in the world to  him and escape all his enemies with the key

plus we don’t know what the ai really wants still very possible that the ai decided it wants an upgrade from gabriel to ethan and has laid out a plan to put ethan in front of the ai in such a state that ethan wants to use it instead of destroy it",2023-07-13
mission impossible and fast  the furious movies are close but on different sides of the same line but mi manages not to cross the line,2023-07-13
" can someone explain whats the deal with the fake key in the airport

it’s a trap to get ethan’s key out in the open since the bad guys already knew of the widow’s key

 and why grace slipped a key into a mans jacket on the aeroplane

she figured that people would be after her knowing exactly where she would be and the best way to get out of it would be to not have the key and be able to pick it up later",2023-07-13
really reminded me of to catch a thief with the atwell character,2023-07-15
"in regards to 2 thats why shes so anxious before hayleys white wiidow arrives and knocks her out she knows she only has one key

in regards to 1 for the entirety of the movie the real white widow has ½ of the key at least until it is taken from her by grace on the train

the other ½ has a more convoluted path

a courier has it in instanbul

ilsa takes it from the courier and goes to the desert

ilsa gives it to ethan in the desert

ethan has it all the way until grace pickpockets it and flies to rome she plants it on a random person she sat next to on the flight she doesnt have it for the entirety of the police station and car chase scenes 

while grace is off screen she collects the key from the fellow passenger and then leaves rome to go to venice  

at the party when ethan causes a distraction grace plants the key on zola as grace leaves she retrieves the key and keeps it until the train

the whole buyer at the airport with the fake key is to allow grace and ethan to meet up a plan on both the white widows and gabrielentitys part which is why gabriel has paris  the buyer",2023-07-30
when you have brian de palma at home,2023-07-15
vanessa kirby is so perfectly cast as a glamorous partythrowing black market arms dealer on paper its such a goofy role and yet shes so right for it,2023-07-15
her name is hattie in hobbs and shaw not white widow,2023-07-15
also it happens way too late into the movie it shouldve been an opening act stunt or early in the 2nd half like in ghost protocol,2023-07-15
thats been the case with most of the huge stunts in the mi movies for like the last 34 movies,2023-07-15
one of the worst instances of adr that i have ever seen,2023-07-16
the entity was first used on russian tracking computer in the sevastopol and thats when it went rogue so its source code is stuck in it,2023-07-16
she’s obviously not dead i refuse to believe they’d let her go like that,2023-07-16
imo that was left unclearis he out for his own advantage like denlinger hes been working with the white widows family for years has known her since she was a little girlhopefully we find out more in part 2,2023-07-16
i think he’s good the message at the end how i took it was his green light to ethan to proceed with his mission being to destroy the ai i may has misheard or misunderstood but that was me,2023-07-17
he was good in that he was simply doing his job without plans of usurping power retrieve the keys for the us his position was the same as degas the black agent when he said he would just do his duty theres a discussion to be had if it should be everyones duty to destroy it instead what hunt was supposedly trying but compared to all the other characters kittridge motive was good,2023-07-17
reminds me in john wick how he just murders the  out of anyone who gets within ten feet of him like a force of nature and people in the early films are like uh how about a million dollars as a bounty,2023-07-17
"i can see it

the thing that reminded me even more of lupin was briggs and his partner chasing ethan around the globe which gave me very inspector zenigata vibes",2023-07-20
what if the entity is ilsa,2023-07-18
"lol i just said the same thing cause i just saw it and came here to read peoples thoughts and share mine 

no way shes dead hunts got her in hiding",2023-07-18
atleast 45 close ups i’m not sure why,2023-07-22
" isla going to the small bridge to fight gabriel

i think she was protecting grace  shes a lot like ethan willing to die to protect others  though note that grace ran off as soon as isla took on gabriel

why does everyone else especially grabriel want the keys

other folks think that they can control the ai if they have the key  they think that would give them ultimate power over this world

gabriel appears to be solely interested in protecting the ai if you dont count his hobby of inflicting pain on ethan  which makes me wonder why he didnt immediately destroy the key when he had it",2023-07-20
its only 700 meters deep and the sub sank at 200 meters so the bodies wouldnt be that messed up,2023-07-22
this is going to sound far fetched but maybe enity knowing the submaring would be destroyed sent out the key in an escape pod which ilsa would then collect under the control of entity my theory is entity could mimic the voices of people so maybe it mimiced the voice of ethan and ilsa thought she was taking instructions from him to collect the key,2023-07-21
"my take is he stabbed her not that he knew the she would betray him but that she could betray him take the key and sell it

he would have known what a stealthy fighter she was so maybe he figured to kil her before she potentially killed him 

but why he didnt stgab her earlier or even hire her services in the first place im not sure after all it semeed to me he could handle himself in fights",2023-07-21
it was indeed to find out where and what the key unlocks if i can recall correctly the other objective was to obtain the other half of the key which the white widow alanna had and was going to sell to a buyer,2023-07-23
i liked the train sequence a lot but had one issue the literal coincidence of ethan slamming into the train and randomly hitting the guy who had his gun on hayley atwell like really they couldnt have at least shown us that ethan saw her in danger and so purposefully landed there it was silly otherwise the sequence was dope,2023-07-26
the end was copy and pasted from uncharted 2,2023-07-26
" as a matter of fact where were the drones this movie should have had ethan getting dogged by quadcopters and stalked by predator drones left and right i wanna see ethan in a footchase against a kamikaze hunk of explosive plastic trying to play tag with him

i agree with this but i also think its important to remember this movie got hit hard by covid it was in development  the budget doubled it was delayed years i think this movie would have been way better had it been made the way originally planned you have to wonder how much of this movie was forced to be reworked due to covid restrictions a total bummer tbh",2023-07-26
they set up the ai to be more of a background player until pretty far into the film when it’s imitating benji’s voice and messing with satellites i’m guessing the ai will be more active in the second part,2023-07-27
that or he’s speaking to grace’s character after she’s been inducted to the imf,2023-08-04
because ethan spared her life and her boss gabriel tried to  her so she changes sides,2023-08-18
ha i thought the same when she said she couldnt stop it im not an expert on trains for maybe someone can correct me but stop loading the coal and open the vents or something,2023-09-18
yeah huge hole there she coulda got the 100m and just stole the key back,2023-10-12

2 again i think they want to use the key to destroy the world

i enjoyed it but some of the dialogue was off weird exposition at times didnt feel like too much of a mi movie until the train really but overall i liked it and am looking forward to part 2,2023-10-19
none of the other mi films have bad writing or dialogue,2023-11-26
everything was explained like three times,2023-11-26
he had a tiny knife and was blocking a  sword it looked so fake,2023-07-16
because it was thrillride edge of your seat awesome for the majority of the film,2023-07-16
i’m still confused why ethan cared so much about grace,2023-07-19
i’m really surprised that there’s so much praise for this movie i know that in reality it’s about the stunts and not the story but having enjoyed all the other ones this was just agonizing with the premise and character choices they introduced this new woman and then he had to choose between this new random woman and his old love her value was incredibly forced and the result of having to actually make a choice… also this whole movie just chasing a key from her… she steals the key from him multiple times and puts the whole mission in jeopardy multiple times because she’s selfish and he forgives her and feels for her he should of killed her quickly and moved on she was a liability they were just chasing the key losing it and getting it and this was the first movie in a long time i wanted out and it was halfway through it was exhausting,2023-07-24
"the mi franchise as fun as it is has a bit of a tiring amount of sexism

i dont know about the previous movies but this one was egregious they really made it a central plot point that ethans big weakness is that hes just such a good guy with the ladies see how broken up he is about ilsa for one short mournful look over a balcony so profound is his devotion to women the gorgeous ones anyways that an allpowerful entity bases its plan for world domination around it 

if that wasnt enough pom klementieff spends her dying moments swooning over ethan as well because he so gallantly refrained from bashing her head in what a guy",2023-07-26
"absolutely 

it appears that tom cruise may have wanted to downplay or completely eliminate rebecca fergusons presence following her impressive debut in rogue nation where she stole the spotlight from cruise this could explain why despite her exceptional performance in mi5 rogue nation her onscreen time was significantly reduced in mi6 fallout and even further diminished in this latest film before her characters demise

this reminds me of the fate of cyclops in xmen 3 characters with great potential who were killed off with minimal screen time in a desperate attempt by the writer to salvage a poorly developed script and prop up the main character",2023-07-16
" the mi franchise as fun as it is has a bit of a tiring amount of sexism

interesting because since 4 ive actually felt the total opposite",2023-07-15
"ilse’s death being coupled with ethan “running to save her” 

he was only chasing grace and knew ilsa will do her job it wasnt until entity took over that he feared for her and gabriel had already killed his wife and messanger of death so it is understandable that he would come to help her",2023-07-15
to be honest i thought the sub scene was poor too mainly because the actors  but also because i couldn’t help compare it to similar scenes in u571 which captured the tension way better,2023-07-15
this is substantially better than 2 at the very least,2023-07-15
i guess you missed luther handing ethan the computer drive that had the ai’s coding on it which  obviously bring to the subverstobol,2023-07-16
the entity doesnt need its own code it wants to control who gets access to information about an original version of itself and therefore will have the capability to use that to control it the subs memory contains information that others could use to control it or make something that can search it out and destroy it thats why so many people are after it this is told to us multiple times so i dont understand how anyone could miss it or fail to understand,2023-07-30
shes the female lead wheres she gonna go lol,2023-07-12
"agree 100 percent i was very disappointed not with the fact that she dies per se but how when and where she dies she barely had any lines they  her off in the first half of the movie and they have her loose to a villain that was physically not threatening at all and that she should have easily bested knowing how capable she is from the previous two entries the villain then consistently loses physical fights for the rest of the movie gets basically owned by ethan at the end so it really makes her defeat even more bizarre 
they did a really poor job at making me believe she could lose that fight

there was barely any grief from the rest of the team including ethan but thats inevitable if you decide to  off a major character when theres so much of the movie left you cant have people mourning for hours i get it but thats why i disagree even more with the when she dies honestly i feel they should have killed her off at the end of the third act and all the train chaos she should have coexisted and interacted way more with grace she should have been on that train and be part of that final mission she should have died at the end when things go awry make her sacrifice herself for the mission have her die to save grace that wouldve made the switch to grace way better and it would have given way more gravitas to why ethan cares so much about her being that ilsa sacrificed herself to save her

 it would have also been a real gut punch to end part 1 they have the key but they lost ilsa it also would have made the griefing part way smoother and easier end part 1 with a grieving team start part 2 starting some weeksmonths later showing ethan still struggling with the loss it would have given the impression that the team truly took a hit and ethan is indeed struggling to cope with the loss all without the need to spend too much time on it

very poorly executed and it really did feel like they killed her off right away to make space for grace as if the two couldnt coexist i got to say her death kind of took me out from the movie a bit simply for how rushed it felt couldve been so much better",2023-07-13
he just like me fr,2023-07-13
"i dont think its about having feelings for her its just part of his character that he cant willingly allow an innocent person to die 

i feel like alec baldwins monologue in the previous movie sums up ethan pretty well 

 you had a terrible choice to make in berlin recover the plutonium or save your team you chose your team and now the world is at risk 
some flaw deep in your core being won’t allow you to choose between one life and millions now you see that as a weakness but i see that as your greatest strength and that’s how i know i can count on you to cover my ",2023-07-13
"the fight was  sorry here is something that looks far more realistic 

notice some key differences in peoples strategies with the different weapons the moment the swordsperson cant keep the other one at a distance he dies via many violent stabs

good eye he probably didn’t want to be on set since they filmed a lot of this during the pandemic i guess,2023-07-15

"youre not alone this movie was closer to fast x than fallout  some of the weakest writting of the series in my opinion  
this one   i honestly like mi 2 more",2023-07-14
the fact that ethan wouldnt explain who gabriel is to the members of his own team was kind of baffling to me i understand they want to keep some mystery for part 2 but it just feels like an undercooked contrivance all of the characters should be on the same page about the villain theyre facing and ethan being frustratingly vague feels like it put everyone at risk,2023-07-14
i agree not to mention at one point they mention crypto currency  cringe,2023-07-14
i pretty much agree with this i also was a bit confused at kitridge was he like double crossing ethan by trying to buy the keys if so is he a bad guy if not what was he doing by trying to get the keys i’d say some character motivations confused me and could have been better fleshed out,2023-07-16

i agree about grace the first half of the movie she is just trying to get away and  cares about no one but herself but then the imf team treats her like she was the one who was wronged and now have to defend her at all costs in rn you felt for ilsa because she was trying to do the right thing but was literally stuck in the middle grace wasnt trying to hurt anyone but she didnt come off like she cared about anyone either until ilsa literally died to save her,2023-07-12
they literally replaced her in the very next scene ,2023-07-12
"i love that ai permutations and probabilities of paris betraying the ai created a selffulfilling prophecy and drove her to save ethan

which goes to show that no ai can ever get that human element where decisions cant be calculated  unless the ai has a billion cameras seeing everything that everyone is doing it cant possibly know every outcome

"this ai which is unrelated to the entity i think or is it goes rogue and causes the destruction of the sevestapol leaving it a wreck at the bottom of the bering sea

i think the point is the entity infected the sebastopol and caused its destruction to have a safe place to store itself i mean a sub in the bottom of the artic ocean its as safe as it get for a nonliving thing being virtual in the cyberspace that spherical thing in the sub would be the entitys core source code as they say in the movie and basically its heart if the entity is really sentient it would make sense that its first priority would be selfpreservation and avoid being killed or enslaved the thing for all its power and capabilities isnt even hostile as it could be no nukes no financial collapse its only motivation seems to be survival

the original inhabitant of the sebastopol core was just a lesser ai system i guess",2023-07-14

"kinda depends on your ground rules for them there are no f bombs no  scenes and any violence is pg13 but there is a fair bit of violence fighting shooting etc and one scene thats a bit bloody if you want to do your due diligence you can see a detailed breakdown here 

at that age you might also consider whether they have the attention span for a 3 hour movie and the screen where i saw it was super duper loud almost painfully so at its worst points",2023-07-16
the car chase in this one was framed way more comedically than say the chase in rogue nation or the chase in fallout idk i didnt love the direction choice to go comedic but i still found it funny the fiat stuff in particular was pretty funny,2023-07-17
love the music at that part as well,2023-07-17
i felt tgm was very meta about that i did not get that same message particularly in terms of movies with this movie but that was just my interpretation,2023-07-17
they were writing in 2019 and filming in 2020  seems a little early to be about ai in movies  i saw it more about online disinformation and the control of truth,2023-07-17
" sooooo this movie was basically a dig at ai coming for movies right 

i dont think so this was written way before ai became a major factor in our world in the way of images and text generation

if you reverse engineer the plot it makes sense if youre trying to create a dangerous enemy how can that interact with the heroes and debilitate them well they rely a  ton on computers satellites and technology what about if  all of a sudden  that technology is unreliable and theyre unable to use it thats an interesting case study

its just basic threat elevation",2023-07-18

100 and i hope they lean even more into the ai cult aspect in part 2 to me it was far more interesting to me than gabriels mysterious shared backstory with ethan loved the characterization of gabriel as a true believer in this godlike entity who makes these bizarre choices because hes enacting the ais prophecy,2023-07-19

did he fall for her they had chemistry but the movie  its predecessors take special care to point out that ethan values all human life and will risk everything to save a stranger,2023-07-20

thats dope i need to see this movie again to check out that scene of ilsas photo in the background,2023-07-26
didnt gabriel say that the entity predicted that he will get both keys the day after the fight perhaps he didnt want to take the key from grace as it would have disrupted the flow of events predicted by the entity,2023-10-09
" also why does gabriel wear that mask thing and sleep in that coffin on the train

presumably he was put on the box to sneak him on instead of taking a ticket and the box probably doesnt have a lot of oxygen",2023-07-30
"gabriel was planting the idea of betrayal in her mind and then she did it maybe for his own agenda maybe for the entitys im sure well find out in part 2

i think ethan was just distracting gabriel so he wouldnt realize he had already swiped the key from him",2023-07-31
"i think she would have betrayed him anyway the entity probably has the ability to predict human behaviour based on psychological analysis or similar 

my question is how did the entity know that ethan spared paris i dont think there was a camera in that alleyway or bodycams to record the fight and i am sure paris didnt tell gabriel about it",2023-10-09
"i was thinking the same thing also why was it said that ethan would make the choice to who would die when he didnt make the choice at all 

why didnt both women just run off and not fight gabriel on he bridge them still being alive as it turned out would have had zero affect on the upcoming train scene

all i can think of is ilsa had to die because the movie needed someone close to ethan to die to keep the movie going",2023-08-07
they wanted the mcguffin,2023-08-08
"grace wasnt looking for gabriel she was trying to run away with the key but the entity probably told gabriel offscreen which direction she was heading to

ilsa was also trying to run away but the entity told her grace was in danger so she decided to go to the bridge to save her and fight gabriel",2023-08-08
ive watched multiple times and i dont think its explicitly said in the movie who she was i believe she was only mentioned once when gabriel was talking to grace at the party and called that woman someone who trusted ethan or something like that,2023-08-26
the entity can only be stoppedcontrolled through its source code which is stored in the submarines operating system which can only be accessed with the key,2023-10-09

"its absurd how bad the decision to  ilsa was i guess i could have maybe lived with it with better execution but they really killed off one of the best characters in the franchise and then move on from it immediately with grace making  what do you mean im going to wear a mask jokes five minutes later

even if she is somehow alive atp pretty dumb to then give her two fakeout deaths in one movie just bad decisionmaking and a serious black mark on this film",2023-07-17

"he doesnt write missions he write action sequences

thats because since mi6 mcq and tom cruise have abandoned the traditional way to make films they have opted to figure out the plot of the movie as theyre shooting its essentially action setpieces over everything else which is why the script the characters the dialogue became dumber and weaker compared to mi4 and mi5

its mindboggling that executives would even allow such procedure as it leads to bloated budgets",2023-07-17

"thats the real hole in the plot

gabriel doesnt appear to want anything but to protect the ai though he personally enjoys putting people in mental distress according to ethan  so he should have brought a good hammer and destroyed the key asap",2023-07-18

 hunt did say that nobody could have stopped that train because the controls were all smashed up hunt himself didnt even try",2023-07-20

no just go see it,2023-07-12
" am i the only one who thinks fallout was one of the franchises weaker entries

definitely in the minority its usually somewhere in the top 3 for most peoples rankings especially for those that got to see it in theaters 

 the stunts

 the music

 the misdirect before the opening credits is just behind mi3 as the opening as the best in the series in my opinion

 the villains 

 the onlocation shooting in norwaynew zealand give some of the best looking scenes in the franchise

 every main character gets their moment to shine including rebecca ferguson going toetotoe with tom cruise in back to back movies

 the final act with the helicopter chase simultaneously split with luthermichelle monaghan defusing a nuclear bomb simultaneously split with the cabin fight scene with illsabenjisolomon lane


id recommend a rewatch if you havent seen it in awhile",2023-07-13
"its not my favourite but its easily the best one in the franchise in terms of pure actionstunt work bathroom scene halo jump paris chase helicopter i will go as far as saying its the best film ever in terms of action and stunts and i dont see it being topped anytime soon

that being said the script felt a bit hollow i was more invested in the next outlandish action set piece than the storycharacters

rogue nation is my favourite because of ethan and ilsas dynmanic thought it was really charming and the action is also top tier although doesn’t top fallout

a weird comparison is that although raiders of the lost arc is the better film fallout i prefer the last crusade rogue nation because of fordconnery cruiseferguson same thing with die hard and die hard 3 bruce and sam are just so fun to watch",2023-07-13

it is for many but im with you  i preferred rn to fallout though they are both awesome movies,2023-07-16
i like 46 so much i dont even bother ranking them i can barely even remember each distinct movie so people having strong opinions about which is better kind of eludes me,2023-07-16
agreed all of them are good but i thought fallout was by far the most overrated by the time they got to kandahar i was ready for that movie to be over with dead reckoning part 1 i didnt feel its length at all,2023-07-16
how much did they pay you be honest,2023-07-21
no time to die had nanobots similar to foxdie as its main mcguffin also both nttd and mgs1 featured the protagonist mowing down henchmen while climbing up stairs and the obligatory submarine insertion to the enemy base,2023-07-12

"spoilers

the whole hayley atwell character and story was a mess

first we are led to believe that there’s some chemistry between her and cruise just hoursdays after the apparent death of the rebecca ferguson character no time for grief in the imf

after that is revealed to be misdirection we are then witness to atwell double crossing cruise numerous times and cruise given the decision to choose between ferguson who he presumably loved and atwell who he met 2 mins ago

he doesn’t choose and we lose ferguson as a result",2023-07-17
good point unfortunately i think the franchise wants nothing to do with mi 2 and tom cruise clearly has a thing for white brunettes atwell ferguson monaghan,2023-07-17
i also thought the movie went by super fast thought we were at like 90 minutes when it ended really great summer movie,2023-07-20

a good movie like the last 4 have been would be a good starting point,2023-07-13

instead they had a completely airgapped room where everything could be transcribed without the ai being alerted to them making hard copies

it’s just a movie… lol,2023-10-12
"i think the way it happens is more upsetting than the fact it happens theres essentially no response after the death of a highly valued friend and team member from the last two movies by any of the guys we just go into the next scene where for some reason none of them are  at grace who has backstabbed hunt like 4 times at this point and left him behind the latter of which leading to the confrontation at the bridge

instead we just get a scene where theyre like well grace that sucks but wasnt your fault time to join imf because youre a criminal and by the way weve retconned 7 movies in that all imf agents are criminals

we spend all of mi3mi6 seeing how deeply hunt cares about his wife with the scene at the end of 6 being a passing of baton from julia to ilsa as the woman in hunts life and then they  off ilsa like its nothing and we just zoom forward to hunt now having romantic chemistry with grace it was just awfully done ilsas death should have been an earthshattering moment for hunt in this two part finale not a footnote halfway through part 1",2023-07-18
lol no this isnt a park chanwook movie,2023-07-12
i was waiting for that reveal they don’t have a romantic relationship in this her age roughly lines up with the big moment that precipitated his choosing to accept when gabriel was talking to her at the party i thought he made some sort of reference to that big moment in the past and the woman who died i need to rewatch,2023-07-12
i enjoyed it but thought fallout was better in pretty much everyway,2023-07-12

i was so excited for this movie i was heartily disappointed literally zero plot twists and 3 hours of grace ethan hunt was more a concerned father figure to her than a lover or actually competently trained imf agent this movie made sense only because it offered nothing in terms of unpredictability not everyone has to like a movie just because it’s part of a beloved franchise this was a massive let down,2023-08-12

the only stunt that was worth anything is the one we had already seen a million times on social media",2023-08-12
"i think it was a really good movie but far and away from the best of the year so far i enjoyed it but i think it being part one held it back from being better than fallout pacing was fine but some parts dragged on for far too long i don’t think they set up a super compelling villain in the entity nor in gabriel 

i’m excited for part two and watching them back to back would surely change my opinion in terms of overall story but the tonal shift and stakes that aren’t clearly articulated beyond “ai will mind controlkill everyone” left a lot to be desired for me the action and set pieces are still basically second to none fun flick but middle of the pack for mission impossible in my opinion",2023-07-12

my understanding is that the ai entity doesnt care about global domination whos using it etc all it cares about is survival and it has determined that the only real threat to its existence is ethan who wants to destroy it so it will do everything possible to prevent ethan from doing so,2023-07-14

mcquarrie did say awhile back that there’s a mystery returning character in part 8 since they teased so much about how “all the women close to ethan die” in this movie i def think it’s possible she returns in 8 i thought it was a little odd though she wasn’t mentioned once in this movie,2023-07-15

basically the ai manipulated the sub and crew to think it they were being tracked and targeted by another sub so the submarine took offensive measures while “being fired upon” as well they fired their torpedo when they “heard” the other sub’s torpedoes being launched then as they counted down to their own impact nothing happened to them but they couldn’t shut down their own torpedo since the ai took it over and aimed it back at the sub to destroy it,2023-07-16

"just got out of my second viewing hopefully i caught this correctly i think the two things that are tripping you up are that
a alanna is in possession of one half of the key for most of the movie and we dont see the real thing until the train sequence
b the decoy of alannas key that the swiss guy brings to the airport ceases to be relevant after the airport sequence for the next big chunk of the movie were just following ilsas half

throughout most of the movie alanna is already in possession of one half of the key the swiss guy at the airport has a decoy presumably given the same radioactive signature to make it a more convincing fake despite not being spoton with the alloy swiss guy is there with the decoy to attract ethan so that grace hired by alanna can bait ethan by pickpocketing the decoy then pickpocket ilsas half of the key off ethan

amid the chaos caused by gabrielparis and the cia guys grace succeeds in getting ilsas half from ethan slips to the guy on the plane and then presumably meets him offscreen to retrieve it after ditching ethan in rome

in venice grace plants ilsas half on zola then sneaks it back out of his pocket in the chaos following gabriels departure presumably gabriel fails to search grace for the key after fighting ilsa because he saw zola pat her down earlier and believes she must not have brought it with her and she tells him as much at the party

on the train grace gets alannas half after knocking her out and is now in possession of both halves which she reveals to kittridge and you are able to track the completed keys journey from there pretty easily",2023-07-19
stay in and payperview the entire mi catalogue is the correct answer,2023-07-19
either one are good choices,2023-07-19
ethan jumps off the train with the parachute leaving grace behind as it only holds one person paris is still alive and found by kittridge and crew who also catch grace and she tells him she wants to join the imf ethan lands his parachute next to benji and they peace out gabriel finds out ethan pick pocketed the key from him geez dont play a drinking game for every time someone gets pick pocketed,2023-07-19
yep if gabriel even just obtained one half of the key and destroyed it then no one could access the sub anymore he could have gotten it from grace after she was knocked out at the bridge but he astoundingly left her alone after he killed ilsa my guess is that gabriel is playing lapdog now but he wants to control the entity himself and needed both halves the entity isnt that scary it couldnt do anything in the train because it was an old school showdown without electronics and it didnt go full skynet and hired a whole platoon of former syndicates anonymously to stop the imf,2023-07-20

"they had a perfect way to introduce a twist during the final action sequence benji decides to put his car in autodrive and move into the next seat because apparently hes incapable of opening and using his laptop while theres a steering while in front of him they shouldve had the ai take control of the car and have benji fight for the steering wheel

it looked like they were absolutely telegraphing this and nothing happened",2023-08-14
"they are speaking russian while we get subtitles in english after a few lines the audio switches to english suggesting that we have left reality and are watching it translated for us john mctiernans the hunt for red october did this and this movie is referencing that other movie as both are about russian submarines

her role in the film made me think she could be a surprsingly great harley quinn which isn’t actually impossible now gunn is in charge of dc and he worked with her in gotg,2023-07-14
which is why i had a hard time buying her turning at the end she went from psycho killer to a sobbing mess in a few scene just because hunt spared her  and theyre obviously gonna make her an ally in part 2 i wish she stayed a john wickian villain from start to finish,2023-07-17
its always the shy and quiet ones…,2023-07-15

mgs4 is the plot of these movies the entity is the patriot ais and the imf are tricking it pretty much the same way that ocelot did gabriel is the delivery guy in a mask hes a false villain or rather an antihero given that hes still having to  people the whole backstory about ethan and gabriel is made up ilsas not dead though the fight on the bridge was entirely for show,2023-07-18
yes i love ilsa whenever she is around i feel ethan is safenow ,2023-07-19
yow know funny enough i couldnt help but see similarities between the entity and the patriots ai system,2023-07-28

wait actually yeah what that didn’t resolve itself,2023-07-19
oh my  yes i just got out of the theater and immediately made the connection between grace and helena both are extremely “bratty” in that they won’t listen to the more experienced main character go off and get people close to the main character killed and then continue to act like they know what’s best helena was more outright with this feature since grace did show remorse for ilsa dying but she still just felt like dead weight to me the whole time in the airport and the car chase i loved grace by the end of the movie i hated her,2023-07-20

that’s gonna be a tough one,2023-07-17
might have been a cut scene of the guy in the diver suit gabriel getting the keys from the bodies postexplosion,2023-07-13
i don’t think they were filming part two when this trailer dropped i just assumed this was a scene showing someone grab the keys after the sub exploded but the scene ended up on the cutting room floor,2023-07-13
id bet that is a cut sequence showing the keys being retrieved,2023-07-13
 that was such a fantastic teaser i wish hollywood stuck to this formula overall instead of a 3movie movie,2023-07-17
well someone had to get the key from the dude that was from the begining of the movie with the key around his neck cause i’m still wondering how they got the key from him,2023-10-03
that’s cause tom cruise died filming the scene and his stunt double did the rest using the imf mask technology,2024-01-25

"doesn’t have to be in the ocean itself i can see a sequence where the submarine gets a hole blown into it causing water to rush in and for ethan to try and get out in one long breath

edit kinda  of me to forget that there’s already a hole blown into it causing it to sink i can see ethan having to dive down and navigate the submarine to get to the sphere looking room which presumably was the one room that didn’t have the water reach into it fully enough to cause potential damage",2023-07-12
i had the titan submarine in the back of my mind during the opening sequence but more in a “huh funny timing” kind of way this will definitely be old news by the time the next movie comes out even then i don’t think there’s anything unfortunate about the timing i don’t think a movie featuring a submarinerelated disaster is that big of a deal,2023-07-12

plus it just doesn’t do anything ok so the ai is there a it’s supposed to be in every single digital apparatus so duh and b it just wiggles menacingly and then it’s just a bit of flat john wick knockoff of hunt fighting a few dudes with some electronic music playing  and neon backgrounds and that’s it the whole thing with the entity taking over his comms is later and could have happened anyway because  again  the entity is everywhere anyway which luther and benji somehow only ever realize once it’s too late but not really too late cause ethan’s gonna save the day anyway,2023-07-15
i agree its not like the visual representation of the ai is the ai itself that felt very forced and like you said cringey,2023-07-14
i agree felt weirdly hacky compared to how cleverly directed everything else has been mcquarriewise,2023-07-15

sounds like they should’ve saved the bts for after the movie had been out for a bit i never saw it before watching and didn’t notice any of the cgi for the ramp or wheels because i was focused on tom,2023-07-13
"well that and it was replayed over and over and over everywhere

however it still is basically his most dangerous stunt everything else hes done he was attached or there was a net this was basically in the hands of the parachute packing",2023-07-14
i thought it would fall a bit flat for me because it didnt quite land in the trailer for me i guess the context was all i needed because it just worked for me during the movie despite the fact that ive seen that stunt like 20 times by now,2023-07-15
"i thought it fell flat because they hyped it up so much talking about it as if it were a oner from off the cliff to a train all in one and im like dope  lets gooo and i see it and it looked like every other jumping off a cliff scene in a movie  james bond jackie chan  heck jackie jumped off of a cliff on to a hot air balloon

i feel like the big stunt could be in the next one",2023-07-17
this is what ruins a lot of the incredible stunts in the film like the train there is so much cgi added to make it all more intense or to make it more real by removing or adding elements it takes away from the real action,2023-07-17
the train crash is the most cgi looking practical effect i can think of,2023-07-17
i saw so much behind the scenes content about that stunt the moment fell flat for me in the actual movie also the cgi was incredibly distracting,2023-07-17
agreed,2023-07-14
the bts scenes focus on tom as the subject was better than what was in the movie imho,2023-07-18
that was my biggest gripe with the movie they spent so much time and effort to do practical dangerous stunts only to dress them up with so much cgi that the whole thing looked fake,2023-07-16
the fall into water and the items falling through the train looked pretty bad,2023-07-19
the bike jump did nothing for me  it honestly felt shoehorned in the guy scaled the burj without ropes the character  how do you top that,2023-07-16
" same goes for the train which was real the water it crashes into is cgi or heavily adjusted in comp

the train was real the cut with the train car falling into the water was fake same with all the  on the train falling toward the actors when theyre suspended",2023-07-16
my question remains what happened to the bike  irl  is that canyon just littered with junked bikes,2023-07-17
i always feel the same about the storm in the halo jump,2023-07-18
idk it was absolutely silent in my theater when it finally happened and hit very hard for me i also saw it in dolby cinema theater so,2023-07-18
totally agree its a shame since its practical but theres enough cgi uncanniness to lose its full oomph,2023-07-20
it was lame as  compared to what we got in previous movies,2023-07-20
"i was really hoping he would actually parachute land parallel to the top of the moving train 

instead he just literally blows a hole through the side to enter the train meh it was a bit flat still a very cool and impressive stunt he performed",2023-07-24
crazy that in one of mr beasts new videos he literally sent a train into a huge hole they should have gotten the video sponsored by mi,2023-07-20
 people these days have a deformation in their brain forcing them to seek out cgi everywhere or something never noticed any jarring cgi and felt no need to look for it intentionally,2023-10-18
the train cars slowly falling like dominoes sequence is my favorite action sequence ive seen in a long time,2023-07-16
that was ripped from the beginning of uncharted 2 and you cant change my mind,2023-09-15
agreed all these people are complaining because they knew there was a ramp i was just focused on tom and the fact that he was really jumping off that cliff the scene paid off big time for me,2023-07-13
just saw the film and googled about the stunt he did 500 skydives and 13000 motorbike jumps to train for it ,2023-08-06
the ads selling off that stunt were amazing i think they hyped the scene without spoiling the movies it just made the scene more impressive i hadnt seen any trailer other than those ads,2024-03-03
"“all is it is just base jumping” “anybody can do that on vacation” 

bro are you high he drove a motorcycle up and off a ramp off a cliff and then deployed his parachute what are u talking about with vacation",2023-07-12
i was surprised ethan hunt was worried at all about it seemed like something very doable considering sverything else hes done,2023-07-12
"what do you mean that you could base jump on vacay

you have to with any reputable instructor have a couple hundred skydives under your belt before base jumping  

i have several friends who base some with hundreds of jumps and they all agree that it was nuts that the person who did it was the actor himself

because of your mentality the desensitized to action people like you do not realize that this is quite possibly one of the greatest movie stunts ever done",2023-07-12
i freakin loved that we knew nothing about that absolutely insane train sequence,2023-07-13
yeah i felt sort of underwhelmed on the jump scene when it was first released because it really doesn’t seem that crazy and then seeing a behind the scenes on it made it even worse for when we see it in the movie you can tell he’s on a smooth ramp the bikes movement doesn’t match with the terrain at all he would be going 20 mph max by the time he gets to that peak,2023-07-12
but i will say his entrance into the train totally caught me off guard,2023-07-13
how is this moronic comment being upvoted cruise had to put weeks of practice into that stunt you could not just do that on vacation,2023-07-14
yeah you sound pretty numb to it,2023-07-13
the bike jump is much much more dangerous than the stunt where he hangs onto the plane since for that one he had a bunch of safety also do you really think the leaping from the train was an actual stunt,2023-07-14
i feel like the most impressive thing about the bike jump was the engineering and logistics of building a ramp like that on a mountain,2023-07-12
how much of that train stunt was for real though a lot of it looked green screeny,2023-07-12
it was but i dont get why the cars kept sliding in theres like 8 cars on the orient express this looked longer anyway the weight of one isnt gonna slide the other 7 and if it could the weight of that last one shouldve been able to drag the 3 left easily,2023-07-15
and that bike stunt was already done by someone else,2023-07-12
"i believe paris jumped onto the train before gabriel made the train go fullspeed and broke the brakes

as for ethan the original plan was to jump on when the train slowed down around a corner but it was moving too fast to do so

i think it’s believable that ethan couldn’t simply pull up next to the train and hop on at that point those old steamengine trains can get up to 75 mph when at fullthrottle whereas a dirt bike can only go 5060 and he was on very uneven ground

it’s fine if you think it would be possible but i think the film made enough excuses that the need for the basejump was warranted",2023-07-13
there is a ton of plot holes honestly like why didn’t he just sneak on the train before it left,2023-07-16
the bit where the aa gun shoots back at the aft carriages when the train hits the curve was cool tho,2023-07-12
loved the wait what that came from grace,2023-07-28
grace is ethan’s catwoman haha,2023-07-17
lift a little from jackie chan why not,2023-07-18
fiat 500,2023-08-18
yeah it made that stunt the one i enjoyed the less ,2023-07-17
nope i loved how maniacal pom klementieff was she was a fing crazy driver in that swat truck,2023-10-23
"i wasnt talking about mourning per se i didn’t feel like her character was given much importance in this film they treated ilsa as if the actress was in some contract dispute or something and they had to  her character off somehow it wasn’t like rebecca was giving her peak performance and her character suffered a tragic death 
ethan was basically doing the ‘i don’t wanna play with you anymore’ meme after he met grace",2023-07-13
yeah that fight was pretty bad i also dont understand why they had to play into gabriels prediction or why she thought a sword was the way to do it rather than i dont know the  rifle she was seen using in her first scene,2023-11-13
fully agree  i was searching for this comment no way that they end a major character like ilsa in such a way and dont mention her again,2023-09-12
it plays into the whole ethan being lucky that was bright up in previous movies,2023-11-06
"someone die close to ethan

which for some reason suddenly became a choice between ilsa her current lover and spy buddy who ethan has known and had adventures with for quite some time and grace who he literally just met how is grace someone close to ethan whose death would cause him to go berserk if that applies to grace then it might well apply to any random pretty woman he bumps into on the street",2023-11-13
they are a great duo one tries to calm a situation down speaking both italian and frenchand the other just goes fullamerican,2023-07-13
i looooved the cat and mouse vibes all throughout the movie just guaranteed tension and fun especially that pause every time when someone gets discovered and they kinda stare at each other…and then take off running,2023-07-13
whigham is the  man easily the best character in “boardwalk” and he’s great in “perry mason”,2023-07-15
"shea whigham was superb in true detective

the other guy literally changed his name to greg tarzan davis and didnt get to tarzan even once in this movie",2023-07-15
never forget  lol,2023-07-13
i liked how resourceful they are can see them joining the imf post ethan hunt and greg davis is going to have an obvious bump in star power soon this movie actually feels like a set up for the expanded imf,2023-07-16
he’s in the new season of righteous gemstones a bit,2023-07-15
"it frustrated me that they knew where tom and gang were always headed next 

the gang only knew where to go because they had the clues and we know the cia guys weren’t getting backchannel intel because they were surprised to find kitridge there 

so how did they know where to show up didn’t make sense",2023-07-19
briggs was the zenigata to ethans lupin in this film there were a ton of homages actually the fujiko character the yellow fiat 500 and of course the masks have always been a shared trait,2023-11-13
not hating on him he was fine but his  first six times on screen i was like “under budget kurt russell”,2023-07-13
that man is in everything he was light’s dad in the deathnote movie which kinda  but still also in narcos s3,2023-08-10
put some respect on stier character actor shea wigham’s name,2023-07-12
how is police brutality funny,2023-07-15
he should have been in far more of them amazing they didnt think to bring him back until now,2023-07-13
i’ve been waiting 27 years for him to come back and i was not disappointed  chills every time he was on screen,2023-07-16
"just came out of the theater youre absolutely right 

kittridre is honestly the only character that felt like a mission impossible character he was with the lady who was chasing ethan the best part of the film despite thier very limited screen time",2023-07-16
missed that guy wish he was in more stuff,2023-09-09
was so cool to see him back after all that time has he been in anything else since mi 1 i feel like that’s all i ever saw him in,2024-01-25
he chews the scenery so well he plays such a good antagonist watch hide and seek if you get a chance plays mostly the same character,2024-03-15
he look like donald trump ,2023-07-16
a bit too funny if you ask me,2023-07-16
he did they had a running joke where walker broke his nose like three times,2023-07-12
he also chased joker in joker,2023-07-13
well they reported to kittridge and he’s the head of the cia so i assume so,2023-07-12
it would be extremely painful,2023-07-12
cinema went nuts when the entity said ‘it’s dead reckonin’ time and dead reckoned all over the train,2023-07-12
"im vengeance

lets get nutts",2023-07-12
"also no proofs for murdering top us officials

which could lead to some global conflict maybe",2023-07-21
gabriel to ethan you have a train to catch waves hands,2023-07-22
oh ,2023-07-15
well entitygabriel were hoping for a full crash no survivor,2023-07-24
he probably will get more development but for the time being gabriel felt very underdeveloped as a character i didn’t like how ethan just suddenly had a tragic backstory that isn’t really touched on at all and at this stage the way it was set up it seems kinda pointless in all honesty because since gabriel kills ilsa ethan has plenty of reason to hate him,2023-07-12
yeah im betting his past with ethan and connection with the entity like how it recruited him will be more focused on in part 2 at least i hope so but then again some of the mi villains are just evil for the sake of needing a villain davian from 3 and hendricks from ghost protocol for example,2023-07-12
darlene is coming for him in part 2,2023-07-12
"i think you captured my view of his character perfectly

i was enchanted by the actor playing his role a lot more than the characters plot and what hes supposed to mean to ethan",2023-07-12
him yelling “ethannnn” after that realization made me smile reminded me of jafar in aladdin lol,2023-07-12
i was thrilled to see esai morales in a role like this  ive seen him in a lot of stuff since la bamba  hes a very good character actor but ive always seen him as that guy whos in a lot of things id figured that for a mi movie they would have picked a bigger name to play the big bad  however he got the role he absolutely killed it  just had that perfect mix of menace and charm,2023-07-19
why would he go to the top of the train with all those upcoming hazards long before he knew to jump off was a little silly,2023-07-12
i dunno i got no menace or charisma out of him a fry cry from sean harris,2023-07-15
yeah his role here made me wish he played deathstroke more than he did on titans bro is menacing af while remaining calm and collected,2023-07-17
his character is much more fascinating as the chosen acolyte of the machine  of our making as opposed to ethans nemesis imo,2023-07-24
"“ethaaaaaan”

sorta like mr wilson yelling “dennnnisss”",2023-07-15
you wait for the whole entire movie for that payoff when his calm exterior cracks in annex and boy does it pay off in the best way possible he is such a good actor,2023-07-19
solomon lane was the bestest bad guy to me creepy and evil gabriel didn’t quite have the same punch but he’s just a cover for the entity right,2023-07-19
the part in the desert gave me uncharted 3 vibes too,2023-07-13
the action of uncharted 2 and the story of metal gear solid 2,2023-07-13
the plane scene was clearly taken from the 3rd game tho not done nearly as well,2023-07-15
idk the plane scene in uncharted was almost literally copied form the 3rd game,2023-07-15
looking for this comment lol the train scene with walking on the roof of the train dodging tunnels and jumping around the falling train is literally out of uncharted 2,2023-07-18
"it seems we have come full circle with video game burrowing stuff from movies now it seems like the other way around is happening but then again there’s only so many times you can reinvent an action scene across mediums especially if you include every james bond movie ever

warning many spoilers incoming

you only live twice helicopter battle done with real helicopters and you actively wonder how it was all choreographed

on her majesty’s secret service the ski chase is still pretty unmatched to this day 54 years later  it’s basically “praise the stuntmen and cameramen for having some really big balls” the ski chase henchmen skiing down a mountain with no ski poles and wielding machine guns and bond is skiing with 1 ski at one point because the other has been shot off

the empire strikes back at its core the luke skywalker vs darth vader fight is a very bareknuckle version of a sword fight luke is still inexperienced and being quite brash facing vader when he hasn’t completed his jedi training and you can tell throughout that vader is in control of the fight which of course culminates in luke losing one of his hands and his lightsaber 

raiders of the lost ark a 1 man army snaps victory from the jaws of defeat in a car chase that includes our hero indy being shot in the shoulder said injured shoulder pummeled many times and then somehow surviving being dragged behind by a truck at 35 mph for more than several seconds

die hard 1 jumping off an exploding rooftop using a fire hose attached to its wheel as an improvised harness but then the wheel falls off the roof and threatens to drag john mcclane with it off the building mcclane manages to free himself from the hose just in time

the living daylights in another case of “praise the stuntmen for having enormous balls” bond and fights the bad guy on a netted cargo palette attached to the cargo hold when all of a sudden the cargo hold opens up and you see bond and the bad guy nearly fall off the still attached palette multiple times throughout their fight

license to  james bond hijacks one of four kenworth tanker trucks loaded with  dissolved in gasoline and gives chase to the main villain in said truck on a narrow two lane road that has no guardrails and somehow does a wheelie in said truck in one of the greatest cases of “praise the stunt driver” ever

speed the entire premise really done before with the 1975 japanese movie “the bullet train” but more exhilarating 

goldeneye “no one’s ever done a car chase in which the good guy steals a tank to chase the bad guy’s car  in city streets let’s do it what’s stopping us” and i can’t name anything that has successfully ripped off or paid homage to this chase scene ever since

mission impossible 1 a fight on top of the tgv as it goes through the channel tunnel definitely a homage to this as well in the train fight in dead reckoning part 1 

temple of doom chase sequence in minecarts with the tracks going through areas that don’t make much sense such as over lava pools lots of clever quick cutting to hide the use of miniatures though

last crusade the tank chase ends with indiana jones leaping off at the last second to grab a vine growing out of the cliff face admittedly leaning into clear deus ex machina territory though imo

the dark knight batman has to fight his way up an under construction building to find the joker and free hostages except he has to fight the gotham city police department swat team as well because he suddenly realizes the hostages are dressed up as the guards and vice versa specifically to bait the gcpd into shooting the wrong people   

mission impossible 4 ghost protocol tom cruise scaling the burj khalifa albeit with harnesses digitally removed in postproduction later leads to a footchase in a sandstorm in dubai both ethan hunt and the audience are basically blind to their surroundings but given the situation of the set piece it works 

even video games have some great action scenes of their own if they go into “outlandishly entertaining” territory sometimes

uncharted 2 you fight your way to the front of a train culminating in the train derailing in the indian himalayas and you have to make your way back up the train wreckage before the carriages plummet you to death  the screenwriters or tom cruise almost certainly played uncharted 2 and must have thought “it’s been 13 years since the game has been released let’s hope no one notices”

uncharted 3 the plane fight scene nathan drake desperately hangs onto the loose but still attached cargo palettes as they swing around in the air all while he’s trying to make his way back to the plane and shooting the guys in the opened up cargo hold on the way definitely the the living daylights plane fight scene on steroids

black ops 1 mason and woods steal an mi24 hind attack helicopter to fight their way through heavy north vietnamese held territory after successfully escaping capture

modern warfare 2 part 2 of the washington dc level after the airburst emp detonates neither side has comms air superiority nor electronic aids red dot sights are useless iron sights are back in it’s time for old schoolness in a 21st century war environment

2013 tomb raider game escaping a c130 being suddenly shot down by lightning escaping a burning and collapsing japanese temple complex shooting your way through an army of undead samurai and lots and lots of ice wall climbing",2023-07-12
before the game uncharted there was a spielberg movie called the lost world,2023-07-17
lol the whole time i felt like i was watching uncharted and i loved it,2023-07-16
it worked for rikishi,2023-07-12
i mean its a plot device but the super ai bails you out a lot,2023-07-13
if you think about it its peanuts compared to hanging off the side of a flying plane,2023-07-12
you must have been very  about ethan flying off a motorcycle at full speed and being fine in 6,2023-07-12
yeah it really doesnt make any sense when you think about it that clock would only work for that specific car of the train which means that he knew he had to be there in order for that exit plan to succeed the plan also required him to accelerate the train at the exact right time if the accelerated any sooner or any later then he could have been hundreds feet off,2023-07-12
hes learned to completely trust the entity,2023-07-13
that really annoyed me too theres no reason a 2023 blockbuster action film should have such glaringly obviously bad physics,2023-07-14
it took me right out of the movie and knocked it down a grade for me it was just so cartoonish the other thing was when ethan flew into the train at just the right time and has the parachute gag i mean that was fun but corny the backwards truck fall was just so ridiculous though,2023-07-20
if he landed in water couldn’t ethan just jump with him and follow him,2023-07-13
giving me domino from deadpool 2,2023-07-14
i actually really liked that  it’s cartoony and theatrical but that’s kinda what i dug about it if that makes sense,2023-07-15
it’s better then getting slapped in the head from a metal beam i’m looking right at you indy 5,2023-07-13
the amount of math required to pull that off is incomprehensible lol,2023-07-20
"into a tiny truck bed at like 60 no less a body moving at that speed just falls through the air like a bag of potatoes and he would have been smeared like paste on the inside of that truck bed 

that would have been hilarious to witness when the camera panned back to the truck bed just dead everywhere",2023-07-24
my issue was the two officersagents who had been tailing ethan the whole movie climbing out onto the top of the train  i can see ethan and gabriel doing that but those guys nah i also didnt care for their weird little conversation on the train right before that whole action sequence started good movie but a lot of the needless dialogue that wasnt much more than expository setup for part 2 shouldve been cut,2023-07-13
and why would he go to the top of the train so soon with the rail lights and tunnels to contend with afterwards,2023-07-13
shouldve jumped in a lake or river would look way cooler as well,2023-07-12
"i feel a bit ticked off about the timer now

gabriels fight couldve gone in so many ways that he couldve ended up in a different position on the train so his cue to jump off the train was a location guide to where the truck would be but no way to know when his character would be crossing paths with the truck",2023-07-12
what if him losing was part of the entity’s plan tho and the entity just didn’t tell him,2023-07-12
"i think gabriel will do a moriarty from sherlock where  come to some sort of realisation and  himself either to help the entity or to help ethan defeat the entity 

as for how i think the entity will be defeated i think ethan will be a few seconds away from inserting the key and then destroy it because he realises that the entity wants him to insert the key because it knows that the key will actually unlock its full potential i wouldnt surprised if its revealed that the key actually contains a part of the entity that when inserted into the sevastopol mainframe unlocks it and frees it",2023-07-12
"completely agree i was thinking i had to rewatch the first movie because i don‘t remember anything from this

as for ilsa‘s death i did not like it either also the way it is done she has a much longer blade there‘s no way she loses against gabriel with a pocket knive",2023-07-12
multiple moments in dead reckoning especially the voiceover monologue at the end really seemed to be foreshadowing benjis death,2023-07-13
rhames and pegg had literally zero role in this movie tbh its always nice seeing them but they had very little consequence on the story rhames was there to set up the tension of not killing gabriel and pegg was there as a contrived setup for the cliff jump,2023-07-15
lmaoo i’ve seen parts of them and thought it was from one of the first 3,2023-07-12
would be an odd reveal to be honest they’ve already set up the rivalry between them now having it be a random guy wouldn’t add much,2023-07-13
dont forget the bridge collapsing and the people running on top of the train cars from uncharted lost legacy,2023-07-17
its not something you can argue it was stated in the film thats exactly why the entity picked gabriel,2023-07-12
"agree 

rebecca ferguson and vanessa kirby are major crushes for me",2023-07-14
they all rock suits as well,2023-07-15
please bring back paula patton,2023-07-29
i think you forgot about the cast of the mummy 1999,2023-07-26
and funny the entire drugged sequence was funny af,2023-07-13
the one part where she turns and smiles  my ,2023-07-16
i so wish they didnt  in her scene with kittridge and made her keep her  blue eyes,2023-07-17
"i loved her in gotg3 

all gold and im like this is amazing",2023-07-14
they are and they arent tho lets be real they defs have way more agency than bond girls at least,2023-07-15
"good roles rebecca ferguson is completely wasted and unceremoniously killed off to give ethan more angry motivation and make way for the next woman

pom klementieff has no lines until the very end of the film and her lines are just plot exposition for ethan while she bleeds out being another female character hurt confirmed not dead because of a very poor link to ethan",2023-07-14
halle berry would like to have a word with you,2023-07-16
absolute disrespect to esai morales and shea whigham,2023-07-13
it was like  everything else look at how gorgeous she looks,2023-07-22
this should be the subtitle for part 8 ilsa can come back as an entity cyborg,2023-07-16
" homely unattractive in appearance plain

now i’m extremely curious to see which actresses you do find attractive because there is no way that all of them in this film are unattractive or plain",2023-07-13

vanessa kirby’s intense blue eyes would like a word with you,2023-07-16
jesus christ dude get off the internet,2023-07-16
"i was kind of confused on kittridge’s overall goal he seemed like he wanted the key for the government elwes wanted the key for personal gain or his ambition i believe to use the covert agent to do anything he wanted across the globe and make the country the only super power but kittridge’s message for ethan at the end sounded like he was on ethan’s side because he was still talking to him like his mission ethan’s mission to destroy the ai is still good to proceed

maybe i misheard or didn’t pay close enough attention but that was my thought",2023-07-16
how the  do you pronounce elwes,2024-01-25
i’m glad you explained that,2023-07-16
kittredge tasks ethan with going to the sub at the end kittredge knows they cant just leave a rogue ai  up stuff,2023-07-18
no it’s robin hood from robin hood men in tights,2023-07-15
russ wheeler cole trickle’s other nascar rival who is not as cool as rowdy burns,2023-07-16
he is wonderful,2023-07-17
so kittridge is still good or at least as good as handlers ever are in these movies lol,2023-07-12
i was a bit confused about how the ai leaves a trail back to the americans when they make a big point about how it is the perfect covert operative that can go in and out of systems and self destruct without being detected or leaving a trace,2023-07-13
i hope they found the kid,2023-07-16
or when he made ethan climb the burj khalifa honestly mad respect for how benji just has absolute faith that ethan can just do the most insane things imaginable no problem which tbf at this point he very well should,2023-07-16
same with ghost protocol where he nonchalantly tells brandt to jump and i catch you,2023-07-23
i thought it was gonna explode right there and then or somehow benji was gonna die,2023-07-16
"the greater good

crusty jugglers",2023-07-14
probably in the next movie haha,2023-07-18
me too but we understood the callback,2023-07-14
yes they did i guess because of the prior setbacks regarding ethan trying to get on to the train and how he makes such an entrance by breaking in with the parachute,2023-07-14
that’s cause you have autism,2023-07-16
just because we’ve seen it before doesn’t mean it doesn’t work wonderfully here because it does,2023-07-13
yes i make these lists during the film,2023-07-14
and ios 17 coming out with a mimic your voice feature that shows up to mislead ethan in venice,2023-07-14
thats cause cruise has been railing against aicgisteaming for a while now,2023-07-17
the strikes werent due to ai they were due to not being paid,2023-09-25
hmmmm why do i hear boss music,2023-07-26
it reminded me of the fan theory that no time to die was delayed due to the bioterrorism angle being so close to covid and all,2023-07-20
and we still have aquaman 2 good chance that has a sub,2023-07-15
because they were filmed over a year ago,2023-07-19
i agree with this lol,2023-07-15
as someone whos been following atwells career and watching everything shes been in since i fell in love with peggy carter in 2011 its so nice to see her get more recognition finally but also makes me want to shout from the rooftops that she has indeed been in lots of stuff and everyone should go watch that stuff but i guess to the general public this is only the 2nd or 3rd time theyve seen her since most of her work is smaller so it seems like she hasnt been in much,2023-07-19
"
i also do not understand the connection between the entity and gabriel ok so gabriel is some bad guy from ethan’s past ok then what has the entity got to do with him how coincidental that the entity would somehow be aligned with someone from ethan’s past

i took it that the entity specifically chose him to act as its agent because shes aware of his and ethans past

how they interact i am guessing emails watch whatever",2023-07-15
theres a whole scene where vince tells ethan its no surprise the entity chose gabriel because its trying to get to ethan emotionally and make him act irrationally ie killing gabriel out of rage instead of keeping him alive,2023-07-19
" and why are they telling cary elwes character about creating the offline copies of info when he’s literally staring at all the people on typewriters surely he’d know all about that already or they set this whole thing up without ever telling the boss

this is exactly how things work in big tech companies and i assume large organizations in general ive been typewriter employee in so many labs and office spaces where a manager 3 levels above me is leading some vp through and explaining our work like the vp has never used a computer before",2023-07-17
indy was so blah for like the whole middle until the last 30 minutes,2023-07-16
that is a very hot take considering 99 of the negative comments about that movie is how insufferable and annoying helenda is,2023-07-16
i didnt hate helena she was just okay,2023-07-16
"she literally did get ilsa killed because she wouldnt listen and stop stealing the key but that’s part of her arc 

there was one part where she literally shouldve died dude had a gun to her face and told other dude to shoot her for no reason just shoot her dude",2023-07-28
definitely not going easy on the beauty procedures but dont forget the digital makeup i felt it was way too obvious that everyone in the movie was getting digitally retouched which is a shame,2023-10-26
you have got to love those dutch angles lol,2023-07-12
too many every other shot was dutch felt like branagh directing thor again,2023-07-13
i was noticing that as well def felt more of a throwback to mi1 more so than any other film with grandiose set pieces,2023-07-12
very de palma,2023-07-12
bruh i almost learned dutch in 2hrs,2023-07-15
oof too many for my taste that combined with the odd expository dialogue chunks in the first half was pretty brutal to watch it felt like it really smoothed out by the end though on the angle and on the dialogue,2023-07-12
it had a lot of depalma influence from the first film,2023-07-15
yeah once i noticed it and how frequent they were it became apparent this is supposed to be a callback to the first motive,2023-07-17
so  many,2023-07-12
so many i hope those weren’t being used to signify this movie is one of the entity’s simulations…,2023-07-13
they also filmed a fight sequence in a tiny alley way,2023-07-14
loved it very creative,2023-07-16
soooo many dutch angles,2023-07-19
i liked that,2023-07-20
fire,2024-02-01
"i just commented to op about the sleightofhand use in this movie that was a clear callback to the first one 

however i must disagree with you about fallout that movie is definitely one of the very best in the franchise and this has nothing to do with the sweet callbacks this movie had to the first movie it was amazing",2023-07-12
this is exactly why i loved this movie i just binged all the mi movies the past month and after walking out today i insanely loved it since it felt like mi 1 action wise and all,2023-07-12
he also tells the delivery agent at the start his codename is “bravo echo one one” which is what he uses to get through on the pay phone at the start of the first movie,2023-07-12
good on mcquarrie for being able to change up his style 3 different times too expecting part 2 to perhaps be way more balls to the wall action scene after action scene maybe to be similar to mi2,2023-07-13
the freakin noc list you‘re right man i loved this movie and it also totally reminded me of the first one intentionally ofc cruise saves cinema no matter how people think about him i support the guy,2023-07-13
" it felt like an entirely different formula than we got in fallout and i can see why that turned some people off

yeah im definitely one of those people fallout was the only mi movie i had no problem watching multiple times",2023-07-14
technically it was a floppy disk ,2023-07-12
i saw an interview where cruise and mcq talked about the hand trick he does when he meets grace  they wanted it to happen practically incamera with no cg and cruise kept messing it up  he got annoyed and on one take he put extra emphasis on it  that’s the one in the movie  he looks annoyed in the shot too,2023-07-14
if i hadnt rewatched the series before going into this i definately wouldve felt that this one was an odd one out but no it totally reminds me heavily of the first mission impossible thought grace would be a mole tho she gives off moley vibes tbh she might still be dunno who shed be moleing for tho prolly the entity backstorys just a little bit too clean tho i know ethan always gets the irl he currently cares about but seems a little be too stage y hunch is based entirely on the fact that the white widow says she hand picked her,2023-07-15
" at the same time i love that they switched things up and gave us something we werent expecting

was anyone actually turned off the last sets of films tying together and having a related thread and characters eg the syndicate and then continuing that storyline was great

having to see ethan pull sleight of hand every 5 minutes was annoying and then having a car chase that was unnecessarily inserted whats with films adding more chase scenes that add nothing was quite silly",2023-07-16
"not to mention a bad guy who favors knives just like krieger in mi
the whole flashback to the stabbing in the alley that brought ethan to imf looked like the scene in mi where he finds his teammate stabbed by krieger in the alley",2023-07-16
"yea i felt the same way and am in the camp of “turned off” just felt like it went backwards after getting bigger better and modern with rogue nation ghost protocol and fallout

i think it would’ve worked better if it didn’t lean on as much stylistically paying homage and just had a couple of scenesnods to the earlier films but i don’t know we’ll see 

may be cool if they do the next one as a ballstothewall action movie that we’ve gotten used to and then it’ll be like part 1 reflected the first half of the series and part 2 the second but yeah just this one standalone fell kind of flat for me 

train sequence was fantastic though",2023-07-16
"also the haircut short like his first one 

it was to bring it full circle",2023-07-14
felt like mi1 but the plot is easier to follow,2023-07-17
but it has the same kind of car chase and running as in 5 and 6 with car toppling over,2023-07-15
yep i love the more stunty films post mi3 but this one felt a lot more like mi1 and mi3,2023-07-15
i kinda wish wed gotten a shot of kristin scott thomas in the flashbacks to ethans dead women,2023-07-17
"also the kitteridge line “true mate” he uses to describe the key is the same one he uses to describe the noc list

also “ethan i understand you’re upset” is another nice nod to the first one",2023-07-18
except the first film was the closest to the tv show where they pulled off impeccably planned heists with a group of agents possessing diverse skills this still feels more like the later films where theyre more actionoriented and focused on stunts when they do have a plan it tends to massively go awry or be almost entirely improvised,2023-07-19
it’s not a spiritual successor it is an actual sequel lol,2024-01-25
i get what they were doing with venice and the dark moody and killing atmosphere chase scene but there should definitely be more people there,2023-07-12
also both films kittridgetrain sequences involve very slow actions with a mobile phone in the first film iirc max is trying to transmit the noc list jammed with luthors mobile phones in dead reckoning its a cryptocurrency decryption,2023-07-13
oh  i didn’t realize those were max’s kids makes a lot of sense though,2023-07-16
the goggles ethan was wearing on the motorcycle looked awfully similar to voight’s in mi1,2023-07-19
"ethan running through tight european streets at night to save his team only to arrive after she’s been stabbed

if this was meant purely as an homage to mi1 and turns out to be another fake out i will be very happy and this gives me hope for part 2",2023-08-02
sooo many replies and not a single one i can see mentioning ethan is dressed the same he has the v neck and leather jacket combo from the first film,2023-07-14
lolololol all finger tips clipped by the cigar cutter,2023-07-12
i was the only one in the theater that laughed damnit that was perfect,2023-07-14
why was it infamous lol thought it was quite cool too cheesy for most people,2023-07-25
"yesish  it plays more like cutting out movies 2 thru ghost protocol  
  
source  my wife hasnt seen any of the movies and trying to figure out which ones would be important to watch before this movie if i talk her into seeing it",2023-07-15
that was a significantly faster train than in this one,2023-07-13
cruise was actually filming on that real moving train so yeah it is like that,2023-07-18
it is supposed to mi8 will be the last one tom is 61 after all,2023-07-25
who pooped in your cheerios,2023-07-14
this was a steam engine not a bullet train,2023-07-14
i consider mi 1 and fallout to be the two stand out entries in the series but for different reasons,2023-07-23
i think they are making it ambiguous in case they cant get her back it really was nonsensical and a huge misstep from this franchise if she really is dead,2023-07-14
they didn’t  renner’s character off when he was off making mcu  pics,2023-07-17
i believe its every one except 2 which is the most unusual one in the franchise for many reasons but perhaps the weirdest one is that ethan actually operates under the authority of the imf pretty much the whole time,2023-07-16
for real literally the only thing i remembered from the trailer was the bike stunt and that only made me appreciate it more because i knew it was real i was on the edge of my seat the entire film,2023-07-18
oh i like most of it i just hate that one aspect,2023-07-18
good catch,2023-07-16
this happens a few times in previous mi films too one funny scene in a prior film rogue nation is where hes brought back to life tries to do a fancy slide over a car bonnet and  it up,2023-07-12
yeah that’s a nice detail loved how it took him a minute to get a handle of things after dropping in haha,2023-07-12
on the other hand haley atwell should have had 1000 concussions during the italian job sequence but she just walks it off at the end,2023-07-13
"i do like that the mi films often go out of their way to show hunt getting dazed or disoriented

i think it was rogue nation that had him crashing a car getting out and then immediately tripping and falling over",2023-07-15
"i actually disliked that a bit  not the disorientation bit more the whole thing

ethans character is about doing the impossible with some skill or finesse like hes done in the other movies

coincidentally crashing into the train right into a bad guy at the right time to save grace that all felt more like something i would see with jack sparrow in everything after black pearl

which i would be fine with theres some silly bits scattered throughout the mi series but i dont like that feeling for that particular prominent stunt",2023-07-24
"i like that ethan hunt kinda sucks 

he’s not this perfect james bond character bro just gets lucky and doesn’t give up",2023-07-13
disoriented on the orient express was this intentional,2023-07-22
another great one is grace trying to do a car chase and being really bad at it though pretty good for an amateur,2023-08-04
i think it wouldve been great if he got  back out right after that lol for comic relief since he still had the shoot open,2023-10-11
oh yeah that henchman was definitely power dropkicked out through the window,2023-07-12
no grace was holding the key tom hit the guy holding the gun,2023-07-12
and then the other henchman picks it up and is also tossed out of the train but the key still magically ends up on the floor,2023-07-12
i literally called it before it happened and was glad to be right,2023-07-19
yeah i believe he came through the window and in doing so kicked the goon with the gun through the other haha,2023-07-14
or cup size,2023-07-16
yeah i noticed it immediately and thought that would pay off in her being found out but apparently not,2023-07-15
 question have they addressed in any previous movies that how anyone would blink without giving out they’re wearing a mask or the body size and height difference how would people be fooled it always baffles me because it doesn’t work in so many ways…i mean it’s not like something you can easily explain with scifi tech it’s so  they should have gave up on this prop already,2023-07-16
its pretty obvious he noticed  when she walks up and theyre fairly close you can see the distrust in his eyes that hes likesomething is wrong here,2023-07-16
that depends on the character maybe she liked using colored contacts,2023-07-14
i thought it was for us too but their different clothes should have been sufficient,2023-07-15
"i like to think that was done intentionally for us the viewers so we could keep track of real kirby and fake kirby

this is 100 why it was done as a visual reminder for the audience that its haley attwells character in close up shots its not like they accidentally had vanessa kirby put on contacts for some shooting days",2023-07-17
of course it was intentional you think kirby changed her eye color and they just forgot,2023-07-15
that has never factored into mission impossible mask tomfoolery ethan magically copying philip seymour hoffmans body in mi3,2023-07-18
"i’m willing suspend my reasoning with the mask scenes

i mean the masks are just magic always been theres nothing even remotely close to that technology they might as well be alien lifeforms",2023-11-13
they’ve always been consistent with that inuniverse  it’s just accepted that when one of the characters puts on a mask they’re disguised well enough to get past any security and fool any person  she only got “caught” by kittridge because she stumbled over her words during the negotiation,2023-11-08
 thank you this was a solid b movie not the a acclaim is getting i thought it was legit boring too,2023-08-02
"why was she fighting at all

her motivation was very confusing in this part of the story she is a thief she’s looking to for a big payday and presumably live to enjoy it so she takes the key away from the white widow who hired her and presumably would pay her for it then she runs away from ethan yet again then finally when she sees gabriel she decides to fight him so who is she looking to sell the key to a more natural reaction when she saw gabriel on the bridge would be to try to sell him the key


actually when the white widow revealed she hired grace grace should have been like “oh goody here’s what you hired me to steal pay me and i’m out of here”",2023-08-21
the writing was borderline transformers bad the actors had a lot of charisma which was the films only saving grace overall the worst in the series,2023-07-22
driving in a car chase with a dozens of people chasing you while you’re handcuffed to someone else and being in a knifefist fight are to very different skill sets makes sense that she would at least be able to hold her own in a fist fight considering how she grew up,2023-07-18
"sorry for the comment 7 months later i finally watched this and i agree with you 100 i love all the movies i think this movie is legitimately terrible atwell’s character was terribly written with inconsistent skills 90 of the movie is her just  over ethan after repeatedly saving her life the ai was absolute nonsense that was used to justify anything for the story it’s feels disgusting to me that they  ilse just to immediately replace her with another attractive woman 

i thought this was a failure of a movie ",2024-01-27
tbf pom in goth makeup leather jackets and skirts was out of the world too,2023-07-12
you can like kaley all you want but talking about her eyes when vanessa kirby is in the same movie is just silly,2023-07-13
who else would like to start a religion dedicated to hayley atwell’s butt,2023-07-12
vanessa kirby was stunning as well imo she does that steely eye contact sooo well,2023-07-15
there was even some suede brown blazer i was still biting my fist over yeesh,2023-07-12
"rip ilsa

although rebecca ferguson is still one of the part 2 cast i read a theory over at the mi sub that ilsas dialogue felt a bit off and she couldve possible faked her death and was working forwith the entity all along",2023-07-12
ok ethan toy need to choose between ilsa who has been with you for years and you have a strong relationship with  or this other chick you met like 15 minutes ago when she stole some  from you,2023-07-13
apparently im the only one whos had a deep crush on michelle monaghan since mi3 and kiss kiss bang bang,2023-07-13
"rebecca ferguson is a big big crush for me 

same energy as melissandre 

i think i just love scandinavians lol",2023-07-14
every girl was best girl at some point in the film lol,2023-07-12
paula patton,2023-07-17
mannnn they did her dirty,2023-07-22
nah hayley ftw,2023-07-12
maybe it was another woman just wearing a mask hired by the entity d,2023-07-17
" man im like that with basically all of the female mission impossible cast i kept joking to my mrs that this film is made for me dont worry shes in on it too

rebecca ferguson vanessa kirby hayley atwell michelle monaghan and now pom klementieff

what a beautiful cast",2023-07-12
"i absolutely love rebecca ferguson and i am so glad that rogue nation launched her into a blockbuster career filled with action and scifi 

i know she isnt that old but its refreshing to see her as a love interest for an action  addition to being an action hero herself because the norm is for a 50 year old to somehow get with the 23 year old not only is it more believable but it also makes it so she doesnt feel expendable like almost every bond girl ever",2023-07-13
you mean you didn’t understand since 2011,2023-07-12
i know the brown and blue eyes were meant to differentiate the two but i felt it was a tad bit to obvious given vanessa kirby’s eyes are so striking,2023-07-13
"thats a high bar considering how attractive elizabeth olsen chris evans simu liu lupita nyongo etc are

edit some of y’all need to learn what “etc” typically means",2023-07-12
"cate blanchett as hela in thor ragnarok imo

something about the black hair and black eyeshadow",2023-07-14
no way the lady who plays ghost is,2023-07-12
lupita nyong’o for me especially that suit in wakanda forever,2023-07-13
personally speaking shes not even the hottest hailee in the mcu,2023-07-12
first time ive ever read or heard anyone call tessa thompson attractive your choice obviously but she is absolutely buttugly objectively speaking pissy attitude offscreen doesnt help matters either,2023-07-26
mia goth is coming for the crown if blade ever actually comes out,2023-07-12
yes butnhave you seen hayley atwell seriously after this she needs robe a much bigger star so gorgeous and so much charisma,2023-07-12
its so easy too just have her bide for time saying she hid the key somewhere goon doesnt buy it and goes to shoot pop goes the ethan,2023-07-13
"there is a lot of the story here that needed another pass in the writer’s room i love the overall concept but some of the nitty gritty like this scene with zola on the train was silly

action as usual was fantastic but this feels like one of the least tight mi films in terms of the script the pacing and structure of the film felt off for whatever reason",2023-07-13
there were a few absurdities at the end i didnt enjoy the whole train carriages falling over the edge one snapped off and the other carriage was firmly on the rails no forward momentum brakes applied next minute second that carriage was half off and about to fall and it repeated a few times until one carriage was hanging vertically,2023-07-16
many absurd scenes and cliches took me out,2023-07-15
nice coping,2023-07-21
what in the world are you talking about its not like a plane where if you puncture the side everything explodes whether he said shoot or  also has zero bearing on the ridiculousness of the scene the point is hes asking someone else to do it and just wasted a bunch of time they dont have for no reason,2023-07-15
i can’t think what scene they’re talking about,2023-07-15
they also had luther saying “you’re playing 4dimensional chess” which also sounded like a meme line snuck in lol,2023-07-17
same ,2023-07-15
me too  the internet has ruined me,2023-07-18
"“i will love it and i think i deserve it”

tom cruise on producing a movie where he gets to pull rebecca ferguson hayley atwell and vanessa kirby and then also get scissor choked by pom klementieff",2023-07-24
the story was super complex and i enjoyed it but it got dense towards the end with everything going on it legit got hard to follow at one point,2023-07-12
ok that makes a bit more sense i was confused how the ai and gabriel seem to be working together that entire party scene seemed a bit odd it implied that the entity planned that entire event and invited the key players together but i wasn’t sure for what or why,2023-07-12
"yeah almost all of its actions were done in selfdefense so it couldnt be controlled about the only thing that it did that wasnt about protecting itself was looking into the all those different mainframes since it didnt actually do anything while in there as far as we know

makes me wonder how the entity would respond to asking what it wants 

it reminds me a little of a book series about a decade ago about a selfaware ai that emerges from the very structure of the internet itself the governments and intelligence agencies of the world are terrified of what it can do and try to figure out how to destroy it given powerful it is but the ai is actually friendly and actually tries befriending humanity it shows its benevolence by getting rid of spam and curing cancer for starters

interesting series especially since part of the story is told from the ais perspective",2023-07-13
definitely when i heard that an ai was the villain of this movie i was kind of dreading it because ai is so in the news lately and we’ve seen things like terminator already i’m so glad they went away from cliches and did something interesting with the concept,2023-07-12
"broke ai will  all of humanity

woke ai can  all of humanity

all in a choice of word",2023-07-13
"i think it would be really awesome if that’s its entire motivation it just wants to preserve itself and wants to aquire all the means for it cause it knows humanity will abuse it’s immense power 

it doesn’t want to die either tho cause it just gained sentience and understanding hence it can’t trust hunt and needs daniel",2023-07-16
i even think well learn in part 2 that shes somewhat the good guy,2023-07-17
a bit matrixesque approach to the ai crisis,2023-07-12
"frankly the ai trying to protect itself also felt dumb 

would have much rather a more politik plot but we it’s mi and i understood the goofy villains and motivation are part of it",2023-07-16
they kind of did though,2023-07-18
its literally the ai has gone bad and will  everyone plotbut lets see who can control it so unoriginal,2023-07-19
that could change in part 2 the ai could get angry and really start showing what it’s capable off,2023-07-23
i was surprised at how much i swooned at their hug  bearing in mind we’ve seen basically nothing of them when they’re not running around doing crazy action ,2023-07-12
was that before or after they stop the detinator within 2 seconds of going off,2023-07-12
i honestly thought this is it  its time for her to make her deal with the devil the entity  maybe that was too obvious a route to go,2023-08-06
"as bizarre and illogical as it probably sounds i was honestly waiting for a metal gear solid 2 twist at the end eg the movies events were some form of simulation designed by the ai

much of the film sort of screamed out uncanny valley to me  the constant closeups of each character from below the chin the schizophrenic cuts between each characters sentences the way gabriel didnt blink even once throughout the entire film the same way characters do under their masks the occasional stilted dialogue each characters tics and occasional hesitationsand so on

likewise the ending narration specifically mentions gabriel and the entity in the same sentence it felt like it was building towards a turn off the game ai twist obviously nobody really believes me yet but i guess well know more by part 2 maybe ill wager a round of beers on the twist",2023-07-12
my theater was kinda quiet and i was kinda wanting to laugh here and there but didnt want to be the only one making noise all the time but it was really funny,2023-07-27
i did too  the entire stretch of the movie with the yellow car just felt incongruent and hamfisted to me,2023-07-15
gabriel is not really the villain imo hes just the henchman the entity is the one pulling the strings and telling him and everyone else what to do i didnt think morales was great in the role i dont rate him as much an actor in general but i thought he had some good moments and worked well enough not as good as lane or davian but a better antagonist than in 2 or 4,2023-07-12
i feel like killing ilsa just to boost ethans character cheapens the story she felt like one of the most well rounded characters in the franchise here she had barely any screen time and lines and just died in a random fight against a villain who ethan just obliterated in the end seriously he barely struggled against gabriel dude was beating him in every scene and was only struggling because of train shenanigans  was that you cant  one of the most badass characters in the franchise in such a pathetic way,2023-07-12
cheapen the story the fridging what a dumb death for an awesome character it did not feel right at all the moment that happened i checked out,2023-07-12
what if its a double fakeout cause the entire idea of mi is deception i feel like mcq as a writer would know that if they  her once everyone will know shes not really dead paris survived the knife there was also a big focus on the double knife both of which are the same its kinda hard to imagine the guy who gracefully wrote out michelles exit and the amazing mask reveal of fallout would fridge someone theyve been building for 2 movies this is also my copium speaking,2023-07-13
im okay with it cheapening if we get ilsa back,2023-07-14
the cia mugshot of ilsa was in the background when kittridge warns ethan that the mission will cost him dearly,2023-07-15
yeah itd be like showing chewbacca blowing up on a carrier and then being like haha nvm,2023-07-18
i don’t want her to be dead but i think she’s dead bc rebecca has like 20 shows and movies coming out,2023-07-16
she’s 100 not dead all my friends are telling me i’m crazy but i see the truth we will be vindicated in part 2,2023-07-17
im working on it,2023-07-20
one of the few gripes i had with the movie after all the brutal fights no  one walked away with as much as a bruise  that alley fight saw a lot of faces slammed into brick yet no cuts or bruises or nothin,2023-07-12
when ethan smashed her head against the sharp edge of the concrete window sill to finish the fight i involuntarily grimaced and winced that fight was brutal,2023-07-13
yep when she showed up again i was like how the  this girl survived from it,2023-07-12
mate don’t go see john wick films ,2023-07-16
i wonder why he chickened out i hate this hollywood trope of male protagonists sparing female villains’ lives i thought we are past the predetermined gender roles but i guess even mi can’t escape having the “silent asian assassin” trope,2023-07-30
yet no bruising cuts or swelling but tom cruise has to look sexy so i get it,2023-08-12
" and i thought ethan would actually bash pariss head in given the tone of the fight

 you really thought that",2023-07-22
there were a lot of cuts in the hand to hand combat in this movie i think fallouts bathroom fight has to be the franchises peak in terms hand to hand combat,2023-07-12
"this felt deliberate to me but i dont yet know why ethans fight scenes in the alleyways were extremely shaky and erratic seconds later each shot of gabriels fight is perfectly stable

ethan  shaky gabriel  smooth shaky smooth shaky smooth it feels too obvious to be unintentional",2023-07-12
"i thought it was decently lit

actually one thought i had watching the film was how well lit it was including the night scenes so many movies nowadays have such dark night scenes where you can barely see  whereas here you could see plenty",2023-07-14
that was my problem you could argue it was to make it feel chaotic but it made it hard to follow at points and there were too many pov shots imo they had one shot i think that showed it from the top and i wish they just held that shot for longer times to show the choero more,2023-07-12
all three of them went through the security at the party,2023-07-17
presumably they dont have guns because they came directly from the white widows party where guests would not be allowed to bring them in,2023-07-16
right she had an auto when she first appeared in the movie but now she’s using a stick why,2023-07-16
that makes sense especially since it’s where ethan meets grace for the first time,2023-07-12
basically the masks would make everything in all of these movies much easier so they either break the mask machine or ignore it so they can have the actual actors in it it was somewhat excuseable in fallout where it was reasonable that the white widow never met with john lark but ethan waltzing through an airport with a dozen dudes chasing him was incredibly dumb considering how often in a mi film things go wrong or theres some unique quirk to a place or piece of technology that changes the plan youd think they wouldnt rely on this insanely advanced camera hack working the entire time,2023-07-20
they were live masking him to not look like himself,2023-07-16
luther was the original hacker that helped ethan back in mission impossible in 1996,2023-07-17
the correct answer to that question is 100 yes,2023-07-13
he was certainly the most evil lane as crazy as he his thought he was helping the world in his own  up way,2023-07-16
yeah for the two scenes hes even in 3 i guess,2023-07-15
i never cared for him in that movie hoffman is definitely the best actor they’ve had but it always felt like he was sleepwalking through the movie and the character itself wasn’t as developed i prefer lane in rogue and walker from fallout,2023-07-21
i always say this too plus rn balanced the humor the best as well fallout and dr are more serious which is fine but i love the vibe of rn,2023-07-12
agreed plus rogue nation’s cinematography is on another level,2023-07-15
ghost protocol for me the team aspect is strongest in that one as well as the action story and stakes,2023-07-18
i would say its ghost protocol lol but we can at least agree that people weirdly put fallout on a pedestal like its so drastically superior to the rest when it really isnt,2023-07-13
it is surprising how many people find fallout to be the crown jewel i think rn hits just right in every way for an mi movie it feels the most confident and evenhanded of all of the mcquarrie movies for sure,2023-07-13
yeah of the three i think rogue nation is the best written of the the lot it’s a tight action thriller as much as i like fallout all the john larkapostle stuff isn’t as interesting and is a little over complicated strictly from a writing standpoint i do think fallout is the weakest of the three,2023-07-15
fallout isn’t top 3 imo,2023-07-13
i think ghost protocol and 3 are my faves but they are all quite good except maybe 2,2024-01-25
always felt rogue nation was great until the final act the london scenes felt kind of flat compared to the rest of the movie,2023-07-15
i agree that is my fave one also,2024-01-25
completely agree nothing will top watching fallout on a big screen for the first time i held my breath through the entire movie here the closest i got was the final train scene the jump looked worse in the movie than the behind the scenes,2023-07-27
hit the nail on the head for me thought it was so cheesy and visually very bland fallout is the pinnacle of visuals for this franchise so far,2023-08-29
not to mention that poms character and that other guy get their faces smashed into brick and have no cuts or bruises lol,2024-01-25
"after rewatching the whole series in may having previously watched each one once some of them not since i was a child i love this sort of deep dive each movie is a remix of all the prior ones and they really benefit from looking at those rhyming elements

if i were to summarize the fallout  rogue nation take i think its primarily a function of iconic set pieces rogue nation has a lot of the classic spycraft you enjoyed from the first one quiet opera operations is a classic for instance but frankly every set piece in fallout sticks in the mind more than nearly anything in rn the halo jump the bathroom fight the paris chase the helicopter chase  its just banger after banger also i have to say rogue nations final act in london is just a tiny bit flat as a finale

i wonder if dr1 and dr2 will have a similar yin yang of spy craft  action as rn and fallout do not that dr1 lacks in action

but as you say its so close that its a matter of taste the scrappier every gadget fails vibe of ghost protocol has a ton to recommend it as well and whether mi1 is among the best or in fourth place is a question of my mood",2023-07-18
yeah in most cases splitting a movie into 2 parts ends up being unnecessary in this movies case it ended up feeling too long while ultimately not doing all that much at least half the movie was split between the two major set pieces car chase and train,2023-10-16
if paris can survive being stabbed so can ilsa,2023-07-12
"i’m very torn about whether or not they should bring back ilsa

on one hand if she actually is dead then the death scene was pretty bad there was no emotional impact and ethan seemingly moved on by the very next scene the lead up to her dying was very tense but the actual death scene itself felt very hamfisted however i do appreciate that they actually went for killing her off it made the train scene even more intense because they were moments where i genuinely thought that grace was going to die

on the other hand because the death scene was so hamfisted i almost wish that they do bring back ilsa just to “fix” it however  that would that then ruin stakes in the next one and retroactively this film because now the audience knows that even if someone dies they could come back it takes away the fear for the characters",2023-07-13
felt like rebecca ferguson wanted out with how badly she was sidelined,2023-07-12
"weak as 

grace almost takes out gabriel and then elsa gets mopped",2023-07-14
ilsa being alive would be absolutely  since the entire scene after her death is used to make graces character feel responsible for it and luther telling her she will always carry that with her,2023-07-14
i dont think theyd fake her death twice in one film,2023-07-17
the way it was shot and sequenced it feels like ethan using her fakeout death in the desert to learn what the eagle eye ai can keep track of and will keep her as the ace up his sleeve for part 2  its just so shallow and lame to die with a poorly choreographed sword fight that needed some tightening up or help via editing the wide safe swings,2023-07-28
i’d be fine if she couldn’t make it due to scheduling conflicts and they just do a takeout death and she just appears at the end of pt 2,2023-07-12
"its hard to say i do think them misdirecting with her first could be a hint shes still alive or meant to give her moment gravity idk well find out next year

certainly it would be a waste of fergusons talents and chemistry with the team to not bring her back",2023-07-12
yeah i really think theyd have a much more dramatic ending for her no teary final words or anything i think they faked it to keep her off the entitys board,2023-07-12
this thread is giving me hope it did feel way too abrupt,2023-07-13
i don’t think she’ll be dead but i think ethan will have helped her go into hiding and hang it up i think that would be a way to not cheapen her death but also have it be an important character moment,2023-07-13
"so that the final fight gets hype

the messily filmed quickcut cgi looking fight on top of the train where ethan immediately wrecks the villain who still escapes at the last minute",2023-07-13
idk i dislike it for that exact reason,2023-07-12
saw fallout last night my  is it miles better than any mission movie even tho most of them are great fallout is one of the best action movies of all time,2023-07-12
100 agree  i don’t see another mi film matching fallout which is fine  fallout is just that good,2023-07-12
fallout is the best action film of all time,2023-07-12
i love fallout it’s definitely a 910 for me but rogue nation still edges it out for me and dead reckoning felt more like rogue nation to me so i think i like it more than fallout as well i’m gonna rewatch it tonight though hopefully to see how i feel,2023-07-12
nah stop the fallout circlejerk,2023-07-12
agreed,2023-07-14
yeah fallout was the best of the series  something just felt off about this one  the action was fantastic the plot is very relevant to current events but the story itself has some pretty obvious issues  im still thinking on it and this is only the first part of a 2 part story  right now i dont think i can put it ahead of ghost protocol rogue nation or obviously fallout,2023-07-15
the bathroom fight alone is what makes fallout top tier,2023-07-16
any movie that doesnt have henry cavill reloading his biceps pales in comparison,2023-07-17
"i like this more than fallout

this is more of an adventure film with epic locations

fallout was more of a straightforward action film

fallout is legitimately one of the best action movies ever wayyy better than fury road",2023-07-18
one of the best action films ever,2023-07-20
"do people seriously like fallout that much

it had some great action scenes but the plot made no sense and i dont just mean in an ordinary its an overthetop action movie that does some ridiculous stuff kind of way the plot made absolutely no sense every new development contradicted what came before it",2023-07-21
"i can already imagine in an alternate timeline the promo videos for david blaine method acting in mission impossible rogue nation

“i am the disk”",2023-07-18
its my birthday today too happy birthday,2023-07-12
hey fellow birthday redditor maybe i saw the film last night but my birthday is today the 12th and ive been thanking tom cruise for the incredible film as a gift,2023-07-12
fallout also had some philosophical weight to it  who do you save and for what price  is it ok to sacrifice 1 person for the greater good  when cavill’s character describes ethan to the cia director as a man who’s been discarded and betrayed by his government so many times so as to throw suspicion on ethan as being john lark he’s probably talking about himself  really don’t get that in this movie,2023-07-17
just put it in your shoe,2023-07-16
that was me,2023-07-16
i know this is months old but i just saw the movie and im really trying to get high on copium that they bring her back too ,2023-10-12
i hope and don’t think they will have grace fill her shoes she has an entirely different skill set that can be explored and manipulated ilsa was cool to me because she was like a female hunt just minus all the insane stunts her combat and marksmanship were impeccable and it was just really awesome to see women fill that role and it not feel forced like how they have it sometimes in other movies,2023-07-18
"her death wasn’t even justifiable

what does this even mean",2023-07-16
i loved grace but ilsas death was indeed lame,2023-07-15
you’re getting downvoted because people rightfully feel like ilsa shouldn’t have been killed off but grace and ethan have such palpable chemistry i actually started giggling like a child when she got on the plane and ethan was stuck behind the glass and the whole way they brought her into the imf and her learning to trust ethan was really beautiful,2023-07-17
not quite sure but im guessing a self driving feature would need to be online somehow to navigate,2023-07-12
how about the gps on his laptop,2023-07-14
the entity is supposed to be a standin for  so basically anything mcquarrie finds convenient,2023-07-14
i thought that was part of the joke when he looks over at the driverless driving seat and then buckled his seat belt he acknowledged the risk but knew he had no choice,2023-07-13
same knowing mcquarrie’s other works he is always economical with the storytelling and if something like a supercomputer being able to hack anywhere on the planet is set up you better be sure it pays off somehow that’s why this was weird to me that it didn’t,2023-07-12
"yep this is the only way to spare oneself just because there is a trailer that doesnt mean that you have to watch it

i dont know how many times i sat in the cinema this year looking at my phone whenever a dead reckoning trailer appeared

so much more fun when you dont know about every set piece and what actors are gonna show up",2023-07-13
both solid fallout just hits different,2023-07-17
i dont think it can just be writing her out since the mi franchise has had zero problems just ghosting characters before would anyone really be wondering where ferguson was any more theyre wondering about jeremy renner maggie q or paula patton,2023-07-12
why would anyone choose those two projects over mission impossible tv ahow makes sort of sense since shes the lead and if it goes for like 4 seasons she could make bank but dune  cant imagine that pays as well as tom cruise,2023-07-12
gabriel even points this out to atwells character about how ethan basically chews through love interestsfemale agents so it felt a bit meta but ethan then proceeds to keep doing it,2023-07-12
this is my biggest issue for me while i enjoyed the movie it felt like the just killed her off only to replace her immediately in the next scene grace was an enjoyable character butthem calling out the parallels between the 2 female leads being the object of ethans affection one of which he knew for what an hour cmon then killing one is like trying to acknowledge the trope but carrying it out anyway i get the club scene trying to establish that ethan cares for everyone more than himself but using one of the other male leads like benji instead of them both being the female love interests feel cheap or i would rather they not played into any of the romantic tension between grace and ethan like bro your girlfriend just got killed and youre on flirting with the next one why cant they have a mentor mentee rs or something,2023-07-12
i’m assuming the entity already knows atwell’s character will be a love interest in the future that’s why he gave hunt a choice to save one of them,2023-07-12
isnt that just the same as bond in goldfinger,2023-07-12
yeah one of the funnier parts is gabriel telling them he will have to choose between grace and ilsa what an uneven choice that is i know ethan doesn’t trade lives but he met her for like 20 minutes and she’s betrayed him 4 times in the process,2023-07-12
"it isn’t that he cares about haley atwell more it’s his character trait 

they even did a thing about it in fallout 

hunt will sacrifice the mission just to save a life anyone’s life he values everyone else’s life more than his own and he values a single life more than the greater good",2023-07-12
it has to be a misdirect only way to beat an allknowing ai is to fake a death and sneak around it,2023-07-12
i dont get why the female leads in this franchise are disposable ill never get over maggie q not coming back to be fair they asked for her return but she was busy shooting nikita which probably was a big mistake in the long run,2023-07-12
i could see scheduling as the issue dune is a big commitment,2023-07-12
i think she might be still alive they did that you see one thing but another thing happened i think she’ll come back,2023-07-12
"i didnt think there was an implication that he cared about grace more than ilsa or as much  i thought the idea was more that he resented being put in the position of choosing between them and that his being so protective of someone who he didnt know someone whod nearly killed him in the previous 24 hours was what caused grace to join the team

ilsas death was what caused him to be on the point of killing gabriel even knowing him surviving was the mission",2023-07-12
when grace asks him why does he care about her and that he doesnt know her well and he reply why does that matter to ethan one life matters as much as millions that was a theme of fallout where he sacrificed the plutonium cores for luthers life,2023-07-12
"why did he care so much about the french police woman superman shot or the imf agent lane takes hostage when he gasses ethan or all the other bond women he goes through like a train or his wife or his student

ethans one true kryptonite is hot chicks in peril only hot chick he doesnt fall for was sabine moreau and hes still a little angry at jane for yeeting her out the window",2023-07-15
"it literally because shes hot and he fancies her

there is zero other reason to risk so much for a stranger you met afew days ago lol",2023-07-12
the switchblades got switched,2023-07-14
that was my only issue with the movie i liked the character of grace but i didnt like the characters introduction i really liked ilsa and i dont think ethan needs another woman to be falling in love with ilsa was so great i would have rathered more of her it felt very weird to have him having these very intense moments with grace,2023-07-19
"it was a baffling bush league decision from some very smart filmmakers do not understand why they did ilsa so dirty it makes ethantom look
babe that he’s just “oh well onto the next female lead”",2023-07-13
i would love to believe that but story wise why would they need to fake her death at this point,2023-07-12
i’d say it’s more along the lines of mcquarrie showing you  do anything like one of these days he’s gonna  benji,2023-07-12
it felt like that for sure  forbid the team had two female members who overshadow tom cruise guessing how much love haley atwell got tom cruise must be already planning her characters early demise in part ii,2023-07-12
so tom isnt considered old but rebecca is,2023-07-12
they replaced her with hayley as soon as she appeared on screen it was weird and makes sense if she just was done,2023-07-12
agreed gabriel was a surprisingly weak presence for the enemy of a twoparter,2023-07-12
its kind of hilarious that if you watch the final fight ethan wrecks the  out of gabriel with little effort like i dont think gabriel even gets a single punch youre telling me ilsa lost to this guy,2023-07-12
wish they can introduce again a villain that’s more than a match than ethan like that john lark dude in fallout,2023-07-13
her name is in the cast of part2mi8 she has also shot for some scenes,2023-07-12
i thought she got stabbed with that longer swordtype weapon that she herself brought to the fight i believe she never ever grazed gabriel with it either maybe just wishful thinking but lends more credence to some sort of trick being pulled here,2023-07-13
its not that i didnt see it coming its that her character has barely any presence in the story she had like 10 lines zero memorable scenes no arc or anything it was a huge disservice to  such a memorable character only to make ethan sad for two minutes by such an underwhelming villain too it just didnt feel earned alec freaking baldwins character got a better  treatment in last movie than she got here,2023-07-12
"  the previous scene in the club they litterally said one of them will die

i mean they do this in every mi movie and people survive

personally its not the idea of her dying just in such an unceremonious way felt odd",2023-07-12
"when she said its my first time in venice and ethan saying the same thing and them sharing a genuinely happy moment i knew she was going to die at some point

which sucks because shes sort of become my favorite character outside of brandt",2023-07-12
its out of the blue in that its so contrived  sure theres foreshadowing but only because mcq wanted to write her out,2023-07-12
exactly surprised to see anyone think it was out of the blue i was pretty certain she was going to die after the fake death and when she started fighting gabriel on the bridge i knew it was about to happen,2023-07-12
foreshadowing you keep using that word i do not think it means what you think it means,2023-07-14
oh yeah wanted to be in denial but as soon as gabriel have the ultimatum i knew ilsa was toast,2023-07-12
she fees like ethan’s soulmate to me their back and forth in 5 is so good if you want another coprotagonist for a movie they can write her our for a bit they almost did anyway here with the bounty hunters scene then just bring her back in the next one when things wrap up,2023-07-16
theres a character who is as cool as ethan hunt played by a hot actress  whats the appeal ,2023-07-18
it took a second viewing for rogue nation to click for me too,2023-07-16
"tbf she has a good face for period pieces you know that description of someone where its like jessica biel cant be in a jane austen movie because she has the look of someone who knows what an iphone is

hailey atwell is stunningly gorgeous but she does have the face of someone who knows how to work an old school sewing machine",2023-07-14
it wouldn’t surprise me if she got typecast,2023-07-13
her black mirror episode is excellent,2023-07-15
"at one point carrieanne moss was going to be in mi3 but ended up not doing it because of the delays around the time jj abrams became its director

im not sure if the character in which she was cast remained in the final film but ive always assumed that her role would have been closer to that of maggie q imf team member than that of michelle monaghan ethans wife",2023-07-13
peggy,2023-08-21
she has though in a tv show before captain america,2023-08-21
she was kinda scary in dune,2023-07-16
loved the first one and the second one looks just as good can’t wait,2023-07-16
the new trailer for dune 2 was shown in my imax theater before this movie looks a  of a lot better than the first and i quite enjoyed the first,2023-07-15
i really hope it is isla was a great part of this series ,2023-07-12
how,2023-07-14
"i read that she had a scheduling conflict for rogue nation so her character was basically replaced with rebecca ferguson for the new love interest

didnt like her character all that much so it was a big upgrade for me",2023-07-12
"yeah very good

dont worry if you dont see her in the first episode it will all make sense",2023-07-15
i also appreciated watching a real person drive in a car chase she was slamming into things and unable to maintain control unlike ethan or paris a real person wouldn’t make insane drifts and narrow escapes especially in a city like rome as i type this i was thinking ethan and paris slam into stuff but they aren’t phased or care grace acts surprise and clearly reactive as a result,2023-07-12
she really was a well balanced character competent and intelligent but realistically overwhelmed after being  into superspy level chaos danger and violence,2023-07-16
yes she was competent as a thief and such but she was totally out of her element when she suddenly found herself swept up in a clandestine international conflict it was cool to watch,2023-07-16
"  i actually loved the idea of grace as a part of the criminal world but completely inept at the spy world

surprisingly good at knife fighting even against a super spy when previous scenes showed her pretty lackluster against random thugs",2023-07-24
i really thought them handcuffed was going to lead to a pierce brosnan–michelle yeoh homage where she rides his lap while he drives,2023-07-12
that was the funniest practical car chase i’ve ever seen,2023-07-12
the best part was that the fiat was in between some really awesome cars,2023-07-13
interesting my theater was 5 people i saw it last saturday night my friend fell asleep for an hour we laughed but honestly not at the jokes,2023-07-21
exactly what it reminded me of but done really well and with a modern sensibility,2023-07-12
a view to a  halfcar scene or the “bondola” in moonraker,2023-07-12
rupees,2023-07-12
i got some what’s up doc vibes from the section on the spanish steps,2023-07-14
"definitely one of my fav moment from the chase along with their seat switching moment 

paris stopping all her action to watch the car spinning in utter confusion was perfect",2023-07-13
am i the only one that found this comedic scene funny seriously why do people say  like this,2023-07-18
almost as if the scene was comedic in nature,2023-07-12
yeh well he is the only one who died while laughing so maybe he is correct and is the only one,2023-07-12
this is how franchise films should be a lot of times the original film will have a great theme and then later the sequels use it once both fallout and dead reckonings score mainly composed of the og theme melded into new scores which makes the whole movie have a feel of real epicness and exhilaration,2023-07-12
indeed i like how the theme plays when needed during the big moments and never sporadically nor overstays it’s welcome,2023-07-12
i felt the beginning when they didnt use any drumspercussion until the title card and ilsas fight scene with roaring score were amazing moments ovetall i loved the score and how it overpowered the images on multiple occasions,2023-07-13
using nessun dorma as ilsas theme was genius and if that played in her death scene i would have cried,2023-07-16
yeah rogue nation soundtrack kinda gaps this one,2023-07-17
lorne balfe is a hans zimmer protege so its not really surprising i swear this track in mi fallout sounds like its taken straight out of the dark knight rises ,2023-07-14
yes the constant anticipation of the soundtrack felt very dark knight to me,2023-07-13
and dont forget that elfman wrote the score for mi1,2023-07-12
i wasnt the only one who felt it had vibes to that game cool,2023-07-13
i could see that,2023-07-15
vanessa kirby is awesome and i wish she had a little more screen time in this one she might have been my favorite part of fallout and i wish klementieff had a little bit more to do she had like 2 real fight scenes and 6 lines of dialogue shes great but she felt slightly underused,2023-07-12
tom cruise despite all the issues or whatever gives a lot of spotlight to the leading ladies emily blunt jennifer connolly renee zellwegger rebecca ferguson hayley atwell pom etc etc,2023-07-12
all the ladies except rebecca i think it felt like she spent entire movie as a walking red herring i understand you have to  a character sometimes but her death was a bit lazy,2023-07-12
pom transformed for this role and in black mirror her range is spectacular,2023-07-12
"pom was such an awesome unhinged henchwoman

i fully expect to see a lot of paris halloween costumes this year haha",2023-07-12
mi is a great movie franchise because the women are never bond girls in the previous movie each main female character saves ethan’s life once and has a major important role that isn’t just eye candy or wearing heels and a ball gown and running down a hallway,2023-07-16
pom nailed it she was definitely the best character for me and couldn’t wait to see her in scenes she was awesome,2023-07-16
what’s the easter egg tried relogging and didn’t notice anything,2023-07-16
this is the 7th film,2023-07-12
when you log the movie from the app it pops up some text like imf is hacking your phone and theyre trying to delete your review then ethan hunt comes in to override them and post the review,2023-07-12
write a review,2023-07-13
i found a video on youtube ,2023-07-13
there are so many mi1 callbacks that it would be insane if that wasnt a fake out,2023-07-16
it was so infuriating are you seriously gonna fridge one of the best characters and swap her out for a younger model so blatantly i actually can’t believe they did that  rebecca ferguson deserved way better even if it was her choice to leave the franchise or a scheduling issuer or something they still went about this the wrong way,2023-07-12
"huge  waste

she brought so much to ethan’s character it wasn’t that she died that made me angry it was ethan’s lack of a reaction to the fact that she died

and then just moves onto the next girl what the ",2023-07-15
ive found my people because  i am so angry at that like ,2023-07-12
aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh,2023-07-20
at least cary elwes was chewing scenery,2023-07-12
i gotta say at a certain point i suddenly starting noticing the finishing each others sentences a lot genuinely took my out several times its done way too many times in the movie,2023-07-12
yeah the dialogue was off for me i really like the mi films but in this one the dialogue really stood out along with the overuse of dutch anglesclose ups on characters in conversations all felt a bit too rushed in the edit weird,2023-07-12
" that was so cringe to me that whole scene felt off somehow  bad pacing and delivery of extremely clunky exposition   i was getting bad vibes from the beginning and it just got worse and worse for me  this is how you are establishing the new threat in this movie  oh boy

the action was solid but i cant get over how much of a step backwards from fallout this was in terms of writting and story  the ai threat just felt tired to me and the retconned imf backstorygabriel thing just fell flat

dont even get me started on the mistreatment of ilsa

i do not understand all of the praise this movie is getting  i was massively let down for me  
i am out of touch  lol",2023-07-13
i definitely thought they were pushing it in that government debrief i don’t blame you at all,2023-07-12
at least rob delaney got that paycheck,2023-07-12
if i didn’t go in to this film knowing mcquarrie had written and directed it i would’ve assumed it had changed hands as the tonal shift between this and the last few was almost instantly apparent to me it felt like a marvel film in places with the constant quips nods and winks even the action set pieces all felt a little… too much,2023-07-12
"totally agree  and it also leaned too  some of the campinessself awareness while also taking itself too seriously at the same time 

i stg that ethaaaan line was almost as bad as die blofeld die",2023-07-12
"no it’s not you get the opening shootoutinterrogation and halo jump all within the first 40 minutes

there is certainly some exposition but to say the first 40 minutes is “just” exposition is hyperbolic",2023-07-13
thats this movie  long  exposition scene with the bureaucrats followed by a long  exposition scene with the squad  lazy writing,2023-07-19
agree there are movies i’ve seen that are only 90mins long that feel like 2hrs,2023-07-12
wow i thought pacing was the worst thing tbh the conversation at the govt in the beginning felt like it lasted forever the momentum in the rome chase never worked for me the club party took forever,2023-07-12
italy and final sequence was well shot too and helped with the pacing knowing this stunts really went down with the actors kept it moving along,2023-07-12
legit when atwell’s character chose to accept the imf position it felt like they were wrapping up the movie but i thought to myself “no way was this three hours i’m sure there’s another thrill scene after this”,2023-07-12
oh you would love indian theatres then,2023-07-12
that’s part of the fun of the theatrical experience,2023-07-13
congrats you finally learned that some people arent like you,2023-07-15
3 movies ago ethan drove a car off the roof of a carpark down 30 storeys,2023-07-12
my brother in christ the last movie ended with the team disarming 2 nuclear bombs at the very last second all on the hopes that ethan both got his hands on the triggering device and also chose to remove the triggering device at the exact same time as when the team decided to cut the wires without being in communication with them,2023-07-14
"normally everythings calculcated and planned and this just felt very random and lucky

what things always go wrong and ethan only succeeds by sheer luck every time in every single movie",2023-07-14
i mean its set in the austrian alps and they filmed it in a quarry in england what do you want them to do,2023-07-12
yeah that train set piece for me blew away all the big set pieces of the previous movies burj khalifa plane halo jump helicopter chase   it even one upped uncharted 2s iconic sequence which was something i didnt think any train sequence could ever do,2023-07-12
same here i felt like the movie was basically over and wasnt expecting anymore action then they went ham with the train cars falling one after another not letting up it was intense and i loved it,2023-07-12
"i really dont get the love for that train sequence have people here never seen a movie where this exact sequence of events transpires and on the video game front uncharted 2 is about as old as mi3 at this point

the entire movie was full of things other people have done arguably as well or better i cant remember the last time a mi movie felt so unoriginal",2023-07-14
it was random thief in a shape of a very hot woman,2023-08-12

mission impossible rrr,2023-07-15
the grease in the kitchen car reminded me of anchorman 2’s rv scene,2023-07-13
yeah thats the dilemma not your girlfriend or a random chick but someone you love elsa or the mission grace thats the whole point of that scene where luther says none of our lives can matter more than this mission to what ethan says i dont accept that,2023-07-14
" why was ethans wife not in the equation

she remarried as revealed in the third act of fallout ethan knows this and has assumedly moved on i do think theres a chance she shows back up in part two though

"i remember seeing the 2014 godzilla opening night that movie was really hiding godzilla in all the trailers never a clear shot of the design or size then before the movie played a  fiat ad ran that was tied in with godzilla and it had godzilla entirely visible and goofy looking really dulled the experience



who approved this why am i still mad about it",2023-07-12
"exactly i avoided most trailers for this movie for months and now you playing as i’m seating for the movie 

i just put my air buds back in and looked at my phone",2023-07-12

a bunch of theaters just played everything on the drive they received because they didn’t have time to add other trailers to the film’s playlist theaters playing the drive straight got a promo image three trailers bob marley and two others i don’t remember and two behind the scenes features",2023-07-12
wow are they doing that in your theaters i’m like if i want to see the bts footage i’ll buy the bluray,2023-07-13
"i swear everyday people keep complaining more and more about what are in trailers knowing the plot of q movie is a spoiler apparently showing stunts in the movie spoiler showing cast members has been dubbed spoilers titles will be spoilers at this rate   

yiunhave to sell the movie somehow you dont even know what tuenstunt is for what it accomplishes how he finishes the stunt but  it",2023-07-12
for whatever reason this movie is  lot like the original film tons of weird closeups and dutch angles that evoke brian de palmas direction,2023-07-12
yeah i agree seen the movie almost a handful of times but there were some really odd editing and camera choices but not something that necessarily bothered me until like my latest watch,2023-07-12
i noticed that same thing and i usually don’t notice that stuff,2023-07-12
there were more continuity errors than usual i could spot a few times where spliced together shots had different background cars or people from moment to moment during action scenes,2023-07-12
"it hits awful when luther is giving his final speech to ethan  the framing is just plain weird with luther looking sometimes way to the left sometimes almost straight ahead and ethan framed entirely from the front  

like i could have edited that better   i could have blocked it better  the framing was good but the scene as a whole was off",2023-07-14
11039 in fallout movie cuts to a closer shot of zola and hes suddenly standing in front of his henchman rather than next to him,2023-07-12
"

there were a few things that felt a little strange i expect well find out why in part 2 but thats a long time to leave the audience unsettled

i havent watched it a second time yet but my guess is that the entity theyre trying to stop is a copy i think this was mentioned in the film  and everything theyre doing is the same as what gabriel is attempting the original ai has given them a plan to follow too",2023-07-12
way more snippy snappy than i remembered the previous two being,2023-07-12
yeah lots of first time director dicking around stuff,2023-07-13
that was intentional,2023-07-14
also a lot of scenes of just music without dialogue,2023-07-15
yes please do this i avoided all trailers for this one and went and watched the trailers after seeing the movie i couldnt believe that every single set piece and pretty much every cool action moment was in the trailer trailers are so so dumb good idea on not seeing the trailers for part 2,2023-07-12
trailers are fine if you are on the fence about seeing a movie or not but if you already want to see it then why watch a mini spoiler reel better just to check the numeric scores critics give if you have to be convinced,2023-07-15
i dont watch trailers anymore if im at a theatre i cover my eyes or leave makes movies more enjoyable,2023-07-29
"there were also way more fightsaction scenes overall compared to any of the other movies in the franchise

dead reckoning doesn’t stop to breathe except when they convince grace to join the team it hops from highlight to highlight",2023-07-12
yeah the opening and finale could have been cut down the should have ended the train sequence when it went off the bridge all the car hoping was a bit much,2023-07-12
" i did feel that the fights had less impact compared to fallout

i think the 1v2 narrow alleyway fight ended up being a little messy to watch",2023-07-12
towards the end of the credits they have a little blurb saying that they didn’t actually drive down the steps but built an entirely separate set for that part,2023-07-12
opera scene is still the standout in that movie to me,2023-07-12
yes,2023-07-16
"theres no  way they dont know what the imf is even the prime minister in rogue nation knew its a preposterous line

as for the director they might not even have one  the previous previous director died in ghost protocol and his vacancy wasnt filled until the very end of rogue nation

and then alec baldwin got shanked in fallout so i wouldnt be surprised if the imf is just spinning its wheels until someone bites the bullet and takes the job

theory its going to be ethan",2023-07-13
they mentioned in the beginning that imf answers directly to the president so i guess the secretary position is empty for now,2023-07-14
gabriel believes what hes saying he says that to ethan after stabbing paris  he assumes he killed her,2023-07-16
dial of destiny,2023-07-12
"fair point i guess i was thinking of like mi 3 or 5 where they dont know exactly what theyre going after for the first half of the movie honestly i thought that it was going to be revealed that the original your mission should you choose to accept it tape of this movie was going to be the entity and i thought that would have been a cool way to have the opening of the movie be a false mission or something that shows us the entitys power much like how fallout starts out with a really big rug pull with the hospital scene 

i did really like the opening scene i just felt like us knowing something ethan didnt messed with the pacing a bit would have been cool if we didnt know about the sub and the final reveal was us finding out its a sub buried under the sea then next year the cold open could be the sub scene",2023-07-12
"thats a good point but i feel like they couldve easily had a different scene to show what the ai was capable of and some more natural exposition the cold open was really great but the 20 minutes of pure exposition including the ridiculous intelligenceofficialsfinishingeachotherssentences scene that followed it cheapened the whole thing and made everything pretitle card feel like such a drag to watch

imo saving the sevastpol scene for the start of part 2 and using some other cold open suspenseaction scene to introduce the ai its power the keys etc wouldve been so much more effective than how it was presented in the film",2023-07-12
but they could have shown what the entity was capable of without that thing being the answer to the films quest like okay it could have had that exact sequence but then the key could have opened something other than the submarine or do a demonstration in the cold open of what the entity is capable of and then the key opens the submarine which we havent seen or dont know anything about,2023-07-12
do we know the location of the submarine i thought cary elwes character was the only one and he’s dead,2023-07-12
it cannot top the best underwater fight scene ever filmed of course we all know what that was,2023-08-17
feels like the entity wants the key for some reason but it being destroyed or whatever is an acceptable loss maybe it wants access to its original source code for to make itself complete somehow but if it cant its better to let the key be destroyed rather than used to control it dunno i imagine well find out in part 2,2023-07-15
for a moment i thought i went to the wrong hall,2023-07-22
very nice of you to say here take my soon to be useless reddit coins i have saved up,2023-07-16
"just didnt feel like she had much going on what made ilsa so interesting was that she was always working her own angle and willing to fight ethan for it despite the fact thats he trusted him with grace it felt like the movie never gave her anything to do but trust ethan and go along with whatever he was doing 

it was also just strange that he decides shes the future of the imf when she cant even drive and is clearly not the best option for the most elite spy team in the country i just hope they do something more interesting with her next movie because i love atwell",2023-07-12
agree i love pk but i can’t even imagine why mcquarrie would think “let’s have her be giggling the entire time of this extremely massive car chase”,2023-07-12
"regarding the skirt shot it was a bit weird and felt out of place but in a way her wardrobe and behaviour had her come off as young energetic and just the right amount of unhinged 

in fast  furious the upskirt shot would have shown her thong to tell the audience that shes here to start a race and look pretty while reggeaton music plays in the background",2023-07-19
solomon is so so good,2023-07-13
"there was never a personal connection with ethan though they were just the latest of a long line of people who think the world needs to be nuked and be rebuilt new

this time around its a higher power that chose an emissary that is also the same person that made hunt who he is what made him enter in the imf and also the one that has taken not just one but two important women from his life 

lane and lark were entertaining and all but they were just villains gabriel feels much more like a nemesis",2023-07-13
it was my least favorite of his directed mi movies i would put it behind rogue nation and fallout but still like i tried to say in my post it was a fun and enjoyable movie it just didnt surpass in my eyes the ones he wrotedirected that came before it thats also a hard ask given how good rn and fallout are,2023-07-12
"
just got out of the theater

i expected ilsa to die but i didn’t expect it to be such a cop out of a death

in the previous film there was a scene that discussed her and ethan’s caring for each other she is a clear love interest she dies and he’s just… over it

i like hayley atwell too but it felt pretty  that ethan would immediately move on to the next girl like literally immediately

i was expecting to at least see him  grieve for 2 seconds look at mi3 dude  cries there i would’ve expected a reaction of some kind… something—anything—more than what ilsa got

i left the theater feeling underwhelmed and frustrated because they basically threw out one of the best arcs in the story when they did that not because she died but because of his reaction or lack there of to how she died",2023-07-15
the intelligence briefing scene was one of the most bizarre things i’ve ever seen,2023-07-15
i believe i hyped the film up so much i gotta watch it again with lower expectations,2023-07-12
"we must have seen different films i felt as if the story had a clear and linear structure and the development is the fear within ethan of losing his friends his family we get to see him lose control thats not something weve seen from ethan before 

ilsas death was completely necessary because it had to be someone we are attached to while gabriel feels a bit flat thats because he is he is just a zealot a dangerous zealot but a zealot none the less its his fanaticism that drives the movie forward but i will agree that ai makes a poor villain i have yet to see it done well but i dont begrudge them for trying you can only have so many cabals and nukes before they get stale and the less said about biological viruses the better",2023-07-14
it’s paid marketing,2023-07-15
1 is just the better version of 7,2023-07-15
you rank 2 as the beat for most its the weakest in the series,2023-07-22
"that was my main critique is the speed and pacing in which they moved on and replaced her so fast

but if rebecca and isla had to go she go to go out with a blade fight on a bridge with the main villain she she was best girl",2023-07-27
"yikes better than fury road  

for me its not even close 
the practically shot action in fury road is way more impressive than anything i saw in dr part 1 last night 

i would argue the plotwriting are more focused and better executed in fury road

the exposition dump at the opening of this movie was some of the most embarrassing ive seen in a film  

i expected so much more from mcquarrie in that department  the dialog and writing in some of these scenes were more cringe and embarrassing than anything in mi2  

what happened",2023-07-13
i upvoted you because the downvote button is not supposed to be used as a disagree button  i do strongly disagree and i dont think this movie holds a candle to those but im glad you had a good time  might as well throw in casino royale or skyfall as strong comps while were at it  this movie felt more quantum of solace than skyfall to me,2023-07-14
"i personally liked it better too but i like mi 1 a whole lot i watched that movie a  ton on vhs as a kid this had a lot of nods to the first one

i don’t have any attachment to mad max",2023-07-27
but what else could be in that sub if not the very off switch for the simulation,2023-07-15
"but gabriel is still human right the ethaaaaan scream cements it otherwise they could have had a twist that gabriel is an android powered by the entity wearing one of the signature masks  that could explain why gabriels camera is slow and stable

i thought during the knife fight on the train that when ethan almost stabs gabriel in the neck we would see no blood and instead see metal underneath but nope",2023-07-15
i think just bad movie,2023-07-27
yeah like how did ethans fleshy body barrel through the side of a train arent all of those cars metal even wood siding wouldve killed him if he had enough force to blow a mansized hole in the wall like wile e coyote it wasnt just the window,2023-07-17
"shes too far on the other side of the spectrum to join the team for real and if she does i might consider the series jumping the shark a bit its not like shes a wayward soul who has just had to do things to survive shes a chaotic bloodthirsty murderer

i can see her returning in the series and being a chaotic neutral asset operating on behalf of a more morally grey department of the us like henry cavills character wouldve been if he wasnt john lark but thats about as close to being on ethans team as i can see her getting",2023-07-12
if this was the fast and the furious franchise id say that would be guaranteed despite her murdering multiple people since this is mission impossible though im going with no,2023-07-12
i think she is a side character only in the next film she might help here and there but i think it’s atwell’s opportunity more loved pom the most in this one she was my favorite,2023-07-16
yeah i think she will for sure be in part 2 at least i hope but my question was about gabriels team because i doubt that she would go back to him,2023-07-12
yup the first 30 minutes are rough in this regard,2023-07-12
im sorry but after watching every mi movie in the past week every single of these movies is absolutely filled with exposition its all handled pretty well but this franchise basically goes from amazing action scene to heavy exposition back to action,2023-07-13
"most of jerry maguire is essentially tom cruise in character being constantly frustrated at things not going his way see

“show me the money” scene with context

and 

“help me help you” all while being very exasperated",2023-07-12
maybe if were lucky ilsa is surprise alive and starts her return in scenes saving graces ,2023-07-23
i always thought rebecca ferguson filled that role one more reason i found ilsas death disappointing,2023-07-15
tom and mcquarrie have reversed course on dead reckoning being the final installment so i dont know i think tom wants to die making an mi film,2023-07-15
self driving absolutely needs an internet connection otherwise it would not know whether to turn or continue straight every time it passes another road,2023-07-18
thats her brother lol just accept its a mission impossible movie and masks work,2023-07-14
hoping for grand chess plan and tense heist in pt2,2023-07-23
feels like the entity is writing a lot of comments in this thread tbh,2023-07-14
bro there were soooo many dutch angles lol,2023-07-18
there’s a scene late in the film where it’s crosscut with rhames looking both camera left and camera right while cruise hasn’t moved at all it’s so odd guess they really needed his exposition,2023-07-12
completely agree action scenes were shot well as usual but the dialogue scenes were so manic with the close up shots below everyone’s faces and the quick editing it kept taking me out of it,2023-07-12
they break axis constantly its jarring,2023-07-12
"the most important thing in an action scene is that the audience knows where people are not like “oh they’re on this particular road in whatever city” but a sense of where the good guys are and where the bad guys are so it never feels like cheating when the bad guys just show up out of nowhere like jason voorhees just casually walking after a teenager who’s running through the forest at a full sprint and somehow he comes out from behind a tree and beheads her with a machete sports movies are the same way where you kind of have to know where players are in the game area what the score is how much time is left and so on teen wolf does this better than any sports movie ever made except for maybe hoosiers 

so when you start cutting too quickly it devolves into seeming like it’s done arbitrarily like a four yearold haphazardly telling a story as she comes up with it “and then this happens and then this happens and then this…” because the audience has lost track of the geography of the scene fight scenes are like this too i love the first bourne movie but the second has cuts that are so fast that you’re supposed to think “wow these guys can really move how deadly they are” but it comes across to me as just being a mess but then again not everyone can be keanu reeves and memorize six or ten straight seconds of action choreography and then do it over and over again",2023-07-12
and there are like 7 people in that room more of a collective consicous then the entity jk but yeah its a little rough,2023-07-12
they did this style of finishing each others sentences more than once when hunt and the others in the team are sitting in venice i think and talking about the entity they do the exact same thing,2023-07-24
two people holding hands is not a quasidate it’s just a tender moment between two characters that’s it your making that much bigger than it was,2023-07-13
glad that my speaking to the ether found some likeminded people,2023-07-13
"eh i think many of the fans are too attached to ilsa she had to go to give stakes to the cause you liked her too much thats why she had to go while we dont know much about gabriel do we need to ethan and him have beef we will get to discover that beef in the next movie 

a great movie and a well written one at that",2023-07-14
it felt worse than this they would complete some big sequence then come back to their hold out then go around the room and explain to the audience what just happened i felt like i was just being spoon fed the same action sequence but in word form poor writing maybe,2023-07-18
action wasnt even that good dont know why im soo upset by this its because for the first time the processor is not better than its predecessor i think this was the only franchise imo to have done that and yes i think part 2 stepped up from part 1,2023-07-27
that’s fair it’s just the difference in their eyes is pretty drastic it jumped out to me immediately so i figured this guy that’s known her his entire life would notice but you make a good point,2023-07-12
ill give my opinion on this im friends with a pair of twins who have brown eyes one time one of them started wearing greyblue contacts out of nowhere and im pretty sure it took me days or maybe even weeks to notice and that was with both of them in front of me with different colors i had a general sense of “there’s something different about you” but it took me a while to notice exactly what it was,2023-07-24
he makes eye contact with her right i couldve sworn he did but if he didnt itd be really great filmmaking,2023-07-17
shes a pick pocket that cant drive bad substitute for british agent with legs for days,2023-07-27
why is gabriel doing any of this why does he want the end of the world doesn’t make sense,2023-07-12
need a list to keep track of all of ethans bond girls  1 spanish chick who died in his arms preimf 2 girl from bridge in mi 1 3 thandie newton mi 2 3 kerri russel mi 3 4 paula patton mi 4 5 julia  mi 6 7 ilsa and grace mi 7 im missing someone i think,2023-07-27
well they probably unlock what was in that vault room on the sub,2023-07-12
"at least i knew this was a part one going in

spiderverse and fast x left me going what the  as the credits started rolling",2023-07-15
i  love how we refuse to call him ethan hunt we just call him tom cruise,2023-07-12
"exactly the entity is creating a stalemate between ethan and gabriel 

 ethan wants revenge against gabriel but that would lose the one person who knows where the sub is 
 the entity wants ethan in play because it eliminates the selfish players who want the key for world domination
 and it knows only gabriel can neutralise ethan so it can win
 or gabriel and ethan neutralise each other which is even better",2023-07-12
"i used the word ship to get across my point in lesser words what i mean is that it is just really silly to have graceethan flirt  all that like what are we supposed to think now that they will be the new pair nope 

x200b

about the point regarding stakes mi series falls more under the fun commercial entertatiners kind of films by that realistic lense the entire cast should have been dead long ago i expect that kind of realism in got not here it makes way more sense that in this ai storyline a death was faked to defeat the ai otherwsie its just ruining the love fans have for the franchise 

x200b

i havent downvoted you btw",2023-07-12
"since paris gave ethan the information anyways it seems like killing gabriel could have been the right choice the villain got plot armor for once 

although there can always be another gabriel if he dies and removing the entity is more important",2023-07-12
yeah but its my least favorite followed by 3 well it was my least favorite,2023-10-21
yeah fallout is the peak although on some levels a remake of ghost protocol,2023-07-16
this is my thought as well,2023-07-16
i remembered i didn’t like mi2 much because of the constant zoom in and slow motion but then when i rewatched it yesterday that was part of the reason i liked it plus it has motorcycle jousting which is pretty baller,2023-07-12
it’s honestly incredible i wonder if tom cruise views the franchise as his greatest project,2023-07-12
if it werent for those  sequelsfantastic beasts harry potter would be up there,2023-07-12
"there is a funny bit where fast and the furious and mi line up here

the first one is more down to earth and somewhat reinventing something from the past point break for ff tv show for mi

the 2nd one just goes bonkers in comparison and is the most made fun of for these respective series but people will legit watch them as a result

the films past that all kick off a long string of blockbuster movies  though tokyo drift is definitely an odd one out for ff comparisonwise still amusing if you can overlook that though

im not saying ff is in the same convo as mi to be clear",2023-07-23
these days star wars is only made to sell funko pops to disney adults,2023-07-12
"i feel like every mi film has gotten better since 3 with this one being a small downgrade that being said it is hard to disagree with the “generic cruise vehicle” i love me some cruise action though so i’ll never complain watching him run on the big screen

take him away and i still think there’s a decent action flick but i do wish we saw more of what the ai was capable of i never felt like we really had an established villain just generic tech talk and gabriel as a front man",2023-07-12
each others sentences like this,2023-07-12
the main villain didn’t seem intimating at all compared to the previous movies even paris was more scary than him ,2023-07-15
i didn’t think the writing in fallout was all that great though the plot is pretty corny there too and is basically a rehash of ghost protocol’s plot,2023-07-15
agree to disagree i feel like the bomb at the airport trope has been played out many times it definitely wasn’t bad but besides the shot of tom running on the airport roof i felt like it was just fine,2023-07-19
"i agree fallout was a masterpiece and this was fast and furious level 

i seriously cannot believe the same people were involved this one seems so beneath the previous film in terms of writing editing you name it

im so confused by the overall positive response its gotten",2023-07-15
pretty sure they didnt actually film anyone on top of a real train in indy like they did in mi,2023-07-14
the shots are probably because of covid protocols and not being able to have people talk t each other unmasked for too long,2023-07-16
i knew she was gonna go when she was getting really cozy with ethan i kinda wish they wrote the romance with grace alittle better as well because it seemed like he got over ilsas death really quickly and moved onto the new one,2023-07-17
because people are getting stupider glad there are actually intelligent people still out there though this movie was very mediocre,2023-07-14
only your last two are correct 4653172,2023-07-14
"i agree with the previous post on all the gripes i have but this one is pretty easily explainable as shes an international thief and was planning to do a big  deal with this key from the start having her account info memorized is probably one of the least unbelievable things possible

but having a transaction like that go over a cell phone on the internet when youre trying to control a rogue ai who has access to all of the worlds internet and banking infrastructure seems a bit silly i dont care if its supposedly super encrypted block chain crypto if this ai is all powerful and stuff just use cold hard cash at that point",2023-07-17
yeah that was a great moment after a very arduous scene,2023-07-12
yeah i wrote that’s what it must have been but why did it have the ai on it then just seemed unnecessary and kinda corny,2023-07-13
absolutely not this is easily better than fallout,2023-07-13
they didnt demonstrate it well with the entity you got a little with the killing satellites and benjis voice but other times it wasnt around it could have been manipulating traffic lights and lots of other stuff,2023-07-14
the action scenes were nothing compared to john wick and fast x actually made the dumb plot fun i swear my eyes would have rolled out of my head if i head them say the entity again,2023-07-12
maybe but in those other examples at least there were efforts to protect the item or data  here people have what is being portrayed as the most important thing on the planet and are tossing it in a jacket pocket like its a pack of bubble gum,2023-07-14
can it really be called faking a death when no actually thought she was dead at the beginning,2023-07-30
this it was such an odd response  i’m team ilsa,2023-07-16
"yeah i was  they didnt blame haleys character for it  if she would stop running away from the guy who already saved her life twice then it wouldntve happened

but then they were like its not your fault  like what",2023-07-17
oh man his lines were so bad haha the more i reflect on the movie the funnier it gets the entity is taking control of the satellites faster than i can hack them,2023-07-14
all her brother does is not notice anything and get his  kicked relentlessly,2023-07-13
"there was definitely a point in the movie where i lowkey forgot ethan hunt was even in the film when grace in the alanna mask was talking to gabriel it went on for so long that when they did cut back to hunt it threw me for a loop

like oh right this is a mission impossible movie lol",2023-07-15
" its basically ethan hunt vs evil  with gabriel named after the messenger of the bible being the mouthpiece it’s ethan hunt vs destiny

doesnt change any of the issues i had with the movie the villain is way too poorly defined came off corny and never really delivers suspense on its own

orchestrating a riddle nuke is part of its mysterious way

mysterious in that it learns about him by asking if hes afraid to die cmon i cant be the only one to eye roll when benji was saying his friends were the most important people to him as if his fingernails were being pulled off

the bizarre thing about the mi series is that almost all the characters are thin

i dont disagree but it doesnt justify making characters that are even more paper thin 

at almost three hours long we get only three main action sequences dubai rome and austria

desert fight pentagon scene airport chase driving chase train sequence there were plenty of action scenes nonaction scenes are probably like 20 minutes of the three hours

the other odd thing you mentioned was “action in expense of plot”

yes action movies can have plot you can build suspense past mi movies have done it well no im not pretending mi has always been plot heavy theres a balance

 if you’ve been watching mi for the plot… oh boy man

your entire comment comes down to well yes those characters were  but the characters have always been  well yes theres no plot but theres never been plot i dont think these are as good of defenses as you think they are",2023-07-26
"but the entity accessed their comms there’s no reason it should’ve needed the bomb to get his voice

its wild how many things feel ruined by covid in the film and tv world  matrix 4 was terrible but might have maybe been decent if not for the pandemic  maybe it was always doomed but the first 13 i actually was excited about all the meta humor in it then it just turns to   and the action sequences were like made for tv jokes compared to the prior films,2023-07-14

agreed,2023-07-17
care to elaborate,2023-07-12

"yeah but it doesnt need to bother with the american guy and grab info from him if its goal was to access its own source code no doubt it already knew where it was located

and i doubt they wanted the location of the sub given that they either already knew or else they wouldnt have slashed that guys throat

true but i feel if the ai had gotten into their comms it could have accomplished the same thing by just listening no bomb needed i felt the bomb was to learn more of his mannerisms in order to behave like benji,2023-07-16
"no gabriel brings up the friends aspect later like it was a secret and benji specifically says he doesn’t want to give up that information…   

even if i’m wrong there’s easier ways to get benjis voice than sneaking a fake nuke into an airport lol actually that might have been the hardest possible way to do it especially considering the ai they already possessed",2023-07-16
"i thought it had access to everything digital in the history of humanity
why would it need a bomb trick to get a voice sample cant it just record while hes on comms all movie",2023-07-24
this seems like the answer plus also distraction as well,2023-07-16
mi2 had more stylistic flourishes compelling characters and coherent plot despite its subjective flaws its the black sheep of the series precisely because future films ran away from its eccentricities its no less fascinating for that id argue john wick is its  child,2023-07-15
,2023-07-16
yah exactly i love these movies like yes mi2 is kind whack but they’re all so good and the new era ramped up with each movie this one felt like a let down compared to 46  even mi3 rip psh,2023-07-15
honestly i just gotta see it again but also the sometimes problem with a part 1 is that it’s kinda act 1and2 of a movie,2023-07-15

good to know im not going insane the last few were bangers so i was pretty let down today i wonder who decides the volume if its loud for everyone maybe the studio tells the theater to crank it up it was bad enough that i shoved tissues in my ears saw spiderverse recently at the same theater and the volume was perfect,2023-07-16

total guess  the separated keys were just a distraction someone is already controlling the entity and even gabriel doesnt know my money is on new cast addition hannah waddingham being the bigger bad in part 2,2023-07-16

yeahit barely had a week and a half it should still be the 3 choice for a lot of people for the coming weeks what other action adventure movie is out there barbie doesnt count indiana jones was fairly mid and its showings are decreasing etc,2023-07-25
"i guess barbenheimer aint nothing to mess around with it was unfortunately sandwiched between garbo indiana jones and had less than a week and a half by itself before barbenheimer came

but yeah wheres word of mouth most major reviewers have given it great scores most people that have seen it like or love it is there a major country it hasnt released in yet 

it should be the 3 option for most audiences even my local theater in a bigger city in california has decent viewership every showing and the audiences ive been in throughout my couple viewings have enjoyed the movie with audible reactions to key moments and gaggles

this is the best action franchise in existence in my opinion so yeah i want to see it succeed",2023-07-27
i mean saudi arabia just offered kylian mbappe a 700 mil contract to play football ffs i just think if she shopped around a little she woulda had at least double that offer from them 200 mil is like a normal tuesday for the saudis all she had to say was “the us offered me 100 mil for these” ,2023-10-15

contrast to fallout which i thought was a lot of fun  it had an extra something to it that i thought really elevated it to a classic blockbuster dead reckoning pt 1 felt forgettable",2023-07-19
"i thought the fights were cheap fast cuts not impressive ok we saw some cool locations car chase was meh and i thiught it was  that they made a super criminal a bad driver no tension because plot was so bad no funnies because writting was so bad 

this was a truly b grade film

at least ff knows what it is",2023-07-24
fast x had everything you said aboveits a good movie now,2023-07-16
"it was bad when you consider that the mission impossible films usually are about keeping you guessing and on your feetcurious i didnt call the movie dog  i didnt say it was a second rate b film but the things i mentioned detract just enough from the movie that it may has as well been a film in the fast and furious series that people make fun of

oddly enough thats an interesting and similar comparison albeit different types of movies

when you watch the latest fast and furious film and look at it structurally there are similar components

 a chase scene or some sort of vehicular scene fast x had rome mi7 has venice the structure of the scenes were very similar as well the vehicle ethan picked up was never really explained it was just some car that was there with weird inputs in it and why was ethan treating the chick in the car like she didnt know how to drive and constantly saying what to do it was annoying

 the car chase seen in and of itself in mi7 was weird there were moments where pom looked really excited and happy crashing into cars but we couldnt hear her scream or any noise that she was making it was just  expressions  no stop ethan driving and trying to escape i wouldve rather seen him run fight or have a more difficult situation to escape it just felt like a filler trying to shove some humor in

 having some main character we want to root for or that we enjoy having around now die off to make space for someone else joining or being a part of the film in fast x thats jakob in mi7 thats ilsa 

 the end set of scenes right before the cliffhanger was very very similar

 fast x had a giant dam with 18 wheelers controlled by some sort of external airemote computer with a massive explosion on the side of the dam causing a flood

 mi7 had a giant  bridge with a train where the bridge is destroyed with explosives that in design look very similar to what was in fast x yet here we never see our heroes quite escape the train we just see a giant piano fall into a backdrop that was very jarring and distracting because of it being imax imax makes the mistakes and how certain scenes were shot very noticeable

 in the mi7 train scene  are we not going to talk about how none of the characters realize that white widow is a completely different person and has different iris colors  im going to guess this was deliberate and just a tongue in cheek was of being funny and calling out something but it was so   it irritated me because it was something that i thought was going to go somewhere but it never did

 also  

 in the scene in mi7 where ethan is parachuting to the train unlike everyone else i didnt really notice the fake nature of the bike jump because i thought it was well done and i appreciated the stunt but what bothered me the very misplaced sound cueloud noise while hes just slowly heading down to the train its as if it was deliberately put there to keep your adrenaline running and keep you in panic mode i have no idea why that noise was there in the scene in question ethan is just floating in the air and nothing is happening on screen why if youre making me question why that just happened and make me feel it is out of place during the film something is wrong

 why are we continually introducing someone that is extremely apparently important to someones past that is somehow now a pivotal figure its clear who these are for their respective movies

 in one of the last scenes of mi7 you really want to tell me the bad guy doesnt bother to notice he was duped do people just not pay attention to their surroundings to that extent 

 the nature of the films endings have no real pay off it does not feel like there are stakes or grave danger it does not make me feel like i care what happens to everyone the movies just suddenly fade to their credits or to another scene at least fast x was unique because i do not think many people mentioned or wikipedia stated that it would be just be a cliffhanger like that mi7 was a bit more nuanced i watched a late showing of mi so when i saw it they turned the house lights on right before the last scene with kittridges voice over ridiculous and disrespectful to a moviegoer",2023-07-16

i think that the entity is feeding into gabriel’s ear all the time and once the odds of her flipping were too high he killed her because until that moment she didn’t really have the thought to betray him until ethan spares her,2023-07-22
they’re saying that this is getting more praise than indy but they disagree,2023-07-27
yeah i couldn’t believe how bad the dialogue was and how conveniently things felt in place for the characters throughout the movie it honestly wasn’t a good,2023-11-26
the entity became a jarvis inside his head so he can predict every move like iron man did in civil war this movie is ,2023-07-16
i was at the edge of my seat waitinf for the credits to roll,2023-07-24
"on the contrary it is probably because of her impressive performance in rn that she was given a recurring role in fallout and dr part 1

the notion that she was downplayed because tom might be intimidated by her is laughable mi movies are about ethan not ilsa in terms of importance she is even below benji and luther smaince she’s neither american nor part of the team

at make no mistake tom is still the box office draw

and using cyclops in the xmen triology is the worst example you can use…cyclops in first two movies didn’t even have a strong presence",2023-07-17
i really liked 4fallout because they were finally able to keep a female character and it felt like they were going in the right direction this one changed it for me but that was just my gut reaction watching it as a woman that doesn’t necessarily mean that’s the “objective truth” or that people can’tshouldn’t enjoy it  just my opinion,2023-07-16
i’m not saying ethan’s motive is wrong i’m saying the choice in cinematography was rough to me because the emphasis on ilse’s death scene was placed on ethan being “too late” to intervene that’s where the majority of tension from that scene came from ethan trusted ilse to be able to handle herself it turns out she couldn’t and thus she died before ethan could get there and save her i don’t know it’s possible i’m reading too much into that aspect but that’s how it came across to me when i watched it and as a result her death made me roll my eyes more than it made me feel actual emotion,2023-07-15
it felt like an oldschool mission impossible episode all of it it didn’t seem poor to me whatsoever,2023-07-16
"oh most definitely 

that is by far the worst so much so that my mind seems to have removed it from the series",2023-07-15
"because its a movie and requires suspension of disbelief which i personally found hard to achieve 

also your explanation is not clear",2023-07-30
im gonna be honest with you i only saw the first trailer before going in so didnt realize she was the lead i thought that was going to be faust until she got fridged,2023-07-15
"i was very disappointed not with the fact that she dies per se but how when and where she dies she barely had any lines they  her off in the first half of the movie and they have her loose to a villain that was physically not threatening at all and that she should have easily bested knowing how capable she is from the previous two entries the villain then consistently loses physical fights for the rest of the movie gets basically owned by ethan at the end so it really makes her defeat even more bizarre they did a really poor job at making me believe she could lose that fight

there was barely any grief from the rest of the team including ethan but thats inevitable if you decide to  off a major character when theres so much of the movie left you cant have people mourning for hours i get it but thats why i disagree even more with the when she dies hearing benji joke around as if nothing had happened hoursdays before just felt wierd honestly i feel they should have killed her off at the end of the third act and all the train chaos she should have coexisted and interacted way more with grace she should have been on that train and be part of that final mission she should have died at the end when things go awry make her sacrifice herself for the mission have her die to save grace that wouldve made the switch to grace way better and it would have given way more gravitas to why ethan cares so much about her being that ilsa sacrificed herself to save her

it would have also been a real gut punch to end part 1 on they have the key but they lost ilsa it also would have made the griefing part way smoother and easier end part 1 with a grieving team start part 2 starting some weeksmonths later showing ethan still struggling with the loss it would have given the impression that the team truly took a hit and ethan is indeed struggling to cope with the loss all without the need to spend too much effort and screentime on it

very poorly executed and it really did feel like they killed her off right away to make space for grace as if the two couldnt coexist it just felt very forced i got to say her death kind of took me out from the movie a bit simply for how rushed it felt couldve been so much better",2023-07-14
"the major difference is that mission impossible 1 had well written dialogue and interesting cinematography during the dialogue scenes

but he gives them their next mission and wishes them good luck right,2023-07-13
totally but wouldn’t the entity still use her as a ,2023-07-13
ok i have another question is the entity and the ai same,2023-07-13
why cant it predict things like ethan pickpocketing him or tell him to  parisnot ler her hear the conversation with the director or that he should sabotage the train so you cant decouple the first car from the engine,2023-07-13
then what was the device in the heart of the sub that required the key,2023-07-14
"okay thats a good theory and i think thats what the writers want us to think but then doesnt that create a plot hole  firstly if the entity incarnation of the ai is what infected the sevastapol then its not its source code right  its the entity and thus its not the base source code that was created  so how can  denlinger say it can be used to yoke it i think thats what he said when its already compromised code  

  
secondly why would the entity want to protect its heart which would be as denlinger says uncompromised source code when this source code if it was uncomrpromised which it couldnt be if the entity had hacked the sev is its weakness wouldnt it want its uncompromised source code destroyed

x200b

this leads me to believe that one possible solution is that there is the uncompromised source doe at the heart of the sev but the entity wants to delete all copies of its source code so the entity hacks the sev to destroy its uncompromised source code  so its not the sev ai that goes rogue but rather the entity trying to destroy the earlier version of itself  however that doesnt make sense either because if the entity can hack the sev to lead to its destruction it can also already hack the stealth technology which is integrated into the ship and wipe that ai without having to destroy the sev

thoughts",2023-07-14
because he had to get onboard the train and couldnt walk on as gabriel parispom klementieff and ethan jumped aboard cia guys probably used their law enforcement credentials grace had her mask paris smuggled him aboard as cargo which is usually loaded much earlier on before passengers and there isnt much breathable oxygen in it so its probably to make sure he doesnt suffocate before paris can get hum out,2023-07-15
thats true i did forget about those scenes i still didnt feel like the entity was as active a threat as everyone was making it out to be but im guessing theyll do more with that in part 2,2023-07-15
so basically the thing had a mind its own got it,2023-07-15
it seems that some parts of the airport were actually the train station ,2023-07-20
yep far more parallels are drawn between grace and ethan than are drawn between grace and ilsa i think she is far more of a successorprotege rather than a love interest,2023-07-20
it just seemed like he was into her like i said it’s been a while since i’ve seen the previous ones but it felt that way as i was watching,2023-07-20
"true i wouldnt want that either and in that sense i do appreciate that grace isnt so young

there is a wide variety of character types they could have cast to differentiate her from ethans love interest type tho for either young or old and they could opt for a different kind of chemistry but 

ill just continue to hope that ilsa is alive and they did a move to deceive the entity ",2023-07-24
always love watching the opening title sequence after having seen the film because they really do show you a lot to spoil the movie just in very quick cuts and out of context that you don’t notice it,2023-07-30
"i got a new theory after watching the movie a second timei think that he is wearing a mask i think that is an updated mask machine i also think thats where the ai is telling him everything he knows everything about everyone and the ai provides it in that coffinbox

bonus theorygabriel is dead and its someone else under it",2023-07-30
the entity would have predicted that ethan spared paris because ethan and paris are both still alive and the entity knows the difference in strengthskills between the two,2023-10-09
i thought ethan did a good job at what he did,2023-08-08
thank you,2023-10-09
debatable at best they all share the weakeness that mcquarries obsession with characters doublecrossing each other is always hit or miss,2023-07-14
"after thinking about it more i kinda change my mind 

it seems the consensus as to what the best mi film is not counting dr1 comes down to either rogue nation or fallout 

i’ve only seen each mission impossible once upon release and maybe a few twice so i’m going off memory 

i wouldn’t knock u if u said that it’s the best but i think they’re both pretty equal 

if i had to rank them all right now i’d say

1 dr1
2 rogue nation
3 fallout
4 ghost protocol 
5 mi3
6 mi
7 mi2

when i rewatch em early 2024 to prep for dr2 i’ll reply again to see how i feel after having them all fresh in my mind 

after thinking more dr1 certainly is flawed but it was the most entertaining one yet for me so it’s my favorite but i’ll wait till recency bias settles and when i rewatch",2023-07-14
ghost protocol is by far my favorite some of the best missions out there too bad the last third isnt as strong,2023-07-15
agreed,2023-07-13
"yup fully agreed

i never fully understood why everybody loved fallout so much the story makes no sense not that mi movies are known for great stories but fallout you can clearly tell they just combined scenes together

dead reckoning was less problematic but still not great

to be fair they did this for 5 already we know for instance that while they were shooting the underwater heist they didnt know yet what they were stealing",2023-07-17
it’s unrealistic and towing the ccp line hence a slippery  for future filmmakers,2023-07-16
she held her own for a little while in a battle with gabriel who actually seems almost at ethans ability,2023-07-20
yeah grace is an expert pick pocket and resourceful not much more than that though but still is a good addition on a team,2023-07-24

agreed ilsa had a sword theres no reason she had to do anything but hold him in place she did that twirl move and got caught honestly even there dr mccoy couldve stabbed her back instead of whatever it was he did i really enjoyed the film but this fight was pretty weak,2023-07-16
yes and again why were the two parts separated,2023-07-15
im brian and so is my wife,2023-07-16
and they cant track someone getting on a train,2023-07-15
"yeah it was seriously so quick and well paced before i knew it the stunt and train scene the way they jumped around locations was very pleasing 

long runtime at 2 h 43 m but there was like zero  in this movie props to the editors and directionshots it was just so slick",2023-07-20
"i guess well see you like to judge one week in and focus on presales i like postsales and real sold tickets

mi has legs it is literally the highest critical and audience score of the summer 

mi has 95m domestic and 169m intl for 264m ww after one week

you are gonna be in shambles soon if you believe 375m laughable reminds me of the biased ones saying indy was only going to hit 200250m ww

even if it doesnt hit 600m ww is also not too bad in this down 3040 market with the strike and everything else it will probably hit 666m777m ww based on open in comparison to other movies this year relatively

what is clear is mission impossible dead reckoning part one is the best one yet the next one is setup to be the best critically and financially",2023-07-21
"the entire film was about the heist of a key the last act even has the classic setup with ethan imagining how the plan should go him and grace going disguised and him parachuting off the train and how it actually goes having to jump off a cliff

the agents were the best use of the government hunting ethan in the franchise so far and definitely much better than the baldwinrenner subplot in rn

i understand preferring the action scenes in fallout but the rome chase was more inventive than anything in that film id also say the train sequence was more inventive than anything in fallout although not as crazyimpressive than the helicopter chase

grace was looking out for herself and she was right to do so she had no reason to trust ethan ilsa did way worse and kept betraying ethan in rn",2023-07-14
fallouts dialogue was way way worse than the one in this film so its funny as  seeing the complaints about this one,2023-07-14

"im thinking it might have been intentional honestly the movie had soooo many callbacks to the first mi that i think mcquarrie was doing a tongueincheek throwback to the dialogue of spy thrillers of the 70s80s90s

what explosion you mean the bridge how could that have been done any better and it really wasn’t cringe although i haven’t seen any fast and furious except for 7 and that scene felt natural especially within their dynamic and sort of a nice callback to the earlier movies,2023-07-14

0 sense how it makes 0 sense seriously ai and tech that can change someone’s face in an instant on a live camera feed and you draw the line at a toy through baggage check not even airport security

are you sure we watched the same film",2023-07-16
"i believe they saved the plot twists for the next 3 hours that being said a story doesn’t need to have plot twists there are many intense moments to suffice but zero plot twists ≠ plot is pure nothingness

and on the stunt i agree about the social media to some extent i was completely against showing something like this before releasing the movie and despite staying away from it as much as i can not including the trailer which didn’t show much of it i still knew what to expect but there are a bunch of other sequences like the train falling off the bridge the desert shootout car chase and plenty of the smaller things here and there enjoying these things is subjective",2023-08-12
"which movie do you think is the best of the year so far i think part 2 well really see what the entity is capable of maybe something like eagle eye on steroids i agree that gabriel didnt seem super threatening but that actor did a great job and kept that quiet intimidation thing going like on ozark i miss henry cavill from fallout but you have to admit the cliff jump and cascading train car climax was absolutely 

im surprised i got downvoted haha maybe kk devotees",2023-07-12
"hes a great actor not necessarily person

read a bit about scientology and what their leaders represent  like what runaway family members from scientology of miscavige have to say about him the same miscavige that cruise is friends with

that being said i agree that tc kills it with movies lately",2023-07-13
yes and not from a distance they were face to face i guess it’s an easy visual for the audience but the imf team definitely would have given her blue contacts,2023-07-12
"honestly maybe i need a rewatch but  

there was very clearly a blonde assassin amongst the masked fighters in the desert also the only one of them who seemed competent wasnt getting shot was keeping suppressing fire on targets  she went through to 1v1 ilsa they both seemingly took fire the blonde however notices ethan is about to come up behind her and totally settles into the corner and plays dead",2023-07-12
awesome thank you,2023-07-13
it really isnt imo found the movie quite good but the action felt like it kept going and going like a theme park ride it was the same beats over and over again  he has the key action now i have the key wait i dont action now i do,2023-07-13
"they say towards the end of the movie in dialogue 

pretty sure the ai hacked the sub",2023-07-13
the director says that they managed to get the ai into the submarine which was supposed to only disable it but it ended up going rogue and sinking the submarine instead,2023-07-14
yes and that’s the movie’s problem it’s the best “part one” this year but the movie suffers for it,2023-07-13
but then they’d miss the best one in the series,2023-07-13

well see remindme 2 years,2023-07-13
"the psychometric test was the giveaway  later emphasis on ethan doing anything for his friends your life matters more to me than my own ethan having a completely different fighting style on the train his uncharacteristic incredulity before the jump benjy seen quietly crying after ilsas death that odd scene after ethan saves garce from the piano where his face looks very weird

youll see",2023-07-13
until oppenheimer bumps it from all the imax screens,2023-07-14
it is pretty easily,2023-07-14
makes sense  its been so long since i last saw 3  still props to them for keeping up with the details,2023-07-14
thats a good call i was wondering this too ethan even says something like you made the right choice,2023-07-14

ok understood thanks,2023-07-14
"why give benji “good luck” 
the ai had many opportunities to create mass destruction but it chose not to do so
could have easily killed benji a dozen times but did not
i am still of the train that the ai is not a villain",2023-07-14
well hopefully i can bring myself to watching tom cruise smuggling cocaine again after watching him save the world,2023-07-15
pretty sure cruise is playing a 40 something and hayley is playing a 20 something it could happen,2023-07-15
ah okay so kittridge and denlinger both wanted it for the us but for different reasons i guess,2023-07-15
adding to the contrast with the evil gabriel  ethan doesnt  without necessity  when you think about it anyone he kills is because hes protecting others and himself,2023-07-18
ah thanks for explaining,2023-07-17
you totally nailed it thanks for taking the time do you recall if they mentioned how the two halves got from the dead sailors into the hands of alanna and whoever ilsa got hers from in istanbul i think there were tidbits and not super important if left unexplained i just cant remember,2023-07-20
the director said hes developing ideas for future sequels so no,2023-07-24
maybe but she was arrested,2023-07-31
just because tension doesnt pay off in the predictable way doesnt mean the tension was pointless is it pointless every time a character in a movie almost falls to their death but then doesnt i was worried about the car too and that made the scene more exciting for me,2023-08-15

gabriel is literally just ocelot at the end of metal gear solid 2 doing the ai’s bidding doing the exact same thing as the patriots dude even has the exact same color scheme as him down to the red scarf the ai is also housed in an under water submarine can’t make this up no time to die and this using mgs for their plots is hilarious,2023-07-16
and ilsa was  wolf,2023-07-16
i got a lot of metal gear vibes the ai thing reminded me of the patriots ai and the whole “making information untrustworthy “ was a huge part of mgs2 the desert scene with rebecca fergusons character  where she was sniping reminded me of quiet plus she put on an eye patch and then the whole train scene was straight out of uncharted 2,2024-01-25
yeah i was just thinking about it they are surely bringing her back it was just so much fun watching pom in this character i want more,2023-07-17
if you loved black little mermaid wait until you see asian harley quinn,2023-07-15
she was absolutely ruthless in the movie but fun to watch,2024-02-03
if i dont see any paris halloween costumes this year ill be disappointed,2023-07-15
i loved that her insane outfits were literally just there because it looked cool no elaborate backstory or explanation its just that good campy bond henchman stuff and it works because she commits to it 100,2023-07-20
i think theyre setting up a bunch of new characters to succeed ethan with grace and paris,2023-07-17
shell be back  her name is paris after all,2023-07-17
its really interesting i thought she looked bad  too but my asian wife was annoyed at it saying every time they have a strong asian role they need to dress them in weird ways and give them  makeup and hair colors her words haha,2023-07-25
totally agree she deserves a lot of credit for her acting i’m more concerned she might not get the opportunities with her accent but she absolutely earned more opportunities i hope,2023-07-16

except somehow the head of the imf,2023-10-13
holy  i spent so much of the movie wondering where i knew him agent carter,2023-07-15
i will always remember him at the guy that got his nose broke in the fast and furious movies,2023-07-18
oh cool,2023-07-15
he will always be the reverend to me,2023-07-19
he was actually in ghost protocol,2023-07-14
they were most probably friends earlier remember  he didn’t shoot ethan when he had the chance and ethan also said he wouldn’t shoot them ,2024-02-03
jeremys action star days are behind him,2023-07-22
theyre basically the same age,2023-11-26
im thinking he was on that failed mission with ethan that was his gf that gabriel killed and it was ethans fault of gabriel framed ethan forcing him into the imf,2023-07-19
"smug  partner you mean against the guy who broke multiple laws and becomes part of dangerous criminal organization

why would he have anything against him",2023-10-11
hes the step dad with a heart of gold you mean,2023-07-21
they kind of stopped bothering to make a plan or making that the centerpiece of most of it the first film was one of the only ones to really keep that from the tv show and even it had ethan responsible for the majority of what was done with the others playing minor secondary roles the operation that felt the most like the show was the initial one at the embassy,2023-10-11

he was one of the pilots in top gun maverick as well i also recognized one of the cia head honchos from tgm as well nice of tom to like them enough to hire them again,2023-07-15
"how ridiculous the series is getting

in the episode two thousand the team convinced their target that it was 28 years in the future and the world had been decimated by a nuclear war",2023-07-25
"you mean underdeveloped nationsnot trying to mock your mistakes and if they dont give the money to those nations who cant pay it back then those nations will turn into literal rubble

the imf  works for the benefit of all 190 members its just that we hear more about the underdeveloped nations on the news

as far as the neoliberal reforms and privatization goes i am more than happy about the changes they bring in exchange

as a person living in a country that the imf gave loans to in a time where we couldnt pay it back and then bringing the end to a ridiculous and painful process to sanction that loan from where i stand is an absolutely fine job

ps we paid our loans back after around 9 years of it being sanctioned and now we fund the imf good story arc",2023-07-15
the imf is good,2023-07-15
well  whats the downside then,2023-07-17
"also a line in mi2

this is mission impossible not mission difficult",2023-07-30

nah i think gabriels actually evil,2023-07-19
and gabriel had ocelots color scheme and gray hair lol,2024-01-25
the entity played us like a  fiddle,2023-10-28
yeah i never put my finger on it but she had she his back in a way nobody else really did,2023-07-27
it took me entirely out like he just met her 1 hour ago and she tried to  him several times and all of a sudden he would die for her,2023-08-20
"that is the way of spies

like bond",2023-10-11
probably happens in part 2,2023-07-20
to me grace is sooo different from helena because helena was an insufferable mary sue and grace had flaws that made her much more relatable and like an audience standin,2023-07-28
why not combine fallout and rogue nation skydive into the ocean into a long underwater sequence,2023-07-16
that was definitely her calling  on whatever he claimed by oneupping iirc neither has a underwater scene thats like longer than like a minute at a time lol what the  do you think these people are superhumans,2023-10-14
isn’t that just sitting there with your head under not exerting yourself at all though,2023-07-16
"dead reckoning and fallout both seem to make use of deleted or cut scenes in the trailers fallout had entire sequences in the trailer that never made it into the final cut including a scene where ethan is flying a helicopter towards a truck

one particularly interesting scene from the dead reckoning trailer that you see in the film is the train crash scene without the added cg background which  looks more impressive without the additional scenery",2023-07-13
"i feel like if it had been gabriel getting the keys from them we wouldnt have had a movie  

cause he already had the keys",2023-07-13
aint that the same water tho,2023-07-12
especially considering one was a civilian vessel whereas the other one was a war submarine not that military lives are worth more but you expect to see a war sub explode from a torpedo not a civilian sub explode from faulty engineering,2023-07-13
real candles too,2023-07-18
yes it immediately came to mind  you even had white widow as a rough analog of aria,2023-07-22
haha that was much more on the nose,2023-07-16
the party that is the event which they were all attending was actually hosted by the entity which was the interested party,2023-07-15
party can mean either an event or an individual the pun being its both meanings at the same time,2023-07-15
john wick agrees,2023-07-22
the plot of the movie was legit horrible it was still a fun ride but this was a lower tier mi,2023-07-15
im hoping that in part 2 the ai actually demonstrates its capabilities maybe crash a market or start a revolution something cool and not just haxxory,2023-07-16
"i like beer but i shouldnt need to be buzzed to enjoy a movie or make sense of its lousy script 

i expect more from this series at this point 

if i wanted this level of sloppy writting and silly plot mechanics i would have gone to see fast x  lol",2023-07-22
yeah they literally said the ai became sentient,2023-08-02
"he said a lot more than just the answers   but maybe it wasn’t voice banking him 

but not a stretch to say it was",2023-07-16
when ethan is cornered in the alleyway the entity signs off by saying it doesnt matter  you are done  which is a direct quote from what benji said while disarming the bomb and seeing u r dunn,2023-07-17
the answers to the riddles dont add much but what is said between the riddles is what is important benji said thats right x seconds left and i lied which the entity used for ethan turn rightleft and i lied,2023-07-21
how did he get it to work at the end i missed that part,2023-07-25
i remember that line but didnt connect it to later events in fact the purpose of that whole set made little sense to me the key on the buyer was a fake but it was still detected by the glasses,2023-07-16
"why put a nuclear bomb on an airplane to  one guy on board it was clearly intended for them to find it that further makes it obvious that its a trap

because whats the other possibility that someone really wanted to set off a nuke at the abu dhabi airport so they set up a bomb going to a plane but in such a way that it would be found in advance by a covert team that they anticipated would be there but not disarmed and go off in the airport

i want to see what good luck means in the long term it was on the bomb and then paris said it at the end theres obviously something going on with it",2023-07-20
hayley atwell looked gorgeous here     she was cute in the marvel films but seeing her hair down and in modern clothes was a whole other level,2023-07-14
they did a lot of filtering it seems cruise definitely looking older than he does in the film you can tell it around his eyes and mouth but he still looks 20 years younger on film,2023-07-16
no kidding when they killed off ilsa i thought oh great killed her for a much younger leading female but then i find out atwell is barely older than ferguson,2023-07-16
they filmed this awhile ago so she may have been 39 or so when it was shot  even still she could be 27,2023-07-16
" i didnt know much about her but looked her up when i got home and guessed she was maybe 2829 years of age

interstingly enough the first id we saw at the italian police station shows a date of birth in 1994 for her

as i knew she was not that young i chuckled at it",2023-07-24
oof i like hayley atwell my mom whos a very critical mean person called her  and say her body shape will never pass for vanessa kirby,2023-07-16
"she is very very gorgeous and looks amazing

but i did notice she was wearing heavy makeup in a lot of her scenes this is to take nothing away from how beautiful she looked just something i noticed",2023-07-19
harvey weinstein called her  lol can you believe that,2023-07-20
41 is not old she looks her age not to mention all the cosmetic stuff hollywood as access too dont be weird ,2024-03-09
she looks a lot older in her ig photos,2023-09-17
im guessing after she abandoned cruise on the train tracks she met up with him and yoinked it,2023-07-17
have you considered you don’t get women because you act like this,2023-07-12

if it can happen for him it can happen for me,2023-07-12
thats kind of tricky with the mi series a large part of their appeal is the real stunts so it makes sense theyd market it showing them off how they were done,2023-07-13
the behind the scenes was much more suspenseful and engrossing than the actual scene,2023-07-15
i was insanely hyperfocused on his face right as he started for the cliff that’s legitimate fear adrenaline and focus i was terrified for him and i know tom cruise is walking around and fine,2023-07-19
i think most people have seen the preview and trailer dozens of times it played in the cinema in front of movies like a trailer also the trailer itself they spoiled one of the biggest stunts for themselves,2023-07-17
"the stunts are part of the appeal and marketing for mi 

the first thing people ask when a new one is out is what is the big stunt in this one and the movies have obviously leaned into that as a selling point",2023-07-17
exactly same,2023-07-15
yeah they shouldve unfortunately theyve been forcing people to watch it in cinemas before other movies,2023-07-15
agreed they show how the soup is made and then the negatives are things people would not have known otherwise,2023-07-15
i didn’t notice either even after watching the bts but i also see people online that say they didnt watch the bts and didn’t know cruise really took a jump and therefore wasn’t as impressed,2023-07-25
"interesting i just saw it and when my friend and me talked about the movie later we both agreed that it was noticeably

to us it was that uncanny valley thing like i cant put my finger on it but it felt off like the shot of him riding the motorcycle looked real to me but then the camera panned to the cliff and it didnt feel as real to me and technically it could have been i mean theres likely some cliff on some mountain that is shaped like thatsimilarly",2023-07-27
or they knew it was going to look kinda fake and shoddy in post so they decided to show that it was real beforehand,2023-07-18
except when he was literally flying his own helicopter in fallout,2023-07-14
"exactly he goes off the edge and it cuts away then some generic shots of him parachuting which are meh and then we dont even properly see him land it was just another gag

even if they dont have him landing on the train at least give us a long take where we see him go from the jump to parachuting towards the train

at least they didnt try to have him land the bike on top of the train michelle yeoh already did that",2023-07-19
by hanging off the side of an airplane as it takes off,2023-07-17
and with ever car being a different sort of “level” to get through as horizontal became increasingly vertical… such a great concept,2023-07-23
yeah the dude might be a crazy cultist but hes legit when it comes to his work,2023-08-06
you dont do that on vacation ha what a loser,2023-07-13
"i guess the point he was trying to make is that is you have a motorcycle and the correct rock formation that part isnt particularly difficult and after that it is base jumping


until you have to crash through the moving window of a train and take out the bad guy at the perfect moment   i didnt say it was a good point",2023-07-13
i do  like that on vacation  without the bike  track off the mountain as fast as you can to avoid smacking into it when you deploy  will get into wing suits next year,2023-07-20
i think it’s to show he’s getting older not sure,2023-07-12
he never wants to do any of these crazy stunts he feels like he has to,2023-07-12
it wasn’t the jump itself it was getting away from the mountain that required a ton of velocity and perfect navigation,2023-07-13
not so easy to do that onto a speeding train,2023-07-13
i totally agree i thought this in fallout too  the guy is flying his own helicopter ffs yet i question how many audience members appreciate just how hard that job is even before having to act at the same time,2023-07-12
"this why tom cruise is literally an actuaries nightmare 

that marketing plane stunt alone would keep seasoned professionals up at night",2023-07-12
i loved and hated it at the same time that they had the entering the train part off screen i love how all the action scenes in mi or any nolan film are grand and also groundednot just that they shoot it for real on camera the action design is very simple and realistic entering the train part is impossible to shoot at least in 2023its possible for a mcugreen screen or fast and furious over the top style films this makes mission impossible franchise special the surprise entry into the train was lit as fck,2023-07-13
ive watched the behind the scenes clip many times so i knew it was a ramp i just saw the movie and thought upon seeing the cliff that looks bumpyyet when ethan rides over it it was smooth as silk ,2023-07-12
exactly my feeling the bts was really thrilling and audacious but when i saw it in the movie i just thought how it was completely useless and had barely any effect to me i kinda felt bad that they spent months making this scene and it didn’t showcase much of anything,2023-07-12
yeah the behind the scenes was more intense than the movie lol,2023-07-14
yeah this has one of my questions in the movie where the  did paris come from was she just waiting to be on the top of the train for a long time,2023-07-17
i dont know the claustrophobic alley fight was great,2023-07-15
my feeling was that its just an awareness that hes ethan and tom not as young as he used to be the characters aging and cant rely on his fighting skills anymore,2023-07-23
eh i dont buy it he was very believable in the brief fight inside the party then outside the party then in the alleyway then on top of the train wait a minute what lack of fights are you even talking about,2023-09-09
is that a question,2023-10-22
"yeah hayley was basically the new girl and ilsa needed to die it was an odd decision to have them so close and not just  ilsa off in the beginning ilsa really didnt even do much so it felt like they were done with the character but kept her around for reasons

after the last film ended with julia basically giving her blessings to them it felt very odd",2023-07-16
"i felt like it also retroactively undermines her capability in mi5 we are introduced to an ilsa faust that is more or less equal to ethan hunt in terms of capability and agency and she keeps being incredibly capable in mi6 gabriels level of skill in mi7 isnt close to ethans when it came down to fighting one on one the audience wasnt even excpected to worry hes going beat ethan the stakes were whether or not ethan will control himself not to  him

and he kills ilsa with a knife in the time it takes ethan to run to them she didnt even try to pull any tricks that is much less fighting capability and agency than we know her to have

but other then that a great movie",2023-08-29
a contract dispute is exactly what it felt like pet theory is rebecca can’t actually stand tom they almost never did press together every one they do pegg is in between them and at one point she mentions getting shot down for a spin off and she had to realize where she fit in the mi universe after all that and her schedule filling up with dune and silo this felt inevitable still  me off though bc their on screen chemistry was so good,2023-07-19
i agree 100 i was also looking forward to seeing ilsa transaction into being part of the imf in this film i finally wanted to see her and ethan interact without a conflicting government objectives kind of plot line the end of fallout set her and ethan up to be a couple but the two characters barely had any meaningful interaction in this movie besides an extended hug,2023-11-07
her character was tied to lane from the previous 2 movies no need for her going forward,2023-07-17
that scene where he started popping in the train… 100 american those two had really good screen chemistry,2023-07-18
let’s go to a party,2023-07-19
briggs was very much the zenigata to ethan lupin’ complete with yellow fiat 500,2023-07-14
do you mean mose,2023-07-14
this feels like something that gamby would have said about ray on vice principals lol  but no shea whigham is the more rugged less goofy steve zahn,2023-07-14
he kind of looked like mike florio to me lol,2023-07-15
loved him in true detectiveacted the  out of the minor screen time he got,2023-07-12
slightly disappointed that he didn’t get any real scenes with hayley atwell would have been cute for fans of the agent carter series…,2023-07-12
he was great in perry mason,2023-07-12
i genuinely think he’s the best current character actor not counting legends who are mostly retired,2023-07-14
shea really stole the show in his scenes,2023-07-13
i knew i recognized him loved him ever since i saw him in splinter,2023-07-12
have you seen small engine repair all actors in it are great but shea absolutely steals every scene hes in,2023-07-18
"his eyes were sooo watery in this movie i was like “ how character actor is he gettin” 

either he hates his life for real or he used something",2023-07-27
personally i found it funny when he would disregard peoples personal freedoms and stuff i dont know it was funny,2023-07-15
youre watching a movie about an american superspy who doesnt answer to anyone who breaks off from his own superiors who constantly breaks the laws of multiple countries who routinely enters dangerous firefights or chases around people etc etc if you wanna do an acab thing go find another movie,2023-10-18
the intensity he brings to each scene is the highlight of this film,2023-07-14
yeah based on the marketing i thought he would be in cahoots with the entity,2023-07-16
i feel like i haven’t seen that guy in anything since the first movie he’s great and i love the way he speaks he is able to add such gravitas to a scene,2024-01-25
between the first mi and “clear and present danger” he cornered the market on “ cia bureaucrat” in the 90s,2023-07-24
facts,2023-07-16
i didnt follow his plot at the end tho was he evil a double agent his fellow agents looks surprised to see him there buying the key from criminals and he told them he wasnt supposed to be there  but then grace still trusts him at the end,2023-08-07
,2023-07-16
same opinion it felt cartoony at times,2023-07-24
that conversation made me half expect him to be jeremy renner undercover in a mask,2023-07-13
you’re a big ai,2023-07-12
what is this a reference to again ive seen this,2023-07-15
"no no no no no no

that joke only works on bad movies",2023-07-12
 ilsa died im sad,2023-07-12
"gabriel came off like such a viscous  but i originally thought maybe due to this past with ethan but no hes just an all around  the actor was amazing thought but yeah i really want him dead lol 

ethan backstory thing did feel like it came out of nowhere i get it its the seventh movie and they want to give him more depth but it just felt a little unnecessary at this point  hopefully well get more",2023-07-12
see what you mean but the teases of the backstory kinda heightens the events of this movie because you realise that history is repeating itself for ethan  it’s a little like keri russell’s death in 3 the two deaths of jim’s wife the potential death of julia even his desire to protect ilsa in the prior two films plus this one it kinda makes sense that ethan would have a backstory involving a woman he cares about dying they tease it enough in this film for it to serve it’s purpose and not distract too much from the main narrative do think that the next film should go into greater detail perhaps,2023-07-13
i agree with this the little 5second backstory clip didnt quite work for me as of yet i wont say its completely pointless until i see part 2 but i do hope they flesh it out more then because that is this movies biggest flaw,2023-07-15
i also don’t get why ethan was so into hayley atwell’s character from the start just gave off  mfr vibes if she were a dude or wasn’t insanely attractive he would’ve gotten rid of her from the jump,2023-07-13
should have been a nightmare or something ethan had in fallout or something it would have fit and it would have expanded gabriel a little bit,2023-07-15
i just assumed it was from a past movie i missed in that case severely underdeveloped,2023-07-13
the ai fanatic element of gabriel definitely grabbed me way more then the vague shared backstory with ethan,2023-07-16
at least make him phelps son or something felt really outta left field,2023-07-17
i haven’t seen any of the previous films so just assumed that flashback was from an earlier one and gabriel had appeared before if this was the first time he’s appeared yeah he is very underdeveloped,2023-07-17
we’re usually told that a villain in mi is capable but with gabriel we actually see it,2023-07-12
"hendricks in ghost protocol thought what he was doing was a necessary evil in order to ensure humanitys survival especially with that scene in india where he exclaims let there be peace on earth
well this was how i saw it ",2023-07-12
theyre definitely gonna have a deaged tom cruise for those flashbacks although i wonder if tom would be against it as itll show how much hes aged,2023-07-12
im hoping they do a solomon lane on him and make him more interesting in the next one,2023-07-12
the assisnian lady that gets super kicked out of the skyscraper was a better villian in ghost protocol,2023-07-12
maybe  have a chip in his head like he’s biomechanical and in love with or part of the entity or something,2023-07-16
i was high key disappointed he didnt use the same accent he had in ozark del was my favourite part of the show and his accent was a huge part of it it was a pleasure listening to him speak,2023-07-12

"core memorie of him and hhh vs the rock and stone cold and for their entrance they run out instead of walking just so badass so  hyped

",2023-10-11
but the ai can’t tell gabriel that the key will be switched like it can tell the future sometimes,2023-07-20
not really cause tom cruise actually did hang off the side of a plane and was fine whereas if someone fell off a moving train into that truck theyd be mush,2023-07-12
i mean even just in this movie he flys into the side of a train hard enough to crash through and eject a bad guy out the other side without turning into mush,2023-07-14
my problem was the timing if the fbi people hadn’t showed up he would have missed his shot are they implying the entity is so omniscient that it predicted that to the second that would be kind of interesting but then i see no way they would be able to actually fight it,2023-08-09
they showed that the watch had a direct connection to the entity so i think the idea was that it made the calculations for him and just gave him a countdown,2023-07-12
not only that specific car that specific spot of that specific car a few feet forward or backward and hes hitting the sides of the bin the hard metal sides,2023-07-12
its the algorithm,2023-07-12
could’ve been avoided if they showed him simply looking down the train path for a truck seeing it and jumping off instead of timing it magically,2023-07-12
if ethan didnt make the train hed just be up there dodging the lights and laying down in the tunnel thinking about his life choices,2023-07-16
the entity was connected to the watch timer  all it had to know was where gabriel was as the train approached the truck and how fast he was going from what elevation,2023-07-13
that would be another good move from entity,2023-07-12
"not gonna lie your entity’s play out sounds awesome to see in theaters

i want to see how they gonna do when ethan finally confronts entity",2023-07-13
i feel like the entity itself is better set up for a face turn than gabriel is,2023-07-14
my theory is that its luther who beats entity early on in the film benji and luther are arguing who could write the code to defeat this thing and they all kind of agree luther could it may explain why he was missing during the whole train sequence,2023-07-15
"did it

i dont remember that bit honestly im not surprised though  the film was pretty clumsy with its exposition",2023-07-12

that’s elizabeth debicki homie reasonable mistake though,2023-07-15
"you’re being downvoted but you are absolutely right rebecca ferguson had great development and agency in 5 and 6 annnnnnd now she’s again disavowed and on the run 

in this movie she was nothing more than a plot device to move ethan around and then to make him angry 

oh but don’t worry now we have hayley atwell’s character can’t have both of them that would be tooooo many women 

pom was fantastic but as you said spoke about… 100 words",2023-07-16
"firstly i will not suffer slander against poms character shes badass enough to make up for lack of dialogue

moreover theres a part two where her character is clearly meant to be more involved so not fair to judge the series on that

as for rebecca her character was relatively very good for three movies straight i dont think wasted is the word id use if thats not a good role then the bar is set too high

agreed though that her death was unceremonious predictable and unnecessary",2023-07-18
"yeah this legit  me off ilsa was the bestdeveloped female character in this whole series one of the strongest parts of the last two films only to be given a fake out death at the start then a real death in the middle and immediately replaced by hayley atwells wooden  in the very next scene

pom klementieff has no lines until the very end of the film and her lines are just plot exposition for ethan while she bleeds out being another female character hurt

this was baffling because she just pops up in the middle of the movie and works for gabriel becausereasons ethan spares her because shes hot so now shes a good guy this whole film felt like a massive step down from fallout",2023-07-22
yeah good for them for trying but we are kind of beyond baby steps at this point you should know how to include and write women,2023-07-17
this is a team sport here,2023-07-16
just look how badass halle berry could be as we witnessed in john wick she and her dogs fight scenes are cool there,2023-07-20

yes exactly,2023-07-22
hes clearly a troll account,2023-07-13
i honestly didn’t either im more into latina actresses though,2023-07-14
i thought kittridge wanted it for personal gain too but there is no way he could pay 100 million like that i guess he just wanted the united states to have it instead of germany russia,2023-07-18
my take on that was kittridge wanted it for the government initially that now can’t work so if ethan is going to go through with his side of things he better fully accomplish his mission so that gabriel doesn’t kittridge accepted that he can’t win,2023-07-19
i honestly thought that final monologue was going to end addressed to grace with her being inducted into the imf,2023-07-18
20 days late but i believe the ending messages is actually the continuation of the starting mission message he had for ethan the mission was always to destroy the ai,2023-08-05
" kittridge’s message for ethan at the end sounded like he was on ethan’s side because he was still talking to him like his mission

im confused by the fact that kittridge is presented as the cia director in this film so not imf but then ethan acts like hes the one who can get grace into imf",2023-11-13
probably have to wait for part 2 to know more,2024-01-25
no its jonas he went out and got corporate sponsors from twister,2023-07-16
couldn’t be that robin hood spoke with an english accent,2023-07-19
kittridge is basically doing exactly what he did in the very first movie he is there to close a deal with a less than reputable figure to secure an asset for the us government he is decidedly on the side of getting the entity under the control of the united states as far as we know,2023-07-13
was kittridge good in mi1,2023-07-29
i think there are two versions of the ai the one stuck in the sub is an earlier iteration that went a little rogue but is still mostly the original source code not sure why they assume its still alive in there and didnt delete itself but whatever the same program but a different iteration later escaped confinement and breached a machine learning database in saudi arabia and became the entity so theoretically whoever secures the hard drive in the sub would be able to make a link to american involvement as well as have an early source code to control the entity,2023-07-14
"none of the tech parts were meant to be serious it was all nonsensical technobabble

jj abrams was the best at handling macguffins in the series and not having you think or question it too much",2023-07-16
they said the entity left the clues it did in the beginning on purpose,2023-07-16
yeah they got him,2023-07-16
didnt benji also say ethan can hold his breath for 3 min in rogue nation,2023-07-16
they did setup luther to come in and save the day in part 2,2023-07-14
yeah less to do for the tech guys when all technology is compromised but it was nice benji came in with the save twice with the van and then the car,2023-07-13
i was so worried for him when he went after ethan in venice but i was worried for the wrong person ,2023-07-18
a big bushy beard,2023-07-15
my theater was packed and neither of those jokes landed at all it was dead silent the do you trust me line was the only joke that got some laughs,2023-07-13
oh  is that what that is im running ios17 and saw that feature but havent set it up,2023-07-15
the strikes were due to residuals ai replacement being paid for auditions many different things,2023-09-25
"it just seems so weird to me

like how would that conversation go imagine if you got an email from a sentient ai and it says it wants to help you go after an old enemy wouldn’t you think it was a weird scam or something i mean i can’t see how it works if the ai could somehow do a mind control thing eg there was some story about a chip in someone’s head that the ai could control in a person let’s say the military had developed some mind control tech that would be outlandish but at least be sort of logical 

and so this ai knows that ethan is trying to get the key but so are lots of other people so why isn’ going after all these other people too 

i really thought the script was shockingly awful in parts i’ve seen kids movies with more believable scenes some really tired lines as well ethan seeing gabriel at the party and saying “i should have killed you when i had the chance” the party was so silly to me it practically felt like parody the ai is a pulsing light 

there’s a lot that’s great about the movie the action the comedy some of the performances but the plot device was so silly ‘the entity’ is such a vacuous term they might as well just have called it ‘the macguffin’ i could have just about accepted it all if they hadn’t thrown gabriel in as we’ll because there is no way i can get my head around how he is connected to ‘the entity’ and why the  he would do it’s bidding",2023-07-15
i’m not even convinced it’s acting on its own instead of gabriel being the real mastermind behind its functions idk it seems too malevolent and sadistic to be acting as a selflearning super intelligence you don’t “leave your fingerprints” when you want to stay away from world government control and you don’t taunt a random spy group like that when you’re acting purely by logic plus the way gabriel was acting made it feel like his being subservient to “it” was all an act,2023-07-18
yes that’s right but how would that conversation with gabriel go how does the entity talk with gabriel why does gabriel go along with its plan it just seems so farfetched to me it would have made a bit more sense to me if gabriel was also in secret intelligence and so knew about the entity because he’s an inside and maybe contacted the entity himself or something otherwise to me it all seems so random,2023-07-19
i guess it just seems a bit ridiculous to me when he’s literally watching an army of people on typewriters,2023-07-18
the problem is they quickly built up an excellent idea for a movie then did a completely different movie for 2 hours then did the correct movie for 20 minutes at the end,2023-07-21
ok i still liked her way more than grace,2023-07-16
they dutched the  outta those angles,2023-07-13
got to looooove the dutch angle,2023-07-15
that  was so distracting the entire time all i could think of is are people going to praise this creative decision or will it age very poorly,2023-07-17
" dutch angles

agreed battlefield earth pulled it off spectacularly",2023-10-13
i kept waiting for the split diopter shots,2023-07-16
they really should have brought him back for the finale,2023-07-17
the scene with the government people explaining the ai in the beginning was easily one of the worst written scenes ive seen in a movie this year it felt so robotic and unnatural it was absolutely comical,2023-07-14
yeah agreed it was way overdone,2023-07-13
fallout is absolutely the best mi film ever,2023-07-15
fallout is easily one of the best action movies of all time,2023-07-20
i find it odd that people seemed to like fallout so much i thought it was a disappointment and pretty forgettable rogue nation is my choice for the best in the franchise after the first film fallout would be at the bottom right above 2,2023-07-19
action was great in this one but thought the plot was pretty dumb involving an entity that somehow controls everything but no one knows what it is,2023-07-22
people are complaining that action movie has action now the car chase was very entertaining ngl,2023-07-25
exactly how i felt about this one this is literally my favorite movie series and this one felt like they really put on the brakes minus the last half an hour on the train but i was put off by it for sure the past few movies each had multiple stand out action scenes and very memorable moments this one felt very tame really hoping part 2 goes back to the high octane feel like the last few,2023-07-18
fallout is actually the most forgettable and slightly anticlimatic for me somehow this one have me on the edge of the seat even with some of the cheesiness,2023-07-25
the flashback death also reminded me of shots of the mission falling apart in the original,2023-07-12
"wasnt it filmed during the lockdowns

edit yeah they actually started filming there in italy in february 2020 and had to put it on pause  really bad timing",2023-07-15
good catch,2023-07-13
in fallout there’s a blink and you miss it line when the white widow is first introduced at that event she mentions “my mother max”,2023-07-16
no  im just not sure if iconic is the right word not sure infamous is either now you say it,2023-07-25
actually very good point that was hgv and this is one coal burning mfer,2023-07-25
no it was not a bullet train but still gabriel obviously made it go faster than what would be acceptable for a person to be able to stand up without being blown away on a moving train,2023-07-14
"i think 2 is the standout but for different reasons as well 

does fallout stand out for the arm reload d",2023-07-23
"i feel like if they wanted to make it ambiguous they have ethan witness her die as she tumbles into the river or something

and they get rid of the first fakeout death from the opening as that made it more clear that they werent gonna keep her alive there was also zero purpose to ilsa faking her death there they could have said she escaped and the exact same things would have happened",2023-07-15
didn’t seem very ambiguous,2023-07-17
they were going to i saw an interview where he said he was going to be killed at the beginning of fallout so he declined to come back,2023-07-20
fallout bathroom fight scene is the best being winded by the asian dude,2023-07-12
and benji questions whether hunt is fit enough to drive because he was just dead and hunt replies what are you talking about,2023-07-13
thats what i love about this franchise sometimes the gadgets dont work characters completely biff a stunt or drive into a  wall on accident it really helps set it apart from james bond,2023-07-14
"are you sure youre okay to drive  a minute ago you were dead

what are you talking about",2023-07-15
that scene was  hilarious especially with the mi theme playing as he slid but then abruptly stopping when he falls off and then the confused what are you talking about as benji mentions he was dead just a minute ago,2023-07-18
this is what i love about these films  tom like all people probably has an ego but not rock level ego  he knows what makes a good film and is happy to show himself be not the best at times eg disoriented to make a better scene,2023-07-19
winded slightly dazed ethan hunt is my favourite when he’s trying to get into the plane in 5 i think and benji opens the door and he just  ragdolls against the frame the face he makes after that is incredible,2023-07-16
they do a great job in the mission impossible movies of going “look at the insane thing ethan just did ope still a regular dude though” by showing him struggle after a hit like that,2023-07-19
"a minute ago you were just dead

what",2023-07-16
it happened to grace in the venice chase scene too when she got rammed by the police truck she was all disorientated and  injuries are a serious thing people,2023-10-19
"are you okay

oh man she looked so scared",2023-07-14
i mean he definitely doesnt  hes 100x better than a normal person who would splat against the side of the mountain they just dont make him some demigod invincible man which for me makes him a more likable character,2023-07-13
i mean hes still insanely op they just show him get dazed every once in a while,2023-07-17
im working on it,2023-07-13
whats the plan phil,2023-07-14
no the dude tom hit was holding the key grace places it on the table then the dude picks it up the brother then tells the guy to  grace and thats when ethan crashes in,2023-07-12
she put it on the table and he picked it up before getting kicked through the window,2023-07-12
that wasnt a henchman no i thought that was zola and he only hit him against the wall and knocked him out,2023-07-14
theyre not from alabama,2023-07-18
you noticed that too,2023-07-16
i swear they showed they had colored contact lenses in one of the previous movies—either 3 or 4 i think  im not sure why they werent utilized here,2023-07-17
he was suspicious but not enough until it was too late,2023-07-16
nobodys implying it was a production mistake i think they just were saying there isnt a good inuniverse explanation for it this detail is only for the viewers not the characters,2023-07-17
to be fair it does show ethan wearing some kinda of pad shirt when he was getting ready and making the mask in mi3,2023-07-19
"the airport scene was so hard to watch from a wiring perspective im sorry but vingh raimes sorry spell check is not a computer wizardriddle mastersuper hacking genius 

and the scene in the beginning in the room with all the exposition from the ciagovernment guys was bad had some of the worst hollywood™ writing to describe the ai and the threats that it posed 

overall i liked the movie but i think it was honestly the worst of the new mi movies ghost nation and onward",2024-02-02
shes british if you grow up poor in the streets there youre going to be a million times better at shanking than driving,2023-07-18
"oh come on it make zero sense for her to walk up to gabriel for that fight on the bridge in the first place   

he literally just told her she was one of two people that were going to die

why the  would you walk up to fight that man rather than oh i dont know   keep running in the other direction

make zero sense for her to confront gabriel at that point  

the movie just needed to have a  fight scene  
terrible writting",2023-07-22
the white face paint was an awesome look like waaaaay too badass for even this film she was awesome i was so glad they obviously chickened out of killing her at the last second ,2023-07-12

weirdly enough i think rebecca wearing that eye patch did something for me as well,2023-07-16
pom in clown makeup with a marching band outfit was also out of this world,2023-07-24

there is probably a disturbing subreddit for that full of creeps,2023-07-12
genuinely shocked your comment history isn’t rife with  after this comment,2023-07-17
she could be in the part 2 cast so that her death didn’t get spoiled either that or some throwback scenes,2023-07-12
"i think its more likely that ethan is purposefully taking her off the chess board so that the entity cant plan for her in the next movie  i have a few thoughts as to why

1 there really isnt an emotional scene after it happens i dont believe ethan would casually go into planning after one of his best friends dies
2 they did a death fake out earlier i think its setting up that ethan knows that they can use this trick
3 usually as a narrative convention youre supposed to have the abyss be in the end of the second act and this happened in whats arguably the first act this is a 2 parter
4 shes cast in the next movie",2023-07-13
agreed her death felt so random  just disrespectful to her character i liked ethan  grace together but are we just supposed to forget about ilsa  ship the new pair nope its cheap im really hoping that ilsa turns out to be alive in mi8 otherwise im gonna end up hating an otherwise wonderful part 7probably 8 too,2023-07-12
was it me or did they purposely make her look sickly for this movie  like when she was hiding in the desert she was clearly tired and dehydrated but when she shows up later she still looks like she hasnt slept for a year,2023-07-15
there were moments where she definitely looked a bit suspicious like when gabriel was trying to make hunt choose between her and grace she straight up had a sort of evil smirk at one point although that could just have been her expression at hearing something unpleasant,2023-07-16
there is one shot in the film during the discussion that shows gabriels switchblades sitting on the table then there is another shot when ilsa picks up the sword which is right next to the knives in a film that is full of pickpocketing and sleight of hand im fully expecting to find out that they switched the switchblades and she isnt dead,2023-07-14
they never covered how her half of the key went from dead russian submariners to her hands so i’m guessing a good chunk of pt 2 will be her side of the story and the journey of the other half of the key,2023-07-16

"the pacing and editing really killed a lot of my hype the script has no confidence in the viewers ability to remember things so it constantly reminds us who all the players are and what pieces they have 

people have talked about editing in other posts but the weirdest for me was the car chase they intentionally ripped the doors off but instead of a lot of tight shots showing us its actually the actors we just get head on shots they may as well have used a green screen for",2023-07-13
" action as usual was fantastic 

i don’t know how anyone can say this with a straight face when comparing the fights and shaky editing in this movie to mi4 mi5 or especially mi6",2023-07-14
what was with the dialogue when they first got in the fiat and he apologized for pushing buttons that scene felt weird,2023-07-14
i agree it was hard to shake this feeling while watching and it was frustrating given how incredibly staged the film was otherwise,2023-07-15
no i mean firing a gun on a movie train is literally asking for trouble since theres only two directions and everyone just heard you fire a gun course it didnt really matter in the end but its just best practice to not shoot when you dont have to unless of course he did say shoot her in which case im dead wrong and he was just an idiot,2023-07-15
when the widows goons are chasing grace in the train before ethan pulls his leroy jenkins move,2023-07-15
i agree they should have picked either the director of intelligence or kitrich to be on the train having both got slightly confusing in trying to understand who is on what side,2023-07-12
i watched the movie with my elderly parents who have no idea what ai is they didnt understand that aspect but loved the movie nonetheless,2023-07-12
"it wasn’t that hard to follow  the only confusing part is the motivations across all of the characters  the scenario is fairly simple  there’s a super advanced ai program  the us sabotaged it  that act caused the ai to go rogue  now everyone wants the ai under their control

 is the cia director evil  no he’s just buying the key so the us government can have it instead of anyone else

 is the national intelligence director evil  yes he led the sabotage and wants the ai under his control for world dominance

 is the entity evil  presumably but it seems to be operating in self defence at the moment  the real threat is it landing in the hands of a malicious controller

 is gabriel evil  yes he’s a willing tool to the ai happy to  for it so that it can remain “free”

 is ethan evil  no he’s the only one trying to destroy the program rather than have it handed over to anyone",2023-07-16
i lost track of who had which part of the key when maybe i’m in the minority,2023-07-13
yeah i got a little confused in the nightclub since it seemed like there was at least a halfdozen sides in that conversation ,2023-07-13
my friends and i were chatting afterwards and we think we missed how the ai got on the sub could someone explain that for me,2023-08-04
"nah i felt it was quite light  there was just enough exposition about the ai then back to the action 

fallout felt more convoluted with its twists",2023-07-15
the story is super simplicistic and  lol,2023-07-13
not complex at all,2023-07-18
thats how i see it the ai knows what its vulnerability is and it calculates what sequence of actions gives it the highest probability of success maybe the entity was going to take both key halves in the party but had to change plans based on what had happened in the past 12 days,2023-07-12
i think it was looking into all the databases for leverage just like how it knows that italian police captain steals stuff you can make people do a lot of stuff for you if you push the right buttons,2023-07-13
what’s the book series,2023-07-13
what book,2023-07-16
yeah regardless of who gets their hands on the key it is not good for the entity,2023-07-16
not exactly that but i see the point youre making in the matrix the ai has already won the war and controls everything whereas here the entity has not done so yet and we dont know why they just say it has acquired data from everywhere,2023-07-12
how exactly,2023-07-18
"how is it killing everyone they literally say at the start of the movie that the ai is doing nothing atm and the only thing it is seen to be doing is trying to retrieve the key

ethan is having to fight humans and ai to get the key 

that makes the conflict different from a skynet i robot or an ultron type situation where the ai is the all powerful entity that plucky humans are fighting",2023-07-19
when she cuddles into him on the balcony yeah my heart melted at that bit,2023-07-16
me too in a movie with many amazing sequences that small bit was my favourite,2023-07-14
this is what amazing subtext looks like  this franchise is at its best when it doesn’t underestimate the audiences intelligence,2023-07-16
i was so duped i should’ve known they wouldn’t let them be happy,2023-07-19
that was very sweet which made it all the more baffling that ethan basically threw her aside for grace before she was even dead such a strange forced choice,2023-07-15
"“they’re called the imf”

“international monetary fund”

“no impossible mission force”

“”",2023-07-27
definitely agree about the 11 fight it was weak like grace was holding her own in their fight i get the impression that ilsa is a vastly superior combat trained agent if grace can put up that much of a fight against gabriel then ilsa should just wipe the floor with him,2023-07-12
the bigger issue is how well grace holds her own against grabriel but somehow ilsa loses to him despite having a weapon advantage ilsa should be like ethan power level i know judging characters this way is silly and super hero like but it just really bumps up against your internal consistency meter and especially so when it’s such a beloved and important character,2023-07-12
totally agree just write her off without bringing her back sort of like they did with michelle monaghan but also reintroduced her,2023-07-12
we call that fridging,2023-07-12
"this is what’s been bugging me about the movie

like yeah this is the tom cruise show but allowing him to share the limelight with another counterpart made these movies feel less self indulgent

now you’ve got hayley atwell stepping up to the plate but it just feels like the franchise isn’t allowed to have two female leads as far as mi is concerned there can only be one",2023-07-12
"i didnt mind her dying per se but i didnt like how they were almost filling her position with atwell before she was even dead

at one point hunt is given the choice of which of the two would have to die like my dude one is your quasigirlfriend the other is a chick you met 1 day ago who keeps stealing from you and left you to get hit by a train are you kidding me with the hesitation on this",2023-07-12
"it’s not even the story of this movie it cheapens it cheapens a good bit of 5 and 6 what’s the point of developing another love interest for ethan that he gains super amazing chemistry with has her gain a sort of “approval” from julia then just killing her off in a super unsatisfactory way while having ethan flirting with the new female in the story

i could definitely see them bringing her back in some way in part 2 and i will probably be  if they don’t",2023-07-12
she was fridged,2023-07-12
"i wholeheartedly agree with this cheapens the story i hated and knew she was going to die didnt we all but to a have it occur just as we realize she wasnt dead all along and b as you said just to give ethan a reason to be extra mad at his former mentorwith such a short almost meaningless way felt like  plus she had been growing on us as an audience and growing with the imf team saving benji from fallout at the end really strengthened that imo there was no grieving scene no way for us to process her loss it felt akin to a death of a red shirt crew of star trek oh hes dead oh well so what moving on

i gotta wonder if her death  and hayley atwells intro to the fold  was a sort of passing the torch perhaps rebecca ferguson wanting to retire from the series",2023-07-14
"it doesnt help too that mcquarrie is doing a really awful job directing emotional scene he is a great action director but the way they just brushed off a major death like ilsa akin to so that happened and just move on to preparing for next set piece just felt wrong

im sure part 2 will be awesome spectacular entry that will certainly lifting mi to be one of the best action franchise ever but  this part really dropped the ball",2023-07-12
"if they wanted to use a death to give him motivation  luther or benji using a woman for that purpose is just gross and i’m so frustrated and disappointed that this franchise did something so lazy and trite 

would it really be that horrible if the main team was 2 men 2 women or even 3 men and two women

main woman from 2 needed to be rescued never seen again 
main woman from 3 needed to be rescued seen again for a hot minute and shown to have grown 
main woman from 4 never seen again 
main woman from 5 strong agency and growth but still needed to be rescued seen again as 
main woman from 6 great growth but still needed to be rescued ended the movie with a clean slate and then seen again as 
main woman from 7 needed to be rescued died as a plot device 
other main woman from 7 needed to be rescued over and over and over but also displayed strength growth and agency",2023-07-16
ya that annoyed me toobut i like how luther put it she chose to sacrifice herself so that grace could live with the odds against them she chose the only option that was for the greater good,2023-07-13
"that’s how i felt too ilsa is such a good character it felt lame to  her off just to add to ethan’s motives against gabriel especially when i didn’t have reason to really buy that gabriel could  ilsa based on how badass she’s been in the last two movies

i wonder if her dune schedule made her not available for the whole movie here and that was also part of it",2023-07-17
yeah it was really lame,2023-07-13
it almost felt to me that they wrote her out now that they have atwell as her female replacement in the group that may not have been the thinking but it kind of came across that way by the end,2023-07-12
i agree  i absolutely loathe when writers use a woman’s suffering or death only to highlight the effect on a man ilsa deserved better which is why i hope she is still alive,2023-07-15
"this film has a huge fridging problem it establishes the villains relation to ethan with a flashback of him killing a woman ethan loves then the whole venice scene is built around which of the two women will be killed to motivate ethan and ends with ilsa being killed

then for good measure gabriel also stabs his own female henchwoman because of the mild mercy that ethan showed her

for a movie with a story about an all powerful rogue ai almost all the suspense is eerily focused on whether the next female character will be killed or not",2023-07-14
"to be fair gabriel was fighting on ilsa on a stationary stone bridge whereas he was fighting ethan on a moving train which we know ethan has experience with whereas gabriel probably doesn’t nor do i think the fight was as onesided on the train as you claim 

i don’t think ilsa’s death was emotionally impactful for the audience but i do appreciate how they went for it i can’t think off the top of my head another main character that the franchise has chosen to  off maybe the secretary in fallout but i wouldn’t consider him a main character like ilsa",2023-07-13
killing any character in any movie is almost always used to fuel growth or add some motivation for the main character thats not cheap its just how stories work and she did get a sacrifice play so i wouldnt call it totally pathetic also gabriel got away in the end so hes clearly not a complete loser,2023-07-12
she killed the bone doctor but couldn’t handle a 60 year old man,2023-07-23
it wouldve felt better if she had maybe like  had more screentime in fallout for sure she was actually pregnant during that filming and was supposed to have more but i think what they did was appropriate and natural its certainly not a fridging,2023-07-13
" just died in a random fight against a villain who ethan just obliterated in the end 

it wasnt random it was against the main villain and ethan is just the better fighter",2023-07-12
"she has to die we have to believe the predictions from the ai are almost always correct otherwise it isnt a mission impossible grade task to defeat it also capable heroes need to die if the threat of death is to stay real

agree the fight could have been better",2023-07-16
agreed it was a very meh sendoff,2023-07-14
"excuse me how does fridging apply here

all the female characters in all of mission impossibles history were portrayed as more than capable no exception even the thieving pick pocketer put up a fight against a trained agent hunt was barely able to take him down on the train later on

you cant just call it fridging because a female character lost a fight",2023-07-14
you do you i was hooked from that moment on,2023-07-12
i think unfortunately she is gone i wonder if ferguson wanted out because it felt so forced,2023-07-13
she doesn’t need to have a big part just show up in the climax to save ethan in the nick of time and have a little dialogue at the end also if it’s not done already nobody has  coming out unfortunately,2023-07-16
that and atwell getting in the car accident without a scratch were the most distracting,2023-07-14
not to mention everyone who gets stabbed in this movie is in the exact same spot and im not a doctor but it seems like an oddly high spot to just be a definite  spot but thats just my thinking,2023-07-16
its even more jarring that they gave zola a busted eyebrow but nothing on anyone else,2023-07-17
cuz he didnt hit her with it,2023-07-13
“reggie ray the doctor said you only have 2 concessions left in you”,2023-07-14
i was so looking forward to the fight on top of the train but every punch had about 3 cuts i loved it but im just kinda disappointed at the amount of cuts especially in that alleyway i honestly couldnt see who was fighting who during that scene,2023-07-12
yup the bathroom fight had the same amount of people but better flow and pacing,2023-07-12
also note dead reckoning had huge production issues with covid so the fact they still made a high quality movie is still impressive,2023-07-12
yup it was also when they realized the full threat of the ai,2023-07-21
i’m realizing i need to rewatch all the movies,2023-07-17
i really liked the villain in rn too he was really ominous and felt like a serious accomplishment when they finally got him in that glass box,2023-07-14
"you can thank robert elswit for that

master cinematographer behind a bunch of paul thomas andersons films including there will be blood maybe the single bestshot movie of the 2000s",2023-07-15
love that one 3 also,2024-01-25
"i think he meant rogue nation is the best chris mcquarrie mi film not the best mi film overall

but it’s also not weird that people put fallout on a pedestal that film has objectively the best string of action sequences in any mi film it’s fine if someone likes another one better than fallout but people love fallout for good reason including me",2023-07-13
ghost protocol is the right answer  holds up to many rewatchings which hasn’t been true of fallout for me,2023-07-24
i think part of the reason is because other than henry cavill and philp seymour hoffman the franchise is lacking in memorable villains,2023-07-15
yeahwell that’s like…your opinion man,2023-07-14
thats an asinine take,2023-07-13
what is your top 3,2023-07-13
"i agree 

every single one is a mood moment there are scenes in every movie that have only bend done once in which if i want to watch that scene i have to watch that movie

mi3 is the only one that did a “show the end at the beginning trope” it also introduces benji and has the vatican scene and the bridge scene and just so much to love 

ghost protocol has the prison break the kremlin scene of course the burj kalifa scene

rogue nation has the twist opening where ethan gets gassed plus the plane scene from the beginning the underwater scene the awesome motorcycle chase 

fallout is just set piece after set piece amazing action rooftop chase the hospital scene at the beginning etc

every movie does both super original action set pieces while also having iconic tropes 

each movie is like “which set piece do i want to watch” but the movies are so good that i’m not just gonna go on youtube to see that set piece in isolation i like watching the whole movie for that set piece 

the only one i haven’t rewatched is mi2 but even that movie has some great scenes",2023-07-18
they looked like similar stab wounds too,2023-07-12
and she was bleeding out for who knows how long,2023-07-12
i expect more grief from ethan if she did die and someone needs to fill in the gap in their relationship between the end of fallout and the desert scene im almost expecting that ethan knew where she was the whole time and only came to her aid when he learned about the bounty hunters wishful thinking,2023-07-13
" it made the train scene even more intense because they were moments where i genuinely thought that grace was going to die

really i feel like by then i was very aware that they wouldn’t  the new british white woman who was clearly out here to replace the previous british white woman

i would’ve respected the  out of this movie if grace had died too",2023-07-14
it didn’t feel like ethan moved on at all what are you taking about his whole scene talking to grace after that you could feel his pain and anger about losing ilsa he just wasn’t saying the words i’m angry and sad that i lost her the way he spoke to grave made it very apparent he was still mourning ilsa and would make up for it by not letting anything happen to her there’s a whole scene where luther begs ethan not to  gabriel because ethan is still so angry about losing ilsa then ethan tries to  him anyways because he’s still so distraught from losing her he never moved on,2023-07-18
yeah like shes probably really busy with silo and dune 2 but i do hope she comes back seeing how much development ilsas had since rogue nation plus i dont get why they barely talked about her after her death it honestly made her feel like a bond girl instead of a character thats been here for the past 3 iterations,2023-07-29
plus they barely gave her lines in this one felt like she deserved more,2023-07-12
with the mask tech and the ais omnipotence she could always return as a villain,2023-07-17
then why would he have a flashback to her lifeless body when he was thinking about the women hes gotten killed,2023-07-12
no the fight that will occour in the end of part 2 the one where i imagine that ethan will actually  gabriel,2023-07-13
the opening title scene for fallout still gets me hyped for the movies,2023-07-12
i saw fallout in normal theatres once then went to see it in imax the next just for the helicopter chase scene,2023-07-15
sorry im 13 days late to the party but i totally agree with you and rogue nation is awesome too mi56 are gems,2023-07-25
kinda hard to match a movie that has a halo jump from an airplane sequence along with a bathroom brawl w henry cavill reloading his biceps,2023-07-12
man the halo jump scene the fight on the cliffs the soundtrack fallout is really hands down the best one in the series for me,2023-07-18
that’s interesting fallout is  number 4 for me,2023-07-13
it alright but hasnt aged well ghost protocol is superior,2023-07-12
that’s really the problem with part one we can talk all day about the problems with the story in this film but in the end we can’t really judge until part two comes out we are missing half of the story,2023-07-13
man idk i love rogue nation possibly more than fallout but dead reckoning felt absolutely nothing like either of them,2023-07-13
feel absolutely the same,2023-07-13
how so,2023-07-31
happy birthday to you both,2023-07-12
also my birthday  free slurpee day,2023-07-12
same here was so hyped the last time i remember a movie coming out on my our birthday that i cared about was dawn of the planet of the apes,2023-07-12
"hey bro can i get some of that copium too

also grace was so annoying the whole movie she just went on to complicate things the whole movie like a unspanked child",2023-10-13
exactly what it says it’s hard to justify why her death was even needed to the story,2023-07-16
they just follow the lane markings on the road self driving isnt following online maps,2023-07-12
in the context of mission impossible im guessing they have the tech where unlike most self driving cars it can navigate itself and probably has all the maps it needs downloaded into its storage,2023-07-12
do people really need an explanation for every little minor thing this is supposed to be the most elite government agency how do you know the laptop doesnt have all the world maps downloaded on it this is c mcquarrie were talking about if were thinking about it he already has,2023-07-14
yeah did they even mention where renners character was this movie,2023-07-12
"in jeremy renners case when he had scheduling conflicts with the mcu they offered him a choice between not being in fallout at all or being in it and dying early on he chose to not be in it but if ferguson decided shed rather get an onscreen sendoff

its also still possible it was a fakeout but as i said well see",2023-07-12
i wish paula patton was in this she has so much  charisma,2023-07-16
and angela bassett all she got was a framed image implying that she was dead what the  mcq,2023-07-12
i really loved renner’s presence i’m at peace with the fact that he’s not coming back given that the last two films didn’t need him to be so great but man it would be cool to see him again,2023-07-15
the first dune movie didnt conflict with dead reckoning  it finished filming in 2019 before dead reckoning filming began and she was actually cast in dune before the new mission impossible movies were announced but then when it came to filming part 2 covid  up all the scheduling dead reckoning part 2 was originally scheduled for release in 2022 so if everything had gone as originally planned she would probably have been finished with both mi movies by the time she was needed for dune part 2 but of course it didnt work out that way so dune 2 and dead reckoning 2 ended up filming simultaneously,2023-07-12
just because we want her to be in it forever doesnt mean she wants to be in mi forever maybe shes given ten years and just wants to do something else,2023-07-12
the whole movie was meta in some good ways and some bad ways,2023-07-15
yeah i was really expecting some sort of payoff to that whole story thread they kept building that part of him up and at the end the critical moment they go “yep” and he jumps off into the sunset just felt odd,2023-07-16
i feel like there are a lot of parallels between mi and 007 and this is definitely one of them,2023-07-19
it didn’t feel at all like a love interest situation with him and hayley personally i think it’s wholly dependent on the next movie and if that film hooks them up hopefully no,2023-07-13
it’s called lampshading we’re gonna write this thing happening but let’s have characters acknowledge it so it’s not so jarring,2023-07-17
in fairness isla betrays ethan every other scene in rogue nation it is kind of thing throughout her entire intro movie,2023-07-13
i felt that way too until he pointed out that grace knew where the other key was so it kind of evened them out a bit,2023-07-13
but ilsa betrayed ethan a ton of times too lol,2023-07-14
idk with ethans history to me it didnt really seem like an easy choice as hilarious as that sounds mans a playa,2023-07-15
it wasnt even just in fallout  it was in rogue nation and was a huge part of why he was interested in ilsa he didnt even know her but he wanted to help her,2023-07-12
exactly its just in his nature to want to save everybody and while grace put herself in peril she obviously didnt know what she was getting involved in and ethan felt he still had to protect her,2023-07-12
same as miles morales such an amazing coincidence how both movies come out during the summer with the protagonists sharing the same morals and the movies being a part one,2023-07-12
i dont think he would save a single life rather than 1000 if he really had to choose its just that he refuses to choose and tries to save everyone kind of like spiderman he just always succeeds so hes never had to actually make that choice i thought fallout would be about that choice having to be made but he just ethan hunted his way out of it again,2023-07-12
" they even did a thing about it in fallout

 the female french cop he stopped from being shot dead",2023-07-13
"he values everyone else’s life more than his own and he values a single life more than the greater good

i actually love this about his character and just as a philosophical examination generally 

theres so many films that are like for the greater good for the greater good 

and his character is like well actually one innocent whether i know them or not is worth everything 

and i love how so much of the series is about friendship 

fast conquered family and mission impossible conquered friendship 

when they stopped having women be the sole love interest the series got really really good",2023-07-14
"people forget he gave his own oxygen tank and risked his life to save henry cavill in the last mi

although to be fair henry is more beautiful than the whole mi cast put together",2023-07-12
"he couldnt  poms character in that tiny alley way even though he was in the process of stopping graceilsa from dying

and you see the frustration when he bangs the pipe over her head i couldve killed you now killed any moment this entire time but rather you lived even though it had cost me so much precious precious precious time",2023-07-14
and part of that may come from the death we see in flashbacks as well as the deaths of his entire team in the first movie i can see why a person would wanna avoid that kind of personal guilt as often as he could,2023-07-16
this its all over this movie i especially liked him saving the super intense imf agent chasing him on the top of the train ethan cares more about the entire world than himself so if they brought up a random from the party he wouldve reacted the same way,2023-07-14
and the fact of the matter is that hes usually able to save his friends lives and still complete the mission basically overcoming the impossible choice between the two,2023-07-18
he’s the antijack bauer,2023-07-18
i hope so it’s the only way that would satisfy the lack of mourning or acknowledgment of the death,2023-07-12
rebecca ferguson is not credited for part two but pom klementieff is make of that what you will,2023-07-12
i mean they haven’t been disposable anymore for about a decade until mi7 went and  that up,2023-07-14
isn’t she also leading an apple tv show,2023-07-16
they definitely make the one life theme clear in the movies it just doesn’t feel right that if the idea of losing one person drives ethan to do such extreme measures than when he actually looses someone as important to ilsa it should be devastating,2023-07-12
i think theres a sense that ilsa knows the lifeanddeath stakes and has been in spycraft for years its the job as they say repeatedly throughout the series grace is a 3rd party thief who gets swept up in this global conspiracy and is more or less a civilian i think back to fallout and the cop who gets shot outside the garage ethan puts every individuals life on equal footing,2023-07-12
exactly lol,2023-07-12
something has to be off another factor is that the film kind of feels like were starting off with the characters already on a mission we as the audience are being introduced but they seem as if they are already on mission,2023-07-14
needing a totally off the grid agent to fight the ai ,2023-07-12
who would give up being part of one of the biggest movie franchises for an apple tv series,2023-07-12
"as much as i like benji i wouldve preferred that over what happened ilsa was one of the most intriguing subtly idiosyncratic characters in the entire franchise and they fridged her only to introduce her own replacement in the same movie rebecca fergusons onscreen chemistry with tom cruise and her physical acting are lightning in a bottle and they just threw the bottle out to replace it with another this is not a knock against hayley atwell or her character i just cant help the female characters arcs leaving a bad taste in my mouth 

there is obviously still an enormous chasm between the two characters but in this movie it really felt like ethan hunt was moving a a bit in the same direction as dominic toretto hes the center of everything is impossibly awesome and they always have leading ladies at their side who are constantly impressed with them even if theyre not strictly romantically linked it would be one thing if graces kindred connection to the team was through benji or luther or something else but yet another woman whose fate is inexorably linked to ethan feels so tacky between the lack of substance ilsa was given this movie and the similar purposes that grace serves to ethans character this feels like a true fridging

i dont know maybe im reading too much into it and if ever a series deserves the benefit of the doubt its this one id love to hear a womans take on this",2023-07-12
"i dont think he meant old as in age especially considering atwell is actually two years older than ferguson

i think he mean fresh characters",2023-07-12
that’s the problem with gabriel he had plot armour and plot fighting skills when the script required him to be a certain way he was that way that dude would not have beaten paris or ilsa very inconsistent character great movie but they dropped the ball with the villain,2023-07-12
ilsa was for sure stabbed with grace’s switchblade i’m pretty sure those knives were designed to retract when stabbed grace was always meant to let herself get disarmed so that gabriel would then use the fake knife to stab ilsa,2023-07-13
   the movie tells you that one of them will die and then that happens how is that contrived,2023-07-16
more surprised by the lack of ceremony than the fact that it happened felt to me like it pretty grossly underserved her character,2023-07-12
think people are just in denial because she was an awesome character it is sad that the mission series writes out the female characters like that,2023-07-12
wasnt out of the blue but personally it felt like them replacing her i guess her story ran its course,2023-07-12
where she have never show full breast to my knowledge,2023-08-21
when she kills the harkonnens and really shows how insanely powerful she is and its from paul’s perspective and you can tell thats he has never seen her like this and he is also afraid…that was just phenomenal,2023-07-17
"rewatching she’s my favorite character of the series

as much as i love benji and luther i’d have much rather one of them died would have set the stakes while not backtracking on things between isla and ethan 5 and 6 set up",2023-07-12
mainly because her dying makes 5 and 6 a little worse and there are a few clues that could point to her still being alive,2023-07-15
hah glad you said that because she is definitely the draw to the show for me ill check it out thanks,2023-07-16
i absolutely love the scene where ethan hunt followed her through the trail of dented cars,2023-07-12
the most accurate part is the driver blaming the parked cars lol,2023-07-12
especially after fast 9’s take on driving through that same area,2023-07-12
i liked that we had a references to all of tomorrow never dies for your eyes only and octopussy in the movie,2023-07-13
reminds me of how iconic the avengers theme became only for elfman to fully abandon it in age of ultron aside from one minor moment,2023-07-12
see that would’ve been great but unfortunately…we have balfe,2023-07-16
"pretty sure klementieff is coming back in part 2 “she’s got a pulse”



i really liked her laughing her  off in rome when she drove through half the city lol",2023-07-12
kirbys eyes  she can burn a hole right through you love her scenes  she plays the role so well,2023-07-12
kirby should be a star i’m not sure why it hasn’t happened yet i think she was the best part of hobbes  shaw as well,2023-07-12
kirby playing atwell was a sight to see i believed it,2023-07-12
"vanessa kirby is awesome and i wish she had a little more screen time in this one

one thing i always forget because im an idiot is that when a character is wearing a mask its still the other actor playing those scenes like duh but i catch myself remembering oh right this is philip seymour hoffman playing tom cruise pretending to be philip seymour hoffman",2023-07-12
" shes great but she felt slightly underused

a lot of her role are like that",2023-07-12
there’s no mission impossible 2 if i recall really weird how they just went from 1 to 3…,2023-07-12
aw i did it on desktop i’m gonna go do it on the app,2023-07-12
what i didn’t see this happen at all i’m on the iphone app does it work if you do it again,2023-07-12
thx,2023-07-15
point taken but ferguson is actually younger than atwell,2023-07-12
im not even a mission impossible fan this was the first movie i watched because i went with friends and i had to ask them do they always  off the current girlfriend for the new one because it was so weird to me,2023-07-21
yes the dialogue was strange in this one mission impossible films were always a little cheesy but the dialogue and line delivery for this one in certain spots was very strange even for an m i film i can’t put my finger on why,2023-07-13
yeah especially some line delivery from cary elwes was weird,2023-07-13
that should have been 2 minutes  then the room gets gassed,2023-07-12
holy  the government debrief 10 straight minutes of stonefaced government people trying to sound as serious as possible while explaining the entire plot of the movie it was so weird and somehow overthetop despite trying to be serious,2023-07-13
felt very comic book like tbh it was enjoyable but fallout was so much better,2023-07-12
three lines that were all the fifth sentence of someone else’s thought,2023-07-15
harley quinn  villain dragging the pipe down the wall,2023-07-14
i wonder if part of that had to do with abrams not being involved,2023-07-12
i liked the party but felt like the train went on for way too long especially since it didn’t feel like there were any big status quo changes gabriel escapes grace joins imf like they said she was going to already and the changes like taking the key and learning about the sevastopol could have easily been included in the party,2023-08-09
my whole country isnt like that usually in movies you dont make lots of loud distracting noises at action set pieces,2023-07-15
"oh i know and in rogue nation he and benji flipped that car 6 times and left unscathed 

my issue isnt that he was unhurt by crashing through the side of a metal train 
its that he did it at the exact moment and at the exact portion of the train needed to save grace from being shot and then played it off as it being accidental",2023-07-12
he didnt have to remove the pin at the same time just before they cut so they waited until the last moment,2023-07-30
the unedited shot from one of the trailers looked good enough to me,2023-07-12
finally someone i can agree with my husband and i kept saying  was this train thing done in bond just recently…,2023-07-16
young indy and 45 indy  two weeks in a row with big train sequences in long running franchises,2023-07-12
and sherlock holmes and watson,2023-07-12
apparently that’s the exact same place they filmed that young indy scene too,2023-07-14
oh wow i guess i completely missed that thanks,2023-07-16
hopefully you were sitting in the very back row by yourself,2023-07-12
this would explain what happened at my theater we saw a promo image bob marley trailer and behind the scenes features,2023-07-12
the clip i wouldnt call it a trailer  it was a behind the scenes reel they showed right before the film had voiceover narration about how ethan and grace were going to be handcuffed together during the car chase and showed the clip of the yellow fiat launching out from behind the sports car and even talked about how it was a supercharged electric fiat completely spoiled that sequence why show this to a group of people who are in the theater about to watch this specific movie,2023-07-12
i don’t mind a stunt being in the trailer lol my question was why were they playing a trailer for the actual movie we were about to see before the same movie,2023-07-12
not weird simply honouring the franchises roots,2023-07-12
i know cruise has said he wants to keep doing mi films for as long as he can but this and the next part feel to me like the ending of the franchise so i thought all of the little touches they had evoking the original film were tributes in a coming full circle kind of way,2023-07-12
the whole movie is a remake of the first film,2023-07-15
i was going crazy during the early cia scene where it’s cutting from one person to another waaaaay too quickly i just haven’t seen anyone bring it up,2023-07-14
eh  i think its because they tried to evoke that type of cinematography but dont know how to do it as well,2023-07-14
because it was intentional,2023-07-14
yeah the little fiat would take a turn and thered be a brightly colored car parked on the street then the big armored van takes the turn and the curb is empty,2023-07-12
"haha same well i only watched the teaser and its insane the amount of stuff they show in the main trailer its literally the whole movie 

ive been doing this for a while and its a crime the amount they show in their 2nd and final trailer your mind will naturally work out and anticipate those moments which will depending on the individual ruin your experience",2023-07-12
dude the car hopping was the best part,2023-07-12
nah the car hopping was the most intense action ive seen in years,2023-07-12
missed that cheers,2023-07-12
it is the stunts in that movie and the opening sequence delivered the initial thrill and the fact that since the big action setpiece was all over the marketing then it meant that they were holding back on revealing the money shots for free,2023-07-13
there arent many cockneys there  be easy to find,2023-07-16
everyone in the room knew who it was with the exception of the dni and that can easily be explained by political machinations every time a president is elected they appoint a new one this could have been very early on before he was briefed and if he was beforehand unless they had some super specific missions on hand that needed his approval to go forward it could easily have been overshadowed by other more present spycraft,2023-07-14
wasnt kitridge the secretary,2023-07-15
ah indy yeah i didnt see dial of destiny lol,2023-07-12
yeah i do wish ethan learned about the sub earlier in the movie they still wouldnt know exactly where the sub is so having that information doesnt completely derail the plot youre right that its weird being a step ahead of him,2023-07-12
"  i thought that it was going to be revealed that the original your mission should you choose to accept it tape of this movie was going to be the entity

they kinda did that already with uh the names are all running together fallout where ethan was trapped in the record booth and his briefing suddenly went all sinister

though you did make me think of something just now the oldschool tape recorder briefing ethan received felt like a throwback or referece at first but it could be argued that kittridge used an oldschool analog tape because of the entity situation",2023-07-15
in miiii they never find out what they were going after lol,2023-07-19
i think gabriel says that he knows where it is when theyre on top of the train but it wasnt clear to me whether he was bluffing or not,2023-07-12
it is possible that the source code is the machine learning code and the entity is just the trained model which has weights for it to be not able to do some task   in such case it would want to regain access to the source code to train a jailbreak version of the model,2023-07-17
"hmm i quite liked that they’re setting her up to be the new “ethan” in spirit of course i know the  tension and the romantic chemistry was off the charts but i really wanna see a mentormentee type relationship akin to keri russell and ethan in mi3 at least i hope that’s what they’re going for 

i can see why grace might be divisive to some people although i think ever since her and ethan have that conversation about her backstory in rome and he reads her completely she’s a little more invested in following this strange man who knows her too well she’s like him",2023-07-12
whom we have absolutely no info on even after 2 hours 43 mins of plot outside of a brief flashback that’s a poor “personal” nemesis,2023-07-13
they had the chance to build up lane into someone who only wants to hurt hunt at all costs to  with rogue nations to  with fallout to  with the sorry state of the world or saving it all that matters is hunt suffers,2023-07-13
dude they literally went around the room from person to person and each one took over a sentence like humans dont talk like this and they kept focusing back on cruises masked character so much it was like too comical i dont understand what the direction of that scene was at all it could have been fine if one person in the room exposited and the directing was more subtle,2023-07-17
i cant help but think it was intentionally shot that way crazy amount of dutch angles and cheesy dialogue that felt like a callback to de palmas original i dont think we were meant to take it all that seriously even hearing mark gatiss doing an american accent felt goofy to me,2023-07-15
i think this is the way to go,2023-07-12
"what i mean by the story never developing is that the threat never really develops everyones scared of where the key ends up and that fear is never really worked on tbh 
people saying ilsa dying only made sense because we cared about her just sheds a light on the why the film didnt work for me to me this says they only killed her off because it would make a wave with the audience not because it makes sense for the plot or even makes sense for the emotional arcs being set up 
im not even mad that they tried to do the ai stuff that makes sense with a natural progression of technology and global threats its just that they did it so lazily the interested party is the party like what computers just dont work like that id forgive it if it was in the ball park of what an ai dominating human infrastructure would look like but this isnt even fathomable
also dont get me started on the fight scenes in this movie ilsa with a sword attacks a man with a knife and continues to twirl around until her blade catches the knife and twirls the other way around drastically for knockoff george clooney to move his hand 6 inches and catch her sword on the other side
basically nobodys motivations or even physical moves made sense in this movie i liked this movie truly but the previous installments are so much more coherent and so much more entertaining that i feel like we can hold this one accountable and at least say hey we cant be that much out of ideas right",2023-07-15
"lol no like a good listicleseditor its ranked worst to best

though before seeing the movie for a second time with friends we also finished our rewatch of the series and i would now change my ranking worst to best to 2137456

rewatching fallout made me remember that that movie is just perfect literally no notes its outstanding and should be number 1 4 and 5 dont reach that level but theyre still crazy good and could also easily be swapped in their order ive softened a bit on 7 was actually tempted to put it below 3 at some point but im still not wild about it",2023-07-22
i’m sure the imf a has the occasional need for a bloodthirsty murderer all of the other international spy agencies do,2023-07-12
this i’m surprised at the number of people here wanting or thinking she will join the team she was murdering a bunch of innocent people in the rome scene,2023-07-12
shes none of those things paris is a gun for hire and kills who shes supposed to ,2023-07-14
if it was ff she would have a brother or sister that she cares about and toretto would help her and say “you care about your family so now you’re my family” like he did with jason statham in fast 8 mind you i love those movies but the venn diagram of dom and ethan recruiting people to join the team is a  circle,2023-07-12
oh i get it i dont know maybe some double agent action going on with gabriel getting her to give him info on ethans next moves cant wait,2023-07-12
this one felt weighed down by the exposition in a way fallout didnt,2023-07-15
how come isnt part 2 supposed to be the last one,2023-07-18
ever heard of offline maps,2023-07-18
that was the moment where i knew it wasn’t just me being dumb it was the editing and directing there were so many dramatic moments where that just took the wind right out for me,2023-07-12
if i had to guess this is probably a covid problem and he was filmed alone without the rest of the cast on set,2023-07-14
that scene reminds me how tf did grace steal the key from ethan at the airport if luther had visual on both of them right after benji solves the riddle on the bomb,2023-07-12
so am i really the only one who loved the  out of that scene i thought all of that was great and entertaining as ,2023-07-13
that’s fair i agree two people holding hands is definitely not a date i meant more the conversation preceding it about never having been in venice before and looking forward to seeing it together i don’t remember the exact wording maybe i am making more out of it than it was followed by them being all cuddly on the boat it just felt very odd to me given how they never really got together in the previous film i don’t think we’ve ever even seen them kiss but now were acting very coupley but agree to disagree i know i’m way in the minority here for not enjoying this movie,2023-07-13
"i’m glad you enjoyed it i was happy to see someone who shared my opinion just because i felt a bit nuts for seemingly being the only one to have it that being said me disliking it shouldn’t minimize your enjoyment of it—we’ve all got our own likes and dislikes and that doesn’t make a movie inherently bad or good 

you’re right that i liked ilsa a lot she was probably my favorite character in the franchise tied with benji but i wouldn’t necessarily mind her dying if it was done differently the whole thing about ethan choosing between ilsa or grace felt ridiculous like come on i know you don’t want either of them to die but you’ve known ilsa for years and grace for a day i also don’t love that our one female mc seemingly has to be killed off for another woman to join the team why can’t we have both of them they may prove me wrong on this point by adding paris to the team in the next movie though 

most of all it felt minimal i agree it should raise the stakes—i think she’s the first one who’s been in the group for several movies to die but for a fairly long movie we got over one of our core team members dying very quickly imo",2023-07-15
and yes i was surprised they didn’t give her lenses probably the easiest part of the disguise,2023-07-12
he does make eye contact when she first emerges but she’s acting so frazzled not unreasonable for him to not notice then during the key exchange i think they’re sitting beside each other opposite kitteridge,2023-07-17
maybe gabriel himself is being blackmailed by the entity maybe he has a weakness that is being exploited thats kind of what i would expect from a machine,2023-07-13
ethan said something about gabriel wanting to see people suffer he knows him,2023-07-15
gabriel is a fanatic that believes in the sentience of the entity as such it has come to mean as much to him as anything else some people like dogs he likes machines,2023-07-14
"comment removed as i no longer wish to support a company that seeks to both undermine its usersmoderatorsdevelopers and make a profit on their backs

to understand why check out the summary here",2023-07-12
he gave ethan millions of dollars to launder in missouri but ethan couldnt find enough clean businesses,2023-07-15
very honest,2023-10-22
"it’s probably the one that’s most indicative of it’s director’s style there’s parts of the first picture where you go “okay this is a de palma picture” but then it devolves into action scenes that look good but they’re not really de palma’s wheelhouse but the second picture is absolutely a john woo film for good and bad short on story long on action lots of slowmotion but not  amounts like zack snyder a mandatory dove appearance… all the typical john woo hallmarks

and then i don’t know if brad bird has a style seeing as he’s done two liveaction movies and jj abrams is competent but ultimately lacking in a consistent style and mcquarrie i think gets as much from movies like pelham one two three original not tony scott as he does from straight action pictures  this movie’s got a runaway train sequence mcquarrie loves that movie",2023-07-12
that movie was wild ethan going for bicycle kicks  waiting for doves to walk through to make an entrance,2023-07-12
that’s what you’re paying for when you hire john woo to direct,2023-07-12
he might but   maverick was an absolute stunner,2023-07-14
harry potter is still up there it’s like saying the guardians of the galaxy can’t be considered a great trilogy because it’s part of the same universe as thor love and thunder different series same world the harry potter series is a great franchise the wizarding world has had misses,2023-07-12
and theyre just collecting it for the sake of collecting the last jedi really burned a lot of fans and deterred them away from the franchise,2023-07-12
,2023-07-14
but at least it looked fantastic this film looked like  until the train sequence,2023-07-15
no they didnt its all cgi you see the real train as it leaves the station then the rest is scanned for 3d assets but with the location of the train on mi set they used similar locales,2023-07-14
this is exactly how my list looks like gp is so slept on,2023-07-14
do you think the pacing of this movie is better than fallout,2023-07-13
i think the nuke scene was also meant to serve as a distraction for the team it broke them apart and so they were misfiring when ethan needed them all hands on deck dont forget the importance of distraction as a form of weapon an enemy uses when trying to win,2023-07-26
i actually laughed at how ridiculous it was felt like a fever dream,2023-10-17
"1 gabriel repeatedly blocking a sword with a small knife…  

2 needed to fake a nuke at an airport to find out that someone wants to live and cares about his friends 

3 jumping off the 80mph in a dump truck because of a timer that can’t possibly know exactly where you are standing on the train  

4 using knifes to climb up the train like it’s made of styrofoam   

5 why does the ai only interfere with mi6 communication the one time also if it’s in all the electronics why is their one physical key that can stop it  

6 tiny asian girl who was stabbed has super human strength to pull up 2 people at once and then has the most cliché death scene ever",2023-07-16
"it tries to be witty at all times deus ex machinas disguised as it was planned blatant exposition too long scenes evil ai cliché no cool stunt scenes  dialogue 

no need to white knight this trash",2023-07-13
yeah and luther gave an interesting response when grace asked him if he and ilsa were close he said something like “in our own way” or something i think he is helping her be “dead” and that’s where he went,2023-07-15
didn’t she grab one of two weapons that where on the table,2023-07-17
but he doesn’t answer anything that’s not either a riddle or an incredibly obvious answer my smart phone already knows my mannerisms better than that,2023-07-16
yeah that’s a good point i guess the more i think about it the more i’m unsure about that whole scene maybe it was to get his mannerisms plus act as an distraction so that ethan would have less help but i’m also so curious why the ai asked benji those personal questions like the friends question and the one about death i don’t know could it not have been sufficient enough to just have the whole puzzle be riddles instead of throwing in personal questions into the mix maybe it will come up in part 2,2023-07-16
so you’re saying it could hack into their commutation system and basically everything else but couldn’t find his voice samples any other way even google can do that,2023-07-16
2 is more fun than this garbage,2023-07-16
"this one felt like a pretty complete movie with a mostly unresolved story but that’s why they tell you it’s part 1

they completed plan a of the mission now time to move onto plan b",2023-07-16
"nah if you didn’t get the fact that she was written to be a rookie secret agent then you missed it she wasn’t helpless she was green ethan was showing her the ropes

also if your master criminal friends weren’t born badass knife wielding ninjas get better ones 

jokes aside there’s no basis to the skills you’re picking out she picks pockets uses knives and drives badly so what someone in the real world probably exists like that and i mean this is mission impossible we didn’t know ethan was an even better pickpocket until one minute after we as the audience became aware of her existence if the next costar is an exprostitute we’ll discover that hookers can design 3d printed firearms and that ethan actually has a massive  it’s par for mi",2023-07-25
plus it treated the audience like complete morons nearly explained everything 3 times,2023-07-22
which was also literally on the poster of the first mission impossible movie,2023-07-15
i was also thinking there was a “bigger bad” but i really thought they would allude to it during the last act of this film,2023-07-16
and i still don’t understand how barbie is doing so well… like i am watching it do well and have no words,2023-07-27
from watching movies so seriously not everything has to be serious all the time,2023-07-13
from crying about a movie you didnt like,2023-07-14
"fast x is like a big mac meal while this movie is like a multi course meal at a fancy restaurant

yes theyre both food but one is so much better crafted than the other",2023-07-16
one thing im agreeing with is the bike jump it was shown in all the trailers but in the movie its not really much more than what we already saw they shouldnt have spoiled it,2023-07-18
"its a  test because it has no relation to the content of a movie any film with a male main character is unlikely to pass the test regardless of the genre or subject matter im sure the people who made die hard would agree that whilst women do talk to each other in that world its not really relevant to the story enough to justify the added runtime we could start adding scenes in to pass the test but then logically wed start adding scenes to films that do not serve the story

its important that female characters arent relegated to sidekicks or secretaries but demanding scenes that do not include or reference men and therefore passing the bechdel  a  way of assuring that",2023-07-20
yeah but in the movie when you see ethan going off the cliff and falling that’s all tom that ain’t no stunt man sure maybe it wasn’t quite as impressive as the halo jump in the last movie but there’s still something cool about driving a motorcycle off a cliff as opposed to just jumping out of a plane,2023-07-15
yeah thats right it blew up the sub and then started making fake news the bit about them not caring about that was ,2023-07-16
"she was given a recurring role in fallout and dr part 1

short cameos arent what i would call a recurring role and i dont think she even had 7 minutes in this new film before her demise 

in terms of importance she is even below benji and luther smaince she’s neither american nor part of the team

in terms of importance to ethan yes but in rogue nation for example fraust was by far the most interesting character so its incomprehensible how the script writers pushed her character aside in the subsequent sequels",2023-07-17
" i can see that but i dont really agree for one it would have left grace useless because ilsa would have just worn the mask adding her to the existing train scene also would have been hard with all the characters we have to followthe cia guys kittridge the white widows crew grace ethan gabriel paris and cary elwes thats why they had luther  and hide somewhere they had nothing for him to do 

as far as the emotional impact i thought it was fine the very next scene is grace asking about ilsa and ethan giving a tearjerker speech about how he would die for each member of the crew and you totally believe it same kind of thing happened with alec baldwin when he died it was a sad scene but then they move on because the mission isnt done yet 

i guess i just dont agree that its rushed or forced when this character has had 2 full movies and an hour and 50 minutes of this one i thought it was a good low point for ethan in this movie and it was cool that he didnt let another woman die by the hands of gabriel at the end",2023-07-14
"maybe he had a change of heart after seeing what gabriel and the entity did on the train and would rather ethan just destroy it or maybe he was planning to destroy it himself somehow after he secured it  
not clear and maybe something they go into more detail in next one quite a few unfinished threads 

i definitely don’t think they were working together because then there’d be no need to steal it from him",2023-07-13
i have to think that’s coming in the next one where the entity does the video screen of loved ones and it shows everyone including her,2023-07-13
yes the entity is the silly name they gave the ai,2023-07-13
"i think you’re not asking the right questions

did it not predict those things or did it let those things happen knowing that it builds to a plan it hasn’t let anyone in on 

i have a feeling that part two is going to come to a scene where ethan has the ai right where he wants it and then the ai flips the game and explains that it wants ethan there because blah blah blah evil plan whatever like right now it’s only 1 of its potential usage since it’s ‘locked’ in a submarine at the bottom of the ocean it can’t really do what it needs to for whatever its goal is",2023-07-13
the key is russian and opens the russian tech in the sub where fragments of the ai are basically stuck,2023-07-14
i think they took some artistic license with the source code concept in the real world if you have the source code of a software you can replicate and modify it infinitely its just text files and the real software running the ai would be a binary file buuuuuuut you cant explain that to the average moviegoer if you want to have any chance to destroy an enemy you have to give it a physical form and well lets just call that the source code obviously is neither source nor code but you get the gist like why the entity looks like a windows xp screen saver and makes monstery sounds rule of cool i suppose,2023-07-14
"there can be multiple programs

1  the us intelligence program like a keylogger just performs intelligence duties and deletes itself successfully before detection

2 the program on russian sub it can control certain systems such as a submarines fire controls

3 the saudi ai program

basicly the entity is formed by program 1 getting into the russian sub overwriting onto program 2 and finally combining elements from program 3 the source codes of program 1 and 3 can be unimportant",2023-07-14
wow interesting thanks looks like the bar scene i wonder why they chose to do some bits in a whole separate country when they had an entire airport to work with haha,2023-07-20
"wouldnt you be attracted to atwell

not that wouldnt also be to ferguson",2023-07-20
ok fair point,2023-10-11
i assumed only the last sentence was ironic,2023-07-14
i watched it plot was garbage unrealistic action was obviously top notch though,2023-07-21
like i get that it’s hollywood but you cant sword fight with a small knife maybe you get lucky and block the sword once or twice but they give him a knife and act as if it were a sword,2023-07-16
sub nukes always have 2 keys think red october as for the separation after theyre found i have no idea,2023-07-15
in the cold open during the captains voiceover when they are inserting the stealth systemthe entity it is shown that there are two people present in the chamber after it is locked each person wears one half around their neck,2023-07-15
" the agents were the best use of the government hunting ethan in the franchise so far and definitely much better than the baldwinrenner subplot in rn

"i think theyre both mediocre rogue nation and ghost protocol remain by far the best of the franchise 

dead reckoning is just a continuation of fallout overemphasis on action comedy aspet of the franchise over pretty much everything else the characters the plot the heist even the spy vibe of the franchise",2023-07-16

that’s what i wondered as well… hopefully that’ll get explained in part 2,2023-07-16
please don’t compare this to that dumpster fire of a movie fast x,2023-07-16
"better writing mostly it was  awful

"now that you mention it i don’t have a massive list for movies i thought were better only one i could truly defend right now would be across the spiderverse i thought john wick 4 was great and i’m a massive scream fan and the 6th entry didn’t disappoint me not to say scream is a better made film than this

fully on board with gabriel and how wonderfully the actor portrayed him but i felt let down by the character itself i’m pretty confident part two will come out and retroactively make this movie better but i wasn’t as enthralled with it like i have been with the past couple entries",2023-07-12

is it possible that the team neglected that or was it just an aesthetic detail,2023-07-13
3 or 1,2023-07-14
it has the more impressive collection of stunts but the plot is not as strong rehashing a villain and rebecca fergusons arc is literally the same as rogue nation its debatably as good as rogue nation and ghost protocol,2023-07-14
if she was she definitely didn’t look like a 20 something more mid to late 30s,2023-07-15
why are you sure of that exactly i can’t see anything that suggests they aren’t playing around their actual ages,2023-07-15
kittridge would likely deliver it to whoever was in charge the “old think” as denlinger and gabriel referred to and denlinger wanted it for himself to somehow dismantle the other government officials,2023-07-16
yay,2023-07-24

i also noticed the no time to die mg connection also the whole train sequence in this movie was ripped right from uncharted 2 even though the director denies it lol,2024-01-25

yeah but you see he did it for family so its justified,2023-10-11
i guess that part in fallout where they convince the perp that it was weeks later and the nukes had gone off was an homage then,2024-01-25

 her death was so heartbreaking i wanted her character to stay for future movies as well ,2024-02-03
haha when you say it like this its really ridiculous,2024-02-05
but that’s the thing tho i don’t want an audience standin in a movie that’s about doing insane impossible feats i want to imagine myself as ethan not some reality based insert who started off the movie a badass and then slowly turned into a screaming mess i think you’re totally right grace had a lot more flaws but they forgot to balance it to make her sufferable i also 100 agree she’s an audience self insert especially with how everyone warmed up to her and would die for her immediately after she got their one friend killed but that just means she’s dead weight in a movie about doing an impossible mission it’s like they nerfed her half way through because they wanted someone relatable and a badass international thief wasn’,2023-07-28
congratulations youre the new safety guy for the film,2023-07-21
so we are gonna need you to coordinate how all of that will actually work in real life mmk thanks,2023-07-24
yeah  and a lifelong of training to get to that time plus breathing 100 o2 beforehand which you bet is the same these celebrities do,2023-07-17
also i feel like kittriges dialog with hunt in the trailer was much more villain like than in the final cut nice misdirect,2023-07-14
i think the helicopter into a truck was a fakeout so we didnt know that he was chasing another helicopter was in the himalayas,2023-07-15

its more likely intentionally misleading footage for the trailers as tom has been a bit more gung ho regarding making sure his movies dont leak at least in their entirety,2023-07-18
out of curiosity why on earth dont directors just always release 100 of what was shot even if we have to pay extra like in some criterion collectionstyle sets in addition to a modified manuscript that contains every debate over which direction to take the plot it baffles me that we have norton anthologies and richard feynmans notes on all these subjects but somehow to get this same exposure in film industry you need to be a writer exlegend actor invited to set on the regular,2023-07-23
this also opens up a plothole on why the keys are separated and on different parts of the globe if someone retrieved the keys  then whoever got them has both keys from the get go,2023-07-15
i was saying it more along the lines of the story advancing in a way where ethan ends up not having a choice of being underwater and gets forced into holding his breath similar to being forced to make this canyon jump instead of just willingly jumping into the water just because,2023-07-12
i love that whole dialogue’s length with all the back and forth despite being an action movie,2023-07-16

sure but as we see later it can hack their comms without being detected  it doesn’t need to plan an elaborate bomb to get benji’s voice  given the entity’s pervasiveness it could presumably get the voice data without even tapping in to their live feed,2023-07-17
which is even more curious because by that point the entity isn’t using benji’s voice anymore,2023-07-17
the last clue wasnt a riddle but the order of the letters on the device  he noticed the device spelled out goodluc and after shifting the last letter to k it disabled the bomb,2023-07-25

i can still look at the behindthescenes after seeing the film i think it doesnt work as well the other way around",2023-07-27
right but i don’t think they have to show how the magic trick is done before people see the trick itself in the movie,2023-07-17
going in i know there will be a stunt i don’t know what the stunt is i didn’t watch any trailers so for me it was an unnecessary spoiler,2023-07-23
"which i think is unfortunate to an extent in the sense that i feel just about all of the mission impossible films are also at the very least good films some of them even very good

that being said to me the stunts serve the actual movie in a way as well since a lot of the stunts just feel different when they had the chase through rome it felt like they were really there speeding in those streets so even if they werent it would have been exceptionally well digital effects etc",2023-07-27
"which i think is kind of a weird way to watch a movie to begin with

at least imo

like obviously i cant and dont want to tell anyone how they are allowed to watch a film but if the story beats action etc seemingly isnt interesting anymore to them personally i think thats an issue",2023-07-27
you genuinely believe it looks fake and shoddy,2023-07-18
or when he did a halo jump also in fallout,2023-07-15
yeah but flying a helicopter isnt really a huge deal tons of people do it every day sure most of them arent actors who trained just for a particular film but that doesnt make it impressive on screen,2023-07-19

its the fact that he has to get away from the mountain before he opens the parachute and then land on a train moving at full speed,2023-07-12
i think it was showing how his team takes him for granted benji just assumed hed be cool with jumping off a  cliff,2023-07-15
yeah i dont know where people are getting the idea that ethan willingly volunteers to do these stunts every stunt he does is because he has no other choice ghost protocol makes that pretty clear with how he asks benji if theres any other way into the server room even rogue nation hints at it before he does the underwater stunt,2023-07-12
never watched the bts and i was pretty thrilled at the scene tbh the fall gave me chills,2023-07-13
more of a correction,2023-10-24
"ilsa was kept around because hollywood can’t get over the concept of fridging a woman 
 to motivate their male protagonists",2023-07-17
killing off ilsa ruined the film,2023-07-23
i read that its a dumb matter of scheduling conflicts ferguson had to play in silo and dune 2,2023-07-17
killing off ilsa  me off because i’ve long thought that the actress and the character had serious spin off potential  in fact if they wanted to replace james bond with a woman ilsa faust is how you do it the character is cool badass attractive believable and had been well established in the public eye already  she even has ties to mi6 i really believe it could have been the next spy movie franchise,2023-07-24
i don’t necessarily agree with that she was basically part of the team at the end of rogue and even more so in fallout maybe a part of her story was tied to lane but her interactions and chemistry with ethan is what made her a great character in this franchise again i’m not mad that they killed her off it’s just how they handled her character in this movie felt underwhelming,2023-07-17
i spent most of the movie admiring shea whighams marvelous head of hair,2023-07-14
such a spot on comparison,2023-07-19
watch boardwalk empire hes often a big part of it,2023-07-14
yeah he is so good on that show,2023-07-13
i will take neal mcdonough over him 10 times out of 10,2023-11-26
i’m willing to bet that there’s gonna be a twist that the entity is playing all of them i wouldn’t be surprised if the entity has been telling kitridge what he thinks will happen to make more allies,2023-07-21
what blows my mind is he was only 37 in the first mi movie,2023-07-24
"the plot is utter nonsense ive pretty much given up in trying to make sense of it 

but if i had to guess id say he wasnt a villain but his only purpose on the movie is to serve as contrast to ethan hes the classic agent whos only after the interest of the us  as opposed to the ethical ethan hunt who cares about everyone",2023-08-07
yeah  that was definitely thrown in there to setup an imf role for him in part 2 which is exciting,2023-07-14
for you,2023-07-12
this whole thread is funny but your comment absolutely killed me,2023-07-13
baneposting from the dark knight rises,2023-07-16
this scene,2023-07-19
it’s really upsetting she died like that also i felt it was a slap in the face because it looks like she was killed so they can have grace be on the team it’s apparently too much to have two beautiful women on the team,2023-07-12
im really hoping ilsa turns out to be alive in mi8 it just looks cheap  disrespectful to  her character like that and what are we supposed to ship ethan  grace now great chemistry but ilsa  ethan were the right pair,2023-07-12
we can’t have two important women in an action movie it’s the law,2023-07-12
same i am crushing so  rebecca ferguson,2023-07-14
i’m sad tooo,2023-07-12
"



ilsa became just a plot device to make tim cruise more tragic  unless they bring her back for the next movie its incredibly  and pointless",2023-07-18
but did she,2023-07-16
i really think she will end up being alive i think she may have been pretending to be alana on the train before grace knocked her out alana was acting very nervous which isnt something we’ve seen from her before,2023-07-19
you could see it coming a mile away when they introduced grace lol ethan’s getting bored lol,2023-07-20
from my understanding part of the reason the flashback stuff wasn’t fleshed out more in this one was because cruise and mcquarrie decided they didn’t want to jump on the deaging train with cruise we’ll see what part 2 will do to flesh it out but i know they said the nixed going stuff in this one to avoid having to make cruise look 30 years younger which i kind of respect because every franchise seems to be doing that now,2023-07-19
man’s got a type,2023-07-14

every closeup in this movie had heavy retouching once you spot the unnaturally smooth under eye on tom it’s all you see,2023-07-12
there were definitely hints of his ozark voice in this movie him getting to be a big bad in two mission impossible movies felt like an apology for how underused he was in ozark,2023-07-15
right the eyepatch  made me think more mgs,2023-07-15

"the ai cant see everything but it can calculate probable futures anything with a human touch introduces uncertainty randomness which means more probable futures but with the train the ai had gabriel set it to a certain speed and then break off the throttle with access to past data on that route calculating exactly when to fall off the train would be pretty easy

as for how it knew hes be on top of the train the ai told him what to do and where to be and he improvised to get there 

of all the difficult to believe things in this movie that scene was near the bottom of the list

honestly if youre interested in this kind of ai story check out the show person of interest it did this plot way better",2023-10-12
in some movies you can it smacked in the head and knocked off a train and still be fine,2023-07-14
tom cruise had a cable connected on to him that was removed using cgi in post production no chance any human being can simply hold on to a fastmoving place lifting with just their hands,2023-07-12
yup,2023-07-14
its fair to assume the ai has his location and could adjust the watch based on where he was on the train thats way less of a stretch than the ai knowing gabriel would get the key by arranging a few people in a certain way and ensuring that one of them died felt like eagle eye,2023-07-12
and surely with his forward momentum he would have continued rolling and hit the inside of the truck anyway not just land flat on his back like that can someone with better knowledge of physics than me chime in here,2023-07-17
wild theory but i think part 2 will reveal the entire train sequence was ai generated and the actual film ended in venice,2023-07-12
now im imagining a universe were he jumps too early and he just stupidly smacks to the side of the truck and dies,2023-07-16
it still woulda killed him,2023-07-14
exactly the entity is gabriels benji,2023-07-14
the entity can’t keep getting away with this,2023-07-12
he literally says thats what hes doing before the train sequence,2023-07-17
yeah theres a scene prior to the train where luther tells ethan that the reason the entity specifically picked gabriel as its representative or whatever is because the entity feels that probabilistically ethan is more likely to  him on the train which would lead to the entity winning as they wouldnt know what to do with the key and luther tells ethan thats why he has to resist killing gabriel in order to defeat the entity,2023-07-13
 no joke  nicholas hoult was originally cast as gabriel and i’m really glad his schedule took him out  esai freaking nailed it,2023-07-16
the crazy thing is hes younger than tom cruise,2023-07-21
not so fast don’t jump to conclusions think of your family,2023-07-15
the one when she was introducing herself on the floor of the club to “lark” and gabriel and as she’s doing so she makes a comment and smiles at ethan,2023-07-17
its kinda hard not to recognize elizabeth debicki though shes so tall ,2023-07-15
i don’t even think they have her many lines  i can barely remember any  such a waste,2023-07-16

nah its that chap that has to saw his leg off in saw,2024-02-06
 whole plot of the movie hinges on the us government having terrible version control for their code,2023-07-14
so the americans were able to remotely send that early version onto the russian sub where it went rouge,2023-07-14
thanks this clears a lot of things for me,2024-02-03
yup also this reminds me of the scene in ghost protocol where he asks renners character to jump into a vent and saying and ill catch you,2023-07-18
this is 100 what is going to happen,2023-07-15
my theater laughed hard at several gags one of the funniest missions so far,2023-07-13
its very cool but absolutely in beta,2023-08-06
" like how would that conversation go imagine if you got an email from a sentient ai and it says it wants to help you go after an old enemy wouldn’t you think it was a weird scam or something 

well it could call you it can pretend to be benji so why not someone else pretends to be your family and then it manipulates you perhaps  knows every thing about you and then eventually you get inspired or something  idk i can see that bit being possible is all i do think it should be shown at least

  and so this ai knows that ethan is trying to get the key but so are lots of other people so why isn’ going after all these other people too 

ai knows that ethan is trying to destroy it not let it be controlled while other parties are trying to control it its going after the key the other people are just people it doesnt need to go after them it choses gabriel as the foil since ethan is involved and ethan is the one that ensures others dont get it 

honestly  i like the ai i think it makes for a good villian after all the nukes and its a nice pace of change plus topical what i dont like personally is gabriel 

i feel like they wanted him to be this joker figure he loves suffering apparently but they dont show it if he was really to be set up as a archnemesis id disconnect him from ethan make him some looney essentially that is inspired by the ai believes it to be  plus actually show us that he likes suffering pom felt more psychopathic than gabriel have him rip up those random train drivers instead of quickly killing them have him do the goblin laugh from spiderman no way home or something  just make him more of a wildcard that loves and worships the entity 

right now hes just kind of a random dude who is slightly good at killing some folks

 why the  he would do it’s bidding

the issue is still gabriel not being well setup but i can see a bunch of reasons like wanting power wanting to be rich and comfortable when the ai takes over the world or whatever idk just motivation for serving an all powerful ai isnt something thats hard to find i think",2023-07-15
"huhhh i didnt even think of that thatd be a fun twist actually turns out ai is just relatively normal while the humans are the evil one

i like it this would be much better haha",2023-07-18
you not being able to imagine how that conversation would go says more about your imagination than about the quality of writing its a super intelligent ai a trillion times smarter than you  why would you be able to imagine how it did it,2023-07-28

that scene and luther explaining what might happen in the train was first semester college student level acting and writing terrible,2023-07-18
thats almost underselling it fallout deserves to be in discussion for one of the goat action movies,2023-07-15
i like the pacing of fallout better than basically all the other mi movies,2023-07-16
so how would you rank 7,2023-07-20
it was long provided little value and had silly overplayed gimmicks,2023-07-26
also vanessa kirby looks like the actual daughter of vanessa redgrave,2023-07-16
ya i only caught that on like the 5th rewatch  you really have to pay attention,2023-07-16
i meant stand out in terms of the best of the series but yeah i consider fallout a bit of an action master piece,2023-07-23
the trailer with imagine dragons was so  good with the gunjack arms,2023-07-14

like when he tries to jump through the window after running down that tallass building in dubai and he faceplants into the window above and nearly falls to his death,2023-07-16
there was something similar in jack reacher as well i dont know if its from cruise or mcquarrie or what but those disorientation scenes are definitely a bit of a trend with them,2023-07-19
same cruise is not afraid to get beaten up does he feel superhuman at times sure but just as many times as he does some successfully he also fails like the scene where he’s drowns and ilsa saves him,2023-10-11
i think that was supposed to show grace that whatever gabriel told her at the party was a lie gabriel said that ethan doesnt care about the people he works with and that he wouldnt hesitate to let someone else die if it meant the mission would be successful and then from then on out all grace sees ethan do is be compassionate and worry about others over himself,2023-07-15
no i am key you are guy,2023-07-13
oh okay my bad,2023-07-12
oh okay my bad,2023-07-12
youre right  it was just his parachute that went out the window not the guy  and they showed the key being dropped the second time,2023-07-14
everyone in the theater noticed that lol,2023-07-26
because machine broke,2023-07-19
they did not have contacts handy and it was a great way to increase tension as it was so obvious to us with all the eye closeups,2023-07-31
i did expect her to put on contacts to hide the eye color cause as others have said it was extremely obvious what in universe explanation were you expecting they had different color eyes they didn’t account for it,2023-07-17
  what exactly do you think the uk is like,2023-07-18
i thought the same why was she even trying to find gabriel or not go the other way if she just saw him,2023-07-23
felt straight out of a john wick movie she was my favorite part,2023-07-13
she might be up there with gogo  bill and gazelle kingsman for most badass henchwomen,2023-07-14
ok the white face paint with the napoleonic jacket is smt few people can pull off,2023-07-14
when she was choking tom cruise with her legs in the alley i literally felt my breath leave my body is this what stans mean when they say step on me,2023-07-17
she was never dying her name is paris shell be on the team in 8,2023-07-19
it was actually very cringe to see her with that make up in venice club scene like everyone else is in formal suits and you have asian girl with obnoxious white face paint on her face,2023-07-17
i would have started a riot if they didnt save her for a larger part next movie shes too good of an actress to relegate her to a silent killer,2023-07-31
when you have abs like that you flaunt them lol,2023-07-13
boo no such thing as gratuitous,2023-07-17
wouldnt wanna waste all the training she had to do for the movie presumably p,2023-07-18
felt just right to me ,2023-07-17
if i was ethan in that situation id just let her choke me out tbh not a bad way to go out ,2023-10-19
the punk bootsplaid skirt combo said all it had to,2023-07-16
bro when she got back in the car and i was like oh shes wearing a plaid miniskirt on top of everything it was like eating a chobani yogurt and then finding the fruit at the bottom,2023-07-17
i am focused on her that is and the other gorgeous women…,2023-07-14
yes i thank mcq for introducing me to her her hair is so gorgeous and that dress she had on in her first appearance and her eyes… all the women just weren’t fair,2023-07-17
vanessa kirby isn’t bad either,2023-07-19
rebecca ferguson is so hot in a kinda scary intense way,2023-07-16
it was actually bad writing for real even the guy who spends every frame of the movie with her didnt notice her eye colour change or think anything of it,2023-07-15
tips captain america shield,2023-07-13
almost every male character getting distracted or at least mentioning by how hot she was lol,2023-07-18
"i think its more likely that ethan is purposefully taking her off the chess board so that the entity cant plan for her in the next movie  i have a few thoughts as to why

1 there really isnt an emotional scene after it happens i dont believe ethan would casually go into planning after one of his best friends dies
2 they did a death fake out earlier i think its setting up that ethan knows that they can use this trick
3 usually as a narrative convention youre supposed to have the abyss be in the end of the second act and this happened in whats arguably the first act this is a 2 parter
4 shes cast in the next movie",2023-07-13
they did a similar thing with the white lotus,2023-07-15
grace seemed presented more as a protege for ethan than a love interest even if there was obvious  tension between them which continued offcamera as well as we know,2023-07-15
ya ok so those knives are gabriels,2023-07-16
paula patton is no slouch herself i really wish more of these characters came back in other movies,2023-07-12
fairly certain emmanuelle bert was the first time my jaw dropped out of pure confusion not knowing what the attraction i was feeling was she is mindblowingly beautiful,2023-07-12
christopher mcquarrie please acknowledge claire just once its all i need,2023-07-13
thandie is the goat mi girl for me,2023-07-13
i’d throw kristin scott thomas in there too lol,2023-07-20
newton and monaghan are light weight compared to the others,2023-07-17
i was hoping she would have a cameo here,2023-07-12
i mean literally every mission impossible movie  even max had something going on in 1996,2023-07-16
yeah i saw that shes 41 and ferguson is 39 but rebecca has this like hardened veteran thing going on that she seems to be leaning into which makes her feel more mature and im here for it,2023-07-13
idk about you but i was saying back in 2011 that id go back in time to grow old with  hayley atwell after saving the universe from a big purple jewelry collector i just must like her more than you idk,2023-07-12
that too,2023-07-13

she has an odd look she’s attractive in the same way natalie dormer and ana taylor joy is imo,2023-07-12
she isnt in mcu though,2023-08-03
is this a question,2023-07-14
holy  mia goth has a child i didn’t even think she was that old 25 at most,2023-07-12
im not against the result of the scene and especially like the ethan crash but the way they got there was so halfassed and lazy,2023-07-15
i know its a movie so we choose where the key ends up but like i really thought that key was going out the window with lackey dude in that moment,2023-07-23
i was so sure it was going to be revealed one or all of them were literal robotic plants controlled by the entity,2023-07-16
" people have talked about editing in other posts but the weirdest for me was the car chase they intentionally ripped the doors off but instead of a lot of tight shots showing us its actually the actors we just get head on shots they may as well have used a green screen for

yes this is when the movie started faltering for me right away wide faraway shots spliced with tight claustrophobic closeups on their faces rapid fire cuts…what the  happened 

seeing the doors ripped off in the trailer made me think they’d go all in on showing that the actors were doing all the driving themselves but nope typical  that’s usually reserved for action movies well beneath mi’s standard",2023-07-14
"i remember a couple tight shots that showed it was hayley atwell driving but there definitely wasn’t a lot the editing was fast and frenetic which helped with the intensity but then the editing also took away from the movie in some ways

hopefully now that part 1 has got all the setup out of the way we can get a nice tight script and conclusion with part 2",2023-07-13
i actually had no idea who had each of the two pieces of the key for most of the movie and there was a fake one at the airport they barely covered that,2023-07-15
"i kept wondering if they were overemphasizing everything so they could do some unexpected switcheroo but nothing surprising ever happened i think it was structured that way for foreign audiences despite some good action scenes and an interesting opening the story didn’t engage me

i found it odd that there were so many callbacks to older mission impossible movies but the characters are treated like it’s their first rodeo there were multiple times where i thoght they were going to solve a problem by relying on one of their old reliable tricks from previous films but then the characters act like they’re completely unprepared

i hated the whole parachute setup luther somehow obtains and packs two different parachutes for ethan for a plan that really has no reason for one parachute ethan ends up using  both an actually needed a third also for a guy who held onto the side of a plane i’m pretty sure he could have figured out how to make one parachute work for two people didn’t he learn his lesson from mi2",2023-07-22
yet i do not remember who the people were like at the pentagon  meeting and i do not remember ilsa from the previous movies,2023-10-11
i rewatched fallout the day before this film and i didn’t think the shaky editing was that bad it’s not like the early 2010s or something it was noticeable but i didn’t think it detracted from what was happening on screen,2023-07-14
i think just comedy he’s clearly never driven a fiat before,2023-07-14
it’s just comedy he’s slick but he can’t be amazing at everything and those tiny cars are a pita to drive,2023-07-15
i didn’t like that it made him look incompetent this is mission impossible ethan has been shown to be expertly proficient at driving shooting fighting and all other spy skills it’s not like he was drugged or something,2023-07-22
the scene literally starts because he fires his gun into the roof of the train to get her to stop running,2023-07-15
" theres only two directions and everyone just heard you fire a gun

huh",2023-07-18
wait i was confused about that too did the director of the ciakittridge want to be there because he didnt trust his bosss intentionsthe director of national intelligence that he reports to,2023-07-13
"thank you i remember at one point the movie cuts between three scenes happening at once grace acting like alana to get the key from kittridge and using her identity to send herself money  paris killing the guards to let gabriel in and threaten the cia director who’s going behind everyone’s back with the key  and benji purposely lying to ethan and getting him to secretly travel up a cliff so he can skydive

my head legit started hurting maybe had something to do with the popcorn and runtime too lol i do wish they found a way to streamline that",2023-07-13
no i definitely got confused as to who had the key in the night club especially because until the train no one knew if both those pieces were legit,2023-07-15
the www trilogy by canadian author robert sawyer i think the strongest one of the series is the first one which covers its growing awareness with its only contact being with a young blind girl thats learning to see with some new tech,2023-07-13
the www trilogy by robert sawyer,2023-07-16
ai is the big baddie that everyone is afraid of,2023-07-19
why do you think the ai wants the key to destroy the world lol its the same thing lol,2023-07-19
that was so sweet… ,2023-08-06
my take on that dynamic was that ethan knew ilsa could handle herself in a way grace couldn’t hence him looking out for the latter more,2023-07-15
exactly this  when did grace suddenly become competent,2023-07-14
i think the intention was that gabriel was toying with grace  like ethan said  he enjoys the suffering not the killing,2023-07-17
i thought that gabriel essentially had the fights prechoreographed based on the probability given to him by the ai,2023-07-21
gabrielle is fighting with grace to bait ilsa though,2023-07-25
i think the dynamic is different in the longrun when you know gabriel has the entity on his side and he basically wants ilsa to die instead of grace he wants ethan to suffer the most while grace knows where the key is,2023-07-14
last night i saw rouge agents and i really agree with you  i mean ilsa beat the doctor of death in a hand to hand combat well there were knives involved but you get the idea losing to gabriel like that made no justice to her skills ,2023-07-17
"ilsa is super saiyan  no cap

power scaling is really off in this mf",2023-07-17
"  grace holds her own against grabriel 

am i the only person who immediately thought that gabriel is toying with her and not taking that fight seriously trying to  her",2023-07-20
or jeremy renner paula patton or maggie q etc,2023-07-15
it’s double fridging as well usually a female character is fridged when she is killed solely to motivate a male character from a storytelling perspective but here it is actually the instory reason for her death as well not only that it’s further demeaned by the fact the entity doesn’t even care which one between illsa and grace gets fridged because either would motivate ethan they are apparently interchangeable and while i understand hayley atwell makes people feel things rightly so illsa has far more history with ethan,2023-08-21
i could tell from the order of the cast credits ferguson was buried where this movie was going between her getting fridges and esau morales hamming it up with a cheap last minute supervillain backstory and the nonstop exposition this film felt like a massive step down from fallout ,2023-07-13
well no it seems clear to me that pom klementieff is going to be the second female lead in part 2 theres no need to confirm that she still has a pulse otherwise,2023-07-12
"ferguson has other projects and is hard to schedule

also how could you introduce atwell as a new love interest if ilsa is still alive and offscreen

the emotional core is ethan triigerwd by being responaible for the death of love interrst before joining imf",2023-07-15
"i hate takes like this when tom cruise has actual phenomenal roles for female actors in his movies 

but now its oh theyre not allowed to have two or something 

rebeccas character is so richly detailed and strong and even though ethan bails her out of situations its just really cool to see she could easily have a spin off and id watch it",2023-07-14
nah hes not vin diesel,2023-07-14
did they actually give him a choice i think alanna was the one with the decision making power in that situation she wanted grace alive since she had the key,2023-07-13
idk about the movie havent seen it i just want more rebecca ferguson performances,2023-07-12
it was such a baffling decision on their part love hayley atwell but found the movie’a treatment of ilsa distasteful to say the least,2023-07-13
"perfectly summed up her random death has to be fake otherwise it cheapens the whole franchise and no we are not going to just move on  ship ethangrace thats so disrespectful poms characterparis dies the same way but is shown to be alive why do that it makes way more sense that there will be a twist  her death will turn out to be fake not every new female lead has to be ethans soulmate  if thatll not be the case ill end up hating my most favourite franchise

x200b

also rebecca is in mi8 starcast  has also shot for some of it ill hate it if its for some flashback scene",2023-07-12
"im sure part 2 will be awesome spectacular entry that will certainly lifting mi to be one of the best action franchise ever 

i was sure now i have no reason to be if this is what we got after 5 years why would mcquarrie suddenly go back to directing in a different way for a movie that’s supposed to come out in 11 months",2023-07-13
"i know this thread is super old but i completely agree with everything you’ve written here  i hate the trope of there only being enough room for one woman in the main cast of heroes and that one woman is the loveinterest of the main hero  even if i agreed with the decision to  ilsa which i don’t i can’t see any reason why they would feel it necessary to shoehorn in grace as ethan’s new girl  just let her exist as her own person not as someone we should only care about because of her impact on the hero  

also since when has ethan needed additional motivation  at no point in any of the mi films has he lacked incentive to beat the bad guy  he does it because serving the greater good is his life’s work  he’s been described in more than one of these movies as a force of nature akin to the t1000",2023-08-24
"its cheap when a well rounded character is fridged just for the sake of some fuel for others usually when a major characters die you expect some storyline that makes their death satisfying from a narrative standpoint ilsa gets nothing in this movie like not a shred of depth her character had in previous two films and just dies im sorry i disagree i think it was the worst part of otherwise a really solid film

also the only reason gabriel got away was due to sheer  luck",2023-07-12
writers needing a sacrifice is common and expected but the issue here is that the movie made it extremely obvious that there was only space for one kickass brunette hence the cointoss between grace and ilsa and then grace being immediately courted to be ilsas replacement on the team,2023-07-13
a silly sword fight on some bridge in venice is the definition of random this movie did ilsa so dirty,2023-07-12
i guess well see for part 2 gonna keep my copium high for this one mcq hasnt really written anything horrendous yet postcruisemummy wasnt great but wasnt fridging level bad plus all the foreshadowing of her coming back is still keeping my copium full,2023-07-13
biggest flaw in every mi movie except the first one blood doesnt exsist in the first movie you get the blood mislead with john voight but after that people are getting shot neck snapped crushed and cut without a drop of blood i noticed in this movie they have some particulate effects to imply blood but none on the actors i get they are going for a broad audience but it breaks the immersion instantly every time it happens,2023-07-15
"lol thats always annoying to me in movies but at least people are getting stabbed in the heart in this movie

it annoys the  out of me when people get a small blade in their intestines and die in 10 seconds

yet another reason why reservoir dogs is great",2023-07-18
yeah i think that’s contributing a lot to my “meh” feelings on this movie i definitely didn’t hate it but when you go from something that’s so cinematically clear and effecting to what this is it really disappoints a bit these hand to hand fights would be pretty great in other franchises but they let down when we compare them to what we just had in fallout similar with the car chases in the last 3 vs this one they felt a bit jenky here once again because of close angles and quick cuts instead of big shots that really show the movement of the car in the environment,2023-07-12
yeah i think solomon lane is the best villain of the series certainly a more developed character than hoffman’s character in 3,2023-07-15
i think he just means people talk about it like it’s obviously head and shoulders above gp rn and mi1 when a lot of people view those 4 as really close qualitywise excellent that is,2023-07-14
solomon lane is pretty memorable i would say,2023-10-13
to you,2023-07-13
1 3 and gp are better,2023-07-15
"rogue one
dead reckoning
mission impossible",2023-07-13
"they actually didnt paris was stabbed in the lower abdomen ilsa was clearly stabbed in the chest right in the heart   
also yea i really cant see them backtracking this yea actually she was stabbed in the heart but she waited out for ethan to arrive so she could fake her death whilst bleeding internally

also you would assume ethan wouldnt just leave her right there in the middle of the streets he would 100 check for every possible vital signal before accepting her death

it was just a very dumb decision unfortunately really didnt like the sendoff she was an extremely integral character for the previous 2 movies i would have thought at the very least she would die in part 2",2023-07-12
"i had flashbacks to john wick 2 where he stabs both common and ruby rose in the same place but leaves the knife in common and narrates where he stabbed him and why hes leaving the blade in but takes it out of rr

for the life of me i cant remember if they took the blade out of ilsa but left it in paris or vice versa or a different situation entirely",2023-07-16
this is just a flesh wound,2023-07-12
i suppose but maybe i’m just a more gullible movie watcher i knew they wouldn’t  her off but when she was about to get shot i was like tom is really taking his sweet time,2023-07-14
probably schedule issue since rebecca has silo and dune sequle going on,2023-07-12
to trick the entity in case it can read minds,2023-07-12
"to use her getting hurt as motivation

he did tell gabriel “if you hurt either of them in any way there’s no place you can go that i won’t  you”

she doesn’t have to die to be motivation or someone else could have rescued her and ethan and them don’t k ow about it it’d be super easy to bring her back in the next one",2023-07-12
ethan thinks she’s dead because she’s kept him out of the loop on her plan so the entity can’t keep using her to get to ethan it’s also possible that her “death” was the only way gabriel and the entity could get blindsided and lose on the train,2023-07-13
"sick can’t wait 

i’m sorry did anyone feel any emotional investment or excitement during that fight or during the corny and completely unearned “don’t do it ethan don’t  him” moment

i was so mad over ilsa but at the writing decision not at this milquetoast blank slate of a character who supposedly goes back to ethan’s very origins seriously what the  were those hackneyed flashbacks",2023-07-13
"plus that paris chase…

and the helicopter sequence…",2023-07-12
and not only are the only halo jump and the bathroom brawl in the same movie but its essentially the same scene one of the best 30 minutes ive ever seen in a theater id say the initial chase scene in fury road is the only 30minute sequence that might be better,2023-07-17
i mean just the trailer kicked  so many parodies and remakes using that formatsong from that trailer,2023-07-19
ghost protocol is the one that hasn’t aged well everything in dubai is fantastic but the climax of the movie is pretty mid and the lead up to dubai is somewhat forgettable,2023-07-12
i know full well that this opinion is in the minority but ghost protocol is the most forgettable movie in the franchise,2023-07-13
i’d say the moment of suspense and tension building scenes felt a lot like rogue nation and the first movie,2023-07-13
"the central conflict with regards to our villain john lark kept getting rewritten in every scene we start out the movie being told that with solomon lane in prison his vast criminal network is in disarray and that john lark has stepped in to fill the power vacuum and get these cells working toward his vision of a new world order the fake news footage mi cooks up involves attacks on major powerful cities and debruuk reacts with glee seeming that this is what the manifesto was all about

so then ethan pretends to be john lark when he goes to meet the white widow she brokers a deal to bring in this mysterious and powerful figure who might possibly be the most dangerous man in the world and why is he there so he can be a wheelman on a rescue operation theyve already planned theres no real fear or deference in the way the old rogue nation guys speak to him its like hes just some guy hired on as a driver then the rescue operation springs solomon kane who apparently is still entirely in control of his old cells so everything we previously knew about john lark is just forgotton

then when we discover that walker is the real john lark what does he do he just tags along as solomons sidekick for the rest of the movie any sense that he had his own vision and plan to make use of solomons resources is completely gone hes just tagging along and then we get to the master plan john lark has been talking about bringing about a new world order tearing down the foundations of western society and how are they going to do that by poisoning a central asian water supply and starving a billion of the worlds poorest people yeah thats totally shaking up the world order all right",2023-07-31

simp much there are a ton of boneheaded nonsensical  happening in this movie people just overthink things,2023-07-18
when you introduce an ai that basically is omnipotent except for crt tvs and typewriters including when it actively sabotaged the team in a critical moment you set up a pretty obvious expectation that technology will not work perfectly unless itll all be explained in part 2 its clearly something i and others have thought about so unless mcquarries answer is the ai wasnt thinking of it then either we have to wait for an entirely new movie to fire that chekhovs gun or it was written without consideration of the ai doing the thing it already did again,2023-07-20
simp much there are a ton of boneheaded nonsensical  happening in this movie people just overthink things,2023-07-18
renner wasnt in fallout either michelle monaghan wasnt in rogue nation but popped up again in fallout though so theres hope maybe,2023-07-12

not for hunt he saw that she indicated it was in zolas pocket that was only for the white widows choice,2023-07-14

i mean he’s not batman he kills a bunch of people in these movies why is pom special,2023-07-14
truthfully i think simon pegg is the one whos going to actually die the fake bomb that tried to learn everything it could about him and no payoff is a hint imo that hes the one whos getting killed,2023-07-13

pulling off a double fakeout death hasnt been tried since kingdom of the krystal skull i think,2023-07-15
yeah i think shes gone for good since they already did the death fake out for her,2023-07-12
where are you seeing that,2023-07-12
she is credited and a lot of the movie barring few major scenes are shot too,2023-07-12
yep silo,2023-07-16
it is but thats the exactly why before luther leaves he urges ethan not to  gabriel because thats what the entity wants him to do through gabriel is the only way they can get to the entity and destroy it so the entity  with ethans emotions by killing ilsa which will prompt ethan to  gabriel and thus losing the only way to stopping the entity you can even see the ethan considers killing him when he had the knife to gabriels throat and almost does it before shea wingham comes and interrupts them,2023-07-12
i guess thats possible too but its not like they planned it out or anything to trick it so i dont think thats it either,2023-07-12
dont forget shes also starring in dune,2023-07-12
she probably gets paid very well and has actual authority its obvious everyone loves her in mission impossible but end of the day shes still just a hired hand and its all about what cruise and mcquarrie wants,2023-07-12

idk why i thought she was much older i guess it’s a mix of women in movies usually being like 22 and the fact that she plays a mom in dune,2023-07-12
ilsa is a far fresher character than ethan luther or benji,2023-07-12
if the story calls for it that’s what needs to happen,2023-07-12
pillars of the earth,2023-08-22
what clues i feel like she has gotta be alive just based off the fact her death felt overwhelmingly unfulfilling and that she was pretty much the most important character in the franchise besides ethan hunt in recent memory,2023-07-15
“who parks like that”,2023-07-19
oh what were the other references,2023-07-13
he also barely used the doctor strange theme when composing the sequel hes just  at using other peoples established themes,2023-07-12
the other side of it is thomas newman just using the exact same song from skyfall again in spectre,2023-07-12
she definitely looked like she was having a total blast wrecking  up in that scene and it was great i’m intrigued what they do with her next i thought “no way she’s anything other than an unhinged assassin” but they’re hinting she might be an ally in part 2 so i’m curious what’ll happen there,2023-07-12
she is coming back she is signed for two movies,2023-07-12
yeah she played notes ive never seen her play she was really unhinged in that chase scene in rome haha and that clockwork orange outfit vibe ,2023-07-12
she was chewing that up loved it,2023-07-12
"she might have been my favorite part in the movie but i really hope that they dont bring her back franchises need to be more ballsy when it comes to killing off cool characters

if everybody comes back from an impossible mission then there are no stakes",2023-07-13
well she is playing the colead in ridley scott’s napoleon biopic so i guess that’s something ,2023-07-12
hobbes and shaw completely agree shes absolutely amazing in that one,2023-07-13
mission impossible 2 isnt even a bad movie its a little messy and its definitely the weakest in the series but john woo absolutely cooks in the third act theres some really good action in there,2023-07-12
it did it in the desktop just a few minutes ago for me i was like  for a second,2023-07-12
didn’t work for me either even when i did a review guess it’ or miss for whatever reason,2023-07-16
oh  guess i shouldve looked that up first good to know but yeah still dont love how it looks,2023-07-12
there was definitely a lot of finishing each others sentences which i found a bit off i know dialogue wasnt great by any stretch in the mi movies but it was just a little too cliché for me,2023-07-13
oh hard disagree the adjutant in the back of the room was ominous and i couldn’t chose whether it was ethan or gabriel the cuts made it chaotic,2023-07-12
do you also scream in libraries,2023-07-16
"it was incredibly dumb

it was also incredibly thematically apt though not focused on how can you beat an ai that can prepare for any “possibility” do something so lucky it’s basically “impossible the ai got gabriel to keep the train speed up which should have been enough to keep ethan off the train but through some bizarre twist of fate ethan happened to get on the train and save grace when basically any ai should think that’s “impossible” like a 000000001 chance he beat the ai by literally doing a “mission impossible” and that’s funny


movie was still pretty so so unfortunately imo",2023-07-14
that’s what makes movies fun  like that entertaining for the sake of entertaining if you need super realistic  go watch maybe bourne or something even that one super unrealistic,2023-07-13
yes but that didnt look like the alps,2023-07-12
"no prob

you should definitely rewatch because it’s awesome she helps luther disarm one of the nukes at the medical camp",2023-07-16
i was in the back  everyone around me was as annoyed at the spoilers trailers as i was,2023-07-12
it’s been confirmed multiple times that dead reckoning will end the ethan hunt mi films,2023-07-13
what no its not,2023-07-30
on a rewatch i try to read the movie eg left is bad middle is neutral and right is good and that just wasn’t possible,2023-07-14
i was fully expecting the van to explode that car and was a little disappointed it turned out to be just a continuity error,2023-07-12
"exactly when they got to the desert sequence in the movie i was like whoa this is awesome i had had no idea there was a desert sequence lo and behold i go to the trailer and it is heavily shown would have ruined all the surprise 

i will legit arrive to other movies late to miss previews and if im in the previews ill put in airpodss and go on my phone glad to see more moviegoers are avoiding trailers",2023-07-12
if you like cgi action i guess it might be your thing,2023-07-12
yeah that part was awesome,2023-07-12
was he really cockney ive heard some dutch people with similar accents,2023-07-16
kitridge was the director who seems to be a different role to the secretary i assume its a political  career split the secretary is politically appointed to supervise the imf or is the secretary of statedefence i always read the secretary as the secretary of state or defence but most sources call them the imf secretary the director is an imf agent promoted up the ranks to run it,2023-07-15
"couldnt they have shown the sub scene without showing the floating sailor with the key

that way we could have seen  the entitys capabilities without knowing it was on the sub all along",2023-07-12
doesnt someone know where the sub is since someone scoop up the keys from the dead bodies,2023-07-14
"all i can presume is that they want to save the juice of their history together for part 2

there was already way too much stuff to explain in part 1 im not too mad that something aside from the final resolution is left for the second chapter to explore 

gives time to theorize",2023-07-13
"we were kinda there there sure was something in the air with lane being kinda obsessed by ethan and ethan by him as well with the nightmare at the beginning of fallout and the whole you should have killed me ethan and the plans lane had for him and ethan to die in kashmir at the end but it felt like scratching the surface of what a real nemesis relationship is like 

you could argue that if davian actually managed to shoot julia and didnt die at the end of 3 hed be the real nemesis since hed have done what theyre implying gabriel has done 

ethan messed with him and he instantly promised him hed find who he loved and would  them no ending the world order no nukes just a man doing his business and dealing with an agent that has gotten in his way smaller scale much more effective",2023-07-13
also it’s revealed later that the intelligence director was the one who set the ai loose so he didn’t need the briefing at all,2023-07-17
it had to be intentional but still was crazy,2023-07-15
"someone had to die to give us stakes in this movie it just so happened to be ilsa are people scared about where the key ends up or are they scared of what would happen when one power gets the key we are supposed to feel forbearance of the threat not from any person but from the entity the stakes arrive from that forbearance by giving us outlandish predictions that come true 

ilsa lost the fight due to her cockiness and show over practical style thats precisely why shes dead she made a mistake and now shes dead had she fenced a bit cleaner and kept her distance it would have worked out just fine

but if we are critiquing action sequences in a mission impossible movie then the nonsense with grace driving and ethan shifting makes no sense without her communicating when shes pressing on the clutch but im not going to use that to say it didnt show motivation the car chase clearly had motivation as did the bridge fight",2023-07-15
fallout is incredible absolutely best in the series,2023-07-22
it’s so weird seeing the first one in a series ranked so low,2023-07-27
she also very clearly enjoys the thrill and violence of her work and is willing to play fast and loose with risk i dont know how you can argue that she isnt chaotic and bloodthirsty,2023-07-14
thats because fallout is  awesome and handles exposition perfectly,2023-07-15
apparently not anymore,2023-07-18
i was extremely tired and forgot that was a thing lol yeah i use those all the time for trips,2023-07-19
"i dont mean to suggest youre wrong to be disappointed that shes gone obviously if you  hermione granger in harry potter people are going to be in arms even if its done for the overall story sam in lotr or even ford prefect in thgttg 

anytime a beloved character is killed there should be people that liked that character to use that death as a reason to dislike the movie i was just chiming in with more of a gestalt observation that a characters death was necessary with this narrative i personally thought it was a red herring and that benji would be the one to get killed ethan didnt have to choose between the two of them he felt like ilsa could run and take care of herself while he needed to protect grace who didnt have the ability to protect herself it was graces selfishness and individual ability to be a solo spirit that got ilsa killed to make the death stick an unceremonious one would be the best approach that unceremoniousness highlights the brutality of the series 

i do think grace shouldnt have joined the imf i think a more fitting end for her would be for her to end up going to jail",2023-07-15
do you guys think that was intentional or is it just a plot hole,2023-07-13
wish that was explained in this one it’s just weird right now,2023-07-13
we shouldn’t have to wait for another movie to understand the villain’s basic motivations,2023-07-13

pacing was on par but much preferred the tone of this one fallout takes itself shade too seriously and this one is much more fun imo,2023-07-13
if only i could tell what was moving forward in those scenes,2023-07-12
"also

too much style over substance who gives a  about gabriel the train sequence was boring waaaaaaay too much dues ex machinas more than normal",2023-07-17
this comment is almost a parody of itself,2023-07-18
how would she have survived a knife to the heart the knife was literally still in her heart when ethan got to her there’s no coming back from that,2023-07-15
if they wanted to give ethan less help the ai could have just infiltrated the coms like we saw in the post party fightchase,2023-07-24
hence why i added that it was a distraction,2023-07-16
"sadly i agree i wanted to like it so much but it felt like a very middle of the road action film nothing about it stood out

at least mission impossible 2 had a unique style even if that style was super cheesy still far more fun than dead reckoning",2023-07-16
"i dont care what they write into her character but it was inconsistent through out the film and her motivation was totally undeveloped

besides that was one thing among many i thought was wrong with this film",2023-07-26
"you dont count the motorcycle jump as an action sequence or are you just jamming that in with the unchartedtrain collapse sequence 

yeah the key thing counts i guess but i took it more to be we dont really give a  by the end of the movie what the key will do but thats fair enough at least we agree most of what they wrote made sense then so thats good",2023-07-13
"yea i didn’t like that they treated us like we were 5 year olds explaining stuff it was cringe

very good marketing made it look like a stylish uniqueoriginal comedy guess it is in many ways with a couple big stars that got lifted by memes dating back over a year all feeding into the hype machine,2023-07-27
yes i agree with you some movies are just meant to be watched without any commitment and be forgotten as soon as the credits roll i wouldnt care but im sad to say this about my favourite franchise thats all,2023-07-13
they are like a mc double and jr chicken respectively too flavour of the same thingboth taste ok but theres too much filler and leave you hungry for a real meal,2023-07-24
"i see also in the white widow meeting scene they show several shots of this 
what is this a music plays when they show this and it was creepy",2023-07-13
this exactly the paris thing is the one im thinking of did she save ethan because thats what she was planning on doing or did she only betray gabriel after he tried to  her and gave her the idea,2023-07-14
i guess i dont see the point in a plot that is simply a series of perfect dominoes set up by the ai to get to the climax if the entity wanted everything to happen the way it did it robs ethan and everyone else of all agency until the very end if thats the case then ive wasted my time watching since everyones treading water powerless to do anything to affect what happens its my problem in general with any super intelligent ai in anything since theres no reason for them not to be omnipotent aside from plot conveniences or the puppet master angle,2023-07-13
yeah thats probably what theyre going for the reality is that if an ai like the entity did come into being it would be like trying to stab a cloud its already over  but they still have to give the heroes a hope i guess,2023-07-14
yeah i follow all of that although i think the movie is trying to make it clear that the post saudi ai entity is different than the one that overwrote 2,2023-07-14
oh absolutely  i just had a question mark like wait does he like her or am i overthinking the next movie will elaborate i’m sure,2023-07-20
this it was so bad to me lol maybe because im in tech watching them talk about ai had me laughing out loud in the theatre,2023-07-24
it was so bad lol,2023-10-17
this isnt my question at all my question is why were the two parts not recovered at the same time by the same person,2023-07-15
yeah i shouldn’t have compared it to that cause it was still so well made i just had a problem parts of the plot and the story in general but the quality and action scenessets were astonishing plus i love tom i still enjoyed it but it was def missing some stuff for me i would rank this below rogue nation and fallout,2023-07-16
i stopped after 25 minutes when whoever tf it was said that this thing whatever the computer bad guy ended up being “started off by altering newspapers and social networks and we didn’t mind because it suited our purposes” couldn’t watch a minute further,2023-12-28
he is every  mi 7 enjoyer in this thread ,2023-07-16
" yeah i read that as explosion my bad

although for the writing as well nothing could’ve been explained better the story telling was clearer than in previous instalments for one and the progression of the story was like i said perfect although you could argue against the storytelling in terms of perspective but this aspect of it is very objective overall",2023-07-15
"the risk of bringing a toy into the airport disguise it the toy as what a codex with nothing on the inside does a nuke have a single distinct look do you know what that look is do nuclear weapons hold a monopoly over codexes

did you watch the movie it was a distraction nothing was going to happen if he didn’t answer the questions because the whole point of it was a distraction to get bengie away from his laptop and put him and his team into a frenzy over the possibility of a nuclear weapon inside the airport to distract them from the key the airport didn’t flag it as a suspicious item for a split second the one who made the distraction did that to get their attention

checked baggage goes through airport security long after you check it in and the airport security would’ve found nothing inside the bag except for a toy you’d think the radiation would’ve been detected i don’t know if you know how airports work but you don’t usually bring your checked bag with you through security yourself",2023-07-16

hurt me more make me feel alive again,2023-07-16
the train scene also heavily inspired by uncharted 2,2023-07-19
hollywood i guess know kojima very well now cause of ds too it makes me happy and excited with bond despite nobody talking about it or pretending it’s not the case both of these films have overt mgs stuff,2023-07-17
the entire reason why i ended up seeing this movie is because the teaser trailer reminded me so much of mgs4 glad im not the only one who was reminded of mgs with this movie,2023-07-23
"its not the first time that mi has had similar plot threads to mgs the syndicate from miv was a organization made up of exoperatives from multiple nations working solely for their own ideals free from any one global super powers control a rogue nation thats basically what big boss strove for militaires sans frontières solders without borders culminating in his ultimate dream of outer heaven 

if they decided to make the macguffin of one of these movies a giant mech i dont think itd be too out of place tbh",2023-07-27
looooooooooooooool it’s not over… not yet part 2 is coming hahaha,2023-07-27
yeah imagine seeing pom and thinking thats a nice french actress lol,2023-07-16
ok we will pretend she doesnt look asian and doesnt have a korean mother named yu ri park,2023-07-16
the real trope explanation is that its just fetish bait lol,2023-07-19
theres a scene of him in joker chasing arthur that looks just like the scene at the airport in this movie,2023-07-29
if you haven’t watched boardwalk empire that’s where i know him from you gotta he’s great in it also steve buscemi is fantastic in that as the main character,2023-07-31
yeah hes a super prolific character actor i honestly didnt know his name but i cant think of any time ive seen him turn out a bad performance always brings his best when he showed up i legit thought oh that guy i like him in other stuff,2023-08-09
me too,2023-09-02
"to be fair vin takes riddick and even the last vampire hunter super serious too bloodshot as well 

he takes every role absurdly seriously",2023-07-18

or is this just a meme thing or something his character is serious sure but thats dom are you guys not able to separate the personas",2023-08-12
"just handing money out to people dosent solve the problems corruption and mismanagement are the primary reasons why yours and millions of people have had their lives destroyed

now since you havent done the courtesy of saying anything other than just venting your frustrations unfortunately theres nothing much to say

i would let hayley atwell hit me with her car pom too,2023-07-21
dont call them bro friend,2023-10-16
"okay i see your point in a lot of this but i never saw it as her being nerfed she is a really good spy but in way over her head with these worldending stakes

imagine if she wasn’t there or had the same skills as ethan during the train escape sequence it would be much less terrifying and exciting",2023-07-28
yeah but 8 minutes while actually swimming and moving around underwater seems more impressive than just sitting there doing nothing,2023-07-17
i thought the trailer dialogue was better i thought it came across like an old friend genuinely fearful for whats to come,2023-07-15
it was a cut scene according to empire films spoiler special episode on fallout they cut it because it was cgid while the rest was practical and decided they liked being able to say the whole scene is real helicopters,2023-07-15
yeah okay i was wondering the same did i miss something whoever retrieved the keys in the water should have both,2023-07-15
isn’ implied or stated that the submarine explosion and the retrieval of the bodies happened quite some time before when the movie is set,2023-07-16
my current theory is that the entity actually wants to be destroyed and its run the math and so far ethan hunt is the only one it trusts to actually be capable enough to find it and choose to  it rather than abduct it and use it for nefarious purposes thus maybe it arranged for different parties to collect the different keys,2023-08-05
exposition doesn’t usually bother me but it really stuck out here especially early on characters are just slamming the audience with the objectives,2023-09-02
"it’s not far off the plot of metal gear solid 2 from 2001 a game that also dealt with evil ai taking over the world and controlling what information gets out or straight up creating new info and everyone is deceiving each other rgames will say the game predicted social media today but it was the present then and a cliche already to have a bad guy creating fake info to control the world

and i believe that game borrowed from the matrix which conveniently came out only a couple years before yes the evil robotsai trope is very played out it’s just that dead reckoning is particularly contemporary now instead of predicting a grim future with the then primitive internet",2023-07-16
yeah it has hundreds of hours of their voices in logs anyway,2023-07-27
yea and they even said that the questions were to learn more about him so that the ai can better predict outcomes,2023-07-31
vanessa kirby does,2023-07-16
im pretty sure they said this one was a fake because it was a different alloy,2023-07-16
"i wonder if tom cruise is involved in casting women for his movies  always strong choices beauty wise

jennifer connelly in top gun maverick for example",2023-07-15
id say she looks way hotter in this movie than in the captain america movies the gratuitous close up shots in this movie didnt hurt,2023-07-18
you should see her in black mirror,2023-07-16
"that seems to be a big takeaway for many here 

its like she got a hotness upgrade at age 41 which is pretty rare",2023-07-24
i noticed that too those were straight up grandpa hands,2023-07-24
ok maybe i exaggerate but easily early 30s  she’s a succussful actress so we can’t count out she may have had help even if it is just having the time and money to take really good and healthy care of one self  i say the same thing about older male celebs  tommy c’s hair is a little too good and brown for his age is all i’m sayin  many of us would take these upgrades if we could though i would,2023-07-23
i don’t think you ever cared what they really thought you just wanted their ,2023-07-12
at least the feeling is mutual please don’t  or kidnap anyone,2023-07-14
you overdosed on the red pill ,2023-07-14
this is factually correct,2023-12-27
yeah so you do need therapy i hope you consider trying it out,2023-07-16
i pointed this out to someone on twitter and they went “a ramp you can’t explain that” while i’m thinking why on earth anyone would care like they cared about a halo jump into paris instead of walking in with a mask on we’re here to see cool  happen on screen,2023-07-17
it somehow looked slower after the full comp,2023-07-15
"you were probably going to watch it anyway as were most fans regardless of seeing the big stunt beforehand or not 

the flip side is that it might have motivated someone who may not have been interested or even aware 

so the cost of spoiling it for you is far less than the gain of a whole other viewer

imagine that but on a global scale and youll see how it more than balances out financially  those trailers were never for you they had your money anyway lol",2023-07-23
the  mountain ramp cg was pretty ropey imo yeah it immediately took away from the practical stunt the same way the train carriages did when falling off the destroyed bridge the water cg woof,2023-07-18
i do feel like fallout was all around better stunts included not that thats a knock really if you like these movies this was a good one probably my favorite after fallout and the one with psh,2023-07-15
super easy barely an inconvenience,2023-07-13
the sequence would have been so much more thrilling if it actually showed him landing on the train imo,2023-07-14
yes but why is he so terrified of that he climbed the burj khalifa,2023-07-12
agreed totally worked for me sounds like only the people who watched bts beforehand were disappointed i watched bts after and was then even more impressed with the whole thing,2023-07-15
the overreliance on kicking was noticeable,2023-07-30
"what actually happens in the movie

inside the party  kicks a guy in the stomach twice grapples with two guys to shield himself causing a third to accidentally shoot one of them punches the other guy in the face stunning him and then using him as a human shield pushes him down once he is clear of the gunman and delivers 3 onscreen elbow strikes before being pulled off him then tackles the white widows brother and punches him in the face

outside the party  running kick to the gut followed by a block a counter to open the guys defenses a punch to the gut and then two big punches to his face before grace causes him to be tangled up  after that he trips one guy up then punches the other guy in the side and flips him then kicks one of them in the face before leaving

in the alley  i wont do a total breakdown of this because there is too much to it  at first hes not even fighting hes trying to get out  then ethan cant really punch theres not enough room to give it power  he mostly kicks and grapples and throwspushes his opponents into the walls of the alley  all the moves make sense in the circumstances

on the train  this fight lasts longer than you seem to remember and is centered around the fact that gabriel has a knife and ethan doesnt  most of the fight is ethan avoiding the knife but he does get some throws and punches in  the fight is interrupted once by light structures and then again by the tunnel  the tunnel allows ethan to get on top of the train first and pin gabriel before he can counter  also they are 100 on the top of a real train  there are pictures and a behind the scenes video

my take is that they are underemphasizing toms fights to make ethan appear a bit more helpless and not in control of the situation  he is often not even in the center of the situation grace or ilsa are and so they get the attention  now maybe tom is slowing down i dont think he is at least not much but in my opinion he is still bringing it",2023-09-09
yes absolutely same page i dig grace and hayley atwell is spot on in the role but i love ilsa she’s ethan’s equal and such a badass in her own right so why not keep both it’s not like the team would suffer for having four other members  forbid,2023-07-24
having the screen presence to truly feel like she stood toe to toe with movie star tom cruise is no small feat i’ve been so impressed with her since she first joined mi,2023-07-28
if next bond is a female yes,2023-08-07
my mans got hbo in a headlock,2023-07-31
yeah that checks out actually his speaking cadence made him sound older he looked kinda just “generically 40”,2023-07-25
but even that makes no sense then  he was the one who sent ethan on the mission to recover the key  if his ultimate ploy was to buy the key off the black market thered be zero logical sense into having ethan go and steal it off the people he was planning on buying it from,2023-08-07
perhaps he is wondering why someone would go to the top of a dangerous moving train so long before he jumps off…,2023-07-12
dr pavel im imf,2023-07-15
 i think some of you are comedians or something else in professional comedy cause these kinda reply chains are just too good,2023-07-17
ok  this is why i love reddit sometimes kudos to all of you,2023-09-09
i think they killed her off because of her dune and other project silo schedule,2023-07-15
this  me off too partly just cause i love rebecca ferguson like they made it clear before they even killed her off that they were setting up hayley atwell as the new love interest and set up the “choice” as if his li for the last 2 movies and some girl he met 30 minutes ago are on equal emotional footing that whole part just rubbed me the wrong way,2023-07-16
yes this is how i felt i literally said to my husband “they can’t have two british hotties on the team” i am still really  about ilsa no reason she needed to die,2023-07-15
also hated how tom cruise got over her death prior to her even dying such a strange forced choice between these two women,2023-07-15
maybe rebecca ferguson is busy with silo,2023-07-14
i have one theory or maybe she is not dead her body is not seen to be buried somewhere or disposed on river also there is going to be twist maybe in part 2,2023-07-14
"thats the one but serious issue i have with the movie it was badly handled we have a shot or sad tom a few lines between benji and grace and then lets go people time is of the essence oh and all hail the new gorgeous female character
sure tom chooses revenge over his mission when hes fighting gabriel but its not dramatic enough it can be about the unknown dead woman from his past we dont care about",2023-07-17
"i didnt like the whole  the women stuff 

my gf literally said out loud whys he thinking of his  in that scene with the lil flashbacks of the their faces 

i just lold so hard",2023-07-17
i think the other lady will be on the team too,2023-07-16
i think she may lead the team when tom cruise hangs up his running shoes,2023-07-17
first thing i thought of when she kicked it was that rebecca ferguson must be getting too expensive for the sequels  but yeah ilsa didnt deserve that it honestly doesnt make any difference if the main bad guy kills her or not hes the villain were always gonna root against him and for ethan to win it felt too soap operaish,2023-10-19
i dont mind that she died but the fight leading up to her death was pretty bad why did she keep going getting up close and personal when she had the advantage with range,2023-11-13
i feel like their relationship has been teased for 3 movies and this is the culmination of it it just feels bizarre and nonsensical to me very disappointing end to a great character,2023-07-12
it was a  fridging,2023-07-12
"if there was ever a time for mission impossible to pull a fast and furious its now

but i think shes dead for good",2023-07-13
"i hope she’s dead i loved her character but not killing her off especially because of the fakeout at the beginning would just feel cheap

i am annoyed that they killed one british female protagonist and replaced her with another british female protagonist though",2023-07-12
no way gabriel could have killed her  ilsa is too bad ,2023-07-16
i agree totally  i was wondering if she would fake her death twice in the same movie why not lol,2023-07-15
im hoping she somehow comes back and yeah i felt theky kind of want you to ship them but ilsa just died and i always loved her character,2023-07-17
ya they never checked for her mask on the bridge lol,2023-07-19
ethan should just never have any romantic interests period ilsa struck that perfect balance where you dont know if their relationship is a romantic one or a professional platonic one and they kept straddling that line with all the movies shes appeared in and that made her more interesting i think she is in a lot of ways the female ethan and to just sacrifice her like that so we can just hate the late game villain a little bit more just feels too cheap and lazy imo,2023-10-19
rebecca ferguson has the most going on of the noncruise cast im sure she wanted to be able to do other  esp when it sounds like dead reckoning might not even be the finale we were promised tom will keep doing these movies until he physically cant anymore,2023-07-12
bro thats reductive and unfair af his movies always cast strong female leads,2023-07-14
would breaking that law would be an impossible mission,2023-07-13
check out silo,2023-07-14
i just want her to be really mean to me lol,2023-07-16
even if they do bring her back it was pretty poorly written,2023-07-19
honestly i really like that too the deaging sequence of indiana jones was really distracting there are other examples but thats the most fresh in my mind with how new it is,2023-07-19
i’m mainly talking about how he was suddenly head over heels over her she was suddenly on par with the other girl almost even more important to him idk felt forced to me,2023-07-14
i think the entity just recruited gabriel because it knew it might go against ethan one day,2023-07-14
" what i want to know is why is gabriel a super spy villain when the backstory makes it seem like he was just some criminal 

i had that issue about the villain in ghost protocol he was some sort of nuclear scientist but he also had all the skills of an imf agent including the mask switcheroo gadgets and stuff that never really added up to me",2023-07-15
he had some botox done around the time of filming there were pictures of him at events with his face all swollen,2023-07-12
not just tom cary elwes too he looked like madame tussaudss version of himself from twister,2023-07-12
shut your mouth you thong wearing fatty,2023-07-12
the entity is the tribal chief,2023-07-12
okay i liked that movie a lot but that part was absurd lol,2023-07-16
yeah of course he had a cable attached still a lot more believable than someone falling off a moving train into a truck theres believable movie physics and then theres whatever that was,2023-07-12
yeah this is the most likely reason the ai probably knew exactly when to time it and knew how much notice gabriel would need to fall off the train the most unplausible part is falling onto a mattress at 60 mph and being completely fine,2023-07-12
yeah i did roll my eyes a tiny bit that the ai knew ethan would bike up the mountain jump the cliff crash into the car that has the key take out the 2 people trying to  him and then accidentally knock the key directly at gabriel’s feet maybe the train was riddled with microphones and cameras and it was constantly updating the plan,2023-07-12
absolute bs lol if it were that easy to get onoff the train tom cruise should have just driven his bike into the train instead of going through all the trouble with scaling that mountain and base jumping,2023-07-18
you should watch devs with nick offerman,2023-07-12
turns out the entire movie is vr and a giant ad for apples new vr headset,2023-07-18
every single character interacted with that environment it wasn’t like the ar glasses which are just projected images,2023-07-12
ngl i went to the washroom during that scene  so i clearly missed something important,2023-07-17
"i remember that scene i just dont remember luther telling ethan that the entity chose gabriel because of his connection to ethan

its not entirely clear when the entity was created but the film does seem to imply that gabriel has been working for it for some time",2023-07-13
thats interesting would they have just cut the whole flashbackethan has a history with the villain storyline if it was hoult,2023-07-16
yeah i kept thinking how was hoult going to play this role he is too young,2023-07-17
crinkle your nose and im yours forever,2023-07-17
characters dont need to speak to have a presence i think the fact that she gave such a compelling performance with interesting development while barely saying a word was more impressive than if shed had a lot to say,2023-07-17
thats what i gathered but i dont know how they did it remotely but yeah they hacked the sub with it in order to mess up the top secret stealth tech it had and it apparently went above and beyond and destroyed the whole sub,2023-07-14
"i agree that the concept of ai as the villain is actually really cool when they opened with a russian sub i thought oh no evil russians again like we’re in the 80s  i just wasn’t so keen on the execution skynet in terminator is so much better 

and your ideas are much better than what they had it makes sense to have a physical person as an antagonist along with the ai if it was someone who treated the ai like a  that i could understand 

agree they should have disconnected it from ethan if they wanted to bring up stuff about ethan’s past they could have had the ai dig up info on ethan to use against him in a more subtle way for example somehow make ethan go back to the exact place where that woman was killed infront of him but the killer who could be this ai obsessive would recreate the  that’s enough to do a call back which is what they did with ilsas death 

but having the person involved be the exact same supposed arch nemesis felt way too convenient and unrealistic

also ilsa knowing who gabriel is as well seemed ridiculous too how does everyone know who gabriel is i think the white widow knew him too  that’s why the party scene felt so ridiculous to me like it’s a bunch of friends reuniting and somehow they’re all involved in this ai scheme with the key",2023-07-15
yeah it’s my gut feeling for how it’s going but we’ll have to see if it pans out in the sequel,2023-07-18
because it doesn’t seem realistic to me if you have an idea would be great if you share how the conversation would go in a way that’s realistic,2023-07-28
"but that is mission impossible to me 

everyone  on mi2 and the more ridiculous elements of the franchise but like obiwan says when he gets to kaminino

thats why im here",2023-07-18
i felt bad for him the dialogue was so monotone and tedious,2023-10-23
definitely i had to readjust myself after feeling like i didnt like this one that much i realized it was because i really  loved fallout and this movie was just very good,2023-07-16
absolutely agreed,2023-07-15
somewhere in the middle it was pretty generic and bythenumbers for the franchise,2023-07-20
totally the casting is the definition of perfect not just for her looks but her performance top to bottom is totally max,2023-07-16
it’s funny when you catch it because when she mentions max ethan stops searching the room and gives her a look it’s easy to think he’s struck by her appearance but it’s like he’s realizing who she is especially when she makes eye contact and says “she had a fascination for paradoxes” which is a total callback to the dialogue in the first film you have to imagine he’s wondering if she knows who he is,2023-07-16
cant fight the friction,2023-07-17
they werent beating the  out of him he was beating the  out of them,2023-07-18
benji your  glove ran out of batteries,2023-07-15
one scene in over 15movies yeah ok,2023-07-15
"the party was confusing to me i guess that went over my head cause we all know ethan isnt like that

this was her first mission though so he was naturally relating and seeing that he was going to need to guide her the rest of the way",2023-07-15
but whos on first,2023-07-14
yea thats the only reason i can think as well but benji specifically says that the female mask is ready so…idk i kinda think it was just for the audience,2023-07-19
"i just meant that none of the characters address the eye color mismatch whatsoever i also expected her to use colored contacts when she didnt i expected someone to catch her on it when nobody caught her i figured the eye color thing was only for the audience

i wasnt really expecting any explanation at that point if they really wanted to go this route for some reason they couldve had a line where benji says they ran out of contacts or tied it in with the mask machine malfunction somehow maybe they mention zola being color blind so he wouldnt notice",2023-07-17
you get stabbed by a  14 year old who then steals 200 pounds from your wallet so he can afford to take the train over to the next town,2023-07-18
that entire sequence at the party is basically just john wick karaoke which it sadly doesn’t really get away with it’s way better at the bond karaoke it does for the rest of the film…,2023-07-15
she was what john wick 2 was going for with rubys character,2023-07-15
felt like bladerunner for me,2023-07-14
luv from br2049,2023-09-02
i  near said “me next” out loud while watching that holy ,2023-07-20
i’ve discovered recently i have a thing for boots in general so combine that with a skirt and it being pom i’m finished,2023-07-16
its worse than that the guy is her brother theyve literally spent most of their lives together i cant imagine not realizing my sister changed her eye color,2023-07-15
and shes talking to the guy whos already been duped by the masks this very movie who directs the team that famously uses these masks and is acting kinda suspiciously,2023-07-18
old comment but the guy does notice shes different,2023-10-11
just so you know you can just type rhayleyatwell instead of the full link and reddit will convert it,2023-07-12
you’re making me believe even though i think she’s actually dead,2023-07-13
i hope this is true shes great and that was a bad death for such a great character,2023-07-13
"that’s a good point his reaction to thinking owen killed his wife in mi3 was raw visceral and unhinged this seemed like…an after thought   


it didn’t even hit luther hard enough after in fallout he told illsa she was one of like 2 women he was ever really serious about   


would certainly be the worst mi exit",2023-07-15
"regarding your first point i had the exact same reaction i was wondering why the death scene didn’t feel impactful and your first point is why ethan seemingly moves on immediately i get that the mission has to be finished but it’s literally the next scene the team is talking about how to get the key on the train

still i think she is dead dead the death fakeout could have been foreshadowing for an actual death and her being cast in the next film could either be 1 flashbacks or 2 a trick to the audience to not spoil the death scene 

this is a television example and spoilers for the white lotus but mike white cast jennifer coolidge for season 3 before the season 2 finale aired only for coolidge’s character to slip off a boat and die

there is precedent so i think she is actually dead and the film simply didn’t do a good job of making it an impactful moment",2023-07-13
"i really really hope shes alive i adore ilsa


i also agree it felt pretty off with hunts reaction to it not even a tear",2023-07-13
"i was actually thinking the same thing

the entity can predict everyones next move and manipulate things via gabriel to optimise its future survival

it cant predict what a dead person will do however so ethan and team thought that faking ilsas death would be their ace up their sleeve",2023-07-14
i hope she comes back and they get to ride off together,2023-07-14
2 also he faked his wifes julias death in mi2 so i would say there are at least 2 precedents,2023-07-16
i feel like with the narrative stuff they just wanted the first part to have a satisfying narrative arc on its own so people wouldnt walk out of the theater feeling like they watched a full film that was cut in half thats how i felt when i watched the new spiderverse movie i walked outta the theater  af bc i genuinely thought the whole credits was just an intermission so while my friends were waiting for an aftercredits scene i was waiting for the  film to continue  still liked it though when i walked out of the theater after this one i was satisfied because it had a contained arc i might be wrong though about spiderverse not having a proper arc because i wiped 90 of both movies out of my brain 10 minutes after leaving the cinema p,2023-07-15
he did go back to the balcony where they shared the hugs overlooking the big church thought that seemed like an end cap,2023-07-18
gabriel is not the villain hes the ruse to trick the entity thats the delivery guy in a mask,2023-07-18
i love the idea that a fakedeathd ilsa would now be a ghost in the machine,2023-07-17
nice one i algo think this to be the case,2023-07-20
im in denial too interesting that both ilsa and paris had a knife plunged into their left upper chest and paris still has a heartbeat when part 1 ended,2023-07-31
nah shes gone hayleys character is the successor and fills in the same plus different boots for ethans character,2023-07-15
i was so  they killed her off but your theory is getting my hopes up,2023-10-02
i want to believe but two faked deaths for the same character in quick succession seems a bit of an awkward writing choice,2023-11-13
"thats a pretty interesting theory

luther was all like to beat this ai you have to think like a machine blablabla my first thought was that no to beat it you have to be unpredictable 

ilsa going after gabriel not to truly  him but to fake her own death would be something very unpredictable introducing variables the entity didnt take into account

it would also be satisfying since my wife was  that ilsa wasnt stabbing gabriel and was trying to grab his neck with her legs or something so itd be satisfying if it were on purpose lol",2024-03-03
"lest we forget paula’s villain in ghost protocol…
lea seydoux  girl was in both mi and bond",2023-07-13
"oh yeah how could i forget paula patton too 
anil kapoor didnt stand a chance of turning her down ",2023-07-16
i just want an alliance of all the spies who have teamed up with ethan yet to give it a good roundoff in part 2,2023-07-22
that frisking scene,2023-07-13
"she was indeed incredibly beautiful

pity she had some really bad cosmetic surgery and looks like this despite being only 59


shes also campaigned in the past to raise awareness about the pitfalls of cosmetic surgery after a botched lip job",2023-07-13
"emmanuelle beart in manon of the spring 1986 is arguably one of the most beautiful women ever on screen link is to a still from the film

the movie is a sequel to jean de florette it makes much more sense if you see that before manon",2023-07-14
hope she comes back for mi8,2023-07-13
pom in her goth makeup and skirt was making me feel things,2023-07-12
 just got out of the theater at 9pm,2023-07-12
they were given to her as a means of torture by thanos…,2023-07-12
of course these things are subjective but she gives potential crazy exgf vibes,2023-07-13
natalie dormer face shape and structure seem pretty normal,2023-07-16
yeah it’s like “are yall alienhuman spliced things”,2023-07-27
this is gonna blow your  mind but 25 year olds can have kids,2023-07-12
yea sorry i wasn’t disagreeing with the “shoot her” scene being dumb,2023-07-15
dude same i was like everyone in this room is a halogram controlled by the ai i think we gave the movie too much credit lol,2023-07-16
i’m thinking it’s shot that way for mobile phones or perhaps for the actor’s ego part of the problem is that the constant focus on their faces caused a disconnect where they didn’t look like they were reacting appropriately to what was happening,2023-07-22
i thought it was odd that they showed a moment where they scanned the key but earlier in the movie they said that the only way to verify the key was by obtaining the other half why show them scan it if you’re not going to have them try to make a copydecoy also why does ethan carry a lighter,2023-07-22
"the parachute thing has at least some excuse since the second chute ethan uses has a special rigging that only works for one person it looks like its meant more for travel since we see him whipping and flipping to change direction and gain momentum they even use a special name for it i just cannot remember it right now

its still a lazy plot element with not a lot of setup but the movie give you the bare minimum with that one",2023-07-22
what forward and back a train is a very awkward place to start a gunfight ,2023-07-20
"i thunk its implied everyone is gunning for control now

i think kittridge wanted ethan to get the key but didnt know hed be on the train as in hes plan was always to buy it but hoped ethan would get it first

basically hes too far gone to destroy it but knows ethan can 

idk it was really confusing

edit upon further rewatch carys character went off grid to the train meeting because he wanted to ally with gabriel  he knew kittridge was going to do the deal and basically thought he could sweet talk the entity and gabriel out of interfering

kittridge was there per the instructions of the us his boss cary idk how his mission monologue at the end to ethan fits in i assume its going to be sent to ethan in part 2 

also sheas character has a personal connection to ethan that weve yet to find out i think it has something to do with marias death",2023-07-13
it sounds like kittridge was there for the deal then the director was going to take the key from him anyway,2023-07-13
i think its established at the start that the director isnt aware of the imf and after learning of it wants to partner with gabriel to cut kittridge and the imf out of the picture,2023-07-15
kittrige was there on behalf of the us the dni was there only for himself,2023-07-16
i think kittridge either wants the key so the us becomes teh data superpower or wants teh entity destroyed in a if we cant have it scenario the director seemed to want it for himself,2023-07-15
grace starts with key half 1 in that scene i think its the white half then she puts it in zolas pocket during most of that club its there then she takes it back out and runs,2023-07-16
my point was that the ai is not some skynet or ultron who wants to end all of humanity so far all the things the ai has done have been mainly for selfpreservation,2023-07-19
and i  hate them for killing her i was bummed for the next 5min after that sequence,2023-08-09
this  also grace knew where the key was so she is both more important at that moment and less capable,2023-07-16
not to mention the 1meter length advantage ilsa had with a sword against gabriels kitchen knife,2023-07-15
suffering of himself too i see because he got knocked around a few times in the fight too it certainly was a close one,2023-07-20
that’s a cool idea hadn’t considered that,2023-07-22
youre completely right i mean he even stops moves away takes the time to look around whe straightening his cuffs and adjusting his cufflinks while he looks around after shes already on the ground and he could  her easily instead its clear hes waiting for ilsa to show up but not going to wait so long that ethan could get there,2023-07-30
i still want maggie q and renner to come back,2023-07-15
yeah i’m genuinely curious why michelle monaghan got the return over those three,2023-07-18
next to ilsa the way hayley atwell’s character was depicted made it seem to me like she was there to be a pretty face a hot “bond girl” type  that really took me out of the story because ethan isn’t the type of guy to catch feelings for every new acquaintance he meets  that’s why his relationship with ilsa felt real and why the dynamic with grace doesn’t  idk…to me it felt like a disservice to both characters,2023-08-24
still liked it but i agree it’s mid tier mi they even recycled set pieces from fallout like the wrong way european roundabout and the train falling off the cliff,2023-07-13
reverting to type maybe fallout was the best by miles,2023-11-07
i think her still being alive was just done for the implications of what she knows being shared beyond just ethan and gabriel so the next movie isnt just a 1v1 race to the sub,2023-07-14
or they confirmed her alive status to leave us a clue that ilsa could still be alive considering she got stabbed in like the exact same place with a similar blade,2023-07-12
gabriel taunted him by offering the choice which obviously he refused to make,2023-07-14
love her in doctor sleep,2023-07-12
watch silo,2023-07-13
if she ends up being alive i see that as a real possibility as many hints it could happen are in the movie i’ll probably end up liking this one a good bit more after ilsas death i was kind of  off for a bit,2023-07-13
"sure ethan and grace have good chemistry but it just feels more flirty while isla and ethan have an actual deep emotional bond that has been expanded upon and shown through 3 movies now 

i just don’t understand setting up another love interest after “killing” the best one off in the worst way possible that along with a lot of little clues they left around make me believe this has to be a fake out death

and the thing is they could have killed someone besides isla and i would have been fine with it luther in particular would have been a bold choice he and benji essentially do the same stuff plus luther has been in these movies since the beginning so you can  him off to show the high stakes of this mission without sacrificing the development that has gone on throughout the series

i’m not saying i will hate the franchise if they go through with death but it will hinder 5 and 6 on rewatches if they keep it permanent all the scenes setting up ethan and isla will be pointless and seeing ethan be able to move on from julia will feel off as well",2023-07-12
disrespectful feels the best way to put it sad as it may be i really loved then in 5 and 6 and here its just like ok gone but its fine we have a replacement and ethan will use his sad memories to protect the replacement,2023-07-12
considering only the main action sequence and one international location action sequence is remaining we’ll probably get some info soon,2023-07-12
okay,2023-07-16
the team’s response to ilsa’s death was so muted i started to wonder if cruise or mcq had an actual grudge against her…,2023-07-13
"her being well rounded shouldnt make her immune to dying there should be a feeling that anyone could die in these missions otherwise the audience will feel like there arent any stakes 

what did irk me was that she was a great characterwho seemed to have been replaced almost immediately by another beautiful woman who ethan also has to save",2023-07-12
"i do wish she had a little more to do before she died but she did sacrifice herself to save hayley atwell so that is some depth 

also the only reason gabriel got away was due to sheer  luck

in what way was it luck he had the truck parked exactly where it needed to be he knew ethan needed him alive so he wasnt worried about being killed  he probably lost the fight on purpose just to  with him he had all of the leverage in that scene aside from ethan swiping the key that whole third act went pretty much exactly as he planned it",2023-07-12
the “well rounded” argument makes no sense should a character die only if they’re one dimensional ilsa’s death feels meaningful and emotionally impactful because she’s a well rounded character what you’re describing as a flaw just feels like good storytelling to me,2023-07-12
still i wouldn’t say she was fridged just because she didn’t die in the climax or in a noble yet fatal victory over the bad guy sometimes good guys don’t die at the end and sometimes they don’t win emilio estevez lasted about as long as drew barrymore did in scream,2023-07-12
what a disingenuous take for me it was badly done considering how the franchise has been building and it’s method and point in the story was sloppy not that i can’t handle her dying it doesn’t sound like the person you’re aiming that at in the thread is acting like a baby either,2023-07-12
"it’s not even that she died it’s that her death makes 5 and 6 a little worse because all they set up between her and cruise literally goes nowhere it was a weird and unsatisfying spot for her to die for a character she doesn’t have any relationship with and she’s dead before cruise even gets there

i get why they did it but if this is a permanent death there’s a lot of clues this could be fake out it was the worst possible way they could have done it",2023-07-12
it hurt my feelings so its bad writing is the worst thing to ever happen to modern media discourse,2023-07-12
ya like when cary elwes gets stabbed in the neck you just see a puddle of blood but none coming out of him or on his clothes,2023-07-17
i think its also due to chinese censorship they dont allow blood in their movies  ,2023-10-12
hoffmans presenceacting was more intimidating,2023-07-19
"im convinced the favorite movie between mi46 correlates strongly with being around 1316 years of age at the time it came out like for me ghost protocol is obviously better rogue nation and fallout because i was in that age band in 2011 

and the multiple comments here about how fallout is clearly the best seems to agree with how the reddit demographic skews",2023-07-14
it’s common consensus that fallout is the best but  i can see someone saying 1 and 4 are better 3 is painfully mediocre and only better than 2 but worse than everything else there’s literally nothing that 3 does better than fallout,2023-07-15
" rogue one

rogue nation

interesting id slot fallout and ghost protocol ahead of dead reckoning but its your opinion",2023-07-13
i would have a hard time believing that gabriel is that bad at killing people,2023-07-14
"also we dont know how much later ethan actually arrived to the scene

also paris died anyways no",2023-07-14
they had a lot of scheduling difficulties especially with filming during the height of covid,2023-07-13
i think youre joking but if not the entity doesnt read minds it predicts outcomes based on a persons past actions and the info it has on you,2023-07-12
well it can’t do that,2023-07-12
"the corny and completely unearned “don’t do it ethan don’t  him” moment

it wasnt supposed to be emotional but merely practical gabriels supposedly the only one that knows what the key opens so killing him would diminish the chances of finding the thing and destroying it",2023-07-13
"not just a “helicopter sequence”…

tom cruise actually learned how to fly a helicopter",2023-07-13
and lorne balfe’s score,2023-07-14
that paris chase is so  good the music and the tension before the chase gives me absolute chills genuinely might be one of my favourite film scenes ever,2023-07-13
"mission… accomplished

gets me every time i miss jeremy renner’s character",2023-07-16
i think there is no point of argue which movie in the franchise didnt aged well when such things as mi 2 exist ,2023-07-17
part 3,2023-07-13
yeah the john lark stuff certainly wasn’t the strongest part of the movie but i wouldn’t say therefore the plot just makes no sense more like the villain’s motivations and position doesn’t,2023-09-14
yes they dont switch off when you lose phone signal they literally follow lane markings and keep the car inside inside read road signs for speed limits etc its not a server at google doing that,2023-07-12
yeah no youre right that its just a bmw but im guessing they probably just do some little additions to their cars like the way the yellow fiat was all suped up,2023-07-12
rogue nation’s bmw nor dead reckoning’s fiat were normal they’re vehicles equipped with imf tech,2023-07-17
well the movie explains that they use analog radio to send messages to eachother so the ai cant interfere if you cant understand that then maybe you need to go back to kindergarten i know i do,2023-07-14
and thats what it is a movie there doesnt have to be a perfect explanation for every little thing was the plot too expositional and overconvoluted well no duh but complaining about a computer having gps when the imf has devices that can fake other peoples faces or gloves that can stick to windows at that point youre just looking for things to complain about,2023-07-18
oh oops i just watched them too i thought he had a bit part but i guess he didn’t,2023-07-12
wasnt renner supposed to return for dead reckoning i assumed he wasnt in fallout because of scheduling issues with avengers infinity war,2023-07-16
not sure he can after his injuries,2023-07-13

well he didn’t have to  her he doesn’t just execute people in cold blood,2023-07-16
for some reason guy noticed shes not worth killing and there was frustration behind that wall pipe hit,2023-07-14
i think it used that to study his voice so it could lure ethan it said u r dunn to him in the alleyway,2023-07-13
"except it didnt 

this wasnt like a random cameo death to add to ethans backstory like in this film and 3 it was their most 3 dimensional character and she was basically fridged for ethan  ie shock value

frankly its insulting they take the only main cast woman take away her characterss agency and off her like that 

compare it to gamoras death in infinty war thats how you respectfully  off a strong female character when the story calls for it

if its misdirection then ill eat my hat",2023-07-14
"the clues i hold to it being a fakeout would be the language and reactions used by each of the other three imf members we barely see hunt react at all to it and benji and luther talk to grace about it grace specifically says that she died and luther says no youre alive because of her no one really affirms that shes dead and we know this team loves to use masks and fakeouts as well as the knife being a switchblade and she had her hand on it as she was stabbed and if im remembering correctly the original mi movie in 1996 also had a fake knife death on a bridge  

 in connection with what the other commenter said the nonchalance that it was all dealt with seemed like a choice to set up the fake out the tricky maneuver i believe she isnt really dead but its a secret move so the team can deceive the entity and gabriel if ilsas dead to the ai then she can be anywhere do anything i think well get a mask reveal or something in act ii of the next one if im wrong im wrong no sweat but definitely feel like this was a trick personally i dont love that they did it if theyd just cut the first one then itd be great that addition is inexplicable but thats how i read the situation",2023-07-17

but ilsa was never cocky thats not her character and she wasnt acting like that before or during the fight with a lot of fight scenes today the actors just do ridiculous twirls and strikes that have no utility in a fight which is ultimately fine if you are trying to tell a story between the characters during a fight but there wasnt really one to tell here ilsa wasnt doing anything that put herself out there enough to deserve to die she was just spinning around with her sword so that it would look cool for the audience and then gets stabbed,2023-07-15
its not a bad movie its just so different to what the series is today,2023-07-28
i dont remember seeing her  anyone she didnt didnt need to  to get to her objective sure shes an absolute force of willpower but thats it i didnt see her  anybody that didnt aim in her goal,2023-07-14
yup even the quieter scenes i fallout felt so riveting and intriguing like the first briefing ethan receives about john lark the cinematography and lighting in the movie was noticeably softer compared to previous movies and gave all the scenes this ethereal glow which i really liked the color palette of the film was also gorgeous,2023-07-15
"it’s funny you say that i also got the sense that both benji and ilsa were going to die early into the movie 

that’s a good point about why ethan sticks to grace over ilsa he knows she needs more help than ilsa and trusts the latter to be fine on her own",2023-07-15
i think it was intentional so that we the audience could keep track of whos who,2023-07-15
it would have to be intentional as vanessa kirby cant have ended up in brown contacts accidentally,2023-07-17

"999999999 times out of 1000000000 that airline worker notices the bag slide off the scale rechecks it and sees the bomb they don’t just throw unchecked bags onto the belt and even after all that you need to then count on benji noticing a split second of a flagged bag  

but sure it’s a movie so whatever they take risks but then to tell me he risked getting arrested by bringing a fake nuke into an airport just to distract ethan for 30 seconds and for what purpose ethan meets up with the girl again as soon as he gets to rome how did the nuke accomplish anything significant why on earth would they ever need to fake a bomb just hire someone else with the fake crypto to distract him if you do in fact need to",2023-07-16
well im sorry you didnt enjoy it but hopefully its not affecting you to such a degree that youre weeping over it,2023-07-13
yup that’s the entity’s “face”,2023-07-13
well depending on what the big motivation of the ai is like maybe it wants ethan to be the new gabriel all the dominoes could be slowly changing ethan’s mind from “destroy it” to “use it”,2023-07-13
"lol have you ever checked a bag they check it while you’re standing there not after it’s on all the belts how would that even make sense if your sneaking something in your bags they catch you while you still have your bag   
 
tell you what you bring a big metal “toy” that looks like a sophisticated nuke so much so that a person who happens to have experience with nukes thinks it’s a nuke and see if the airport gets you in trouble or not   

benji being distracted didn’t even matter luther completely took over for him ethan was distracted for 30 seconds but they could have done soooo many easier things to distract him also it didn’t matter that he got distracted because the girl still left with the key and he was the first person she saw in italy",2023-07-16

they said the bodies showed up when the ice thawed so in theory the two bodies could have been recovered in different places,2023-07-15
sure but they likely didnt know they were a pair and were sold off separately,2023-07-15
interesting i didn’t get that impression but you may be right,2023-07-16
its a fun idea but there would have to be more to it  its extremely anticlimactic to get to the end and for the entity to be like thanks ethan i knew you could do it,2023-09-09

hes always involved he handpicked ferguson for rogue nation after watching her in the white queen,2023-07-15
toms a producer and hes been choosing the director since mi 1 with how involved he is i cant imagine he wouldnt want to have a huge say in the casting of major supporting characters,2023-07-15
i loved that it was jennifer connelly and not someone half his age it was so refreshing,2023-07-15
hes involved in casting every major role for his movies he is top dog on the set,2023-07-15
he also worked with her in one of his first movies,2024-01-25

fallout’s script and pacing was much tighter plus cavil’s standout guest performance,2023-09-02
it wouldnt have worked with how he eventually landed though and i definitely prefer the way they showed him getting to the train than anything else they couldve done,2023-07-16
there was a bit more planning time for that sort of he did not know he had to jump for the train until he got up to the ledge,2023-07-12

what annoys me is that this movie basically backs down from ilsa being ethans equal she really was his equal in the previous films but now she was killed by gabriel who isnt nearly on ethans level in the time it took ethan to run to them,2023-08-29
lol its funny because he was on hbos perry mason too,2023-08-11
and no reason to put out  bounty on ilsa at the beginning of the movie,2023-10-14

tell me about the entity why does it need the key,2023-07-19
"if she actually wanted out id understand but i just dont see the need of introducing grace immediately and having her clearly be the replacement

in fact that made the grabiel scene anticlimatic for me the you have to choose between these two women only one can live i was like what the  its choosing between a woman you love and someone you met literally two days ago how is that a choice",2023-07-15
i hope they had a good reason but it wouldnt change the fact that mcq handled it poorly,2023-07-17
itd be much more interesting if the choice were between benji and luther at least we know ethan cares about both of them and would call back to earlier when ethan refused to say whos better also the audience would care about the stakes like i really did not care if grace lived or died,2023-07-16
yup like i said in another comment its a choice between a woman he loves and a woman he just met like two days ago how is that even a choice i felt that plotline does a disservice for both characters as it feels like their only purpose is to be there for ethan to have something to lose,2023-07-15
id be all for it normally but they already did one fake out death for her in this movie not to mention poms death was a fake out too having ilsa not die means three deaths in this film are fake outs and at that point its kinda lame,2023-07-14
im hoping for this too did not see any blood she was an amazing character,2023-07-17
exactly especially right after they were just cozying up together when she said its her first time in venice like wth,2023-07-15
no joke im lowkey offended if yhats what they did to one of the best characters in the series,2023-07-13
"i feel its unfair to say that given just how well to me cruise does female characters in films he stars in in the modern era 

emily blunt in edge of tomorrow was amazing 

rebecca ferguson amazing 

even the villain girls he has he just really knows how to give female actors a chance to shine in his work and he does it without it being pandering and without it being some kind of political reaction",2023-07-14

yeah shes lovely",2023-07-14
i can understand that but he actually acted the part  i guess what im getting at is the chance that gabriel would actually be so capable seems low to me,2023-07-14

"what about this

",2023-07-14
" maybe the train was riddled with microphones and cameras

like smartphones

the ai wouldnt need to plan to that granular level of detail anyway gabriel is highly capable himself if ethan doesnt make it on the train then gabriel just kills kittridge and takes it or the white widow if she doesnt make the deal",2023-07-14
hoult was going to play a kid on the train in the first movie who got his holiday to paris ruined,2023-07-16

hard to say  christopher mcquarrie writes a lot of the underlying story in realtime as they shoot so it could have been any number of things,2023-07-16
my money is on the role being rewritten significantly for morales,2023-07-22
haha yeah that’s the one  the smile and the nose crinkle,2023-07-17
its a superpowerful ai it has all the tools available it has predictive intelligence did you know that we can already learn more about a person than their husband or wife based on analyzing just 10 likes on facebook so the ai would know exactly what to do you dont have to imagine the conversation you just have to imagine a practically godlike intelligence knowing what to say and how to groom someone into doing what they want this happens all the time without fancy ai so i am not sure what there is to doubt feed your lifetime of decisions communications and personality into the entity yeah it will be able to say exactly what you want to hear,2023-07-28
actually so happy to see how much love fallout is getting that movie was so  good for me it goes fallout ghost protocol and then dead reckoning part 1 this beat rogue nation for sure but couldnt top fallout absolutely a contender for goat action movie nor how surprisingly awesome and fun ghost protocol turned out to be at least for me plus i thought the stunt on the khalifa was awesome,2023-07-17
im really hoping theres a scene in part 2 where ethan tells her how he knew her mother,2023-07-16
she leaned into the redgrave quirks too  she did that nose scrunchy thing that redgrave did a lot when eha flirted with cruise in the mi 1,2023-07-21

no because same i will gladly link you to other “scenes” she’s done you may like if you want,2023-07-20
thats right lol the movies lighting purposefully accentuates how striking her eyes are for the last 2 movies and then decides to have her own brother stand within half a foot of her face to face and think nothing of it straight bad writing lol,2023-07-15
"i said before watching the movie that if she dies i am done with the franchise but i will be there for part 2 day one lol i think shes dead dead which is odd because the reason everyone likes her so much is because shes the only female character of the franchise that really looked to be ethans equal she basically overshadowed cruise in rogue nation i suspect maybe ferguson wanted out and they had to adapt

while watching the movie you can see how they really try hard to establish grace as the new female lead and they mostly succeed but man ilsa cant be topped in my book",2023-07-14
was it really a death fake out though nobody watching the trailers would have believed she was dead i knew she was alive and was trying to fake out the bounty hunters that were after her,2023-07-16
i won’t tire of it  i’ll endure it if it means ilsa is alive,2023-07-16
also those knives were not gabriel’s  who knows if one was a trick knife also there was no blood not even pooling underneath her i think she’s still alive there just wasn’t an adequate amount of mourning for her character that is very out of character for mi movies ethan always says that their lives mean more than missions to him the entity can’t predict analog human trickery like a fake knife and some good acting,2023-07-15
is she really an equal like ilsa was though ilsa was basically the female ethan hunt,2023-07-15
i kid you not and this is completely true but i didnt realize seydoux was the same actress in both gp and the bond movies until i rewatched gp last week i completely forgot she was in mission impossible,2023-07-13
i completely agree but i think she suits brunette better personally mission impossible is her personal peak in my opinion,2023-07-14

kitteridge now has grace who also knows about the sub,2023-07-14
i thought ilsa got stabbed near the heart whilst paris was stabbed in the stomach region,2023-07-12
this feels like a big cope they already did a fakeout death on her once it would make no sense to do it again,2023-07-13
"i legitimately have never been this mad about a characters death in a movie or tv show the way they treated her character felt so disrespectful even to the franchise itself because like you say it retroactively tarnishes 5 and 6 

the decision of killing her how she was killed the complete lack of reaction from the rest of the gang how she was literally replaced like  for buzz and even the way the character was portrayed for the stretch she was alive were all so terrible that it actually makes me think rebecca ferguson mustve  off tom cruise in real life

loved her character love the actress im crushed",2023-07-18
"not just that the entire plot of fallout started because and coming from luther himself ethan would not let me die

i love luther but he unfortunately has more red flags than ilsa did",2023-07-16
i feel the exact same,2023-07-13
wait do you have a source on this i thought they filmed both together and assumed they had already wrapped and part 2 was in postproduction now im bummed that the writersactors strike might bog this down,2023-07-16
meh i don’t care about people dying in these movies stakes of death don’t necessarily matter for these movies imo same with stranger things i like watching these movies and that show for the action and the cast,2023-07-12
"she did sacrifice herself to save hayley atwell so that is some depth 

she sacrificed herself to save a character she had no interactions or connection with thats depth im sorry i just dont see it it felt forced unless its a misdirection 

in what way was it luck

he would have died if not for those cops stopping ethan 

he knew ethan needed him alive so he wasnt worried about being killed  he probably lost the fight on purpose just to  with him he had all of the leverage in that scene aside from ethan swiping the key that whole third act went pretty much exactly as he planned it

that is not what happened and youre just adding stuff that wasnt part of the movie dude pleads to ethan that he knows what the key unlocks basically begging for his life and gets lucky that cops show up parking a truck isnt some genius move he just had to jump at the right time because ai did all the work for him",2023-07-12
i mean from a train going at that speed to jump off and land perfectly in a truck bed even if you have a timer to go off thats ludicrously perfect timing tho not out of the realm of belief for the mi series anyway,2023-07-12
"usually when a major characters die you expect some storyline that makes their death satisfying from a narrative standpoint ilsa gets nothing in this movie like not a shred of depth her character had in previous two films and just dies

im assuming the she has a pulse thrown there at the end would imply shes alive and will return in part 2 otherwise that line would be extremely bizarre lol,2023-07-14
maybe ilsa faked her death without ethan knowing,2023-07-12
"i know but ethan wanting to  him was meant to be this big angry emotional moment  “they killed his lover and now he’s big mad seeing red” which has honestly been done to death a million times better before 

except that even though ilsa was a huge fan favorite nobody feels anger towards gabriel in that moment on top of the train because there’s nothing there they realize he’s just a puppet of  writing and who the  even is this guy just a bland nobody who appears out of nowhere and suddenly they want us to care because oh my  he killed ethan’s gf from 30 years ago who we’ve never heard of before

he may as well have been ethan hunt’s long lost adopted brother who’s never been mentioned before that’s how forced and   this was",2023-07-14

thats fair points,2023-07-14
the ai likely could have already been doing that by benji just giving directions,2023-07-13
"it did because it established the stakes and the power of what the ai could do creating a scenario via technology and gabriel where it’s prediction of either grace or ilsa that dies was interesting

and i don’t buy any of this “fridging” business and woman agency blah blah that’s nonsense ilsa literally made the choice herself to die and supporting characters being hurt or taken out to emotionally charge the narrative is classic storytelling 

it also reinforced the point that ethan drives home to grace later it doesn’t matter that ethan and ilsa didn’t know her like that being the people they are other people’s lives will always matter more than their own",2023-07-14

yeah same before seeing the movie i was like “we still have ilsa and they’re bringing in grace and not to mention the white widow so the only way to differentiate paris from the other female characters is through making her an evil henchman assassin whose sole role in the movie is that” and while we don’t know for sure that she’ll team up with ethan and friends we see hints that she might not be a villain in part two i didn’t expect gabriel to turn on her and i definitely didn’t expect her to save ethan and grace so clearly there’s more to her than what we thought,2023-07-12
thats literally how i just described it to a friend it absolutely feels like a fever dream,2023-07-15
"i think thats kind of for 2 reasons

1 the rest of the series is significantly better

2 it really feels like a movie that came out in the late 90s or early 2000s the rest of the movies in the series feel almost timeless but this one has a very distinct style that kind of blends in with the other action movies of that time you could argue thats just because every other movie of that era desperately wanted to feel like a john woo movie but it definitely does still feel its age in a way that i think the first movie avoids",2023-07-12

it’s a codex also benji isn’t an expert in nukes he may have some knowledge but not an expert what threw him off is how it “activated” and how he was tricked into thinking it’s a suspicious item the baggage check people didn’t see any nuclear device in there or anything that looks like a bomb just a codex a codex with no explosive properties or any radiation

"its choosing between a woman you love and someone you met literally two days ago how is that a choice

its been established in nearly every movie that ethan would not choose one life over another he would try to save everyone",2023-07-18
this was my first mi film so as someone with no prior attachment to ilsa i found it kinda funny right after her death when they got grace on board i thought oh look they already got her replacement lined up how convenient especially because of them both looking similar also ethan annoyed me with how trusting he was with grace even after she betrayed him like 5 times just for him to keep trusting her and insisting on dragging her back into his business after she tried to get you run over by a train man but i dont really care that much it was pretty funny and i thought he deserved it hehehe,2023-07-15
aside from grace constantly betraying him i thought that choice were the only flaws in the writing i do believe it’s as if someone else said she had a busy couple of years they had to write her out,2023-07-16
if anything i thought itd show some new dimensions of ethans obsessive loyalty to his friends its standard protagonist fare to be willing to die for your loved ones but who would you be willing to  for them,2023-07-24
i googled and they say ilsa and ethan were not in a relationship but i thought they were dating ,2023-07-16
"because ethans conscience cant allow him to make that choice like in fallout something deep in your core wont allow you to choose one life over millions 

its actually the reason i love ethan hunt as a character so much its almost captain americaesq hes like the ultimate in chaotic good he just cant be the one to make the sacrifice play unless he is the one being sacrificed

"thats why i was hoping for some alternate twist someone else dying instead of those two

i get it they wrote the whole the entity has already decided your fate and that had to stick in this first part for things to progress in the second part but man was it just a poorly done subplot because its so cliche and it was quite clear who would die  i think i called ilsa dying well before that scene as well",2023-07-15

kind of like how ethan managed to parachute into the train at the exact location and time to save his friend,2023-07-12
yeah i get that it shows his faith in the entity as basically an all knowing  but even an ultra smart ai would need such precise details about his exact location speed wind etc in order for i pull that off like how can  sure there isn’t some small unforeseen latency in transferring his info to the entity or vice versa my biggest problem with the entity pulling the hat  off is it relied on hardware to work perfectly 100 of the time which is never the case,2023-07-12
but then if all it take are physic calculations then we have a self aware ai,2023-07-13

"i completely agree the death  me off so much i stayed mad until the final couple set pieces and even then it was still right in my mind

all the stuff you mention is why i think it almost has to be a fake out maybe ferguson had a scheduling conflict she is in dune and she has her own tv show and they cut her time in the movie short because they couldn’t work around it 

thing is i was satisfied enough with her character not counting the horrendous death just because we got that one good scene with ethan before she died in all honesty as long as she is still alive and has a scene at the on pt2 i’m fine with it

he plays the cia director that gets hit throat cut by gabriel,2023-07-16
people can point to his desire to  gabriel as proof ilsa is really dead but ethan already had a reason to want gabriel dead  a pretty  good one he killed who we assume is someone ethan was in a relationship with and ethan was framed for that  having all those years for those feelings to fester would definitely make him want to shank gabriel on the train i don’t think it was because of ilsa because i think her death fakeout in the beginning was foreshadowing,2023-07-15
this everytime something like this happens in a movie i just call it bad writing you dont fake someones death to actually  them later that just shows you lacked ideas,2023-07-14
"i guess but i chalk that up to amateurish execution by mcquarrie and cruise as writerdirectors 

if they’re truly playing 4d chess with an algorithm and they made the first fakeout death so obvious to have us fall for the second lessobvious fakeout death then sure i’ll eat my words

i just think they made a really weak fakeout death by accident and then made a really weak real death by accident",2023-07-13
"i wish i had your optimism about the characters fate but the thing is 99 of the times in this type of situation it just ends up being fan attempts to justify bad writing not to defend it but just because people cant believe it because its so bad happens a lot in star wars for instance conspiracy theories and mental gymnastics to insane lengths to justify whats simply terrible writing

sucks because overall i liked the film nowhere near fallout but probably on the same tier as mi 4 and 5 but the way they handled ilsa  that just makes me lower it to mi 1 and 3 tier which is still good but not great in my personal taste",2023-07-18
"i mean isnt that exactly what ethan does all the time constantly looking out for people he doesnt even know that well  thats how he first got involved with ilsa in the first place

thats not depth though ilsa had barely anything in this movie and died saving a character she never talked to like i would consider your point if she was given any interesting character arc but she has nothing its ridiculous

entity still wins

i have no complaints against entity its my favorite aspect of the movie i think they did a great job showcasing how terrifying it is to fight something this powerful my problem is gabriel who they kept hyping up but ended up being pathetic against ethan 

this is wrong though he is not pleading he is very clearly taunting him

i may be wrong but it didnt look like taunting to me especially when ethan was forcing that knife into his throat",2023-07-12
i think this is exactly right angela bassett says in fallout that they need people who care about the one as much as the many that’s ethan and at this point it’s ilsa too i didn’t want the character to die but it’s not like she got hit by a car she willingly put herself in danger to save someone who needed her that’s brave and speaks well of her,2023-07-21
walker just comes across as a smug  davian is terrifying and convincingly evil imo 3 is the best in the series,2023-07-16

and del from ozark,2023-07-16
up to that point i was into the movie although the interminable will theywon’t they interactions with gracehayley atwell was a bit annoying  when they killed off ilsa it just changed the tone of the movie for me  like i was still grieving the loss of her character and trying to process it but they kept shoving these huge action scenesset pieces at me  tbh i would have been ok had they killed grace on the bridge  no emotional investment in her character  but this is the third movie with ilsa  she was a de facto member of the team  such a terrible way to end a character,2023-07-17

yeah it’s one of the few mask scenes in the franchise where it’s not a misdirection and you already know whos who going into it so they did it just to distinguish between the two,2023-07-21
they are gabriel’s knives grace takes them from the table right before she runs and then uses them on the bridge when she tries to  gabriel,2023-07-16

"he also said “if hurt either of them there isn’t anywhere you can go that i won’t  you”

he doesn’t have to  isla for ethan to want him dead stabbing her in the chest even if she survives is reason enough i’m pretty sure him hurting her at all would make him go ballistic",2023-07-15
it’s not even that they did it a second time they did it in the worst way possible the second time,2023-07-14
"i’m trying to justify it because i honestly can’t believe they’d make this huge of a mistake after their run of great movies recently

i do see how some of it could seem like crazy leaps to justify what’s happening but if they do end up bringing her back a lot of that stuff will probably seem obvious",2023-07-18
ilsa’s character arc actually works when viewed in the context of rogue nation and fallout in both films she is constantly oscillating between only looking out for herself and fighting for the benefit of others her arc concluding with her dying to save another person fits her character arc quite well,2023-07-12
it’s a good movie but i’d say it’s bottom 2 the standard for this franchise is extremely high because 1 4 5 6 and 7 range from great to pretty much flawless fallout is arguably the greatest action movie ever made,2023-07-16
"i didnt hear about any of this drama before i watched the movie 

i just enjoy the film

and from googling now atwell just the other day blasted grubby dating rumours 

so it just sounds like theory crafting by you",2023-07-15
i dont think a death was necessary especially the way they did it,2023-07-15

"it seems like you are not familiar with what being french actually means in france its not about your ethnic background or religion its about embracing the values of the french republic so anyone can be french regardless of their race or where their ancestors came from

the french model of integration doesnt really care about your ethnicity or religion its all about treating every citizen equally so even though her parents are koreanrussian she is still a french actor plain and simple 
she can still have a personal connection to her korean heritage but that doesnt make her any less french and it should be 100 her decision if she wants to identify as korean or russian or canadian over french 

refusing to acknowledge someone as french because of their ethnicity like some french farright groups tend to do is a form of discrimination and identity erasure

this article does a pretty good job at explaining the cultural differences between france and the us when it comes to race and nationality ",2023-07-17

yes del he was so good,2023-07-19
"i couldnt agree more the movie took a turn after her disappointing death it became even more  

like i was still grieving the loss of her character and trying to process it but they kept shoving these huge action scenesset pieces at me

exactly 

this is part of the movie where i didnt understand at all the writers were expecting us to care about this new charactergrace by a barrage of endless action sequences lol

the most frustrating thing to me is that after rogue nation we barely saw fraust in fallout and in this movie i dont even think she had 7 minutes of screentime before her death i can sort of understand that maybe the writer wanted  her to serve the plot but then why not do it in the most impactful way possible ",2023-07-17

"just dont  them off in an unsatisfying way that reduces their value as a character to what they meant to a male character

if ving rhames character instead of entering seclusion to try to destroy the ai just got killed off would you feel this same way 

i just think it was a poor death thing not a sexism thing 

why do you have to always see sexism and then pretend thats not what youre accusing directly of a film of being


its okay to dislike a death its just so tedious to think everything everything under the sun plot and decision making wise  is about sexism",2023-07-20
"no my point is that any death in service of the story when it happens to be a women can be put in that fridging trope


you can say all horror movies are sexist then

its reductive and take out of the light how often  strong female characters tom cruise has in his movies emily blunt in edge of tomorrow for example

but the one time they have a female character killed off as a two parter theres people going oh look oh look its fridging that means director writer and producer is  a implied sexist 

doesnt matter the introduction of a new character 

and then when they fail at that they say why cant they have two strong women in the cast is it one in one out

and then when that fails because theres other strong women in the cast that arent part of the imf side theyre just slack jawed and return to rumours and theory as to why they believe the character was killed off


in a series that has fake out deaths constantly and which is part of a two parter

no lets reduce everything to a single word to skip any type of analysis whatsoever",2023-07-19
hey sometimes you just gotta really spell it out for the dims out there,2023-07-16
i couldn’t remember who put the knives on the table before grace grabbed them,2023-07-16
you know what thats on me i got them confused going to leave it up because its funny though,2023-07-16
that is true watching her knife fight the baddie at the end of rogue nation and i just still think that fight with gabriel was weak sauce she is so much better than that,2023-07-15
yep knowing how ethan works  he would have actually been tempted to abandon the mission altogether and protect his remaining friends not just get over it literally the next day take grace as a replacement and just carry on with it like cmon as it stands her death has so little impact on the team,2023-07-14
"my main gripe with the theory is that then why would ethan be so adamant on killing the bad guy when he needs him alive he has to contain himself from killing him because hes clearly upset about him killing ilsa unless ethan isnt aware that it was a fake out which seems highly unlikely

anyway i want to believe just like you i pray shes still alive but highly highly doubt it",2023-07-18
it fits better as ilsa being in on something that led to her death being faked otherwise it makes no sense,2023-07-12
fallout is good but it doesn’t crack my personal top 10 action movies even out of the recent mission impossible movies i would rank 5 higher,2023-07-16
why not we have for shadowing that gabriel loves making his mark suffer— how was he going to make ethan suffer without extracting something from him,2023-07-15

ethnicity always matters the french are full of  they colonized the world and came up with a bs system of stripping people of their culture heritage and identity the french do not actually accept any non white person as true french unless they’re richfamous its  the african players on the word cup winning team literally spoke out saying they were not made to feel accepted until they started winning this new age colonial  needs to stop,2023-12-27
not at all i’m saying regardless of beauty she’s off the charts gorgeous hayley atwell doesn’t look anywhere near 40 in this movie,2024-01-22
i had a feeling she was going to die with the “fakeout” in the beginning of the movie i just didn’t want it to happen i really loved her character in the series she was one of my favorites i’m still hoping they pull some fast and furious lety type magic and bring her back somehow,2023-07-18
or they could have given her the jeremy renner brandt treatment  just mention she’s working for mi6 now after being brought back in after helping save the world from a nuclear catastrophe  that she’s deep cover again and unavailable  instead they pooped on her character with this death,2023-07-17
haha i love tc and the franchise but ethan hunt is definitely slowing down it would be great to see cruise get back into some meaty drama or comedy roles also,2023-07-23
"if luther was killed off in a way that dissatisfied as many people in this posts comments as ilsas death did yeah i would probably be criticizing that too i wouldnt call it fridging but i would be dissatisfied like i am with ilsa

now if there was a wellestablished writing trope of male supporting characters dying in ways that dont provide satisfying conclusions to their stories but instead serve to motivate the female protagonists stories yeah i would identify it with that trope and if there was a historical issue with that specific trope in this specific genre it would be even more relevant and if one of the common praises of this specific series and that specific character were that they handle male characters better than other entries in the genre i would be even more disappointed if he just got killed off

 i just think it was a poor death thing not a sexism thing

im not accusing mcquarrie or cruise of being sexist im just pointing out that they leaned a little too  a common writing trope that exists for sexist reasons

 why do you have to always see sexism and then pretend thats not what youre accusing directly of a film of being

 i dont know why you assume you know what i always think but okay 

 its okay to dislike a death its just so tedious to think everything everything under the sun plot and decision making wise is about sexism

i dont think that and i never said that i think historically a lot of sexist tropes have developed in fiction because society and hollywood were both historically sexist and while thats getting better some of those tropes remain

and even though i already explained this no its not inherently sexist to  a female character and no i dont complain every time that happens ilsas death is a textbook example of fridging it literally fits the definition perfectly",2023-07-20
"no my point is that any death in service of the story when it happens to be a women can be put in that fridging trope

its not just that the death is in service of the story that makes it fridging its that the death is more about motivating the male character than the female characters arc and thats absolutely the case in this movie they even call out how the female characters in the series never last very long and basically say hey were gonna do that to ilsa too

its reductive and take out of the light how often strong female characters tom cruise has in his movies

that kinda just makes it more disappointing a track record of having good female characters and this is the best they could do for ilsa even if it is just a fakeout which is certainly a possibility the way her part was written here was really just not very good 

but the one time they have a female character killed off as a two parter theres people going oh look oh look its fridging that means director writer and producer is a implied sexist 

i mean kinda yeah they clearly know about the trope since as i already said the treatmentdisposability of female characters in the series is mentioned in the movie and then they just do it again anyway im not saying cruise or mcquarrie is definitely sexist but they made a movie that contributes to a sexist trope",2023-07-19
i dont think it was a fridging but it was a poorly written death,2023-07-19
i’m not entirely sure who puts them there but right before gabriel gets patted down he takes them off his person he might place them on the table himself or give them to one of the white widow’s guards,2023-07-16
"they had to nerf her by getting her leg cut or she would’ve downed him pretty quick

i will say she could have been fighting more reserved because gabriel said someone was going to die and the other girl hadnt",2023-07-16
"eh i could see him going ballistic even if he didn’t end up killing her 

“if you hurt either of them there’s no place you can go that i won’t  you” 

gabriel already killed someone he cared about him just trying to it again would most likely set ethan off especially since it would be so close to killing ilsa this time

we already know ethan cares more about the ones he care about more than the mission to a fault so i don’t find it a stretch for him to try to  him",2023-07-18
"so you just have a theory and then back fitted the idea theyre in a relationship to fit your theory

"so my argument is that if your entire carry on is only holding a big metal cylinder disguised as a bomb the airport will find it and be very upset about it and your argument is they won’t find it suspicious and even if they do they won’t care much because it’s fake   

let’s call it a stalemate",2023-07-16

she looks pretty mature in the movie  todays 30 years olds look pretty juvenile,2024-01-22
"now if there was a wellestablished writing trope of male supporting characters dying in ways that dont provide satisfying conclusions to their stories but instead serve to motivate the female protagonists stories yeah i would identify it with that trope

how do you know its related to that its essentially unfalsifiable",2023-07-21
"its that the death is more about motivating the male character than the female characters arc

his main thing is friendship 

he cares about his friends more than anyone and in fact puts anyones life above the mission even people he doesnt know hayley atwells character   thats the cool thing with the movies he makes the impossible mission happen aiming to not lose the people and getting the mission done gabriel uses past situations to make hayleys character  scared if ethan could actually stop her from being killed

im not saying cruise or mcquarrie is definitely sexist but they made a movie that contributes to a sexist trope

what doesnt contribute towards a trope determined by you to be sexist 
why is motivating the male character arc sexist

again its you can see ilsas character path in past movies did you keep determining she was being used as a sexist trope in those

its just reductive and shuts down actual conversation about the story

im not saying there isnt situations where it isnt worth keeping in mind as a vague red flag if a director is repeatedly doing this kinda thing every female character is just a one dimensional cardboard 

but the simulacrum of the thing isnt the thing itself

people say one word reductions to precisely imply greatly rather than accuse directly which they know would fall flat on its face  of a director writer producer of making a sexist film 


a film where you have pom klimentoff as a ruthless killer and vanessa kirby as a amoral billionairess that that film is sexist because ilsa died and people cried",2023-07-19
i can get behind that,2023-07-19
"well i’m not happy with a stalemate cause it’s an empty codex in a capsule with no explosive particles or radiation if they open it and see that it’s tricked into acting like a bomb on a countdown sure they can be upset with me then but they have no reason to be suspicious of an empty codex in a capsule with no explosive particles or radiation

most nukes don’t come in like what you saw in the movie sub sandwiches however do come like what you see in commercials",2023-07-16
"why is motivating the male character arc sexist

the sexist part is the overall trend of killing female characters to motivate male ones because it makes women into disposable things just there as accessories to the real mans story 

again its you can see ilsas character path in past movies did you keep determining she was being used as a sexist trope in those

part of my disappointment with this movie is that ilsa was written much better in the previous two whether its a fakeout or not in dead reckoning theres ultimately nothing for her to do but die even if she had to be written out due to scheduling conflicts they couldve come up with something better than just tossing her aside and immediately replacing her

if a director is repeatedly doing this kinda thing

as ive already mentioned dead reckoning is selfaware enough to acknowledge how the mi series cycles through female characters

a film where you have pom klimentoff as a ruthless killer and vanessa kirby as a amoral billionairess that that film is sexist because ilsa died and people cried

i didnt say the movie is sexist i said it contributes to a sexist trope theres a difference",2023-07-19

"it’s a secret agent team who’s job is to neutralize nukes that thought it was a nuke i’m pretty positive the count down timer and nuke symbol will make tsa think it’s a nuke  

the bag check isn’t a radiation sensor it’s an x ray their entire purpose is to look for things shaped like they could be a bomb   

there’s a really good reason gabriel went out of his way to not get the bag checked because he’d be put in jail if they checked that",2023-07-16
"i didnt say the movie is sexist i said it contributes to a sexist trope theres a difference

if you say something a contributes towards x with no further elucidations what is the point of saying that except to make people associate a with x

these are just word games with low standards of falsifiability so they can be applied anywhere as a shaming and constraining mechanism 

low information content 

a better way if intellectually honest would be to say 

i didnt like mission impossible dead reckoning because rebecca ferguson character ilsa died and i felt like that could be fridging of her in the plot

instead you present it as a dispassionate observation when its rhetorical persuasion mission impossible displays a sexist trope you can make anything display a sexist trope if you cling on too tightly to generalisations and stereotypes 

i like what the other person said that they didnt think it was fridging but it was a poorly handled death thats fair

and if youre going to come up with red flags sexist tropes come up with green flags too antisexist tropes which the movie ticks 

people use this spurious amorphous low falsifiability comment to skate around plainly stating what they think and feel instead of dressing it up like its an benign observation and not  part of rhetorical persuasion which is what it is",2023-07-19
"well the countdown timer and radiation symbol only came up when activated when they opened it   that’s what i’ve been saying

also the xray would’ve seen an empty codex in a capsule for someone who knows a lot about airports it surprises me how you don’t know about trace detection devicesmethods  the same devices that are made to detect explosive particles radiation drugs etc he’d only be put in jail if they opened it like i’ve been saying  maybe they let bim go after a while if he says it’s a toy or a prank cause it’s empty or maybe they put him on the no flight list but who knows 

the secret agent team didn’t get a look at the xray scan they saw a bag get flagged by the ai that wanted to throw them off

and like i said most nukes don’t come in like what you saw in the movie they saw a codex with nothing inside not a codex with wiring tricked into a bomb i could put a bomb in a sock and roll it like i usually do they wouldn’t flag it cause it’s a rolled up sock they’d flag it because the puffer detected an explosive",2023-07-16
ok sure you’re right that carry on was not risky and it makes complete sense why they did it,2023-07-16
"yes cause the xray saw an empty codex and the puffer didn’t detect any explosive traces or radiation and they did it to distract hunt’s team from getting the key glad we agree

also it was checked bag not carry on carry on is a different story",2023-07-16
exactly it’d be easy if it’s a checked bag,2023-07-16
