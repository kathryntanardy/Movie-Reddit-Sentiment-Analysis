really loved that there was no huge threat like the quantum realm was going to swallow the city or anything like that just a family desparate to reunite a young woman so afraid of dying shed do anything to stop it but still be talked down from hurting a little girl and a well meaning fellow who just wants to do right by everyone he cares about was suprised hank hope and janet getting dusted thought theyed need at least one of them to help the avengers in a4,2018-07-06

ok yea sure stan lee had a cameo but what about tim heidecker,2018-07-06
always amazed how well the mcu juggles these different genres this was a blast after infinity war and i had almost completely forgotten the events of that film and then…they made me remember ,2018-07-06

"you ever get blackout  do a bunch of bad decisions then have your friends go hey man you were so fed up last week check this video filling you with dread as you have to relive what happened

thats this movies postcredits scene",2018-07-06
" kidsized scott was a really great scene 
 the villains motivations were solid but her plan was a bit underexplained somehow killing janet was going to fix her then not killing her allowed her to be magically fixed instantly a bit of a copout in writing
 the cgi black suv chase sequence was very distracting
 the cgi deaging scenes on the other hand were really good 
 michael penas gag was just as good as the first time  i really liked seeing evangeline lilly mouthing his speedtalking i only know her from playing fairly serious characters  it was nice getting to see her act a bit goofy shes charming
 cassie is adorable and i hope we get to see more of her and scott as time goes on she would be a great partner  did you see how she handled that laser grid 
 it played into infinity war exactly when i expected it to but in a way that was much more interesting 
 there were some moments that i noticed the score in a good way i like that marvels getting better with that
 i was bummed laurence fishburne didnt turn into goliath i assumed he was in the big inflated ant man suit
 watching fights between people with powers and seeing them used creatively just scratches an itch that nothing else can for me its so fantastic the incredibles ii did the same thing ",2018-07-06
"can we designate antman as the official postavengers palate cleanser 

a light funny romp about a guy who talks to ants and who can grow 50ft tall is just what i needed after the somber ending to infinity war

well until the postcredit scene",2018-07-06
"some people are asking why scott lang and the pyms are just doing experiments during the events of iw but i think it makes sense

first hank pyms disdain for tony stark and the avengers have been made clear in the first film so theres no reason for him to go actively help them out scott fought against stark in civil war so i think he shares similar sentiments and he wouldnt have known what cap was doing 

second the events in new york and edinburgh were over within a few minutes and involved few if any civilian casualties after the battle of new york the dark elf attack in london and sokovia the events at the beginning of iw might have seemed like comparatively minor news since only the core avengers knew about thanoss plan no one else would have understood the stakes of what was really going on the attack against wakanda also seemed to have flown under the radar because fury only received news of it moments before the snap 

third people dont suddenly drop everything every time there is a crisis going on somewhere in the world unless it directly affects your life you tend to still do your normal routine as far as they were concerned there was a minor attack on the other side of the country that was over within a few minutes they might have been concerned but they also wouldnt have had dropped everything that they were doing ",2018-07-08
marvel i love you but  you for making us wait until march after that ending,2018-07-06
"can we talk about what is hands down the biggest problem with this movie

they should have had scott drinking a juice box after cutting back from do you have those  biggest missed opportunity of the mcu ",2018-07-07
"i thought it was a win on pretty much every level

 worked really well as a direct sequel to antman without being retread the first was a heist this one was a chase
 worked really well as a movie in a wider universe everyone kind of thought putting antman in civil war was iffy theme wise and this dealt directly with the fallout from that
 the first marvel movie in ages in which the villain doesn’t die at the end they even forgive her and let her go
 small scale stakes if the good guys had lost you’d have one dead character and a few more in jail

i loved the first antman and i thought this was a really great way to follow it up

also shield continues to be just the worst",2018-07-06
may be an unpopular opinion but i thought ghost was a really cool villain,2018-07-06
heres something i noticed that people havent mentioned yet a lot of marvel movies tend to ignore the consequences set in place by the previous film for instance even though the dark world ended with loki on the throne in order to tease a third film taika waititi kind of waved that cliffhanger away in the first 20 minutes  in antman and the wasp however it really felt like the fallout of civil war was felt in this movie so kudos to the film and peyton reed,2018-07-08
forgive me if this is dumb but did anybody catch when janet said advances human evolution in the quantum realm to explain her developed powers i have a feeling that may help introduce mutants to the mcu now that the disneyfox deal is finalizing i could be wrong but just a feeling ,2018-07-06
paul rudd’s acting when janet moved into scott’s body was so good that it was instantly clear what happened as soon as it did ,2018-07-24
"dread it  run from it

the snappening arrives all the same",2018-07-06
it’s really nice to see scott’s exwife and her husband being so supportive of him ,2018-07-07
"some thoughts about the movie xpost from rmarvelstudios 

 i know some people prefer the first one but for me i prefer antman and the wasp

 paul rudd and evangeline lilly have a great chemistry in this movie and their teamup added a value that i want after the first movie especially evangeline lilly as wasp her fierceness swagger and badassery were delightful

 hank pym also got few moments to bust one or two jokes and it was fun to watch him did those i like that when he joked about how is school

 michelle pfeiffer has a great screen presence even her appearance was not much in the movie you know there is something special that make you admire her character throughout the movie

 ghostava is better than i expected she is not killmonger or thanos but we know what has driven her to those things throughout the movie and she has clear pathos hannahjohn kamen also performed well in this movie and her performance is better than her character in ready player one

 i like that cassies apperance in here is more meaningful than the first one and i like that she became a moral center for scott i like that moment when she hope and scott watched a movie together and hope ask her what is she going to be when shes older also she was really cute when she had a big smile while watching her dad on a live tv

 xcon gangs were great as usual luis is a human juxebox and kurt reciting a baba yaga song was hilarious

 i also like the running gag with jimmy woo that he always fail to catch scott redhanded

 i kinda wish that sonny burch got more development and so he isnt much of a hatesink in the movie the third act was kinda little busy for me but the car chases was one of the most creative things in this movie

 also i kinda wish they spent bit more time in a quantum realm it feels kinda rushed but the visual was pretty good

 in the end i like the movie and i like it better than the first one because the whole cast did a better performance than the previous movie plus i feel like this movie is more confident than the first one 75  8 out of 10 from me

ps the mid and after credit scenes are nice thing to connect to recent events in the mcu

",2018-07-06
the scene with peña as the voice of the other cast was amazing,2018-07-07
"i think ant man is my favorite series of all mcu there is no i gotta save the world stuff just a lightweight and funny heist movie first one and now a lightweight and funny rescue mission movie

"post credit scene though

one of the best scenes is when scott hank and hope are going to see bill and they put on their “disguises” and scott basically calls out the whole mcu about how any normal person would immediately recognize them ,2018-07-07
my reaction every time ghost showed up and interrupted the plot,2018-07-06
i really think the line where scott is all like “how did he even manage to buy a ticket that fast” was my favorite ,2018-07-08
i knew it was coming but i was still not ready for more dusting,2018-07-06
125 minutes of film and i feel like that postsnap scene has completely usurped my attention really looking forward to whatever role scott has in avengers 4,2018-07-06
my favorite joke was when hank pym said that paul rudd entangled with his wife when he was in the quantum realm and he immediately responded no hank i would never do that to you i respect you too much  i feel like it slipped past most of my theater but i was dying,2018-07-06

"i really liked ghost awesome suit cool powers and her struggle to stay alive was a lot more relatable to me than world conquest or mass genocide the postcredits scene made it seem like shes still in close contact with the pyms hopefully she returns in a later film

along the same lines i like how personal the stakes were in this movie the villains werent trying to destroy the world or anything they were trying to save avas life the good guys werent trying to save the world they were trying to save janet both sides were trying to save someone which made the conflict very interesting to me",2018-07-06

also the quantum tunnel was the ghost zone portal and the pod ship that hank and hope made was very reminiscent of the specter speeder a vehicle to traverse the ghost zone in this case the quantum zone 

scott even used the fenton thermos used in the show to capture ghosts to collect the quantum energy at the end",2018-07-06

"its finally out here

i loved the first ant man movie but this one felt pretty underwhelming compared to that its still an enjoyable watch but nowhere near the quality of the first one for me 

not all of the jokes landed the shrinkinggrowing stuff also felt a lot less creative then the first movie and there were too many subplots going on at the same time like

1 the house arrest
2 fbi guy
3 ghost
4 getting the original wasp back

i wished they ditched the house arrest plot eh shes been stuck there for 30 years couldnt you just wait for 2 more days when scotts house arrest is over and the fbi guy plot didnt really feel like it added much to the movie for me

hes just going to crash into a scene to hilarious effect during iw4",2018-07-22

"skipped this one during its theatrical run and just saw it last night pretty good i enjoyed it but i dont think it was as good as the first antman

that post credit scene leads me be believe that antman is gonna sit out avengers 4 as well because  be stuck in the quantum realm maybe antman 3 will be about him trying to break out of there",2018-11-11
"i know im gonna get downvoted but this is how you make strong female characters  wasp was great and was just as capable as antmanif not moreso and they played off each other well  ghost wasnt bad for being bads sake  she had legitimate issues was as strong as the 2 protagonists without being overpowered  

star wars can take a lesson from marvel",2018-07-07
"i thought this movie hit the perfect mark of marvel humor and superhero action i felt like antman and the wasp and thor ragnarok both hit similar vibes of humor that were missing in guardians of the galaxy ii i thought it did a good job of making jokes and then not overplaying them i felt like ghost was a step up from other mcu villains a demonstration that marvel is making its phase iii villains less one note but i wasnt thrilled by them 

i also thought that the wasp was tough and competent while complimenting and not surpassing antman in his own film ultimately it was a pretty good movie and superhero movie

i enjoyed the sort of indirect reference to john wick as well",2018-07-06

it was okay i got spoiled by good villains after iw daredevil and jessica jones so im kinda dissapointed that there were no good villains here ghost is a woobie who doesnt do much while sonny is just a dumb bumbling idiot glad that theyve adressed scott being involved in civil war even though he risked being forced to stay away from his daughter and his noninvolvement in iw action was nice most jokes were on point quantum realm is still not really explained ghost is hot also the prototype suit thing was really annoying they shouldve called the movie the wasp and antman ,2018-08-14

"ghost was a great villain her “phase power” was great visually and made the fights  the post credits scene was great with that eerie feeling that infinity war left you on which was low key hype for the next avengers film 

bonus shoutout for the daughterdad moment before the rescue ",2018-07-06
i liked it it was a fun action movie i agree with those who stated scott seemed like the subplot to hopes wasp and im okay with that also i really liked the villain she wasnt after world domination or destruction she just wanted to live and for the pain to stop i found her to be relatable i have a nerve pain disorder and there are days where im pretty sure i would to anything including fighting antman and the wasp to make the pain stop i would be no where near as successful as her at it though,2018-07-06
i loved it just as much as the first film antman is a much more lower  personal stakes franchise and i hope they continue that formula the original was an entertaining heist but this felt more of a timed rescue mission it makes you wonder did the film really needed a villain ghost wasnt really a villain just a character with her own plans once again peyton reed utilizes the entire supporting cast no matter how small their screen time were that could make everything come full circle  ,2018-07-07
loved the mid credits scene my question how will scott get out of the quantum realm with the pym family vanished,2018-07-07
"im convinced that ghost and bill foster were originally planned to be the same person

as a single character its a cool concept  personal connection to hank complicated dynamic where they hate each other but need each other cool powers demonstrates the danger of the quantum realm

but split into two both characters are super onedimensional and boring and the relationship between the two is just completely left blank

i dont know why they got split  maybe a scheduling conflict or something but it definitely hurt the movie",2018-07-17

antman and the wasp is the first mcu film where the stakes are purely personal for its main characters and the general population is not at risk there is no threat to thwart there is only a goal to achieve for emotional reasons this would have been great had the writers not felt the need to include some sort of villain the gang is already on the run from the law and a crime boss who wants their technology so why muddle this further with ghost cool fight scenes aside the villain adds nothing to the story and makes a movie that’s already all over the place feel too complicated and full of technobabble it’s also notable that this movie is very much about the wasp and hank pym with antman only there for the ride evangeline lilly is very good in what can only be described as the lead role and michael peña once again steals the shows when it comes to comedy despite issues the movie is entertaining and in some ways inventive not to mention they utilized the shrinking and growing technology in very fun ways,2018-07-17
forever bothering individual,2018-07-20
"antman and the wasp is a fun summer action flick that brings a muchneeded lighter tone after the heavyhitting infinity war though never quite reaching the heights of the aforementioned film antman and the wasp does manage to improve on its predecessor in most regards 

paul rudd michael douglas and evangeline lily all return as our main characters and deliver wellrounded and realistic performances throughout rudd continues to highlight with a great sense of humor 

the plot benefits greatly from a more realized villain in ghost she’s got a fantastic backstory and a believable performance delivered from hannah johnkaren unfortunately we also get a generic bland villain in sonny burch the performance isn’t bad but the character is a walking cliche who would’ve been best served at playing less of a major role 

the plot feels tighter in this one we’re seeing ramifications from the first antman and captain america civil war it’s nice to see scott struggling with becoming antman again versus trying to be a father there’s some great stuff between he and his daughter throughout the film 

peyton reed returns to direct and i think he did just as good of a job as the original some of the shots especially when antman and the wap are enlarged or shrunken are great the moment when antman rises out of the water as giant man is awesome 

antman and the wasp is a great example of how a superhero sequel can keep what works about the original and improve on some key aspects to make it better the writing isn’t amazing and it suffers from a bit of a secondary villain problem but it’s a great movie and i recommend seeing it if you’re an mcu fan fan of the original or just want some laughs the humor is even better in this one

"this movie is supposed to explain where ant man was during the events of iw but does it really 

we know initially he was on house arrest but it seems by the time everyone is snapped ant man and the wasp and the team are well into conducting experiments separate and apart from the events of the movie which leads me to believe that he’s been done with house arrest for some time at least a few days

enjoyed the movie a lot but i wish a hugely talented actor like walton goggins wasn’t wasted in such a lame role ghost wasn’t much of an antagonist either but what saved the movie was the chemistry between the actors michael pêna and michael douglas were awesome again and so was paul rudd evangeline was a little boring to me,2018-07-18

"this was my first time watching an antman movie so i wasn’t too sure what to expect but i’d seen the positive reviews so i was hoping it’d live up to my expectations i think the movie was a bit slowpaced to start with but starts to speed up towards the end with the car chase i liked the chemistry between hope antman and hank also liked the small comedic moments with luis and woo however i felt lawrence fishburne’s character was underdone a little 

in terms of the villains i thought ghost was an interesting character and her backstory and situation gave her some depth so we understand her motive i thought walter goggin’s character was alright and solid enough but not anything memorable 

overall the plot felt a bit all over the place but it got there in the end the overall cast was pretty good and i did enjoy most of the humour i knew this wasn’t going to be a big budget mcu movie but rather a “b tier’ film and i think it delivers a fun enjoyable laid back movie

"the operative word when one reviews a marvel studios film is “joy” these movies are joyous they are designed to make you happy when the obligatory post credit scene ends the average theater goer invariably walks through the exit door with a big smile on their face a spring in their step and a deep rooted feeling in their gut where they are just glad to be alive antman  the wasp may be one of the strongest examples of this peculiar phenomenon

when it comes to celluloid sagas that comes in many parts the sequel is often better than the original and the antman franchise is no exception while i was quite fond of the original antman amtw ultimately turns out to be a funnier sweeter more self confident motion picture and something which i felt no regret whatsoever in spending two hours sitting through the characters are better developed than in the first filmparticularly hank pym and hope van dyne the villain has a more interesting motivation for their deeds than darren cross did and the domestic hijinks and family melodrama feel more organic and less cliched most importantly the pseudoscientific explanation for the mechanics of “pym particles” are jettisoned this time the weirdness of being able to shrink and grow on command or marshal armies of ants to do your bidding are embraced for what they are allowing the weird quirky wonderful magic of the house of ideas to take center stage and just do its thing in a sentence antman  the wasp is a genuine crowd pleaser

marvel studios makes this all seem so easy so effortless despite yourself you still want to deduct a couple of star points from your review of something like antman  the wasp no matter how good of a time that youre having because it seems like a magic trick has just been pulled on you akin to scott langs mastery of close up card tricks something this mainstream something so light and fluffy on the surface and produced for mass consumption cant be this kino can it

it can because antman  the wasp really is that good we the public have been spoiled by so much quality superhero films from the likes of marvel christopher nolan brad bird and others that we have forgotten how pitiful the genre used to be go back twelve years ago and compare amtw against something like xmen the last stand and tell me which movie is better now dont get me wrong i like the xmen movies but compared side by side its obvious which movie was made by a committee of money grubbing executives and which was made by people with a genuine desire to entertain their audience

on the other hand despite my enthusiasm i do have to admit that the plot of this movie while enjoyable isnt one of the best things to have ever come out of the house of ideas there are certain things about the nature of pym particles and the quantum realm that still dont make complete sense even going by its own internal logic there are certain things about the motivations of our heroes that dont make complete sense upon examination either and there are certain side characters whose motivations seem a bit sketchy as well these particular characters arent incomprehensible theyre just not fully realized in the end none of it really matters though because what amtw lacks in cohesion it more than makes up for in laughter and imagination two things which we are never in too much supply of",2018-07-23

"i am guessing during his house arrest scott watched dave made a maze to come up with that house maze i have half a mind to make one myself that sort of arts and crafts looks like fun 

i love that the writers have not tried to make scott get back together with his exwife rather everyone is fine and healthy with the arrangement sonny and maggie are an extended family to scott rather than this is my ex and herboyfriend it gives cassie a weird but stable foundation she loves her dad but loves her mom as well there is no she is stuck in the middle 

the one problem i had with this movie were a couple of jarring edits for example one moment scott hope and hank are fighting ghost and foster they beat them and the next moment they are back in the lab no running out and gunning it in the van no making sure foster cant follow them no making sure ghost cant follow them just a very jarring cut 

what i really did like is how they used the layout of the city fantastically this story wouldnt have worked in new york or los angeles or anywhere else on the planet given the way the car chases went

i liked it so much because it didn’t swing for the fence it just enjoyed playing the game infinity wars was so heavy great but heavy this was smaller in scale and stakes which is perfectly fine by me ,2018-07-09
"just saw the film kinda love the fact that they dont give a  what pym particles are limited to now the film kind of has less of a focus than the first film but still had most of the same charm most of the charm comes from peña being amazing and lily and rudds relationship which was great to see growing from begrudging to caring and flirting

walton goggins is  brilliant despite having a one dimensional character makes me really hope that tarantino is using him as charles manson for once upon a time in hollywood but probably not 

i love how generally the hope is a better fighter than scott but she doesnt take the whole picture and in many ways you can tell she needs him around 

generally the characters are more fleshed out in this film and much more welcoming developed but the plot isnt as strong and confident as the first one 

my issue is how ghost is fairly underdeveloped her plan seemed pretty silly and i get her brashness but she couldve easily been working with pym to fix herself up and shes been this way for a long time so why now and sure shes not the villain more so just someone in opposition to the protagonists with superpowers but they kinda shove her whole backstory in a onescene exposition dump the fact that everything got resolved so smoothly and easily is a bit convenient but it did overwhelm the fact that the start of the film struggled to get momentum a bit 

still was great tho im gonna have to watch it again to smoothen out the creases mid credits scene is what i was looking for

edit also i thought they couldnt take off their masks when shrunken down ",2018-07-16
i like how being able to instantly alter the size of things brings sort of a 4th dimension to fighting  its cool to see how far the writers of this film can push and utilize that new dimension,2018-07-16

"the original antman was such a pleasant surprise i loved the film so much that antman quickly became my favorite hero i was so excited for the sequel that i purchased tickets to the double feature fan event as i was watching the first antman i remembered how great the characters in the antman films are i was filled with excitement knowing that i would soon be able to see the great characters on the big screen again needless to say i had just as much fun with the sequel

i think my favorite aspect of the antman films is that they are their own smallscale no pun intended fun adventures the stakes arent universal just an exciting adventure we get to watch our heroes embark on i enjoy seeing marvel experiment with unique subgenres the first film was a great heist film and this film is a fun actionpacked chase film with the film revolving around a chase we get to see interesting plot points that havent been explored in previous marvel films there wasnt necessarily a villain but obstacles that blocked our heros path it was refreshing to not have the goal of a marvel film to revolve around destroying a powerful force but instead rescuing a loved one

as expected antman and the wasp is a fantastic comedy there are so many great gags and jokes which make this a fun lighthearted adventure the comedy aspect works as a nice refresher to relieve the pain left from infinity war all of the characters in this film have unique personalities that all work so harmonious with each other paul rudd and evangeline lily have fantastic chemistry seeing them work together is an absolute blast as always michael douglas does fantastic portraying the wise mentor who still likes to have some fun michael pena and his crew are hilarious and its fun to see a group of average guys working with scientists and superheroes

the film is bright and colorful the locations are fun and the costumes and suits look epic in conclusion antman and the wasp has a unique story which makes for the perfect fun summer film the cast is great and they all have wonderful chemistry which just adds for more fun moments in a small marvel film with big heart",2018-07-07
may we all be blessed to age as well as michelle pfieffer like a fine wine ,2018-07-06
"left the movie enjoying it about as much as the first film which i consider a good thing in that regard but that midcredits scene i knew something was going to happen to that would tie it into infinity war but it still came as a shock so much for all the effort that went into rescuing janet 

i do hope that wong is among the survivors because i can imagine scott escaping that quantum realm through magical means albeit happenstance",2018-07-06

"definitely a fun movie but not without issues it feels like they had one decent villain ghost along with the bill foster angle but then they realized they needed more bad guys with cars for action scenes so they added in walter goggins hes fun to watch but his character felt superfluous

great gags and set pieces and paul ruddevangeline lilly are a killer combo for this type of movie some jokes felt like improv didnt land but most were good or better the stuff with rudd and randall park was hilarious and it sounds silly but i like how the basic themes were basically just love your children and help people thats usually all i require from a superhero movie and some get lost in being epic and grandscale and dark

i kind of wish they didnt even have the gut punch after credit scenes but i know it makes sense and will lead into avengers 4 in a smart way",2018-07-07
so there are too many comments for me to go through them all but i had aprobably unoriginal theory scott dodged the snappening by being in the quantum realm if this is true it means that hank and hope inadvertently killed janet by rescuing her,2018-07-07
my fingers are still crossed that in ant man 3 well see the pyms hiding out from the law by living in legoland with a subsequent action sequence taking place in it,2018-07-08
well i had fun i enjoyed the first one and this was better imo also i just  love douglas as hank and the fact he’s a full fledged main character and not a supporting one like most of the ‘big stars’ they tend to put in these movies are,2018-07-08
"there were so many things i loved about this movie some of the best jokes in the mcu and great character moments overall it felt more like a comic than a majority of the mcu films did in the sense that it was  science and absurd situations as if straight from the pages and into the silver screen i didnt even mind that the villain and story was simplistic or not even there it feels like it didnt need to be sophisticated to just have fun 

also cool movie detail when the fbi agent enters the house looking for scott if im correct its always the same camera angle but with every instance he loses his patience going to the door at first he knocks a lot then suddenly hes kicking the door open by the end of the movie 

loved it solid 8510",2018-07-08
just saw it  it was much better than expected it built on the first one and gave more without going tacky full blown plus it transitioned nicely from civil war to a more personal conflict i am going to forget the post credit happened till next year ,2018-07-08
so all that time vortex talk by janet in the midcredits scene  is antman going to be the key to everything in avengers 4 then  i know theres been hints of it and the leaked pics of him at the battle of new yorkspoiler  but is this going to mean that the one possibility dr strange saw of thanos being defeated meant that the snap had to happen during those 30 seconds or so when antman had gone into the quantum realm but before hank janet and hope could bring him back so that he was trapped in a situation where he needs to take that risk and enter the time vortex,2018-07-08

what a great palate cleanser after infinity war i thought this would be pretty middleoftheroad as far as mcu films go but it certainly exceeded my expectations i especially loved the fact that nobody was more evil than they need to be all the characters’ motivations were very easy for me to latch onto the funniest bit for me was when a mediumsized ant man is walking around the elementary school,2018-07-06
"me after the midcredits scene thats fed up

overall a really fun movie and i loved that it didnt resort to too many goofy jokes and went for the more clever quips  the heist format was different and focused on three groups after the same thing and one group after one of the three groups  i also have mixed feelings about ghost on one hand i thought the development was enough to make ghost a character with whom the audience can sympathize but i also found the backstory to be a bit cliche with just the minimum development to keep the story going

as an sf native i liked how this film had way more sf location shots compared to the first one and that it was able to stand on its own without leaning too much on the rest of the mcu i def liked the smaller connections to infinity war and the postcredits scene was a very interesting and human glimpse into the postsnap world of infinity war",2018-07-06

this movie was great it was light and comedic whilst being extremely entertaining and fun the plot made sense and the characters were wellbuilt i gave the movie an 810 which i think it deserves i enjoyed it more than the first antman which i loved i really hope there is a third antman movie or at least he has a more important role he and the wasp are my favourite super heroes so obviously i am bias,2018-07-08
that stan lee line is now my favorite of his one liners ,2018-07-08
anyone hoping that scott gets pulled out by a futureolder cassie janet mentioned a time vortex so that could be a cool starting to the infinity war sequel,2018-07-09
i had to explain the stan lee cameo to my kids they didn’t know why having fun in the 60’s would affect someone ,2018-07-09
another fun movie by marvel studios would of had a better time if the kids sitting next to me would have stopped commenting during the entire film ,2018-07-10
did the snap  half the ants in the universe,2018-07-18
can’t wait to see what powers he gets from the quantum realm if any at least we know  be involved in the time travel  that is to come,2018-09-08
def not as good as the first one but still entertaining tho the plot plodded along a bit for me  enjoyed the humor   one question about ghost  when shes not in her special suit she cant control her power so how the f does she stand on the ground  logically she would pass right through the earth esp when she first became ghost as a child,2018-10-04
"as a childrens marvel hero movie great  for adults soso  i did enjoy the lighter tone of this movie but got bored of it toward the middle then it picked up at the end  the first one was way better with a more focused story and a true villain  i really hate it when there are no real antagonists especially in a super hero movie  ending was cool but really  how many more super hero movies can i watch

overall 7 out 10 score",2018-10-08
im in love with evangeline lily she is gorgeous and everything she did in this movie was awesome you could tell she was having the time of her life playing this character in the movie her character was so good that if i had to pick id rather see get her own movie than black widow,2018-07-07
"the perfect pallet cleanser after the spectacle that was infinity war almost all other studios would just make another bigger movie but the mcu decides to let the audience breath with some silly puns and paul rudd doing his shtick which will never get old really solid movie

also that mid credits scene got a collective reaction of ohhhh  from the audience

"how is ant man affording an incredibly expensive house in san francisco and sending his daughter to a nice school etc without having a job for 2 years real estate in the bay area isnt affordable

totally unrealistic",2018-07-31

"after the rush of elation i got from my initial viewing just going to recap my thoughts on the movie

certainly a change of pace compared to iw but it was needed the comedy was pretty expected for a marvel movie some didnt like it i certainly enjoyed it but just my opinion

ghost was definitely an upgrade over darren cross just much more understandable motivations she just wants to stay alive though i cant help but wonder did bill foster really resent hank to the point where he was willing to fight against him and possibly  janet until he realizes the consequences of that later couldnt he have put aside his differences with him to save ghost i mean it still worked out but that kind of bugged me

fbi with randall park was good comedy relief

sonny birch was a bit over the top and cliché for an antagonist but he served his purpose

i wish we got to see just a few more wasp action scenes the ones we had were fabulous

speaking of which i was really pleased with where they took hopes character this movie still cool as a cucumber but a lot more personable and compassionate when the time comes i smiled every time she and scott interacted with one another and the buildup towards her meeting her mother was great

hot wheels car ah childhood

again michael peña is a national treasure

paul rudd really nailed his scenes especially when janet was channeling herself through scott just superb acting

i enjoyed seeing the  side of hank we saw in the comics but glad they didnt overdo it

janet healing ghost felt like a cop out given how hank just told foster well find a way a few minutes prior as if there was no other feasible solution other than ghost utilizing the quantum energy

i was surprised that janet actually seemed to age in the quantum realm given how hank distinctly stated that it ignores or can at least alter the fabric of time and space

is this movie foreshadowing cassie eventually becoming scott partner in a4 if he somehow travels to the future via time vortex she likely wasnt dusted so im guessing she was just out of the house at the time of the snap

if they go the route of the time vortex maybe scott will encounter some ripples within the spacetime continuum given all of dr stranges time loops and how the bill always come due

i really wish just one of the pyms survived that snap either just for scotts reaction once the one remaining pulls him out to a sea of dust or they could have both wasp and him trapped in the quantum realm scott may end up more traumatized than stark and cap what a thought

the post credits scene left me shook with the ominous silence of the house the ant going through scotts routine unaware of the chaos around him and the television showing the state of emergency i brushed it off on my first viewing but now i definitely appreciate the way it was able to convey the gravity of the situation at hand

overall a good lightheaded comedic movie that was definitely needed after iw with a nice callback in mid credits scene to remind us of the state of the remainder of the mcu 9210 for me

edit just noticed wasp is confirmed for avengers 4 surely it cant just be flashbacks right",2018-07-07
do you want to get dinner,2018-07-08
just so im not missing something hank and hope are only fugitives because scott used their technology when helping cap,2018-07-08
"i thought it was great the comedy is on point the action is great the effects are great i loved hanks hot box car box i love that they continued with paxton and maggie support scott especially with so many shows and movies when someone does something along the general concept scott did in antman theyll just ignore it the next week i though the scene of scott and cassie playing together was adorable and wanted to go down that slide myself the dont laugh scene from cassie broke me i knew someone was going to get dusted in the end credit scene after infinity war came out i just didnt expect it to be hope hank and janet

the only thing i really want in the third movie is for them to deal with the loose ends like mitchell carson the hydra agent who stole the pym particles and whoever sonnys buyer was

i really hope michael douglas gets his antman prequel as long as they use the other characters who should be around during that time period

possible spoilers

i know that there is a rumor that emma fuhrmann will play an older cassie in avengers 4 thats fine i know that we will apparently be going into the future in avengers 4 so it makes since but i really hope that they wait till abby ryder fortson is a little older before they do an young avengers movie and her stay as cassie  stature",2018-07-08
"i wonder how long scott will be in the quantum realm before someone gets him out 

i have a feeling avengers 4 might take place a few years after infinity war",2018-07-08
who else thought the post credits scene would be cassie disintegrating,2018-07-08
it was nothing special but i had fun time with likeable characters exactly what i expected and hoped for ,2018-07-08
pena is underused in the mcu he needs crossovers rudd was amazing as always wish the romance with him and hope stared earlier in the film but i cant complain it had me smiling like a little boy the whole time lilly has a smile that can make me forget about everything honestly wanted more douglas odd because i think everyone had a fair amount of screen time my only complaint is the switching between scenes it either needed more music or a notice or my theater was dead other than that no complaints solid mcu movie my top are still iw ws and cw i just hold the russo brothers to a higher standard but i think paul rudd brings a different comedy that i love ,2018-07-08
when scott was in the school and the music changed to the more childlike theme i about fell over laughing ,2018-07-08
 i have a feeling luis will be the one wholl save scott then narrates how people disintegrated ,2018-07-08
i was thinking how the worlds best grandma was just a throwaway line but assuming scott and hope get hitched wouldnt janet being in his body make it literal to cassie in relation her stepgrandma but still  ,2018-07-08
i am a big paul rudd fan but man did pena steal the movie ,2018-07-08
what if captain marvel is in the quantum realm,2018-07-09
"movie kinda stops cold for ghost’s backstory and we never really get a sense of sonny’s motivations

but this was a fun lowstakes romp michael pena was clearly having a good time loved the defective suit bit and the dynamic way size played into fights didn’t like the way shrinking was played like a whoops now you can’t see me

that credits scene though first whoa second the “time vortex” line does that play into the time travel hinted at in photos and casting for the next avengers",2018-07-09
i loved this i just clearly love the ant man character and movies im just not getting why some consider this so much inferior than equally comedic stuff like ragnarok,2018-07-10
appy ryder fortson is probably the most impressive child actor or actress i can remember off the top of my head ,2018-07-10
"this was honestly better than i was expecting it to be sure it wasnt anything great but a smallerscale marvel movie was nice to see after infinity war i personally enjoyed it even more than the first film

the action was great and all of the jokes landed for the most part which isnt something that can be said about most marvel movies story was decent and i was actually surprised at just how good of a villian ghost was after this black panther and infinity war i think marvel might finally have writing villians down

as far as my complaints there was some noticably choppy editing in more than a few scenes where the transition between them felt almost nonexistent i also wish they had done more with walton goggins character

overall 7510 for me its not one of the best mcu movies but its a fun ride and one of the better films ive seen this summer",2018-07-11
john wick 3 true lies,2018-07-19
"good fun and i laughed a lot kind of endless “oh no but now” which must have gone a little too far because i stopped and noticed interesting how they chose to mostly parallel antman with janet more than hank although a rare kind of subtle moment in sandwiching setting up hope to go inantman telling cassy she would be amazing but he’d be a terrible father if he let herhank insisting  allowed to go after janet himself

a few missed opportunities i thought 

there was a really ridiculous “as you know your father the king” exposition at the beginning and i kept expecting the ridiculousness to be acknowledged and kicked into something more interesting but no they just literally explained to each other what their motives for the last two years had been and how they knew each other and nobody onscreen seemed to find it odd 

and i thought for quite a while they were doing a kind of interesting beattheclock thing because they’d mentioned being back by lunchtime and we got lots of subtle time cues the xcons eating breakfast cassy’s school having morning recess and i liked the idea of the entire adventure being fitted into a morning but then it was suddenly night and we had much more time than i thought

but i did enjoy the awkward banter

also the science consultant has the best name and therefore i assume the best life and i wonder what the small team of illustrators were for",2018-08-04
"i saw that ign just posted an article called antman and the wasp end credits explained

i know that this is just a clickbaity trend but jesus nothing needs explaining",2018-07-06
i always like michael pena but it is offputting knowing hes a scientologist,2018-07-09
my biggest complaint about this movie is that i had to watch a trailer for hotel transylvania 3 first i die a little inside each time,2018-07-06
really liked how they handled the villain in this one she wasnt the typical evil bad guy who has a evil motivation for evil sake she just wanted to use the machine hank built to heal herself and for once the heroes help the villain at the end and not  them off it was a nice subversion and felt refreshing to see that than to see what were so tired at this point of seeing and it seemed like they knew that also walton goggins was just okay he felt a little more like a cartoonish bad guy i just wish they had more for him to do,2018-07-07
"a couple more comments

paul rudd is a phenomenal actor the part where he plays janet is given appropriate  and body gestures at every move too bad he spends half the movie being kind of hapless

hannah johnkamen is sexy af tbh i was rooting for her the whole time",2018-07-08
loooove that scene when scott being halfsized lol suuuper hilarious,2018-07-06
"i absolutely loved it everyone had great chemistry especially rudd and lily even lily and peña in the small screen time they had together ghost was a great “villain” for lack of a better term and that mid credits scene was a good connection to infinity war 

my biggest complaint about the movie is a small nitpick about scott being completely clueless about all the tech talk wasn’ established in the first movie he had a masters in engineering he should probably not be having so much trouble keeping up 

great movie enjoyed it almost as much as infinity war ",2018-07-06
i thought it was really good i think hope and scott had a good relationship that didnt feel forced and i thought that the humor was great it is a solid movie and i do not think it deserves less than a 758037 rating super cute too ,2018-07-06
underrated favorite part of the movie was the mini reunion of the shield not shield cast with shane vendrell goggins and army renta pena sharing some screentimebanter,2018-07-07
a solid contribution from ant man again  i feel like they could have done more with ghost but i was satisfied  glad that pena got to do one scene with the fasttalking story boarding type thing,2018-07-07
people talking about how marvel blew it with the villains again and i could see that with sonny maybe but ghost i thought she was done pretty well all things considered would’ve liked a little more fleshing out but overall i’d say she’s on the better list of marvel villains i actually liked that bill became this voice of reason for her in the end,2018-07-07
did scott get “lucky” or does the snap not reach the quantum realm,2018-07-07
 stuck in the quantum realm for 30 years then banished to the soul stone or where ever by thanos never thought id say this but it sucks to be michelle pfeiffer lol,2018-07-07
"so what did janet do in the quantum realm all these years what did she eat where did she sleep how did she  is she even human anymore with her et healing hands 

did paul rudd ever prank conan for this movie it’s literally all i ever want when a rudd  leading movie comes out",2018-07-07
i spent the 2nd half of the movie worried that ava was going to  with scotts daughter thank  nothing happened,2018-07-08
after watching this movie i felt entertained ,2018-07-08
if ant man isnt in avengers 4 because hes stuck in the quantum realm im gonna be   they had every other leading  the third except ant man and hawkeye  and they just killed off a bunch of them  put ant man and hawkeye in the fourth,2018-07-09
"i can understand pym particles not having any proper explanation because theyre cool and make sense in a superhero kind of way but the quantum realm is just ridiculous how did she survive down there where did she get that weird robe from

but besides that and the villain i loved the movie the humor was great all throughout",2018-07-09
"so were in a blank period until march eh my godthe theories thatll be made between now and then

im hoping hawkeye pops up in a credit scene for captain marvel weird i know but every other avenger has popped up",2018-07-09
"enjoyed it a lotas i did with the first one

especially liked the baba yaga bit",2018-07-09
the final post credit scene made me think does thanos doing his thing affect all living things are half the ants in the universe gone too obviously it doesnt just affect humans based on who disappears in infinity war,2018-07-10
when ghost is quantum phasing do we see alternate versions of her im 99 sure we do esp since laurence fishborne is talking about parallel universes during his teaching scene it legit happens after she gets the lab and goes back home when she tries to go into her containment chamber there is 1 version that goes in with the suit on and one version that is wearing a tshirt instead of a hoodie did anyone else see it ,2018-07-11
this movie felt like a saturday morning cartoon which is a compliment just plot moving the plot forward which was pretty entertaining due to the performances of the cast great summer movie,2018-07-12
david dastmalchian much better in antman 2 than antman 1,2018-08-22
"holy  guys where do i start

firstly i like how the ghost isnt a 2dimensional villain ghost had a good motivation and was sympathetic the diversifying of the character was an interesting touch and luckily doesnt seem to be much of a social justice pander since the comic character didnt have too much to his alter ego choreography was great  jokes hilariousthat  ant eating fruit loops and of course the stingers man let me tell you i cried holy  at the top of my lungs when i saw scott was stuck in the quantum realm with the pyms disintegrated due to thanos then we see the ant playing the drums from the trailers and that quote at the end with a question markdamn disney you can really tug at those heartstrings

admittedly it doesnt play too much into the overall mcu but thats fine its nice to have films like this and spider man homecoming that have a smaller story that ties into a bugger one and this one did it well 85 out of 10 from me",2018-07-06
but what did she eat in 30 years of the quantum realm and where did she get her hair and makeup done,2018-07-11
such great dialogue i noticed the character interactions were fantastic in fact the first 5 minutes had more heart and action than justice league,2018-07-06
did anyone catch the “you go low i’ll go high” scene from the trailer or was it taken out,2018-07-07
of course tim heidecker is here the entire last act is about whos gonna claim that free real estate,2018-07-08
i was really hoping the ava’s alias was going to be baba yaga,2018-07-08
now tayne i can get into,2018-07-08
so quick question i haven’t seen anyone bring up yet since scott was in the quantum realm during the snap was he immune to it,2018-07-09
"i liked it overall the humor and the action the villain was a little meh it kept taking me out of it that not only could she choose to move through walls or other things but sometimes she couldnt control it and hold objects she never had trouble walking on the floorground and they even added footstep sounds for almost everything else i just chose to kinda toss out disbeliefexcept what did janet eat for 30 years i was hoping theyd add at least a line or 2 to maybe say 30 years in the quantum realm do you guys just add the word quantum before everything doesnt feel like it there or else she spent 30 years alone and would be insane if she didnt starve 
  
how they tie it into infinity war with the stinger is great i actually said oh  out loud ",2018-07-09
"i enjoyed this movie but i was disappointed with the villain she did some cool things but her back story and motivations werent that interesting 

also where did janet get those clothes in the quantam realm",2018-07-09
i really liked the baba yaga background told by one of the friendly cons this movie made me laugh so much ,2018-07-09
my entire theater lost their collective  at the post credits scene,2018-07-11
overall i really liked it but maybe it could have benefited with one less villain maybe cut out sonny burch so they could flesh out ghost more ,2018-07-11
i wonder which dc actor theyre going to get next i really want to see phiefer and keaton look at each other in infinity war 2 and have hank ask if she knows him lol ,2018-07-14

"after midcredit scene

marvel you thought you were going to enjoy this film",2018-07-06
foreshadowing cassie does eventually become scott’s partner when he’s out of the quantum realm and they work together with tony to figure out the time travel situation,2018-07-06
"having watched the first antman again recently i think i enjoyed this much a lot more frankly the villain in the first movie was just so bad and forgettable that having ghost as a villain with clear and understandable intentions did a lot for me at the same time the southern guy didnt really have much of a purpose in the movie other than to contrive more action scenes and add comedy

im glad they brought back the luis storytelling scenes from the first movie and loved how they took a selfaware jab at the baseball cap and sunglasses incognito look",2018-07-07
"just finished watching the movie probably one of the funniest marvel movies along with thor ragnarok 
love the fact that the villain wasnt actually evil but just trying to survive

just a good time all around ",2018-07-08
"just got out my first impression very solid mcu film just not one of the absolute best i’d say it’s middle of the pack this opinion could change after subsequent viewings however still very enjoyable overall now some noteshighlights for me

 wasp was badass and i’m glad she got plenty of time to shine
 however i also wish we could have seen more of scott in actual combat instead of just runningchasing things and being used for comedic effect the whole “suitpowerswhatever not working” plot point i feel like has now been done to death in mcu i was totally cool with him being sidelined a bit in favor of wasp just wish there had been a better reason 
 really like that marvel has been going in the direction of more sympathetic and “human” villains recently ghost wasn’t an amazing character imo but she also wasn’t just a generic revengepowerhungry antagonist so i still enjoyed her more than a lot of mcu villains 
 once again found myself laughing quite a bit one of the reasons the antman franchise is becoming one of my favorites in mcu michael pena was comedic gold every time he was on screen man needs to be in more movies 
 both credit scenes were great even if somewhat expected the second one in particular i enjoyed i got somewhat of a falloutlike vibe from it in the way it mixed the humor and absurdity of the film with an undertone of post apocalyptic horror 
 cassie was absolutely adorable and in general i loved all the family interactions
woo was an unexpectedly great character 
 finally that tim heidecker cameo ",2018-07-09
only thing that would have make the movie better for me would be if instead of the ant in the second after credits scene it was just the daughter walking around her empty house calling for her mom,2018-07-06
ive never heard of a movie being described as a palate cleanser lol,2018-07-06
fun popcorn movie nothing stellar and nothing really bad to say think ruddlilly’s chemistry is one of the best in the mcu,2018-07-06
anyone else spend the movie watching ghost and seeing all the variances whenever she phased i really loved it especially when she left the lab,2018-07-06
how good was that car chase scene though so much fun to watch,2018-07-06
there really werent anyone evil  everyone was fairly nice,2018-07-06
the 1st end cedit scene was kinda obvious and i was expecting it the whole time admittingly i was expect scott to die too,2018-07-06
i liked how contrast the film was with infinity war this is just rescuing 1 person that is literally it in comparison of half of the entire universe being dusted simple story which why i liked it,2018-07-06
2 hours in the bathroom whatever thats about,2018-07-06
glad michael pena got to knock someone out in one punch again his true super power,2018-07-06
in soviet russia ghost is baba yaga,2018-07-06
basically ant man and wasp arent in infinity war because no one felt like flying to the west coast to pick them up same with hawkeye even if he got a longer house arrest youd think the current situation would be worth breaking that house arrest,2018-07-06
i enjoyed this one as much as the last but is it just me or is hank kind of a  also it seems like everyone from his past disagrees with his story as opposed to corroborating it,2018-07-06
"perfectly solid marvel movie probably not great for rewatches since half the plot is person has the thing get em

i thought all the deaged characters were really cool to see

watching wasp flying around beating the  out of people is the first time ive ever considered the antman characters superpowered i can easily see wasp trashing a lowertier mcu hero like falcon no problem

this movies stan lee cameo is great

the postcredits scene was kind of a weird place to leave off on and im wondering how theyre gonna explain it in the next avengers

it’s been awhile since i’ve seen a film with such great pacing there was never a moment where i wasn’t entertained major props to the director writers and editors for that,2018-07-06

in a4 janet is going to reform herself like dr manhattan because she is now molecule man ",2018-07-06

i kinda hoped that luis would have been in the giant suit when scott snuck back home either way i hope that he gets to use the suit in the third movie ,2018-07-07
overall a great movie but i did feel like it was a little overstuffed with both villains ghost was an interesting departure from usual marvel villains but as much as i love walton goggins legitimately one of the most underrated actors currently working his villain fell flat and was totally unnecessary that’s really the biggest issue i have with this movie  it felt like such a waste of the great walton goggins,2018-07-08
truth serum and baba yaga brilliant ,2018-07-09
i’m assuming the time vortex that janet refers to in the midcredit scene will play a big part in scott escaping as well as a4 end game,2018-07-10
so when scott got a facetime from cassie and said i have to pick up if i dont shell think somethings wrong and go to my place  am i reading too much into the second end credit scene to assume that cassie has also disappeared due to how empty and untouched scotts apartment appeared to be ,2018-07-10
credits scenes killed me all over again and the emergency broadcast tone with the ant playing the drums was subtle but the implications are nuts post snap earth,2018-07-11
real solid film def lacking on the pfeiffer but i loved randall park he nailed it,2018-07-11

i loved the opening of the movie of them pretending to be on an antman adventure in the cardboard box all the way through the giant group hug i really loved how wholesome scott is in this movie and when he answers his video call while tied up had me laughing so hard,2018-07-06
i tought that having the top 3 minds in quantum physics would make an impact on the war against thanos then they get  dusted spoiler,2018-07-06
"i liked this sequel a lot and the smaller scope of the movie is much appreciatted after infinity war the pacing is very fast and works great for the comedic tone it feels like a family or summer movie in a good way 

the movie is also surprsingly touching the family themes really got me invested and even if they werent as great for janets character every scene with young cassie worked for me 

wasp was amazing and i think its really nice to see a strong woman with so much agency in a superhero movie another aspect that really made me happy was how cassie wanted to be a superhero just like her father having a young girl dreaming about becoming a superhero is very inspirational and i cant wait to see if she is becoming stature in the mcu ",2018-07-06
i havent seen anyone talk about the stan lee cameo personally i thought that was easily a top 5 appearence from himgot the biggest laugh in the theater,2018-07-06
"it’s a comedy and a superhero film i know but you guys i have questions 

how is janet not emotionally and mentally unstable after being alone in an alien environment for over thirty years

also where did she get access to makeup a hair dryer water food cloth sewing supplies etc

i loved ghost  i love it when the villains dont get killed so hopefully shell play a role in future movies,2018-07-07
about the mid cred scene in iw we saw a ship destroying a city how is that we dont see any reference to what is happening in wakanda i mean the avengers are fighting all over the world and then nothing in this movie ,2018-07-07
another top tier marvel movie  great mix of funny emotional and badass,2018-07-07
"the movie was super funny and visual effects great there were really no stakes but just a family trying to get back their mother so i was okay with that after the events of iw

however the midcredit scene killed me again lol",2018-07-07
the movie was great but the countdown clock at plank’s distance was ridiculous time is not really a thing down there ,2018-07-07
"i wasnt expecting too much but i actually liked this one much better than the first one it also had some of the best humor in the mcu and that midcredits scene

edit also someone should really edit that clip where hank starts up the quantum realm ship with holdos hyperspace kamikaze",2018-07-07
"saw this tonight  
  
it was a decent story that was real funny i wasnt a fan of the first film but this one hit all the right notes im hoping theres another ant man movie now with evangeline lilly back in because i feel she is why a lot of this worked so well rudd and her play off each other well  
  
there is a mid credit and end credit scene for those wondering  
  
edit the fbi guy had a break out role he could have been so forgettable but he made that character stand out",2018-07-07
scott better be naming one of his rides  hugh grant in the third movie ,2018-07-07
did anyone else see what looked like a city in the quantum realm as hank and his wife left it looked like it was in a bubble kind of like a gungan city in phantom menace,2018-07-07
"even though i went in expecting to see people get snapped as some tiein for infinity war those credit scenes still gave me a good shock  


evangeline lilly was my favorite part of the movie she did a fantastic job as the wasp and i hope we get to see more of her in the mcu i also appreciate the scopescale of the conflicts in the antman movies so far the first being pretty much a heist movie and the second one being a rescue missionunderstand the quantum realm by dr pym kind of a refreshing departure of the stop the villain from taking over the worlddestroying the universe trope that every other mcu hero has to deal with  


i really only have three main gripes about the movie

 did not like how the trailers used every single action scene in them
 so were they unable to perform some of the quantum tunnel experiments while the building was shrunk down or something yet hank pym traveled into the quantum realm while the entire building was shrunken down wouldt it have been easier to do all the major experiments while the building was shrunken down and safely hidden
 for violating the sokovian accords scott seems to have gotten off pretty scot free",2018-07-07
did anyone see thanos face in the quantum realm right before the three got snapd at the end creditsspoiler,2018-07-07
"i think ghost is a really cool antagonist with a sympathetic background and hannah johnkamen has an interesting presence thats somewhat dazzling but i cant help to wonder ghosts actual strength she could phase and disappear at will but how could she gained all those superhuman strength like kicking scott through walls and stuff 

and in the trailer theres a scene where ant man uppercuts a guy then wasp took him down but i noticed theres no such in the actual film",2018-07-08
felt like i got trolled by that after credits scene,2018-07-08
antoniooo,2018-07-08
lots of fun creative uses of pym particles scotts stand in ant was hilarious and the music was surprisingly good for a mcu movie this track has been in my head since yesterday,2018-07-08
man i loved it michael peña was hilarious i enjoyed it way more than the first one ,2018-07-09
definitely enjoyed the first more but still had a fun time really wished we had the chance to see more of scott and his old crew working together on their new company they felt a little too sidelined hopefully in the next one assuming everything works out in avengers 4,2018-07-09
i thought bringing janet back and her learning new powers while in the quantum realm was going to be a big key to resolving things in the next avengersand then she got snapped ,2018-07-09
didnt jump out of the standard marvel movie mold but it was fun ill enjoy watching it again ,2018-07-09
i wonder is the slide scene at the beginning a reference to the troll trailer he used at conan all the time,2018-07-09
"i thought this film was a lot more wholesome than i expected which i think is a welcome relief after infinity war

for anyone expecting to get a glimpse of what happens after infinity war 

no luck as this movie happens prior to the snap end credit scene is what happens to them during the snap

which honestly makes it seem like there will be no antman or wasp in the upcoming avengers film and that paul rudd and evangeline lilly will only be in the 3rd antman movie because rudd being stuck in the quantum realm and being rescued could be its own movie instead of a small part in the bigger picture but id love to seem them in the avengers movie stillspoiler

personally i think the acting was great this has a great cast imo there were plenty of jokes and the danger wasnt world breaking in fact it was actually pretty small and personal the story was short and simple in fact with the jokes i felt like this was possibly the funniest and lighthearted marvel movie to date michael pena and paul rudd are just hilarious 

moreover i was pretty surprised that the side villain was more like the actual villain in the film while ghost was more of a loki type villain except of wanting to be appreciated she just wanted to save her own life and was also more sympathetic too as wellspoiler

having said all that there were a few plot holes in this film and a lot of unexplained things that happened but for the most part they were minor and didnt really affect the story in a major way 

minor side note i personally didnt like evangeline lillys first hairdo in the first movie but her hair in a ponytail to me is really attractive ",2018-07-09
do yall think luis would get a suit he said he wants one and hes okay with it not having a superpower him and hope seems pretty cool with each other and hes very close with scott maybe theyll gift him a powerless suit i mean hes helped them a lot in their missions ,2018-07-09
"when i saw janet in the quantum realm with a sick looking spear my first thought was how the  did she get a chitauri weapon

then my mind went to stuff like annihilus and the negative zone probably wont lead to anything sadly",2018-07-10
janet just cant catch a break ,2018-07-11
i’m so sad janet hope and hank were deleted,2018-07-11
so i’m thinking the buyer of hanks lab is ten rings i’m also wondering if the man who hired xcon isn’t the actual mandarin i have this theory that 10 rings will be the hydra type villain for this next phase of films guzman was mentioned when what’s his face was on the ferry a guzman showed up on iron man 3 so i keep thinking they are telling us it’s 10 rings and the mandarin ,2018-07-12
"it was ok the action scenes involving ant man and wasp doing ant man and wasp things were top notch michael peña and co are still charming enough the cast did their jobs just fine and the story itself was ok but overall it felt kind of boring also what  me off were the plotholes in the first film if i remeber correctly you must wear the suit at all times if you change sizes because otherwise you would die but in this one scott sometimes has his  helmet off when hes bigger or smaller but since he isnt in the subatomic world i guess we can skip over that but and this is unforgivable when hank goes to save his wife and meets up with her none of them are wearing proper suits and this plothole just took me out of the movie completely ghost was poorly executed as a villian and just came off as annoying instead of tragic and the texan guy was jus meh

overall you could do a lot worse and after seeing the midcredits scene im looking foward to seeing more of ant man in avengers 4 but compared to other mcu movies its definitly one of the weakest entries in the sharred universe ",2018-07-12
wow that was much better than i expected it to be ,2018-07-19
the jokes were on point,2018-08-22
"it is much better than the first one 

if is a familycomedy movie the bad guys are not even so bad",2018-10-29
"the contrast of the lighthearted fun and more relaxed nature of antman and the wasp against the cynical dread in the infinity war tiein scene was brutal it took me back to sitting in the theatre in april and just knowing how dire everything is it was fantastic to remind us how much will be at stake in a4

plus scott still being in the quantum realm thatll be intresting to see unfold i wish janet couldve survived the snap at least especially given her new powers thatll come into play a bit more eventually though

overall it was a nice and relaxing breath to take after black panther and infinity war until the aftercredits scene at least",2018-07-06
did anyone else think that they added one too many former associates of hank pym i think it wouldve worked better if theyd simply made laurence fishburnes character as avas father and have her mother be the sole casualty of that experiment it wouldve made fishburnes character have a stronger impetus towards helping and saving ava and the resolution with michelle pfeiffer healing ava would also be stronger as it would represent that lost maternal symbol to her as well  ,2018-07-07
"i’m bummed i saw the entire car chase scene in the trailers it would’ve been awesome seeing a giant hello kitty pez dispenser for the first time in the theater

hate how trailers these days basically reveal the entire movie ",2018-07-09
when janet meets hank in the quantum realm and when they board the ship did she call him henry once did that actually happen or did i mishear it completely,2018-07-22
i guess janet adapting is how she didnt eat for 30 years ,2018-07-06
that was worth the money for the end credits scene alone,2018-07-06
so is janet van dyne the first mutant in the mcu she said she evolved and now she has powers outside the quantum realm i feel like her evolution is a subtle mutant reference ,2018-07-06

"i enjoyed the unapologetic silly fun with this movie its a breath of fresh air after infinity war and black panther which were more serious films moreover i like the smaller scope of searching and saving hopes mom as oppose to saving the world or universe 

i always like how grounded the antman films are there are tons of people in the mcufilms and tv shows with daddy issues but here in this movie you have hope and hank working sidebyside in the film which is refreshing i was surprised by the screen time michael douglas has but he has great comic relief especially with paul rudd hope is also interesting because of how shes part of a family of superheroes well until that mid credits scene 

scott lang though is arguably the most relatable grounded marvel superhero and thats thanks to paul rudds everymaness scotts fit for sure but nothing like thor or captain america hes also smart with his electrical engineering background but not to the extent of hank pym bruce banner or tony stark guy is also an average fighter compared to all those martial arts masters like black widow cap etc hes also isnt some quipping machines and a lot of time his humor comes from stating absurditiesbaseball cap disguise or being the butt of jokes too  

really like evangeline lilys chemistry with paul rudd all the jabs she frequently gave him were great how did she change into her wasp costume so fast after the first meeting with sunny 

the villains were weak though sunny kind of felt like a joke villain which work i guess given the movies tone ghost was more of a misunderstood villain who just wanted to live her powers were interesting though and the coop attack with wasp and antman to defeat her was cool 

also the product placements kind of felt obvious in this film especially with hyundai that said was hoping for a return of baskin robbins as a joke 
",2018-07-10
truth serum part is one the best things in all of marvel movies ,2018-07-06
scotts going in the time vortex for sure right that wasnt a throw away line,2018-07-06
ghost ended up a surprisingly strong villain with a solid motivation the trailers presented her as just a onenote “bad guy with a better suit” but instead they made her “power” a weakness that she has to exploit really clever i thought,2018-07-06
scott lang deserves best grandma ever for that insane cardboard labyrinth and roller coaster ,2018-07-06
through out the entire movie i was expecting someone to turn into dust and it delivered the tone of the movie shift immediately and matched the tone of infinity war cannot wait for a4,2018-07-06
"was i the only one that was extremely tense at the end as “come on get happy” played i was expecting cassie and hope to fade into dust as it cut to black 

the post credit scenes here make thanos even more terrifying in my book as it further displays the ramifications of his actions especially the one with the ebs playing pure dread after such a fun film ",2018-07-06
"i loved the movie but one thing really bothered me

so pym co can shrink building take them around and unshrink them again on any level ground how does that work with foundations utilities like plumbing and electricity

",2018-07-06
"can anyone give explanation to me on why the lab or its inside doesnt go subatomic on the car chase scene it was shrunk twice when the car got shrunk while it still inside its been bothering me

someone here mentioned the lab was actually a scale model enlarged to a normal size building but what about the equipments inside",2018-07-06
going by the time works differently in the quantum realm and all the quantum energy thing maybe scott will have sufficient exposure in there to evolve and get minor quantum powers like janet maybe,2018-07-07
"i liked this movie a lot more than the first one and i think a lot of that it was thanks to ghost i loved that she was the antagonist without being a villain and that she was more than a match for the heroes i also liked that they defeated her without killing or vanquishing her no they defeated her by helping her achieve what she wanted and then turned around and continued their research to further help her its such a great change of pace from the usual marvel villains as was thanos for that matter

now excuse me while i impatiently wait two more long weeks for the fourth season of killjoys so i can get more hannah johnkamen",2018-07-07
not bad weird that they put the end credit scene in the trailer,2018-07-07
how about a juice box that part was priceless,2018-07-07
"not sure if anyone’s said it yet but

oh snap ",2018-07-07

"so i was hoping janet would come out still the same age she went in like the 30 years or so were only like 30 seconds to her kind of like a flight of the navigator deal hank repeated that time and space act differently in the quantum realm

it seems to raise more questions having her age appropriately then to keep her in her young how did she  did she sleep eat im shocked she still can speak english after have no one to talk to for 30 years ",2018-07-07
are scott and hope a couple in the comics as far as romance goes in the mcu theyre probably my favorite i like how their infatuation is shown in the movie its there but subtle,2018-07-07
i don’t know if it was the same in the us and other countries but loved that he used mary antoinette and antonio banderas as names,2018-07-07

the cure morrisseymaybe joy divisionnew order in the next one,2018-07-08
i liked the movie overall i think they did a pretty good job trying to balance all the new characters and kept allot of the same humor from the first but with better action sequences added in the only thing that bugs me is by the time thanos has snapped his fingers allot of crazy  has gone down not just on other worldsin space but on earth too i feel like pym and company would have heard about it but they seem either oblivious or just super nonchalant about the whole thing i could be not remembering things correctly too so who knows,2018-07-08
i was waiting for the ant to fade away at the end shot,2018-07-09
"1 scott has gotten himself out of the quantum realm before why can’t he do it again
2 hank could control getting in and out of the quantum realm in his quantum ship are you telling me he didn’t implement the same technology into scott’s suit they didn’t think about a safety switch or anything if something were possibly to go wrong pretty  if scott was totally reliant on a single control panel to get him in and out of the quantum realm",2018-07-09

"pros

  paul rudd is the highlight of this movie and brings it down to earth scott lang is some average guy who just happens to have access to a shrink suit rudd does a good job of bringing out this side of the character
 despite the movie taking place before infinity war i did feel some sort of tension when they were rescuing janet which i didnt expect to have since the stakes shown in the movie trailers seemed pretty low and uninteresting to me
 i found myself laughing a bit more than a usual marvel movie which i usually dont do that was likely thanks again to paul rudd and some humorous running gags throughout the movie 
 i like how ghosts motivation was not to take over the world make money or to just cause mayhem for the heck of it not to say those motivations are always bad for a movie but i do like a break from that



cons

 a lot of the important plot details were just scifi mumbo jumbo and it kinda took me out of the movie at some points thats probably why the do you guys just stick quatum in front of everything now remark stuck with me a lot
 ghosts motivations werent terrible but her blaming pym for her dads death seemed like a stretch
 sonny the other antagonist just seemed like a nuisance and i never felt he was ever a threat to any of the protagonists plus his character essentially being unethical shady business man 198456 is really going to make him forgettable like a lot of other marvel villains
 this is kind of a nitpick but ghosts costume just rubbed me the wrong way it looked cheap and really uninspired there was something jarring about seeing it when ghost gets back to her chamber after stealing pyms workplace no idea if anyone else shares that same feeling though

overall

i would recommend seeing this movie if you just wanted a marvel movie to ease you back in after infinity war this does the job  if you wanted a marvel movie that keeps up with the serious tone of infinity war or a movie that ties into it  youll probably be dissapointed but might get a kick out of this anyway",2018-07-08
"how is it so hard for the fbi to find a  building like they get no tips at all about a disappearing building or cant they scan for suddenly appearing buildings somehow it really shouldve been a small warehouse or a house not a full sized building

i also noticed the lack of blood and injuries more than usual without consequences it all just feels wrong and nonsensical ",2018-10-03
"as i was walking into the theatre it occurred to me what makes me pay to watch marvel movies even the ones that i have almost zero interest in it was when i was deciding between skyscraper and ant man

do i want to watch die hard with the rock or a marvel movie

i wont remember a thing from this movie aside from one or two good jokes one decent action scene one or two nice character moments and thats about it but then i compared it to skyscraper which will probably be another generic blockbuster action movie with utterly forgettable or even painfully bad writing wrapped up in two hours of excuses to go from one action set piece to another the thing that sets marvel apart is the overarching story and the recurring characters

marvel movies are like csi you get a whole library of episodes that go from bad to decent and one or two that are absolutely amazing every once in a while and then it goes back to its standard level of quality not bad but nothing really memorable

you dont go to a marvel movie expecting the next godfather you go in there expecting to be entertained for two hours and marvel has the rest of the market beat on that front",2018-07-18

"i laughed so hard almost the entire film it was so funny and nice to watch after work xd i was positively surprised that the easter egg was so obviously a result of what happened in avengers 3 but also so simple that somebody who had not watched avengers 3 wouldnt really be spoiled by it

on a side note is it only me who thought there were similarities between ghost and winter soldier both used by hydra as super operatives although i find her abilities much more useful and rare than buckys sad and angry and hurting and dangerous and traumatized both probably killed a lot of innocent ppl knowingly or unknowingly",2018-08-02
8 months until the next mcu movie this gonna be a long wait,2018-07-06
"fun movie 710
overall lots of hilarious banter from paul rudd and michael pena as well as plenty of easy to follow and consume action sequences a few concerns

1 how did janet van dyne survive in the quantum realm what did she eat and drink how did she speak perfect english after that much time in isolation no mental degradation or trauma  it felt a bit too much of a suspension of disbelief
1 too many flourishes of sciencey gibberish to explain things in the quantum realm  in the end we werent learning a great deal other than whether they could progress the story
1 ghost was not a rational villain and didnt feel important to this story it would have been better if we saw more redeeming qualities for her character to allow us to sympathise with her at the end i didnt really care if she died she was getting in the way of the main plot

on the positive
i loved the dynamic with scott his daughter and exwife  partner the cgi for young hank and janet was exceptional post credit scenes were great and put it back into the context of the whole mcu the truth serum storytelling scene by pena was a nice callback to the first and was hilarious this time as well

i was glad i saw this movie",2018-07-07
am the only one that thought the beginning felt like a random scene it only felt like it started after the marvel intro and the movie only begun an hour in  ,2018-07-07
i really enjoyed this film  lily stole her scenes  rudd sweet talking hank and hope  that  seagull ate antonio banaderas  does antman even exist in the universe while he is subatomic,2018-07-08
i was really hoping for peña to do another story telling by the end of the movie need more than one of those ,2018-07-09
"it was a fun film i can definitely see that marvel wants antman to be the family friendly part of the marvel universe

ghost was honestly a better villain than yellow jacket as her motivations made more sense as she was just desperate to survive and yellow jacket wanted revenge for being fired when she was talking to scott when hope and hank were still knocked out to me she was extremely intimidating in that scene with the way she was speaking and acting

this was the funniest movie ive seen this year hands down the jokes landed more this time compared to the first one

one thing i didn’t like was the whole deus ex machina at the end of the movie where janet simply heals ghost with her hands but since it’s a family movie i guess they didnt want someone dying no one died in the movie i think unless you count the end credits it felt like janet was hinting towards mutants with her little evolution and adaptation talk with hank when she was rescued

i am guessing from the end credits scott has to through one of those time tunnels that janet mentioned a minute before and looks like no wasp in infinity war part 2
",2018-07-11
how did janets mind not turn to mush after 30 years of basically solitary confinement i could imagine someone would be pretty messed up in the head after that,2018-07-11
holy  that mid credits scene didn’t expect all of them ,2018-07-06
the post credits scenes might be two of the best marvels made so far the crowd reaction to the first one was awesome ,2018-07-06

"the whole magic gang had me rolling 


seriously howd you do that",2018-07-06
just saw it   better than the reviews have given it credit for i thought   i thought the last scene was the best post credit scene in a marvel flick only because after the light tone it comes out of left field which i thought fit in perfectly with the misdirection thing   truth be told i thought goggins character was pretty superfluous and since i thought ghost was so cool it would have been better to really develop her out and skip his altogether but it wasnt a deal breaker  i do hope we see more of ghost in the futurespoiler,2018-07-06
this movie was like half scott and hope staring at eachother and half michael pena and squad being hilarious also how did janet age but didn’t need to eat and drink to stay alive hmmmm,2018-07-06
okay but where was hawkeye,2018-07-06

this is a quick fun heartfelt movie and its my 8th favorite mcu film,2018-07-07
well ,2018-07-07
will antman get those healing powers from the quantum realm and save some people in avengers 4,2018-07-07
i think this might have been the first marvel movie to show a clip from the after credits scene in the trailer,2018-07-08
watched it yesterday full of laughs everyone in the theater was basically like o  at the mid credit scene loved the fact that marvel uses these smaller movies to bring a lighter mood especially following iw and bp ,2018-07-08
movie was fantastic  quickly became a favorite and overtook the first one  these antman films find strike a perfect balance with humor and story much like gotg  ,2018-07-08
i’m glad that they referenced them my favorite b movie of all time not once but twice ,2018-07-09
as far as sequels go i think it was pretty solid the plot was rather meh but the characterization was excellent lots of solid jokes like one might expect for a marvel movie i think the most interesting thing to me is that like the first movie they didnt have much in the way of action and saved almost all of it sans one fight scene early on for an extended chase sequence at the end its an unusual choice for pacing and one that i still appreciate it let the movie focus on the characters and give them time to breathe rather than get distracted with hitting the plot beat checklist,2018-07-09
good movie had a fun time watching it looking forward for next part,2018-07-09
is this the first standalone mcu film to not have another marvel superhero in it thats not in the titlesorry wasp the first antman had falcon even if it was not a long sequence,2018-07-09
i think that abby ryder fortson stole every scene she was in i look forward to seeing what she does with her career and would actually love to see her play stature if the mcu is still going strong at 20 years old,2018-07-09
"the movie was alright had some good moments  but the end credits scene floored me  like i knew it was coming didnt know who tho but  thats actually a much more brilliant set up than i was expecting tbh

right now it feels like theyre moving the chess pieces right where they need to be for a4 and i cant wait to see how captain marvel factors in",2018-07-11
"i liked this one it was pretty entertaining pretty fun it understood something that a lot of marvel movies dont  humour is more than just  quips like my biggest laugh from a marvel movie since homecoming i think was that  grin cassie had in that one scene i get that either marvel or their hardcore stans i dunno arent over the avengers yet but change the humour game already lol nice change of pace in that regard 

the dramatic elements to this movie were okay felt like they were kind of there for the reunion scene like the scene where hank has that existential nightmare thing in his house was interesting and couldve really been something but it felt more tacked on than anything to me the relationship stuff with scott and hope was cute ghost was fine the luis story thing was cool but it also felt like we gotta get all these done now people loved it in the first one so one big scene now it was cool tho rudd and lily had fun with it lol agent woo was rad as  tho randall park is the best 

oh i guessed three people were gonna be dusted for the postcredit scene  hank janet and cassie i wouldve guessed hope but i was totally betting she wouldve been in a4 ah well cant win em all plus cassie wouldve been too dark for a marvel movie lol overall a fun movie i had a good time",2018-07-11
"was anyone else who watched the movie reminded about the never trust an elf meme 

i wont say if it was confirmed or denied but this was the only thing on my mind while i was watching lol",2018-07-19
i really liked the movie i thought it was funny and gripping not a surprise from a marvel film though i have one big question about the film so we now know that the events of the film are at the same time that infinity wars are but we seem to get no information from the news or  the police or any kind of other media and that is kind of strange beacuse in my opinion of the news could report so fast on scott being giant man at the last part of the film how could they not know about thanos and the avengers fighting them if anyone knows the answer please tell me beacuse im really curious,2018-07-30
 good movie,2018-08-22
plenty lttp but i found this film to be plenty boring unfortunately ,2018-10-03
"i liked the cast i hope we havent seen the last of walton goggins in the mcu and some of the action sequences and comedy and kinda hated everything else about this movie i still dont quite get a lot of the rules in antman world 

placing it between the two parts of infinity war i know theyre gonna call the next part something else still its the second half of that movie does it no favors either",2018-10-03
"i liked it not as much as the first one but i liked it 

though i got to say im having difficulties with villains whose motive is childish egoism  dont talk to me about pain ghost says at some point to justify the fact that she wants to  janet or kidnap cassie i kinda hate the i dont care if i make people suffer because i myself suffered a lot i dont know why but it feels pretty cheap ",2018-10-08
i thought it was fun to watch wasp is dope,2018-10-28
"ant man 1 was definitely one of my top marvel films and i definitely liked this better than ant man 1 pulling together my thoughts about why

overall even better chemistry between all the characters hopescotthank and cassie really good scenes between scott and cassie in particular cassies mom and stepdad didnt have a ton of screen time but i love all the family scenes not just the ones between cassie and scott


the kid playing cassie became a much better actress in such a short amount of time in the first movie a lot of her lines sounded like she had just gotten an off screen parent to prompt her 10 seconds before saying it and not terribly convincingly in this one not only was she convincing but her  expressions had a ton of pathos her performance was good even by adult standards


no origin story frees up a ton of time the training montage of ant man 1 was necessary but felt so rote even if they did try to infuse it with as much character as possible with scott starting his trend of naming ants there

michael pena and co are hilarious as usual but they were smart enough not to overdo his fasttalking bit even after how popular it was in the first movie it was great that his sidekicks saved the day at the end and got them some financial success

the humor was always on point and ant man being more of a comedy in the first place it never felt like there was too much like with thor 3 even though there was more humor compared to the first one

what i didnt like much was everything to do with michelle pffeifers character she was a big macguffin to keep the plot moving but thats all everything she did was basically a magic handwave hack teh quantummsss through possession magiced a cloak out of nothing dont have to eat quantum powers fixes bad guy immediately so everything ends happy within 30 seconds meh i guess it was necessary but felt very lazy",2018-07-06

"a couple of questions

whats the point of a tunnel ant man 1 showed us you can enter the realm by just shrinking

how did scott have connections with the original wasp what was that antenna she mentioned how was she controlling him

how does the original wasp have healing powers evolution whaaat

why not just bring the original wasp the growing discs instead of using the dangerous tunnel method

why not shrink the building to an even smaller size so its easier to hide

why collect quantum healing energy janet already has healing powers




",2018-07-07
"i found antman and the wasphttpmanapopcomfilmantmanandthewasp2018review to be an immensely fun flick  building nicely on the previous film  and with some of the most original action set pieces yet

stray thoughts

 marvel’s actor deaging software is getting better and better

  how his being locked up in the raft a high security prison maintained by shield during captain america civil war was commuted to house arrest in this film is never explained

 bobby cannavale returns as the husband of lang’s exwife and his character nicely bucks the trend of  movie stepdads

 the movie could have used a bit more wasp action what we got was fantastic i just wanted more

 having enlarged ants as laboratory assistants was bloody brilliant

 that janet van dyne managed to stay sane while being trapped for 30 years in the quantum realm is quite impressive

 i’m not sure how the contents of hank pym’s shrunken building survive all the jostling they experience during the movie’s “great keepaway” chase sequence",2018-07-07
"my only nit picky flaw with the midcredits scene is that ebony maw and the other big guy attacked new york hours before thanos actually did the snap in infinity war 

wouldn’t that be huge headline news antman hope and hank seem like they didn’t even know earth was visited by aliens again when they were trying to harvest quantum energy in the midcredits scene which takes place a minute before the snap actually happens",2018-07-08
paul rudd such an underrated actor,2018-07-09
"personally i think it did an good job most importantly its point was ant man and wasps chemistry which was spot on action was neat score was top notch dude micheal pena needs a solo movie coming to the most important part the snap i guess we expected this to happen one way or another but still it was brutal i wished janet stayed kinda panicked me hearing scott scream and yes i noticed mirror dimension thanos face shaped something iron mans armor in the quantum realm mid credits scene 
now how he will come back captain marvel or he will find his own way my theory is since janet mentions something about time vortex scott will make a time jump which will send in future
marvel you  ",2018-07-15
something i haven’t seen mentioned yet but i thought was a cool little easter egg when scott is showing off his close up magic and does the trick where he snaps and the card changes from a queen to a 6 he snaps and the card’s “value” queen could be considered “12” ie 10 j11 q12 k13 is halved just like the population when thanos snapped in iw ,2018-07-07
"i liked it not perfect but also not too big for its britches so to speak

my little thing  sonny burch goggins was a silly character  never heard of himdidnt need him  i understand why he was there thoughthey needed more bad guy fodder

so at the end when hope asks cassie what she wants to do when she grows up she says “i want to help people like my dad” takes on a different meaning after the post credits scene,2018-07-13
haven’t seen it yet upvoted for tayne ,2018-07-06
nice nod to hank pym as the original antman in the comics when he wore that suit as he goes to rescue janet love how michael douglas portrays him as the hero that he is other than being just a mentor to scott lang,2018-07-07
"the movements and style of movement that ghost made were the same strange made when looking back in time phasing in and out this further cements the time stone and the quantum realm having some connection
  
i think there will be a time jump with antman coming back to a future earth after the snap think 4 years odd through a time vortex to escape the quantum realm
  
life has moved on but his bringing the pym tech to a future stark gives the avengers the possible out they need using the quantum energy to create a device that phases the avengers back to the battle for new york to influence the changes needed to get the stones before thanos and correct their timeline to make the click never occur",2018-07-07
my grandma had a jukebox that only played morrissey is by far the best thing to come out of this decade of marvel,2018-07-10

i dont think walton goggins was really necessary for the film though you could probably remove him and merge his subplot with ghosts and itd be pretty much the same i honestly thought he was hinting at a greater villain in his scene with hope when he was talking about selling to other customers 


evangeline lilly was definitely the star of the movie the interactions with langs daughter were really good too the movie ultimately had too many subplots going on at once though it was kind of jarring to keep swapping between so many ",2018-07-06

its definitely an improvement of the first film while the films story and humor is very familiar all the bts drama not being here makes a big difference 

overall i would highly recommend this if youre a fan of the mcu",2018-07-06
"there is a lot of parallels between this movie and the winter soldier hank pym is to scott lang what nick fury is to steve rogers then you got an older partner of hanks with whom he had a falling out and that guy has a new foot soldier that he is working with ghost just like alexander pierce and ws both ghost and ws were being controlled by shield to do missions for them but at some point they were innocent people both were in accidents that didnt  them but gave them some special powers

then the movies end with ghost being cured of her affliction but still on the run because she knows she is still wanted and ws being able to remember rogers and also going into hiding",2018-07-06

i dont know if this is achievable but can someone explain to me where janet got the cloakhood she was wearing when hank found her in the quantum realm in his flashback she disappeared on the missile while only wearing the wasp suit and she became trapped in the quantum realm for however many decades in a subatomic dimension outside of time and space that everything weve seen of it makes it appear to be either a dark void you float through or a landscape akin to walking on the surface of a quark like its the size of an island i didnt exactly see any life of any kind at that level yet janet showed up wearing a new white hoodcloak over her wasp suit,2018-07-09

i really liked it,2018-07-29
"i liked it i wish we learned more about the quantum realm though

also i read that in the comics cassie gets her own powers anyone think theyre going in that direction with the next upcoming movies they didnt show her getting snapped so its possible she grows up a scientist ormeets a scientisttony and stumbles on a way to bring her father back just like they did for the mother",2018-07-30
"so i got to thinking about this movie and how the time vortex within the quantum realm will likely play a role in avengers 4 heres my theory thats probably already been said somewhere edit this is not confirmed but in case this could be true dont read if you dont want potential spoilers

while scott is trapped within the quantum realm he will eventually fall into the abyss of the time vortex while there  notice there are numerous tears in the fabric of the spacetime continuum mainly due to dr stranges time loops given that avengers 4 is potentially casting an older cassie it is plausible that scott will travel to the future via the time vortex as the ripples  him into a post thanos snap world where the effects of it still remains lets say 10 or so years from the current timeline in the mcu when scott arrives he discovers san francisco to be in tatters and when he sees the date of 2028ish he is horrified he seeks to find cassie who fortunately survived the snap along with her step father the three of them are of course overwhelmed with emotion as scott explains his predicament and etc maybe cassie goes to join scott rejuvenated that her father is alive given how ant man and the wasp does have her ask scott if she can be his partner whatever the case scott will eventually head to new york to seek out the remaining avengers where he finds a dejected tony stark who appears to have aged far more than the 10 years that past moping in the avengers hq eventually scott is able to convince stark that the war with thanos hasnt ended quite yet and they gather the remaining avengers to travel back to the battle of new york before the infinity stones were located this would explain why starks hair appears to be graying in this picture perhaps bill foster will aide the heroes in helping them with the mechanics of the quantum realm as they travel to the past

anyway tldr scott travels to the future via time vortex convinces remaining avengers to continue fighting and they travel to past to stop thanos before he begins",2018-07-07
sooo how in the world does janet look the way she does after been in the microverse for 30 years also what the  has she been eating and drinking,2018-07-13
i was watching a video discussion of infinity war where one of the participants theorized that thanos having to reverse time in order to obtain the mind stone is going to have some kind of unforeseen effect on his wiping out half of existence thus when scott is in the quantum realm and hank hope and janet are on earth theres a split second where their radios go out but they regain communications with scott then from scotts perspective he loses contact with hank hope and janet completely because theyre part of the half that thanos destroys i think that the split second in which the group on the outside loses contact with scott is a time paradox that occurs due to thanos using the time stone to ressurect vision and that paradox had a direct effect on the quantum realm because as we know the quantum realm is subject to the timespace continuum in a different way than the regular plane of existence i feel like this entire theory will somehow tie into scott escaping the quantum realm and helping the remaining avengers defeat thanos you heard it here first edit spelling,2018-07-06
wow that was so much better than i expected i think i liked it about as much as gotg and i really loved that people can say they’ve got marvel fatigue until they’re blue in the face but they really are putting out good films,2018-07-06
did anyone spot a city in the quantum realm in the scene where hank and janet were taking off or was that just me,2018-07-06
this is more of a nitpick than a criticism but if scott is exhausted after being big for a few minutes how come the humansized ant that takes his place at home for hours on end doesnt ever get tired the increase in size that the ant goes through is proportional to scotts if not bigger is the ant more durable due to its biology im probably overthinking but i didnt see anyone else point it out,2018-07-06
"i like how they kept trying to be creative with the wacky physics of growing shrinking and phasing and incorporating them into the choreography  my favorite was when ghost regrew the lab and phasing into it as it expanded

"saw the movie 3 hours or so ago still talking about the movie and the ending with my girlfriend honestly i felt the villians were a little weak cartoony even i dont recall the movie ever really going into their motivations as for wanting to go though so much trouble to get pyms tech i get ghosts motivations but they just felt like they were there just to give the heroes a hard time but no real motivation out of just being jerks

scotts friends as always are always a riot when on the screen along with his daughter and even the agent cho i think his name was basically any scene with scott or those characters were guaranteed to be pretty funny cept for that mid credit scene

liked michelle pfeiffer but her magic powers just seemed kinda out of nowhere and too convenient imo also the mid credit scene it really kinda shook me even though i saw it coming i didnt think itd take all of them away or that it would just be so sudden especially after how heartwarming and positive the movie was in the end

till this moment im still sitting here thinking about it as i said its funny i saw it coming logically i figured as much but man when it happened i still kinda couldnt believe it also the after credit scene was still pretty morbid overall even with the ant the tv and the house showing basically no life kinda really subtly showed the impact of thanos decision ",2018-07-07

"the more i think about it the more i feel that this is one of the better marvel sequels in terms of how well a second movie stacks up against the first movie

i enjoyed this as much as i enjoyed the first one i do think the writing is weaker in spots and some of the humour feels too forced but structurally its more interesting and feels more unique in amongst the marvel movies than the first antman did it feels a bit like a caper film of the 90s

i like how they split up the storyline so the movie didnt really have a villain there are three separate antagonistic forces plus scotts conflict trying to balance the mission with his own life i enjoy how after infinity war they decided to go small with the conflict in more ways than one its a very contained story just trying to save one person and get their family back together without tearing themselves apart in the process

i loved eva partly im biased just because i love hanna johnkamen but also it was really nice to see an antagonist who is purely focused on personal survival no other marvel movie has done that so you dont want her to fail youre just concerned about how far she will go unfortunately i felt the character came out underwritten at the end and the relationship between her and foster felt incomplete

far from a perfect movie but it did a great job of following infinity war with something completely different",2018-07-13
"i thought it was boring but i didnt think it was necessarily bad mostly just dialogue in really boring settings score sounded like any generic action score and incredibly underwhelming humor was decent action was pretty meh until the last 1v2 fight

the quantum scenes looked like a marvel movie budget yet they werent anything mindblowing and they didnt do anything creative with it it was just a realm they visit and apparently you get magical superpowers there that of course solve the villains dying curse how convenient

also unless im missing something fishbournes character didnt make a whole lot of sense he took pym hostage so they could try to fix ghost and then later he says pym could help so why the  did he take him hostage why not just make a deal with him at first if her life was in danger why not offer him shelter in exchange way back when pym was still running",2018-07-16

"according to infinity war scott couldnt help out because of house arrest yet when the snap happens he is no longer on house arrest am i supposed to believe that hank and janet built the smaller quantum tunnel in around 24 hours after she was rescued seems like that would have taken a lot longer especially since i presume theyre still fugitives

",2018-07-09
"this is definitely not uptopar with the recent slate of fantastic marvel movies nor is it in the same league as the first antman the main weaknesses are

 all the coolest moments in the film are in the trailers nearly every interesting sizeshifting setpiece youve already seen if youve watched the trailers and theres very little more to the action scenes than those sizeshift gimmicks they felt like the center of the action in the first movie and here they feel like afterthoughts 
 most of the humor in the movie is that sort of lazy style of improvy awkward conversations you know when characters just talk to each other kind of awkwardly and it goes on for like half a minute too long and its mostly just funny because of how long it takes they rely on this waaay too hard 
 the villains are really underwritten especially ghost it doesnt help that the plot tying it all together is pretty thin and pretty much every hero main character is at their weakest they all had arcs of some kind in the first film scott learned to be a hero classic but effective hank learned to let his daughter grow up and be less overprotective and hope earned the opportunity to be the wasp nothing like that in this film 

there are things that the movie did well 

 the soundtrack was really good and on a few occasions i really noticed it and thought wow thats a really cool way to score this 
 the aftercredits scenes tying in to infinity war were really good and i didnt expect it to happen the way they did it so heres to another reason to be hyped beyond belief for avengers 4
 michael pena is still a delight and national treasure 
 i agree with the sentiment that it feels like a saturday morning cartoon i think if it was an overall better film underneath that feeling it couldve been a more memorable movie but oh well  ",2018-07-12

"some thoughts that i have been mulling over since seeing it 2 days ago

 the fbi made some pretty dumb moves especially at the end when scott goes mega at the docks hes plastered all over the news so what do you do obviously send everyone to catch him in the act instead of you know sending just one guy straight to his house to get verifiable proof and then arrest himspoiler that said jim was amazing and i really enjoyed his character 

 as much as i love walton goggins i wasnt a fan of of his character he existed solely to be the fly in the ointment yeah criminals are dumb but clearly this guy is doing really well what with being able to clear out fancy restaurants with an army of minions and all after his first asskicking by a superhero where he still got to keep the money ftr he should have just bailed especially when it turns out that theres also a supervillainghost women after the same thing take your money and run dude 

 speaking of supervillainghost women i wish they had spent more time fleshing out ghost and the whole dynamic between her and pym it was just the whole one minute spent talking might clear up a mess of problems trope which i personally find annoying hank pym while arrogant and selfish was also the og antman and has shown pretty resolute morals ghost hates him though because she thinks her fathers unjust firing led to her father becoming a black market scientist and exploding i just dont understand how they couldnt actually go into that more the one line i remember pym was talking to foster and says that the dad was a traitor or something and then they never bring it up again pym doesnt even tell that to ghost at all that probably wouldve been a fun conversation starter while tied up from some who probably shouldnt hate you after allspoiler still i liked ghost just wish they wouldve gone over her back story more instead of the walton goggins gang 

 the overall pacing of the movie felt really off it just didnt seem like them doing all of that could actually take place over 3 days even in movie time i really wanted to yell at everyone for taking the time to stop and have a conversation when they supposedly have like 2 hours to accomplish their task multiple times 

 regarding the stinger okay so in iw the aliens show up over manhattan well before everyone gets thanosd how does that go unnoticedunaddressed by literally the entire city of sanfran at least it still shouldve come up before they had time to make a minitunnel and the gear to collect space healing lasersspoiler

 i  love michael peña and the xcon crew paul rudd was great sure but those guys probably made me laugh the most they definitely helped making the walton goggins gang okay    


sorry this got a bit longer than expected but i got on a role i tried to spoiler out the juicier bits but if theres something i missed lemme know overall id probably say 35  ",2018-07-10
"not bad but not great probably a bottom 5 marvel movie though that isnt saying much that thing about how they couldnt save the mom for another hundred years because the quantum particles wont align for another hundred years so they have to do it in the next two hours was so cliche also a lot of the scieney stuff just made no sense

also ghost still had weeks couldnt they just explain to her in like 2 minutes that theyll help her after they save the mom who is on a really really tight schedule jeeez

edit ok this is a nitpick but why did laurence fishburns character have to be called bill foster when he was first name dropped i was like oh jane fosters dad the one that worked with erik selvig then we see him and hes a black guy and im like oh ",2018-10-03

1 will being stuck in the quantum realm give scott lang quantum powers like janet van dyne some kind of evolution is what janet referred to it as in the movie

2 in the first end credit scene scott is collecting healing quantum energy what role will they play in the postsnap world

3 before entering the quantum realm janet tells scott to be careful of the time vortexes will scott mess around with time vortexes

4 is the post credits scene with the ant just for humor or does it have a deeper meaning",2018-07-06
what was scotts ringtone ,2018-07-06
"i thought how the scene w janet suddenly entering scott’s head was a little weird but okay and i was reminded of the reverse flash’s time sphere when hank entered his quantum realmmobile  
also does audience size matter in watching film i watched right after 2100 the initial premiere 1800 and there were only a couple of marines oh whale
the two end credits scenes i thought that hope was gonna be the only was snapped but was surprised at how it was from scott’s pov seeing all 3 of em gone then with the ant playing drums  it took me a second to realize that oh there is no news networks there is no people at home antman and wasp will return",2018-07-06
"i liked the movie on the whole my biggest complaint is there were too many plots trying to wrest sympathy from the audience scott as a dad pym family reunion and orphanedinpain villain bordered on melodrama at certain points for me

"loved this movie thought the paul rudd scene where he was acting as michelle pfeiffer was one of my favorite movie scenes this year had a question about the first credits scene

so in iw there is a definite time lapse between when iron man banner strange and wong confront ebony maw and when the snap happens what was scott lang doing during this lapse of time between those two events because in the postcredits scene he is on that rooftop about to go into the quantum realm seemingly unaware of the nyc invasion and within a matter of a minute the snap happens 

im not really trying to criticize it because i love the narrative angle they are going with this but that is kind of a plot hole that i wish i hadnt noticed

"as a disclaimer i loved ant man the first movie a lot but i was really disappointed by this movie 

the positive is i loved peña the whole xcon plot line was done spectacularly and luis and the rest of the security business gang were hilarious im glad my favourite part of ant man came back

similarly the whole defective suit bit was really well done as was the get big get tired thing which was laid out in an early scene and then became relevant towards the end

everything else didnt come close the whole subatomic quantum thing didnt make sense i have no problem with them not following science dr strange is about wizards and i thought it was awesome but from a story perspective they just made things up as they went along

the mom having magic quantum powers and evolving the ship being able to send signals to the surface but then not putting an antenna on scott being eaten by a protist that whole part of the movie was a 

i also didnt like how the main conflict was basically sidestepped the basic premise was eva needed to  janet to survive this is totally fine and the building block for everyones character motivation and at the end they save janet and she magically fixes eva no build up nothing one second they essentially defeat eva and the next a magical solution comes through that fixes everything

there was alot a lot of moments characters just made dumb mistakes the whole car chase scene the fbi was incompetent etc but the above 2 the quantum stuff and letdown climax were the biggest

i went in hot off incredibles 2 loved it and really loved the first ant man and as much as i want to i just cant recommend this movie",2018-07-09
"i personally disagree with the complaints against janet healing ghost

she’s been in the quantum realm for 30 years throughout those years i’m sure she’s come into contact with the healing particles mentioned and shown in the end credits scene it’s likely that like a wasp she is covered in healing particles and the healing particle residue was enough to keep ghost’s powers at bay for the time being it isn’t magic or anything it’s the healing particles",2018-07-09
"after watching it what i didnt like was how they advertised the movie they basically put all the cool or surprising moments in the trailer like size manipulation and funnywitty jokes the only part where i genuinely laughed out loud was when luis was hit with truth serum and blabbering about scott and hope because i hadnt seen it before i dont have to watch the trailers i know but considering how vague iw trailers were they even faked hulk in wakanda i didnt think not to watch the trailers 

im assuming but i imagine disney pushed for a more child friendly movie considering how iw was a bit heavy with the content and dialogue and thats fine but i left the theater mostly disappointed because the acting was meh and the script wasnt very good ",2018-07-10
"i would say i dont think it was a good movie but it was definitely an enjoyable one

house arrest for scott seemed weird same with hank and hope being on the run from the fbi maybe i missed something but i just dont know why they would give scott a plea deal when he didnt really have anything and why the fbi would go after hank and hope when they werent knowingly doing super hero stuff afaik

the cars shrinking should likely have gone slower too but theres a whole lot of weird science stuff that doesnt make sense with these movies if you think about it too much

i dont know why bill had to be all sneaky about working with ghost

all that said it was a very fun movie visually and the jokes were pretty good too i like how the super villain is just a scared person trying to survive and not take over the world and their fights against her were very interesting since it was hard for any of them to get a punch in underground crime villain really wasnt needed except to pad time imo",2018-07-17
"this is probably the first mcu movie since ultron that i didnt walk out of super excited by

it felt disposable in a way that none of the other mcu films have",2018-07-08

this movie was basically paul rudd and friends the superhero movie didn’t try to outdo the sequel but built in it this one unlike ragnarok which was verbal humor is a lot more situational so if you enjoy that you’ll love it ,2018-07-06
in a way i feel like this should perhaps be called ”the wasp and hank pym go do important things while antman is along for the ride being a very good friend and a helpful dude that really just wants to ger home on time and not get in trouble” which may be a bit on the long side admittedly seeing as hope and hank are the ones with the main plot and scott is kind of the subplot ,2018-07-06

man the antman movies have to be some of my favorite in the whole mcu i love heist movies and i love comedies and theyre such a great mashup of the two plus sometimes its just fun to have superhero movies operate on a smaller scale heh not every movie has to be about saving the cityworlduniverse right,2018-07-06
"thought it was a very funny movie with good chemistry between the main cast but with a pretty uninteresting plot and bland villains

my biggest issue was that ghost didnt seem to have much characterizationmotivation they do show her dad dying and they do show her in pain but after the cabin in the woods scene they dont ever mention her anger at hank and they focus on the pain aspect she just doesnt get much dialogue after that and just punches people for the rest of the movie

it just seemed reasonable to me that shelaurence fishburne would at least discusswait for hank to his experiment

walton goggins had a pretty generic villain role nothing much to say there

a little too much exposition on science junk 

the mom having quantum powers coming out her fingertips came off as extremely cheesyeyerolly i get that theyre setting up for something but in my opinion it was done very sloppily

asian jim was excellent and so was cassie tibaba yaga guy did a good job

fun movie but was annoyed about the second post credit scene i sat through all those credits and they essentially gave me a gag that i was already shown in the trailers,2018-07-10
loved seeing wasp show off her stuff but i felt like it was almost always at the expense of lang looking like a bumbling idiot while being offbeat he was formidable and quite smart in antman and civil war not sure why he had to be dumbed down and retconned in order for wasp to shine but whatever,2018-07-10
"i kinda liked it and i kinda did not like it feels like it had some very wasted potential and the movie just ended up stumbling to much over it self definetly some flaws with the script and the phasing of the movie i lost track of all the times they lost the building paul had to go back to the house go here go there back and forward made the movie feel veryi wont say confusing but unnecessarily convoluted in a way at the same time  the constant reuse of the same locations made it feel a bit bland i kept waiting for the movie to kick  off and give me that okay here we go feeling it never really did 


a lot of the jokes did not land a lot did as well some felt forced and out off place luis voice  over for instance was once again hilarious and amazingly done by both him and the other actors but the execution and setting of it fell a little flat since they just shoehorned it in the middle of the movie and then jumped in and out of his story and kept the truth  serum joke going for way too long 

ghost didnt have a enough time to shine the actress did great and there was so much potential for a cool winter soldier  esq character here she looked like a total bad  yet we only got a couple of fight scenes with her could have made her way more intimidating 

all in all the actors carried this movie so hard amazing chemistry between them cant think of a single actor i had a problem with just sad the scrip and directing wasnt as good as they deserved this couldve been the next guardians of the galaxy 

edit just have to add that this one definetly suffered from the marvel humour formula a bit it wasnt as bad as the worst ones as i personally found the some of the jokes pretty good anyway but yeah there was a lot of bad quips  humour in dramatic situations here thats what made spider  man so great the humour felt on point and natural when it was there yet it wasnt shoe horned in when the movie needed to be serious 
 ",2018-07-14
"miscellaneous thoughts on this movie

 this is pretty much exactly what you would expect from an antman sequel the action was escalated a bit but its still more or less the same as the first movie this isnt the winter soldier or ragnarok of antman movies but its warm and entertaining nonetheless

  villain is created by hank pyms past mistakes but doesnt serve any purpose in the story except to be an obstacle

  scott hope and hank pym are still taking the bulk of the screen time and carrying the film with their performances scotts daughter also has a small role

  luis is doing the same routine as before the same joke isnt really as funny the second time but seeing his perspective of the scotthope relationship was a great moment

  the balance of humor drama and action is unchanged but we skip most of the introductions and the training montage to get right to the juicy stuff

 quantum physics are magic theres really no attempt to be realistic here they just make up the rules as they go to maximise drama and visual flare the whole finding janet subplot is riddled with nonsense antman had suspect physics and logic in the first movie but this is kind of getting out of hand

 i noticed that while shrinking hank passed through a barrier similar to the mirror dimension from doctor strange

 i see a lot of discussion about this movie in relation to infinity war in this thread but the avengers are tenuously relevant to this movie until the postcredit scene its a very selfcontained story and the only important tie to the rest of the mcu is scotts house arrest the pyms are also in hiding but thats not a major change of the status quo for them since they were already conducting their research in secret their research is valuable and they have many enemies

 its pretty amazing that the 1st postcredit scene is a massive plot twist and mustsee sequel hook while the 2nd postcredit scene is a complete waste of time im getting the feeling marvel doesnt want to put anything worthwhile in postpostcredits scenes anymore because hardly anyone sticks around in the theater that long",2018-07-15
in case anyones come to this thread looking for serious discussion you should turn back now any criticism of the movie is being massdownvoted,2018-07-06
"most people here are talking about the post credits scene and just quoting lines from the movie probably because the movie itself is nothing to write home about but anyone expressing that is getting downvoted 

randall park was funny as woo although comic book fans should he upset that the mcu has decided to take a bad  character and turn him into a joke classic marvel lilly had the most to do and shes very likeable so thats a wise move the fatherdaughter dynamic between hankhope and scottcassie was nice paul rudd 

those are the only positives i can think of the amount of exposition dumps in this film rivals guardians of the galaxy 2 and they use the tiresome strategy of splicing in some forced humour so it doesnt get too boring or obvious the prologue was needless and an anti climactic way to begin the film  the amount of times this movie came to a halt to deliver some  exposition was frustrating they completely ignore the show dont tell rule just like every other mcu movie but i guess people are okay with it because of the jokes and its super fun all of these films literally spell out whats happening to the viewer and its lazy 

then you get to the story itself what the  was the point of walton goggins his character was pointless he seemed shoved in because they needed more story he was just a lame inconsequential character who didnt contribute anything of value in the jokes department as well ghost was a  villain though i like hannah johnkamen the reason she was  is because they decided for some reason to develop a cstory with goggins instead of developing what could have been a way more compelling villain  janet comes back and i dont even give a  shes literally the whole point of the film but the movie spends so much time focusing on other  outside of the main narrative that i just dont give a  about the woman they are all fighting for scott who was a competent character in the first movie gets the thor treatment i dont know what to do with this character so im going to make him funny because the marvel universe needs more quip machines scott is a bumbling child in this doing   at every turn why should i root for him the only reason is his daughter and the way he treats her nothing to do with him as ant man  

im getting tired of marvel humour its  terrible on a second viewing because all it is is quips awkward exchanges or a character talking really fast with a straight face every character in this universe is just tony stark lite and theres no  variety this is a universe for crying out loud but it feels  tiny when every character has the same  personality and every film ties into the next its no wonder the only thoughts people can muster in this thread are to do with the mid credits scene because they were momentarily reminded of the only movie in this universe that did something slightly different 

also why are people okay with how visually bland this movie is or most of these marvel movies comic books are a visual medium and so is film why the  is it okay that they are continuing to deliver bland cinematography i guess when a movie is fun all is forgiven 

edit thanks for the gold 

also apparently since im a mod for   my opinion is entirely invalid and im trolling i joined that sub upon being asked because its close to impossible to voice a negative opinion about these movies on this sub without being drowned in downvotes and personally attacked by people who cant comprehend that some people dont like these movies im not a troll dc fanboy or any other dismissive label you want to slap onto people who dont like these films i havent liked many mcu movies apart from gotg spiderman homecoming winter soldier and ragnarok to an extent my favourite comic book movie of all time is spiderman 2 ive read marvel comics for as long as i can remember but i just simply dont like this universe voicing that opinion shouldnt have to be so hard this is a discussion thread ",2018-07-06

"i hope peyton reed gets proper credit from fans this time he has now made two awesome mcu films bursting with character and strong identity

the first time around everyone was quick to attribute the good parts of antman to edgar wright

now with this c’mon give reed his credit one of the top mcu directors for my money great film ",2018-07-06
" this movie was fabulous just for scott and cassies scenes it does bring up the question of why ant manwasp werent in iw did cap just assume he was still under house arrest and not bother to get him out ah well this movie was worth not having scott in iw but hopefully we really see him kick  in a4

also michael peña is a national treasure  bless him scott and hope are my new otp as well",2018-07-06
i thought it was okay fun action some great funny scenes baba yaga ghost was interesting but i felt like they could have done a little better with her there were some comedy bits that fell completely flat and nobody in my theater made a sound i wish they done more with janet i really thought shed have more screen time but she got about 5 minutes overall its definitely better than some of the other marvel films iron man 2 thor thor 2 but not top tier it was fun and thats what i wanted micheal pena is  wonderful,2018-07-07
for a movie named ant man and the wasp there arent a lot of ant man and the wasp moment in the movie,2018-07-08
"so i really enjoyed this movie  i liked the characters i liked michael pena being michael pena the wasp kicked a lot of  as well she should and it was nice to see hank suit up they did great stuff with the powers and it was nice to see scott have more than 2 sizes  his getting stuck at three feet tall was pretty great  id like to see him use that size more  

that said was this a good movie  not really  the opening dialogue was super flat and the whole intro was a bit ham   ufogal was perhaps a bit harsh but they had it just right when they said that making janet the emotional core of this movie was a mistake  i literally grew up reading about her so i had a but more invested but even i had a hard t ime caring about her till the very end and if im honest giving her first real lined to paul rudd while funny and a little clever was a mistake  

basically there was a lot of design and directorial mistakes tbh in a movie this big its hard to say whether that is the director or a producer or whatever but they were poorly made decisions  

we didnt really get to see scott being as clever or useful as he can which would have been nice  im a big fan of giantman but in a movie called ant man and the wasp id like to see them work together at least once without it being a gag about scotts  new suit  that felt like a joke that went on too long because it created lazy flaws 

basically the stakes just never went anywhere the big bad was a guy that either character could have beaten down in half a second and his only real move was running away  

thats not true  the real enemy was time but i never really felt like it was the enemy because they didnt manage it well  i never felt like hank might run out of time and in fact he did run out and still found janet and it was only about ten seconds later  i never felt like they were in any danger of missing their chance to get out because it was never really well established what would happen if they didnt  

the use of the ants was neat in this one and i liked the big ants 

overall i think there was a better movie in there than the one we got but i didnt dislike the one we got ",2018-07-13
the real question about the movie where did wasp found a lispstick in subatomal world her lips was unrealisticly red side effect in form of a permanent lipstick thats aside the questions like how did she even survived out there ,2018-10-02

why does ghost never fall through the floor and the earth  
i always liked the detail that the helmet was required to make the suit work but now theyre just ignoring that detail its an issue because he shouldnt be able to breathe normal air while in a different size not to mention how eyesight would work even with the helmet",2018-07-07
"i think this film really benefitted from the lack of involvement from edgar wright not that i think the first film wouldve been better or worse as and edgar wright film but it definitely suffered from trying to jam in so many rewrites into remnants of an outdated script it still came out as a great film but they definitely were pinned creatively in places

this film fully put the humor plot characters etc into the hands of the current crew and its a credit to their work this is honestly the funniest mcu movie theyve done i like it more than thor ragnarok i think its because i find scott lang more relatable as a person than a demigod but it just has the right amount of everything",2018-07-07

antman 3 ant men and the wasps,2018-07-08
thought it was pretty good but played exactly as i expected it to a fun humorous actionpacked subversion of the far more serious black panther and infinity war this was a very smart move by marvel especially seeing that captain marvel and a4 will return to the more serious route i think that the first ant man has a slight edge over this in that i felt that scott lang had much more of an arc there whereas here this felt like a more easygoing dayinthelife adventure for him but thats only in comparison to the first on its own i was fine with that the first postcredits scene was completely expected but still great to watch,2018-07-08
"i wish ant man didnt have a defective suit and i wish he had more opportunities to play around with his size in combat when he grows during that third act fight he stays that size for quite a while i thought it wouldve been cool to see scott go back and forth between becoming giant or becoming tiny i get that hank and hope are on the run working on the quantum tunnel in other words not focused on improving the ant man suit but still maybe its just because i saw all the giant man moments in the trailers i guess i secretly was hoping they saved the biggest transformation for last or something they did this right though when scott grew to save wasp from an impact with the quantum express which was busy blindly barreling through layers of reality in pursuit of normal land 


plus how cool is wasp hank is a  fool for not letting her wear a suit until now",2018-07-09

" what was ghosts motivation she was like some  brat the whole time   
how did janet survive without foodwater in quantum realm for 30 yrs dont tell me time ran differently she definitely aged   
and what the quantum realm is supposed to be smaller than the freaking air molecules and they went ahead and removed the masks and breathed normally like it was nothing suppose they were surviving on the suits oxygen yes since it was implied that the suits have some amount of oxygen in them like when scott fell into the water and hope said that he doesnt have much time like that how is it possible that the suit held oxygen for 30 whole years this question is invalid anyway because they removed the freaking masks like it was their freaking bedroom ",2018-12-15

i quite enjoyed that it was fun and funny like it wasnt perfect with some pacingplot issues and the standard underdeveloped marvel villain thats plagued like 90 of the last nineteen films but i felt good after watching it i loved that antman was the jack burton to wasps  chi in fact i thought they made a great team that really complimented each other well one might even say that they were perfectly balanced as all things should be ,2018-07-06

i have a theory about the change to the backstory of ghost could the original comic version of this character be the father of the movie version rather then the company killing his wife the event that prompts his becoming a terrorist both parents died thus leading to his technology becoming somehow infused on to ava it did state that her dad was an inventor that was a colleague of pym  ,2018-07-10

im just curious if janet was a coowner of hanks company if she was and she has returned can she claim ownership to what hank lost,2018-09-07
my personal take on it was that it was a good set up movie theres a lot of plot threads that i am hoping will be expanded on in other parts of the mcu on its own i dont think the movie performed that well aside from the one scene where they showed avas parents dying i found it really difficult to get invested in the characters or the plot at all,2018-10-27
when they were all chatting midway through the movie and ghost appeared to say the forest and everyone screamedspoiler i laughed so  hard,2018-12-09
it certainly was a movie  big drop off in quality from the first one probably because they didn’t have edgar wright’s material to cannibalize  i was happy to see that michelle pfeifer has such ready access to cosmetics after wandering a quantum wasteland for 30 years  and that even though she said she was no longer the person she once was she still acted like the same person she was,2018-12-24
"nbspnbspnbspnbsp this is probably a kind of weird opinion but i think this one was actually kinda better done as a movie than infinity war in a lot of ways in terms of scope and impact its obviously not going for the same thing but i felt it was structured better and the action was better most of the fight scenes in infinity war were basically hey there thanos lets run at him and then they get swatted away and when its not that its usually some big cgi sludge being pushed towards some other big sludge like thor trying to start the forge or the wakanda battle this movie on the other hand had some actual choreography to its fights there were a lot of neat tricks being pulled off with the shrinkinggrowing stuff and a lot of moments of improvisation or general cleverness that made me go oh that was neat i felt the only particularly cool or memorable thing that happened in an action scene in iw was the actual snap and maybe when they blew squidward out the air lock 

nbspnbspnbspnbsp as far as the actual plot structure iw also had the problem of jumping across like 5 or 6 very different plotlines which made it feel very choppy especially at the beginning when it essentially has to start each groups story and get them up to speed with whats going on it felt like that movie began several times before actually getting going and each plotline was pretty distant from the others until everyone got together for the finale antman on the other hand set up its premise very efficiently in the prologue and more or less stuck with its main thread you do have it jumping between scott and the pyms goggins and ghostfishburne but each of those three threads is tied very closely and they intersected very frequently which i felt made this movie flow better that it wasnt jumping between like 30 different avengers also gave each character more time to shine and i felt like the cast played off each other very well and they certainly got their money from the cast they chose

nbspnbspnbspnbsp if i had to pick a weak point id definitely say the villians felt like a bit of a fallback to some of the less developed ones weve had in marvel movies especially the walton goggins character thanos and killmonger were great and had very compelling arcs of their own but here the villians are mostly good enough to fill their plot purpose with that said i actually felt ghost managed to have some fairly good stuff going on despite not having a ton of time for development her backstory was really interesting and sympathetic and i liked the different perspective that she brought shes not trying to take over the world or even do something particularly bad shes just hurting and is trying to get better the only was she knows that they actually help her at the end and seemingly make an ally of her was a sweet touch and fit with the theme of family i just wish she had more time to shine as for goggins he was funny but he felt kind of extraneous that said it was nice seeing two villains who actually were working against each other from the start instead of the usuall teamup which i felt gave things an interesting dynamic

nbspnbspnbspnbsp as far as the humor goes its pretty subjective but i felt it worked better here than in infinity war as well the humor in iw felt very forced during some of the guardians scenes and tonally at odds with what else was going on but here it came about very naturally and gelled with the lower stakes i liked the delivery a lot and most of the jokes be they verbal or visual worked for me

other random observations

 i wish ti had more to do hes generally a very charismatic presence and i think that transferred well to his acting in this film but he only had a few lines ill definitely keep an eye out for him in further acting roles

 i noticed antman mention his peppep and thought hey thats a tim and eric word then i remembered the tayne sketch then tim heidecker himself showed up i liked that tims character name in the credits was a typically absurd te name

 michelle pfieffer needed way less touching up to look young than cgi michael douglas in the intro

 i loved what they did with the postcredits scenes its so cruel but i was wondering the entire time how it would fit in that we finally see the emergency broadcasting signal on the screen has me really wanting to see infinity war part 2 to see how society responds which i think will be the real spectacle

overall i had a great time it definitely wasnt trying to reinvent the wheel but it was a fun action movie with good comedy that flowed well and i had more fun with it than iw even if it wasnt as ambitious",2018-07-14
"my second post on this thread elaborating a bit more  

some background i liked the first antman but thought many of the jokes and sequences fell too flat and the first half of the movie suffered the most from that  the first half of the plot also seemed too convoluted and silly to me hank intentionally seeking out scott the training sequences jokes but was redeemed by a fun and exciting second act  it was clear to me the first antman focused more energy on the second half

for me antman and the wasp was a major improvement in that the whole film felt like the second half of the first one in energy spirit and writing  this was the funniest marvel film for me personally as im not a fan of thor ragnaroks more goofy type of humor that relies on outofcontext oneoff gags and jokes  i loved guardians of the galaxy but that film basically started a trend for sillier cheap jokes in the mcu so it was nice to see antman and the wasp with jokes that i felt relied on clever running jokes and contextual relevant plotcharacter details  i think much of the disappointment that is coming from this film is that the scale of it isnt as grand as previous marvel films especially since this is a followup to infinity war  the film is literally small in scale and i like that its able to standalone in the mcu without having to rely on the mcu civil war did not feel like a captain america film  it felt like a proper antman and the wasp film 

the story definitely felt like it was focusing on the wasps character story arc and scott was left as a plot device as janets antenna in the film but i was ok with this direction given the first antman was focused on scotts completed redemption arc  the first antman was definitely setting up the plot of this installment so it was only natural for the story to shift focus  

my minor gripe with the film that i seem to agree with most critics is that the character development could have been better  ghosts backstory was underexplored and seemed to cover the bare minimum with her motives without going into any depth  the flashbacks and background were cliche and the film honestly should have opened with her story a little more instead of the flashback from the first antman  i thought the film did a decent job developing janet van dynes relationship with hope considering the fact shes mostly off screen and her dialogue is loaned to scott lang  its difficult developing a character not present on the screen but i think this film managed to do enough to make the characters feel connected to her  

as small scale the story was and as bland as the character development was i was pleased with this film for its entertainment value and how it has the perfect blend of being a standalone film while being connected to a bigger universe",2018-07-13
"i thought this was pretty average for the mcu lots of humor that felt a bit tryhard and drawn out especially all the stuff with luis and stuff like the facetime about soccer shoes just felt random and outofplace at least janet really came back and seems to be here to stay for the future stuff so unlike some mcu movies something meaningful that will affect the future happened

"dont have much to add about the movie that hasnt been said but i was very disappointed in how my audience was with the second post credits scene 

perhaps it didnt linger on the tv or the emptiness of the city for long enough because the only thing that registered for a reaction was the ant playing the drums i thought the entire thing was chilling but the majority of my screening left feeling cheated since they thought it was just the ant joke again 

i went with a group of people disclaimer all saw infinity war and they looked at me like i was crazy when i mentioned the emergency broadcast or the sirens in the background i didnt think it was incredibly subtle so im surprised so many left almost angry about how it ended

edit i wasnt talking about the quality of the scene its fantastic imo the blinkandyoullmissit nature of the important aspects is what i was referring to",2018-07-07
"saw it about a week ago and honestly i was pretty disappointed even as a fan of the marvel movies the jokes were funny and all the performances were pretty good all around but the movie these actors were put in was simply not good the characterization was weak even by superhero movie standards to the point that i didnt even know what stakes scott lang had in this movie other than cleaning up all of hank pyms  ups the film seemed to be banking on rudds charisma to carry the character but it honestly just didnt cut it

the action scenes were pretty suboptimal too especially with the car chase being super cgi dependent even beyond the growingshrinking effects there was one scene where unnamed southern techarms dealers car whisked around a corner and it was blatant cgi it sucks that a big budget movie would cut corners like that

as i said before i thought the jokes were funny and the performances all around were pretty good and i think that there was potentially a really good movie here but it just kinda lacked impact i had fun but will probably skip rewatching",2018-07-16
i thought it was pretty mediocre and boring for the first half sooo many boring exposition scenes but it at some point it really kicked into gear and its great fun from there on,2018-08-02
my big problem with the movie was that the conflict with ghost could have been avoided entirely if either hank pym or bill foster had stopped acting like a raging  for about 15 seconds,2018-07-08
"for anyone angry that scott was not in infinity war please read my claims and try to refute them

1natasha was aware that they couldnt contact scott or clint because they had families that relied on them even if they knew scott was free they wouldnt ask him to help because if scott was seen associating with criminals like capnatashafalcon he would be a wanted person again those 3 guys can be on the run forever but they know scott can not live that life with a daughter and wouldnt ask him to risk that besides in the first battle scene in civil war it was shown that capnatashafalconwanda were on a mission where were war machine and tony and vision no one said anything back then there is no need to bring every avenger involved for a small task caps side already had enough firepower in infinity war

2another point natasha and the squad wouldnt even know that scotts house arrest is over not to the exact day

3another point hank despices stark and the avengers also hope and hank were  at scott in civil war for interfering with the avengers and getting those 2 characters on the run scott has a close bond with those 2 characters and wouldnt dare hurt them like that again

4another point the attack on new york during infinity war was pretty short in comparison to events that occured with loki or vulture in ny sokovia in age of ultron or first battle scene in civil war or the first battle scene with hydra in age of ultron that new york fight was over in minutes and as far as scott was concerned it was over tony was seen going to outerspace and there was nothing that scott could do to help him occurrences in the mcu world are pretty common there are probably way more battles that are not on screen that the avengers faced

5as for the wakanda battle only characters with advanced tech like nick fury knew something happened in wakanda but he didnt even know what just high energy around the area remember in wakanda unless you go through that portal everything in wakanda looks like regular african land",2018-07-10

 that cardboard slide looks like a good time 
 ghost phasing her arm through hank pym’s neck as a threat was risky and badass 
 pym particle shrinking and enlarging all sorts of things was fun but didn’t feel overused 
 scenes where large ants are just building things in the lab were funny 
 postcredits scene which was expected but still a reminder of iw 

i’m not sure what the point was in having bill foster and ghost hug in the alleyway i thought it was quite clear that he wanted to help her throughout the film 

expected to see a hawkeye postcredit but i assume that will be in captain marvel instead

"antman and the wasp is pretty good but not as great as the original its got almost a ferris buellers day off feel to lang trying to get out of house arrest to help the pyms again without getting caught the film establishes the consequences early when some fatherdaughter antics results in lang getting his ankle monitor stuck in the fence alerting the authorities who come to check on him randall park as agent jimmy woo fbi rather than shield comes across as sympathetic just doing his job rather than maliciously hounding lang hopefully well see more of park as woo as park has substantial screen charisma michael pena does the same shtick again while the other two pals get even less to do this time around evangeline lilly gets to take center stage in the best action sequences of the film especially the salt shaker bit 

the villain doesnt really make an impression shes just doing what she has to in order to survive as she sees it and is willing to cross any line to achieve it something her benefactor is not meanwhile walton goggins plays another piece of  something he is fantastic at pulling off adding another layer of pressure to the pyms hectic lives  

finding janet pym is the goal with all the chaos providing obstacles to achieving it janet gaining quantum realm powers seems like a way around calling her a mutant and allowing her to use her energy manipulation powers to cure the villain why not 

overall it felt a little too by the numbers even as the plot zips along at a quick pace this is perhaps because while i watched the first film without any expectations and was pleasantly surprised this time around i had some hopes for this film while an enjoyable film nonetheless it didnt quite reach the bar 

if they make another one they need better villains darren cross was  basically a facsimile of obadiah stane worked out alright but going forward it would be good if the villain was something other than another  wanting to steal what pym built ",2018-07-15

"so some thoughts about the movie

 a lot of the cast works fantasically together the whole school break in and scott tot sequence was adorable even when hank joins in on the ribbing and lets not even get started on paul rudd acting out michelle pfeiffer

 any scene cassie was in was a treat the beginning was one of the most wholesome moments in the franchise and dont laugh practially melted my heart the same way it melted scotts

 hank gets some more good moments showing his character his interactions with bill foster and ava definetly showed who he was before and throughout the movie you see these two realize that hank is trying to be better

 the dynamic between ava and bill was nice as well it was a great way to subvert expectations with bill vetoing going after cassie and then later refusing to abandon ava after all she did

 this whole film subverted my expectations i was waiting for the other shoe to drop with janet coming back i was expecting her to sacrifice herself for ghost or to get stabbed the second she got back or for hank to take her place in the quantum realm but no scott gets his freedom the pymvan dyne family is reunited like the lang family the xcon business is booming the criminal is taken down and even the supervillain is cured and redeemed with someone she loves as the doctor would say just this once everybody lives until

 the post credits scenes were jaw dropping i saw someone in the rmovies thread think of it like a vietnam flashback and thats certainly what it felt like it was like watching all the horror of iw all over again with the added eerieness of seeing an empty house with the emergency broadcast on with sirens and screams in the background


there is one big thing i feel though that detracts from the movie and thats the action its not that it is bad far from it its just that its well safe


the first antman movie had a lot to prove only doubled by 1 its production dramas with edgar wright  and 2 antman is the aquaman of marvel the oft ridiculed hero of the bunch despite being the founding member of their respective premiere superteams plus shrinking seems like a silly power to a lot of people and antman a silly character becuase of it 


antman 1 circumvented this perfectly i feel and helped get the audience on board to the concept of shrinking as a viable tool and power and buying into these characters so much so that it made me mad to see so many praising all the best moments of the film like the luis narration as classic wright when it was peyton reed that came up with these moments and pretty much the only edgar wright left in the film were the action scenes


this made me really excited for the sequel because reed wouldnt be in the shadow of wright and now that people bought the premise and viability of the concept they were free to run wild with it and i dont think that happened in this movie


there wasnt a single action scene or shrinkgrow scene that wasnt in the trailers i kept waiting to see something i hadnt seen before something that would make me say wow that was a really cool use of their powers but it never came there was nothing i didnt see coming


for the combat it mostly revolved around scott or hope shrinking to avoid ghosts punch regrowing behind her and then having her phase through the punch for her to counter and repeat ad nauseum a little bland compared to the suitcase fight or scott running up the gun barrel to punch a dude and then hightailing it through a diarama battlefield


the action did nothing to elevate the unique concept when it could have synergized with it a lot more than it did for example how cool would it have been if in order to fixdefeat ghost whose powers come from the quantum realm scott had to grab her and grow and grow and grow to the point where he reaches the macroverse the opposite force to counteract her powers


all in all i would compare it to doctor strange a film with a lot of potential for cool cinematic moments but they played it too safe  i feel like antman and the wasp is one of the safest marvel movies out yet that doesnt mean its bad though just that its a good fun film but it could have been so much more 7510


ps seeing paul rudd and evangeline lily in luiss narration was fantastic if i dont see a luis narration in avengers 4 with the other avengers i riot",2018-07-07
"i was bored throughout and fairly disappointed i regretted not going to see mission impossible again instead 

by the end of it i felt it was the simplest excuse to have the og wasp back for what little it was worth but also to whimsically explain why when we next see ant man  have actual super human powers

i had hoped that the snap would happen mid way through this and just completely derail the plot and it go bat  insane but it just never came

i understand it is its own little side adventure away from the main avengers stuff however i still thought it missed the mark and fell short of the first one which was solid fun i wouldnt go out of my way to see this again  its a needlessly long film just to tell us for some reason wasp1 is back and ant man2 is stuck in the whatever realm",2018-08-29
nice to know that ghost’s portrayal here continued the trend of recent quality antiheroes in the mcu killmonger in black panther vulture in spiderman homecoming these “villains” had their own motives and you could have a sense of empathy for them they’re not straightout evil assholes like thanos where even with his motives there was still pure evil in his actions,2018-07-09

this movie was fun and after the snappening thats just what it needed to be it had a decent story good humor tons of visual gags measured stakes however like the first one antman 2 is disposable and unremarkable thats not the worst thing in the world but it means this movie doesnt crack marvels top ten,2018-07-12

"this was 100 a moviepass movie nothing bad about it nothing spectacular either i love rudds scott lang i like how relatable and likable he is i also love hope i think shes an infinitely better character than black widow i would love it if scott hope and hank played a bigger role in the bigger mcu 

other than the characters i thought the villain was yet again an incredibly weak nothing marvel villain youre supposed to sympathize with her by the end but she didnt get anywhere near enough screen time or development for that 

overall if it wasnt for how likable rudds scott lang was i probably wouldnt have enjoyed this movie as much this was blatantly the equivalent of a filler episode",2018-07-09
wonderful palette cleanser after infinity war it was fun from start to finish i found myself chuckling a good bit i wish i could write more about how much i enjoyed the movie but i’m still in a bit of shock after the end credit scenes that glimpse into a postsnap world was horrifying the people of the world must be freaking the  out since the avengers pretty much never lose ,2018-07-06
marvel has had some great humor in their movies lately pretty much every release has been on point with exception to black panther,2018-07-09
it was decent but just feels like an unneeded tag along movie  like when you are watching a tv series and in the middle of the season they have a full episode that has nothing to do with the main story and doesnt move the plot along at all,2018-07-09
"among the bottom of the mcu im afraid which to be fair is still not that awful i like most of the characters and the expansion of pyms tech into more shrinking  expanding the plot needed major work though

normally i like when mcu movies are continuous with the others but hank  scott rehashing a fight over civil war was not good mostly because it reminds me of how little sense it made in the first place scott is not impulsive despite them saying he was and would not have risked access to his daughter on a whim and pym who hates the starks would likely have been supportive it was a negative to that movie and kicked this one off badly as well but it was minor

the first thing that really bothered me was the time coincidences janet van dyne has been in the quantum realm for 30 years connected with scott via retcon 3 years ago but now they have 2 days to find her the same 2 days at the end of scotts house arrest simultaneously an enemy they never heard of has only a week to live 

and at the same time generic mercenary bad guy decided this was his time to get involved for no clear motivation his presence with the other coincidences felt like random complications to fill the movie

and speaking of random complications there was no reason for hank and hopes initial response to ava to be anything other than well totally help you they avoided saying that until 5 minutes before the end so theres something to fight about at the same time flipping whether she was confused and lawrence fishburne lied to her or she was violent and he tried to lead her to good 

another thing i had a hard time with was the magic of technology you need a pretty big threshold to enjoy a superhero movie so i think im fairly generous but two subatomic entities who were nowhere near each other at size can randomly find each other in a moment without trying but then need coordinates to be found on purpose and its timeless but she did age but she didnt need anything to survive and also she has the power to put an antenna in scotts brain and to create energy with her hands

ill accept if if they try to be consistent or offer more explanation than recalibrate the deflector relay or other technobabble but they need some effort beyond whatever helps the plot at the moment as far as im concerned if ava magically knew that janet existed and could be killed for benefit she should have also known janet could help her directly instead things did what they did and people knew what they knew purely to advance the fight

not to end on a negative note though paul rudd nails the character and the car scenes were a lot of fun i liked that his ex wife and her husband were more supportive of him now and even thought the fbi agent was kind of funny i hope we get to see some ant man in infinity war 2 as i expect that to be a good script which does the character justice",2018-07-16

"i thought mcu couldnt get more fun than ragnorok fatigue be damned i was wrong

great jokes and character moment with amazing delivery

i did feel the climax was a little cluttered too many different things going on all at once or right after another

i feel like they had all these great ideas for what to have in the next antman movie and decided to cram all of them in there a few of those moments giant man sinking could have been cut to give ghost more fighting i think

"im going to give my 100 honest opinion here
i thought the movie was incredibly bland cliché and not very funny at all i laughed out loud about 4 or 5 times the rest of the jokes just didnt land most of the theater was silent 95 of the time i saw it in a group of about 10 people and none of us liked it i cannot understand for the life of me how it has such good reviews and ratings so far its probably the worst movie in the mcu it was especially disappointing because my friends and i are pretty big fans of the mcu especially as of late with movies like spiderman homecoming thor ragnarok and infinity war i wouldnt say the movie is terrible it just fails to excel at anything it basically felt like a mediocre kids movie with some mild swearing and violence really dont recommend it id give it a 510 or so",2018-07-06

"excellent fun movie 

my one criticism is that the middle of the film felt a little bloated due to the walton goggins character there were all these different antagonists stealing the building before and during that chase scene from the mobsters to the fbi to the ghost it was just a little bit of villain overload for me i feel like the mobsters and the fbi could have been consolidated into one organization and the film could have been like 5 to 10 minutes shorter and edited a little tighter",2018-07-09

can someone help me figure out the timeline this movie takes place in a matter of 2 days based on when scott will be released from house arrest then we see hank and janet at the beach after everything is done after that we see all of them running their tests with the quantum realm when the snappening happens so how long were the events of infinity war and where does it fall in with this movie i can assume that a massive alien attack in ny would be huge worldwide news and scott and co should have heard about it and possibly made a decision about whether or not to help cap says that scott is under house arrest in infinity war which makes me wonder if they happen at the exact same time the only thing that throws it off for me is hank and janet at the beach and coming back to run the tests it felt like some time has passed but if it did scott was already off of house arrest and could have helped the avengers am i missing something,2018-07-06

 timeline with avengers infinity wars is a bit unclear they say in iw that scott cant help because he is in a house arrest but that ended in the end of this movie and it was at least several days before that post credit scene where people vanished so i feel like he would know that the earth was under attack and they needed him maybe he didnt want to go because of the probation

just got back not sure if im still supposed to use spoiler tags so ill just play it safe and say 810 would be my score furthermore it was really good but id be lying if i said i liked it more than infinity war that was always gonna be tough though just considering the sheer scale of the latter film this one was pun intended much smaller in scope smaller but also much sweeter wholesome is probably the word id best use to describe it scott and cassies relationship scott and hopes hope with hankand later janet hank and janet it was all very touching and nice the action scenes were fun i liked stan lees cameo but boy is he starting to show all of that 95 year old body even his mustache looked older honestly the movie im having trouble deciding if i liked it better than is the original antman i really loved that movie it was sorta the overlooked marvel film i liked a ton i probably liked this better but i dunno ill hafta watch it again after it gets on hbo or netflix or whatnot that end credits scene was such a somewhat predictabledick move though my 11 year old nephew especially hated it after everything they went through its snatched away again just like that i do think those particles or whatnot scott was gatheringwhich reminded me of fry gathering the chronotons in that one futurama episode are gonna prove vital in next years avengers 4 where  play a role im not sure how  get back from the quantum realm but ive heard the upcoming captain marvel movie might be looking into that location too so that may tie into itspoiler,2018-07-06

"i liked the movie though i would put the first antman ahead of this after the last 2 marvel studios films were more dramatic this does work as a cleanser until just before the credits scroll to take us back into depression the humor is still on point and mostly works while the stars do lift this movie with their performances 

the things that keep this away from being one of the better marvel films and instead sit this in the middle of the ranks of marvel films are the issues that have similarly dragged down iron man 2 this feels like there are way too many plots stuffed in the financial troubles over at the security place get barely mentioned while the businessman that wants to sell the lab just for money feels like a reject out of jurassic world fallen kingdom his plot could be cut out and the film would be more focused

ghost would have worked better as a nonvillian sympathetic character rather than being a villian throughout most of the story it feels like had hank just said to ghost that janet could help her the conflict would be resolved immediately and would give more incentive to find janet

im surprised at how much i disliked this one since im a big fan of the series and quite enjoyed the first antman for me it ultimately comes down to the fact that i cant think of a single character who has development or an arc in this one scott never faces punishment for trying to balance being a hero and being a good person hope doesnt reveal much of anything about her character in this one despite playing a larger role hank doesnt suffer for creating demons in his past professional relationships nobody loses anything here and whatever they desired in the first place is granted without question by the end they do not learn from mistakes or grow as characters really,2018-07-09
i loved this film it had a lot of heart at the same time the story was a little bit of a mess and went here and there and there and there and in the end while we got the happy ending it was a little anticlimatic that being said the movie is still tons of fun hannah john kamen has a ton of screen presence some of the jokes were dead on like luis with the truth serum and some were not the little girl stole every scene and as awesome as scott lang is evangeline lilly is glorious as the wasp some of the movie is downright silly but overall a solid 7 out of 10 for me post credits scene is cool i so saw that coming though ,2018-07-06

"20 bucks says ghost comes back to retrieve scott in iw2 but doesnt do anything beyond that or the ant in the apartment goes to find scott after taking its headphones off at the end of iw it looked like fury was driving was driving in san francisco so i imagine thatll play into iw2 like scott is the one that finds the weird captain marvel pager or he calls the surviving avengers who come to sf and see the pager and meet her etc

i thought ghost was decent but underwhelming not a big fan of the whole let us explain our entire life stories and evil plan while youre all sitting up tied thing it would have been more interesting to find out who she was in a different way also how many secret operatives can shield have 

beyond that ghost just didnt do it for me scott and hope could really stop her at any time if they team up she walks through walls they walk over under or kick through them it just didnt feel like a threat then again this was more of a heist movie with multiple teams going after the same target not so much a battle so i can see why she was executed that way

there didnt seem to be much character development everyone is exactly the same at the beginning and the end the only thing is the rivalry between michael douglas and morpheus and hope and scott not liking each other for a relatively dumb reason and then getting over that but there wasnt any major emotional arc changing them as people everyone got everything they wanted without having to make any sacrifices or change along the way it was less a movie and more an episode of an antman and the wasp tv show where everything gets resolved all nicely in a bundle with your favorite characters remaining their same old selves for next weeks episode    
     
was also kind of annoyed that michelle pfeiffer didnt seem to change at all personality wise from being down there so long i think it wouldve been more intriguing that she forgot them initially but then remembered at a crucial moment

jokes were funny although i saw it with a crowded theater so that might have overamplified just how funny everything was overall its a fun romp but definitely lacking in the dramastory department

"i just saw it earlier today and enjoyed it it was a fun heist movie and a good followup to the original movie i liked that peyton reed returned to direct  it was pretty consistent with the first antman as far as comedic timing and overall pacing the jokes landed the action scenes were just the right length without getting stale and were creative the kitchen scene the car chase with the pez dispenser are the two that immediately come to mind i could have done with less of the sonnyfbi sideplot and more of luis and co and maybe more of the professor that laurence fishburne played the midcredits scene packed a punch i wondered how long after civil war this one took place and how it would tie into infinity war the postcredit scene as well packed a punch with its silence and the solitary feeling it had save for the ant i cant wait to see how this ties into avengers 4 next may

"here are my thoughts after seeing this movie today

i would describe this movie as a collision course movie  you have 4 disparate groups on a collision course that culminates in the finale  scott hope and hank want to use the lab to rescue janet  ghost wants the lab to save herself  mobsters want the lab to sell  fbi wants to catch scott violating his house arrest and to capture hope and hank  a very keystone cops scenario of yesteryear

for the most part i enjoyed this movie but everything in the first movie landed better  i found the first movie to be funnier  i bought into the relationship between scott and hope more in the first movie  their  tension and chemistry felt more genuine to me in the first movie  i also felt the relationship between scott and his daughter felt more real in the first movie  scotts entire house arrest montage played like a sitcom to me

additionally i found this movie to be very expositionheavy  there were a couple of scenes that were straight up explanovision  i think the script overall was mediocre  i even felt the actors at times had a hard time selling some of the lines

now for the good parts  evangelines wasp kicks much   they really made her a bad   her ability to fly her grasp of shrinking and growing her martial arts skills and her overall competence as a hero really shined in this movie  michael douglas was fantastic as usual  he didnt have a frontandcenter role often on the edges of the frames but in what opportunities he was given he took full advantage  michelle pfeiffer in her brief appearance was amazing  i cant wait to see more of janet in future mcu movies  david dastmalchian gave me the best laughs  he was the best comic relief in my opinion  the trio of pena ti and dastmalchian have been used really well in both movies 

action was also amazing  shot amazingly well  i especially appreciated peyton reeds and the visual effects teams ability to seamlessly shrink and grow antman  whether it was a 3foot tall scott running in oversized clothes or a 65 foot antman in the bay the visual worked naturally and seamlessly  wasps fight scenes were fast but not frenetic  i was able to follow exactly how she was executing her skills  although we lose sight of her we never lose sight of what she is doing  this couldnt have been easy for peyton to achieve  he deserves a ton of credit for this

within the pantheon of mcu films this is definitely the most comical a purposely campy and jokey movie  surprisingly though i actually had more laughs in movies like guardians of the galaxy thor ragnarok and avengers infinity war  too early for me to rank this movie within the mcu  presently it isnt a top tier marvel movie  it sits between the middle tier and the bottom tier for me  i enjoyed it but i think it could have been better  i would give this movie a very solid 7510using the tomatometer scale",2018-07-07
was dope tim and eric reference was the best part,2018-07-07
"why would they decide to experiment with the quantum realm during an alien invasion

but yea definitely a solid and hilarious movie stoked for peyton",2018-07-07
i just saw this today and got hit by the feels due to real life experiences from the touching scene with scott and cassie but was wondering if anyone had the quote where he said that what he does hurts her and that he always messes things up please and thank you,2018-07-07
i was confused as to why scott didnt just use his old suit that actually works as opposed to the new malfunctioning suit also earlier in the film hank mentioned that he actually did implement laser shooting in scotts suit why didnt they expand on that topic i mightve missed a few things that wouldve answered these questions,2018-07-08
"idk about you guys but janet kinda reminded me of a jedi when she was harnessing the quantum energy the way she did 

marvel and star wars crossover ",2018-07-09
i did enjoy this movie alot but it was so hard to watch after infinity war iw was so dark and brutal whereas this one was so light with a semi insignificant conflict i do wonder though can ghost still use her powers she could put up a real fight against the purple crimson chin,2018-07-09
"i thought it was a really fun enjoyable movie

but

the stakes were low i thought someone was guna get killed off 
",2018-07-13
that final after credit cookie angered me waiting that long for a joke  a joke shot that was in the  trailer  was very lame and certainly not helped by me really having to go to the bathroom by that point,2018-07-08
"i actually really liked it i hated the first antman and this in general is an improvement on all fronts paul rudd is doing less of a hey im paul rudd playing a character and is actually scott lang the movie was generally funnier the villain had interesting motivations if one note and the action was so slick it really felt like a live action rendition of a 2000s superhero tv movie its not gonna blow you away or do anything that well but in general its a solid film that has a unique tone for a marvel film and does it well

also its so refreshing to see there was never a big twist in this movie they set it up and it played out done my only major complaint is that his wife being a mcguffin to heal the girl was kinda lame but whatever",2018-07-06
"this movie was fun and light on its own merits a welcome change from infinity war whose warmth and humor felt like whistling in the dark i wish theyd left off the last two scenesthey felt like they were in service of the larger franchise at the expense of the emotional tone of this particular movie

also

does anybody know about the making of the animated toy scenes at the end credits just before the first infinity war tiein scene everything i try to google keeps coming up the postcredits scene explained or buy our toys now that animation looked like it took a lot of work i might have to buy it on disc and hope for an extra little feature on it",2018-07-08
marvel has done it again it was so funny and full of heart,2018-07-09
forgettable didnt lol once not as funny as ragnakok,2018-10-30
"two villains that were so bad nothing needs to be said an incredibly thin dumb generic plot with some horrible dialogue and an absurd basis by which the story establishes itself  that these heroes are just put on house arrest and some  agents are there to keep track

just a shocking movie it is unfathomable to me just how bad ghost was and the 1 billion dollars cartoon character of a villain whose name im forgetting it also didnt help that 90 of the jokes fell flat far and away the worst film on the mcu",2018-07-06
"so these days what’s the difference between stark thor antman rocket racoon and starlord personality wise 

don’t get me wrong the movie was ok but the writing in the mcu is extremely mediocre these days you can pretty much guarantee each scene will end with a joke sometimes it works and sometimes it completely takes you out of the film",2018-07-06
"in many ways antman and the wasp was a breath of fresh air much of the reason for it being generally well received has to do with the context within which the movie has released it follows the socially conscious morality tale of black panther and the emotionally draining show down of infinity war the welcoming light heartedness of the wasp is its biggest pull

do you remember audience reactions of mcu movies prior to 2018 there were a slew of youtube videos and comments decrying the lack of stakes in the mcu complaining that the franchise relied too heavily on quips and gags failing to actually conceive a resonant story taking this into consideration imo wasp would not have been received as well as it has had it been made and released earlier 2015 say the same complaints about its lack of stakes would have left it lower in the pecking order

im a big fan of the original antman it took a goofy preposterous concept for a hero and coupled with narrative warmth and innovative action set pieces crafted one of the most entertaining movies in the franchise in its wake i think wasp retains the warmth and innovation even overdosing on both while the original had a straightforward narrative and served as a clean origin story for the titular character wasp has just too many characters to remain cohesive throughout the plot is very loose and weaves its way into and out of tight spots and deus ex machinas with warmth and breeziness given first priority

the concept behind the villain ghost was a fresh one shes given a compelling backstory to boot however her supposed means of resurrecting her normal self was weak its stated that janet having spent 30 years in the quantum realm has somehow gained its powers but the other characters have no sensible way of knowing this with any reasonable amount of certainty so as to concoct a plan on it also they claim that theyll harness her power and save ghost whilst killing janet there is a neat moral conflict created but it does feel highly manufactured it was also slightly underwhelming to see janet simply revive ghost on her return it stays honest to tone of the film but to have the pioneering conflict of the movie resolved so clumsily was unconvincing

also laurence fishburne is a fantastic actor and any movie is better off with him than without but i felt his character was unnecessary while his character definitely does things the most notable of which is his admonition of ghosts proposal to kidnap cassie a more efficient screenplay would have done away with him and incorporated his actions with the plethora of other characters this in no way diminished fishburnes work with the character but he was never an integral part of the story

one of the most inventive aspects of the first antman was its all out inclusion of ants as a focal point in the superheroes arsenal him teaming up with the ants in a variety of ways the sequel has a notably reduced role for the ants and also does not feature any actual waspsthough i do agree those insects are too  nasty to be playfully included in the story the fun action set pieces could have benefited further with creative use of the little critters

given that janet spent 30 years in complete isolation i was hoping theyd explore her experience their in better detail they could do so much with this old janet it would be entirely plausible if she in fact had forgotten the language and a host of socializing skills that go with it all the complexities of spending 30 years in isolation are dismissed casually instead of perhaps capitalizing on it to provide a new character dynamic ofcourse any such decision would have again gone against the carefree tone of the film

its  near impossible to dislike wasp though simply because of how inviting it is there are so many light jokes peppered throughout the movie doesnt have a mean bone in its body it coasts along on sheer goodwill alone yes it might not be the complete superhero movie experience but given the gamut of movies the genre is inundated with each movie can appeal to a different aspect of superhero lore i know some of you might take issue with what ive said but i truly believe it is possible to love something while acknowledging that it isnt perfect antman and the wasp shows its cards up front and delivers on that promise",2018-07-14
"i was largely unimpressed most of the action bored me the characters continue to feel like caricatures and the my biggest gripe is antman is largely sidelined so that were all supposed to marvel at how cool and awesome wasp is allegedly

i did like the midcredits scene and was hoping wed get something along those lines

very middle of the road effort in my estimation",2018-07-09
i think it was a solid 6maybe7 out of 10 science mumbojumbo became a little entangled in itself at times and the ending felt slightly anticlimactic but the humor from rudd and peña was great as always as well as fbi agent wu the emotional heart of the film left a little to be desired but i’ve probably got my expectations too high following infinity war overall i got what i hoped for out of this flick an entertaining romp that didn’t take itself too seriously also i knew going into it that the end credits scene would be something of that nature and it still hurt ,2018-07-08
how much time elapsed from when thanos ships got to earth and the snap i feel like pym and co would have been looped in on world ending doins and they just kept on with their science project,2018-07-08
"anyone else get the impression there was a lot of stuff left on the cutting room floor

then they stop off at the college and head over to her house and they are suddenly referring to her casually as ghost",2018-07-11
the  technobabble in this movie became incredibly frustrating also why the  was walter goggins in this film,2018-07-06
"this movie was just boring i dont know what it is just never got into it and i love most marvel movies 

luis was great though he should have been in it more ",2018-07-07
a lot has been said already but holy smokes are there a couple huge info dumps in this film  at the midway point everything comes to an absolute screeching halt as we get ghosts origin and toward the end of that exposition its almost as if the writers realized oh nothing is going on lets put in a joke here to cap it off  theres a lot of runtime devoted to exposition in this movie,2018-07-07
finally we had a big screen debut of ghost rider in the mcu,2018-07-07
"first they mention baba yega then laurence fishburne shows up i was expecting john wick to pop up soon after disappointed 

the best scene of the movie was the mid credits scene the only scene that stirred up excitement in me everything that came before that was just okay none of the jokes were lol funny just a chuckle here and there if youve watched the trailers the actions scene were nothing to wow about you know what to expect 

the plot constraints felt very tackedon to artificially up the intensity we have this machine but we need one more component we can get her back but theres a time range limit ghost has two weeks but cant wait a few hours to let pym do his thing 

i wasnt bored i was entertained but this was a very safe bythebook movie its not pushing boundaries like the more recent marvel movies do ",2018-07-08
it was solid but more or less forgettable kinda like the first plus they piggy backed off the michael pena narration gag from last time which felt lazy the quantum realm stuff was great my favourite aspect was the care put into every character no matter how minor the characters were all great and well acted solid 710 i reckon ,2018-07-06
the first movie had a certain charm to it despite how closely it adhered to the marvel formula that feels lacking here it also doesnt help that marvel is fresh of the incredible hot streak of guardians 2 homecoming ragnarok black panther and infinity war easily their best run of movies to date despite their flaws all those films have something that makes them interesting and worth rewatching  compelling villains directors with a unique voice etc this feels like a return to the pleasant mediocrity of something like doctor strange meaning its perfectly fine while its on and the powers make for some neat visual effectsdriven sequences smartly played for comedy here but ill probably forget most of it within a month the postcredits scene does more to move the over mcu plot forward than anything in the actual movie ,2018-07-06
"id rate it 610 i find it the weakest in phase 3 so far

i cant believe it took me this long to realize it but it hit me half way through this movie marvel movies are the american equivalent to indian masala films ,2018-07-08
that movie kinda  there were some funny parts but the first one felt like it was more cleverly written this really wasnt the right time for this movie to come out either straight off the heels of infinity war,2018-07-12
just watched it boring and predictable with forced and annoying jokes worst marvel movie in a while ,2018-08-02
"im glad everyone seems to be having fun with this film but i just found it incredibly bland and void of any real thrills or tension the script was weak the performances were stilted and character interactions had an air of awkwardness to it that just made the whole film feel off

i couldnt even really find enjoyment in the very few action sequences the dynamic teamup combat of antman and the wasp is only briefly showcased and the remainder of the action is choppy and surprisingly not as imaginative as one may expect considering the films intriguing size gimmick 

the many attempts at humour often fell flat for me which is incredibly disappointing considering the comedic talent involved i couldnt help but notice that the film screams secondrate marvel ",2018-07-09
"marvel definitely bunted on this one  it was okay but nothing special  

it felt really cheap  the plot had us going in circles like they wanted to recycle sets  there was a lot of bland dialogue that seemed like it was just there to eat up screen time  pena and rud were fun to watch but thats about it",2018-07-09

judging from the comments here i guess ill pass on this one sounds like a fun movie but nothing that really excites me,2018-07-06
yayyyyyyyyyy i’m so happy this one is way better than the first they took everything that made the first good and upped it with rudd peña lily giving really fun and exciting performances douglas’s felt less phoned in also and that’s always nice but pfeffer is really underutilized the villain in this movie is also miles and when i say miles i mean light years better than the garbage one from the first film and i actually found myself caring and rooting for her during a large portion of the film the size of the story in relation to the rest of the mcu is also kind of refreshing to see as this isn’t as big as the others this is pretty much what i wanted from the first movie but actually good,2018-07-07
"i find it fascinating people are down voting
criticisms of the film i will admit so the criticisms could be worded better  but hey it’s the internet what are you going to do  i think the fact that every negative comment about the movie is being down voted is indicative of the collective hive mindcultish mind set around these movies  i’ve been reading comics for 20 years and it still confuses me how this franchise has blown up the proportions that it has with the general population antman  the wasp  is a mediocre movie  solid b or c movie it’s fine nothing greatbut i feel like people in this thread  are denial about it due to the marvel brand being slapped on it 



 i will never understand why people cheered for the pager scene in iw  the reality is maybe 23 people knew who danvers was from the comics and was legitimately excited about that money the other 20 were probably people who read internet articles about the captain marvel film and cheered in attempts to pass off how cool and “in the know” they are about comics ",2018-07-06
so uhhh how does ghost not fall through the earth  especially as a child wouldnt she just phase herself right into the ground,2018-07-06
not gonna lie watching the people talk about the movie made it really seem like the mid credits scene was shoehorned in  i think that it really undercut the entire movie  also i think it would have been better for janet to survive just because they literally just found her  they had her casually throw out that time vortex line but i think having her around would have been a nice way to explore a character we just met as well as give a great way for this whole supposed time travel plot to happen  overall though i think they could have started a4 with scenes like that similar to how they began the defenders with all the different character stories starting out on their own ,2018-07-06
  ,2018-07-06
i actually was not a fan of the first one and enjoyed this one more id say i liked ghost quite a bit maybe not the handling of all the exposition but i really liked the way they filmed her and its always nice to have a villain whose goal isnt end the universe but something on a much smaller personal scale,2018-07-06
it performed as expected not the best to date or better than iw but good enough i always thought marvels villains play a crucial role in determining how good the movies perform it just felt slightly underwhelming all things considering humor was spot on and not forced unlike gotg2 ,2018-07-06
during the midcredits scene did anyone else expect to see the wasp they kind of zoomed in on the ashes and i thought we would see that hope shrunk down surviving the snap unlike her parents,2018-07-07
"okay this timeline is still bothering me i just finished watching civil war scott is in the raft when cap comes to break everyone out then we hear in infinity war that scott is under house arrest which side note what kind of deal does scott strike if they give him house arrest after breaking out of the raft infinity war happens and the snap occurs right at the end in ant man and the wasp scott is under house arrest for his last two days the movie ends an undisclosed amount of time passes between the end of the movie and the after credits scene theres enough time for hank and janet to go on vacation somewhere together and come back to start running their tests but we see the snap happen in the mid credit scene

so cap says that ant man is still under house arrest and decides not to contact him which would indicate that infinity war takes place as ant man and the wasp is happening ny gets attacked and scott and hope figure they probably shouldnt go there to see if they need any help which is very odd because the last time an attack this big happened it was the chitauri invasion and you would think that scott and hope would want to help out anyway they can even if its just clean up of the city but the new york attack this whole movie and the vacation all happen in a matter of two days i have to be missing something here",2018-07-08
was mike myers in this movie behind i’m hiedercker ,2018-07-08
"saw it last night wasnt exactly sure how i felt about it now having sat on it a bit i really didnt like it much at all

the best parts of this movie are

 a character quirk thats a callback to the first movie

 an aftercredits scene that just reminds us of how good infinity war was

 the acting performance of an actual 10yearold

 paul rudd pretending to be michelle pfieffer

thats pretty much it ghosts first scene set her up as like a deranged desperate individual but once laurence fishburne shows up at the house shes just normal again the big emotional anchor of the movie is supposed to be the mom but weve never seen her before and hank and hope are still cracking wise when they have 2 hours until they never see her again it never feels real to them so why do i give a  and scott is the main character we got to know in the first film and he doesnt give a  either i was wayyyy more emotionally invested in getting scott back home before asian jim could catch him so that cassie wouldnt lose her dad than i was in hank and hopes plot

and then were supposed to just accept that janet can touch ghosts head and cure her what the  hank said well find a way together to laurence fishburne and so i was expecting some big reunion sciencey plot beat where they save janet and the old gang gets back together and experiments with the quantum energy to fix ghost or something but no just touch her head

idk maybe i just wasnt in the right mood because i appear to be in the clear minority on this film but man it was a big whiff for me one the mcu hasnt had in a while

i didnt love ragnarok or gotg 2 as much as some but i still really enjoyed both and i think black panther and infinity war are legitimately great the mcu to me hasnt struck out like this since iron man 2 ",2018-07-06
funny movie throughout but my cousins and i couldn’t stop laughing when the midcredit scene happened so predictable,2018-07-07
i thought it was the perfect definition of a one time watch not gonna lie this was kind of underwhelming especially after infinity war,2018-07-06
anyone catch that scene in the quantum realm where hanks wife called him henry i dont know if i misheard her or not but im pretty certain she called him henry,2018-07-06
"this could have been an agents of shield episode or something it feels like a plot that belongs on tv they didnt need to set this after the end of infinity war but having a little more focus on events in the mcu in addition to saving janet instead of just shoehorning in a character from the past out of nowhere as a villain i mean thats an incredibly comic book thing to do but man what a weird turnaround from iw

also haha holy  did they just cut ant man out of the next avengers movie as well maybe tony finds him but it seems like they are setting him up to be absent for a movie and brought back in ant man 3",2018-07-06
"so avengers 4 is tony and ant man time travelling to all the past movies and gathering all the gems before thanos has a chance to do so and then they defeat a gemless thanos but not before future tony and maybe future scott die in some self sacrifice way and of course they change a few things like the death of the asgardians

and just like that no one is dead and iw is meaningless did i forget about anything",2018-07-06
i see a lot of people really liked ghost but i feel some of her dialogue and a tiny bit of her acting was a bit weak the first scene with her telling her story felt like she was using the villian monologue voice that sounded a bit odd to me and then the part near the end where she says something like it hurts it always hurts just felt weird to me it was still a decent villain story but with some weak points,2018-07-11
"my theatre was so quiet despite being full

i enjoyed it as much as the first one too bad the trailers showed off all the action scenes though i thought ghosts phasing effect looked pretty cool throughout the movie i think maybe just a little too much referencing to civil war for me i liked the approach that theres no real villain in this movie i think my only gripe with the movie is that the finale felt a little weak but that may be partly due to seeing it in the trailers overall pretty good not it my top 5 for the mcu but i liked it way more than recent solo mcu movies like thor ragnarok and black panther,2018-07-08
i thought it was okay janet’s character was such a disappointment ,2018-07-08
"why did they change what happened in civil war  
  
for some reason cap didnt rescue scott off the raft  
  
somehow he had time to pack and ship his suit after the airport fight  
  
also scott stole the suit from hank he even filmed him doing it  so why is hank guilty by association

im so confused maybe its because i typically dont like super hero movies i thought the script was cheesy and the plot was scattered there were some funny parts but i dont understand what is so appealing about it,2018-07-10
"i don’t wanna be that guy but am i the only one who thought this was bad like worst marvel movie bad there were a couple of nice scenes but no scene can make me enjoy 1 hour of fake science boring talk or the other million things i didn’t like 

judging by the comments this was amazing 

honestly i didn’t like ant man 1 and watched this just so i’d have something to do i like every other marvel character buy this guy not so much it’s not his fault really he’s fine it’s the rest of the movie i dislike ",2018-07-10
im kinda disappointed it felt really sloppy and rushed doesnt help that the trailers show a lot of the action the only scene that made me laugh is when antman giantman breached the ocean,2018-07-07
"i felt like this movie overall was just really underwhelming and didnt fully go for interesting potential it had its not bad but its not really solidly good to me either

some of the acting is really shaky at times it feels overacted or unbelievable to me particularly with hopescotts relationship and michael douglas being angry or protesting in any moment the antagonist situation in the movie is insanely messy its very clear that two characters we have on the table arent cleanly cut villains when theyre revealed but the film doesnt go as far as it should to let us understand ghost for everything they say about her the entire premise of her is cool and interesting being perpetually in pain and on a timer to die and having been a shield operative assassin that was something that sounded big when they mentioned it but we just get a quick exposition montage instead of really being shown things that couldve fleshed out her character more it feels like ghost is supposed to be important at the end of the movie but everything before that felt like some of the typical vanilla mcu villain stuff that people dont like to see i feel like they couldve made her a clearly detailed villain but even if they wanted to keep her how she was ghost needed more

because of the films connection to civil war and the lack of actually showing us much regarding scott being on bad terms with hank and hope after the last movie ends with hope and scott kissing i dont feel like we had a believable enough reason for their tension hope especially after coming off the first film where she stood out as being interesting seems overly grumpy and in  mode here theres a lot of messylazy handwave storytelling tons of technobabble mumbo jumbo that just had me losing attention this really felt like a movie marvel studios probably wishes they could have put out earlier had this come out around guardians vol 2 or spiderman time i think it just wouldve worked better the bar has been raised so much in the mcu that right now antman and the wasp just feels like a step back for quality that you cant make its hands down the weakest and least ambitious phase 3 mcu movie i dont hate it or anything i think paul rudds charming and the relationship with his daughter is very endearing in these films but as far as a story and characters go it felt like hank pym was the only person really served in this story and it just doesnt work well as far as entertainment with the amount of screentime thats not executed as well for everyone else

610 for me",2018-07-06
"i’m sure i’ll get downvoted for this but i was not a fan which is weird cause i really like a lot of the parts but he sum didn’t work for me i think the script was fairly weak

rudd and lilly have great chemistry pena and the xcons were hilarious that last action set piece was fantastic but i found a lot of the dialog really awkward and cringey and the direction was really odd at times  ",2018-07-08
also dont bother staying for the second post credit scene,2018-07-06
"really wanted to like it but in the end it was very mediocre at best

i was excited to hear that ghost was in it one of my favourite iron man villains and i totally understand the need to give the character a better motivation other than i like to cause corporate chaos by stealing stuff but it felt very forced to have everything related and not tied together in a good way or with any exposition other than the character talking about the plot for a minute or two

action seemed poorly edited and combined with one of the most mundane soundtracks to date you know the car chase scene needed some beastie boys the moment hope reversed the van it should have busted out into sabotageor anything really with some energy to it this really was forgetful i think everything i will remember was found in the trailer so ill just remember that",2018-07-11

my only real complaint was it didnt really feel like there was an antagonist like team pym and co were really just working toward a goal and some people were just sorta in the way every so often idk my friend called me out on that but i just didnt get a big bad feel out of it

"i really enjoyed it everything about it was really good except the editing two times it simply jumps you forward in time and a lot of scenes were shot with a certain pace but the editing was jarring overall really was invested and almost teared up when janet stepped out of the ship this is the most ive felt during any marvel movie

if antman and the wasp and the wasp and the other antman happen id love for them to start away from the action an be more adventure like this movie was i think ghost was compelling enough on her own that making her do bad guy things was against what the film was trying to accomplish good thing laurence fishbone was there to keep a leash on her honestly pretty bold of him to stop her from going too far

had a great time good comedy well done action and the scott and cassy moments were so wholesome ,2018-07-06
the whole movie i was really worried it would end with scott seeing cassie disappear during the snap and that be some sort of dark motivation moment i was super happy it didn’t happen during the drivein scene and was impressed they had all three pyms go in the end ,2018-07-06
man oh man i thought the second postcredit scene was going to be cassie left completely alone maybe that would have been too much,2018-07-06
very refreshing nice break from the breakneck pace of infinity war and a comedy throughout including the post credits scenes according to my brother,2018-07-06

"this wasnt a captain america or iron man sequel so i didnt have high expectations it was fun  perhaps 10 minutes too long  but overall a good superhero flick

one issue i had with the movie was the constant exposition five people worked on this script and none of them could find a way to weave the information into the dialogue without making it so painfully obvious

the postcredits scene was so  creepy various shots of an empty townhouse emergency alert on the tv and a giant ant playing the drums horror movie stuff

solid b movie

edit reading through this thread i see a lot of negative opinions i can totally understand why people might not like this movie or arent completely satisfied with it especially when compared to the first one antman  as a said  is not one of the bigger marvel characters so thats why i didnt care too much about the quality its not great but i dont consider it a bad movie

there are no memorable action sequences the first film had a ton of cool moments they didnt always make sense they sometimes contradicted previous plot points but they were dramatic and stood out this film had nothing memorable  if youre tired of marvel humor this movie has a ton of it  which i found forgivable in this case because antman is heavy on comedy its not civil war or ragnarok where the story is serious but characters are constantly quipping and being silly nothing major is at stake here the antagonists are more annoying that threatening

overall its incredibly incredibly average it brings nothing new to the table its very forgettable but  for me   i didnt leave the theater thinking i wasted my money on a bad movie i laughed at a lot of the jokes i thought the sentimental parts were touching the cast has great chemistry and i thought some parts were cool but i wasnt blown away like i was after black panther

tldr its an antman sequel shrug",2018-07-07

"i am a big fan of the first ant man movie and the mcu and have just seen ant man and the wasp

maybe it is me but i thought it was def in the bottom 5 mcu
is it just me but it felt like a continuous get the lab movie
it just never got going as a superhero movie and felt all over the place i really wanted to like this but i am shocked at how bad it was

even the not so good superhero movies had something i liked

i know it was a sort of break from infinity war and like the previous ant man it was more of a fun ride but i found this so disappointing

what are anyone elses viewsdid i miss something",2018-07-12
"i didnt dislike it but i also didnt love it its probably my least favourite mcu movie since age of ultron i thought it had a lot of cool concepts but none of them were given enough focus to really shine and so it all ended up feeling a bit empty

im also not happy about a good 90 percent of the cool actionsize changing gags being in the trailers it didnt feel that way going into the movie but thats probably because i thought theyd have more up their sleeves with the quantum realm and that the big car chase would be around the midpoint at the latest",2018-07-06
"i enjoyed the movie i dont regret seeing it im surprised there wasnt that many action scenes where characters stayed in shrunken form for extended periods of time it follows the aftermath of captain america civil war and how it affected the people around him and his life

 scott interacting with his daughter is still a major part of his character carrying over from the first movie so thats great
 scotts banter with woo is probably gonna be peoples one of two favorite scenes
 the other scene would be janet possessing scotts body and interacting with hope and hank funny as 
 luis and friends coming back showing what theyve been doingplan on doing with scott running their security business and as expected with their scenes are still funny as 
 hank pym and his daughter hope are revealed to be on the run and in hiding but also finding a way into the quantum realm after scott managed to get out of it

it was waaaay more jokey than the first movie and some jokes dragged on for a couple seconds too long thats probably my biggest and maybe only gripe with the movie

there was two kinda villains in the movie butch and ava

 i enjoyed butchs attitude and personality quite a bit and since he didnt die im hoping to see more of him since hes just your typical black market dealer instead of an irredeemable killer

 ava was quick to use violence and threats throughout the movie so it was a bit strange for me to see her feel sorry for herself for killing people in the past after she gets fixed although they did explain she was in constant pain

two aftercredit scenes

 the midcredits scene is the important one and one we all expect after infinity war where janet hope and hank send scott after quantum healing particles to continue helping ava heal probably implying ava still has her phasing powers hanks family gets disintegrated while scott remains the audience in my theatre went ooooooohhhhhh when that scene playedspoiler

 the aftercredits scene is a minor playful scene dont bother waiting for it it really is minor",2018-07-06
i was thoroughly whelmed by this movie not good not bad just there ,2018-07-06
wakanda and san francisco should have a 9 hour time difference if youre using cape town as reference so for me the two snap scenes being in broad daylight holds up figure team sciene in sf was up bright and early did janet even get to have a lunch for the first time since coming back ,2018-07-06
"i enjoyed it a lot laughed more from this than i ever did from thor 3 the humor was intentional but didn’t feel forced or placed in the wrong moments if this was thor 3 there would have been a joke placed when scott was stuck in the quantum realm and the snappening occurred 

great change of pace good misdirection on the true villain and good work humbling the heroes but keeping them heroic ",2018-07-06
hated the villain but the rest was great ghost was supposed to get my sympathies but i could not have cared less about her than i did i was rooting for her to die at the end tbh bummer how they wasted her either make her sympathetic or dont but they did a 5050 split which just frustrated me greatly other than that i loved this movie funny and entertaining  and his daughter is a  super star she nailed every scene she was in,2018-07-07
anyone catch the pastor joke goddamit marvel,2018-07-16
"great movie loved it but i have to  on its weak spots  

so because they became quantumly entangled janet was prepared just in that brief exact moment hank and hope fired up the quantum tunnel to communicate through scott they said time worked differently there so i may be mistaken  

so how did they program the ant to follow scotts meticulous housearrest activities schedule  

poor judy greer and bobby cannavale  theyre like the warriors three of the antman universe unnecessarily big faces in small roles  

so why was sonny burch in this story he would have been just a chekhovs army character to just appear and then reappear later had he not had a connection to somebody in the fbi to further the reoccurring theme of phase three poor walton goggins is just typecast as a  dirtbag in every role now isnt he  

so hope meets burch dressed casually and ten seconds later is suddenly dressed in a brand spankin new suit just in time to fight no big reveal of her or of what is clearly the better suit  
hank seemed okay letting her deal with burches mooks all alone but got anxious when the ghost arrived if my daughter were surrounded by gunmen even with a supersuit id be worried  

is there any backstory on the lab pyms last lab imploded how did he get this one for a man who lives in an old adams family house he can sure afford a lot of buildings and vehicles to shrink  

so they can take off their helmets at different sizes i was under the impression it worked like a spacesuit with its own atmosphere inside and that they couldnt breach it at different sizes without being effected  dying why am i bother asking this in an antman movie  

oh so bill foster the guy they just happen to be asking information from on their ghost troubles is also coincidentally behind the ghost troubles they are investigating well how about that  

so the expensive tech they got off of burch just fits into their machine like a big keycard  harddrive thats convenient  

i love stan lee  but this has to be his worst cameo in a marvel movie it was a slow humorous moment totally crammed into a fastpaced action scene it stood out like a sore thumb  

just like half of the laws of physics in antman movies the physics of the quantum realm are left ambiguous but it would have been nice to explain why hank needed to suit up if he could just survive in that environment without it or how janet managed to survive several decades there or how it changed her  
i get the feeling this will be expanded on in the sequel the same way it was before was there a city in the quantum realm or was i seeing things  

bill foster gave ava a matter of weeks to live so why did she get so desperate as if she had hours even enough to kidnap cassie or  janet  

janet is such a huge part of the plot of this movie but we barely scratch the surface of her character at all call this a criticism if they dont plan on expanding on her in the sequel  

tldr great fun movie  but so many questions to answer",2018-07-06
i enjoyed it thought it was good not great by any stretch though the film was just so  repetitive in the whole second half of the movie enjoyable none the less 710,2018-07-06

"please don’t downvote me to  first i enjoyed the movie now that’s out of the way i did not feel that any new ground was tread with these characters “marvel is formulaic” would be too lazy of a review and  i don’t think this was necessarily a lazy or formulaic effort perhaps for me the stakes didn’t seem that high the villains weren’t necessarily villains the criminals seemed a bit 90s campy and the general outing felt more happygolucky than it was in trying to press the danger and stakes 

i’ll tell people to go see it i got a few really good chuckles out of it and i enjoyed the kitchen fight and tunneling visuals but i don’t think this will be ranked extremely high as say thor ragnorok 

edit spelling",2018-07-09
"obviously a different movie but the villains plot suffers from the same problem that poes plot with holdo did in star wars tlj but for some reason people dont seem to be complaining about it that much

i dont see a logical reason as to why ghost and laurence fishbournes character couldnt have had a conversation with hank at some point during the movie about ghosts condition  or even have had a conversation about ghosts condition in the years leading up to the events in this movie

also they gave no explanation as to how janet was able to cure her  she just could  cause she has been in the quantum realm for years she can cure ghost  but why",2018-07-09

"overall i really liked this movie i was satisfied with the action and there were also some great jokes

my minor gripe that keeps this movie away from the rest of the great movies in the mcu is that i was a little let down by the villains of this movie there seemed to be too many and they didnt get a lot of development

theres jimmy and the fbi but im guessing thats more for comedy than an actual threat to the mission to save janet

theres sonny the black market arms dealer who doesnt really seem to have any motivations other than money is he working with someone is he just trying to force hank to work for him his fbi liaison just dies but he continues the chase anwyay

and then theres ghostava and bill ghosts motives are pretty clear but it seems like she acts pretty selfishly considering she has a few weeksdayshours it wasnt really clear to live after janet comes back bills motives confuse me as well its not clear if he still hates hank or how he could still spite him for being discredited despite being a university researcher",2018-07-07

"one of the worst marvel movies in recent years imo aside from the onedimensional villain and horrible subplot with the southern guy there was just no cool antman action scenes the wasp had a cool kitchen scene but aside from that there were no cool tiny scenes i think there were literally zero interesting tiny antman scenes no set pieces that compare to the first films building diorama drain pipe infiltration underground ant tunnels briefcase fight and the train set nothing even comes close to being an interesting or creative sequence for antman in this film

edit stop downvoting an opinion you disagree with this thread is for discussing the film and opinions",2018-07-09
it was just really boring for me and im bummed out because i love the first movie and paul rudd,2018-07-07
it seems like everyone else loved it but i didnt find it that enjoyable the main characters seemed like jerks in relation to ghost and the humor felt forced and overdone at times the science talk wasnt funny and didnt even sound accurate and the movie had no interesting twists maybe im the wrong target audience but it felt like very much a movie for young kids with awkward attempts at adult humor and the gangster guys were cringey at best it wasnt like a bad movie just nothing special ,2018-07-09
everyone that is questioning why the antman group didnt participate in infinity war is mentally ill,2018-07-10
i really didnt like most of this movie it had some funny moments but for me they were few and far between one of my major gripes was that i didnt care for michelle phiphers character she was in the movie for maybe 15 minutes and i didnt see any reason to care about their family dynamic same goes for ghost the exposition dump with her and lawrence fishburne was painful to sit through some of the funniest moments was the scene where ghost pops up into the interrogation of michael pena along with school break in but overall i just didnt care about the movie i would love to hear some counter opinions and have a good discussion with people who enjoyed the film,2018-07-06
the midcredits sequence doesnt really make much sense when you think about it after the fact if he was already released from house arrest did he miss the tv stories about thanos in nyc did cap not call him did he say he wasnt interested in helping after risking his life to help one person why are they working out of the van,2018-07-06
"i didnt see the thanos film but am aware of the great thanos snap of reddit then i saw this film tonight and the ending scene made soon much sense

movie was good just needed to be 20 minutes shorter and it wouldve been better baba yaga is spreading everywhere john wick i mean ghost is coming for ya,2018-07-15
"i had a lot of issues with the logic of the film but it was funny and a pretty good sequel for a marvel character 

save winter soldier pretty much every second installment for a marvel hero has issues

some of the things i had trouble with

scott had a new suit in civil war they made a big deal about him scuttling the old suit but werent there two ant man suits out there 

why were ghost and bill porter openly opposing the ant family their end goal was to enter the quanum realm and find janet wouldnt a lastminutedoublecross been infinitely easier

just what are the rules for shrinking the lab was shrunk but then shrunk again while inside a getaway vehicle why not just doubleshrink it and keep it in a pocket

i realize scott was under house arrest and wasnt really deemed a threat but did they have no other way to track or survey him other than to march through his front door his known associates possess technology deemed dangerous to mankind but they didnt even keep track of his personal cell phone

despite the nitpicking paul rudd is a treasure martin sheen is amazing and who doesnt love seeing more luis",2018-07-10
i liked it but coming off of movies with significant weight like black panther and infinity war i will say that it feels like there is less at stake the driving force of the movie is the quest for janet and there was never really any risk there seeing the first antman and seeing the trailers for this movie should clue people in to its lighter tone and allow them to enjoy it for the adventure romp that it is but if you were expecting something more dramatic waiting for that to happen could possibly make the film feel like it was dragging along personally i thought it was great and fun and broke away from the mold of hero and villain w matching power sets like the majority of superhero movies including the first antman some of the best fight scenes are with the creative use of different power sets against one another which is why this movie spiderman homecoming the antman vs falcon scene and the battle between cap and tony are so memorable to me ghost is sweet for what we see of her and i would enjoy seeing her further humanized in the future ,2018-07-06
"it was pretty good obviously paul rudd was great and the guy who played luis was great too something did feel a bit off though im not sure what it was i think it tried a bit too hard to be funny at times 

also what was the deal with the lead fbi agent he was funny but he had a really weird vibe too i think at one point he said what the dickens which i dont think ive ever heard anyone actually say out loud before",2018-07-11
"i liked the movie despite it not being what i think it could have been

my favorite part was the midcredits scene it was brilliant it raised the stakes very high and very quickly

i liked the characters including sunny despite him not being much of a threat he was a nice and entertaining addition that showed the lengths the pyms were ready to go to to get janet back

pena stole his scenes and his chatterboxing flashback was brilliant i guess the production team saw it as a hilarious comedy routine and decided that they must have it in the second movie

sadly there wasnt enough wasp  antman action for which we can blame story reasons first of all scott was reluctant to help the pyms until cassie convinced him to at first he had to get back to his house arrest once he realized thats not happening he excused himself saying i  everything up and i have no idea what you said referring to all the science scottie has no idea about then his daughter literally tell him to help the pyms and scottie cant use any excuses anymore

then we have the pyms and lang not talking to each other for two years problemspoiler what do you think this does to trust and teamwork its a marvel the three were able to make it work especially considering hanks ego issues

another problem i have with the movie are the generic forest sounds we have james gunn with his two volumes of guardians and now we have generic forest sounds ugh just record the actual sounds in the forest in the scene or forego the sounds altogether

when janet took over scottie to fix their algorithm and tell them how much she loved them the pyms reactions and rudds performance were brilliantspoiler my second favorite moment in the movie all pure acting

yes scotts malfunctioning suit wasnt explained as well as it had to be yet it provided two decent scenes of scottie as giantman first when he uses a truck as a scooter and second when he  finally  retrieves the lab from sunny and makes a spectacle of itspoiler

ultimately the acting was the best part of the movie sure there was writing which though not yet at the desirable level was improved i saw the feedback from the actors and the lessons from other movies right on the screen

what really bothers me were the forest sounds which hint at bigger issues the movie conveys that its antmans improved sequel and that its a kidfriendly superhero comedy but is it good enough to be a marvel movie

no

this movies closest comparison are the guardians of the galaxy guess which franchise is more fun yep the guardians

foregoing special effects because space is not earth and ants arent aliens we have to consider three differences the music the writing and the pacing

in the guardians the music isnt a plot device or a comedic device like the cucaracha in antman and the wasp in the guardians music is an experience its there to entertain the viewer and do that on its own essentially with the guardians we get the familyteam component in the story the comedy in the writing and acting and a party in the music not so much in antman and the wasp lesson treat music as a companion experience to a movie

the writing and the pacing could have been better the pacing to me wasnt that much of a problem as i was struggling to keep up with the false plotholes why wasnt scotties suit functioning how did avaghost know how to drain precisely janets energy and not hanksspoiler who knows and if those explanations were clear in the story id be bound to have issues with the pacing the writing should explain each possible plothole at least twice the science talk should be more conversationlike and the movie was almost funny not as funny as it could have been due to cliches yes the actors funny ideas are great but the funny stuff has to belong to the lore of the story and the action on the screen lessons learn different types styles and genres of comedy read the dialogue aloud multiple times in different inflections youll surely find a better way to say things and dont use anything generic as it devalues the movie and the viewers experience

as a final note im happy to say that the movie is all things considered a success i doubt it will cash in as much as thanos pt1 did and definitely not as fast antman and the wasp is a movie worth watching and rewatching for the story the acting the progress the lore and truth serum

what do you think",2018-07-08
"perfectly balanced as all things should be

but seriously  this film had it all heart humor action equal billing for our heroes not just in title but in the content itself not to mention three great antagonists two of which not only survived  but had meaningful motivations and arc fulfillments

overall this ends up somewhere in my top 8 for the mcu really really good throughout i thought",2018-07-06
i was surprised iw wasnt acknowledged til the midcredits scene i kept expecting it to play into the last act somehow for me it made the midcredits scene have 0 emotional value because after the credits started i was just thinking ok here comes the iw acknowledgment scene where people start fading i did think the emergency broadcast at the very end was cool it made me excited for iw2 seeing the ant on the drums added nothing though since we had seen it in the trailers,2018-07-06
is this better than the first,2018-07-06
death count  0 this could of been just pg i think,2018-07-09
is no gonna talk about how cliche the ending was it came off as lazy to me not the after credits scene i just think they could’ve drew something up better than everyone ended up stereotypically happy ,2018-07-12
that was a let down i was hoping they would explore the sub atomic or whatever it is you call it world instead we got scott trying to use a broken antman suit,2018-07-08
"i didnt hate it by any means but i definitely didnt think it was as good as the first one im slightly confused by all the comments about how well all the jokes hit in this one and how much funnier it was than the first i thought it was the complete opposite maybe because my expectations werent very high before i watched the original but i found the first one surprisingly hilarious this movie was a perfect example of someone trying to shoe horn jokes into spots where they theoretically should fit because they worked in the first one and got laughs but you cant catch lightening in a bottle twice

i could go on about other things like having two under developed villains mainly used just to make the chase scenes bigger i guess walton goggins character served exactly zero purpose which sucks because hes an amazing actor 

im just honestly surprised at how many people are going gaga over this movie when i thought it was mediocre at best maybe im wrongin the minority but the commentslove have surprised me to say the least not to say its bad or anything its a perfectly fine blockbuster mcu movie i just thought the first one was a whole lot better",2018-07-11

i really just wanted to come in and have fun at a marvel movie but that movie was so bad,2018-07-12
"i already gave my personal opinions on the actual movie but i just wanted to discuss the after credits scene and get it off my chest

i feel scott getting stuck in the quantum realm just because the pym family got snapped was pretty unwarranted if were to assume that thanos snapped in that exact moment at wakanda how come everyone there just seemed so nonchalant on a potential alien invasion new york was attacked earlier granted antman takes places in california but still iron man went missing and it made national news and im sure governments and scientists around the world wouldve noticed giant extraterrestrial objects heading towards africa

i think doing a dangerous and timesensitive experiment on the roof of a building during a time like that would be irresponsible let alone doing it without having the technology for the user in the quantum realm to return on their own should something go wrong on the pym family end",2018-07-08
a fun movie but one of the more forgettable in the mcu the finale is one of the mcus best and antmans powers are fun to see onscreen but the stakes are really low and the movie doesnt do anything different for the genre like the last few,2018-07-08
"i wish they could have played up the fact that wasp is actually the hero of the movie who does all the cool  and antman is more or less jack burton from big trouble in little china they kind of do it but it doesnt feel intentional theres really no reason why rudds antman needs to be in these movies when wasp does everything better than him

what is the timeline with this and avengers iw why wasnt antman and wasp off fighting thanos did they miss the news on what was happening in new york and wakanda iw spans like 23 days max so where were they

young cgi laurence fishburne looked weird then i found out his son played him",2018-07-06

i was very disappointed with the aftercredits scene it would have been funnier if they hadnt already done the joke of the ant playing the drums in the movie itself and just feels like they added that because they knew they needed to add something  ultimately a very very minor gripe on what was a great film,2018-07-07
what a great sequel  marvel is really hitting their stride with the humor,2018-07-06
honestly didnt think that everyone would make it to the end of the movie alive i thought janet was going to betray hank and  him clearly i was wrong,2018-07-07
antman 2 was better than the first one i wish luis storytelling lasted a bit longer  but other than that it was dope currently watching the end creditswonder whats gonna happen ,2018-07-08
i liked the movie seemed a lot more kid friendly tbh than alot of more recent marvel productions i will say ghost was horribly written tho imo the laziest writing anyones done in the mcu to date she existed seemingly to just throw an extra wrench in when it was convenient and her inconsistent personality was made worse by how easily she was stopped everytime she made some headway,2018-07-07
i had fun watching it no really serious complaints that i can think of but it has to be one of the more fillery marvel movies ive seen ,2018-07-08
"i loved the expanded roles for lilly and douglas but the movies weakness was the villains the reveals about ghost shouldve been saved until the end so they had more impact we all can predict where her story is going to end up once we are told how sympathetic she is supposed to be so she loses her status as being a threat to the heroes then they stick in all the mob goons to be the villains were supposed to hate but theyre hardly organic to the story you can take any superhero movie in the world and stick in some thugs who want to attack the hero for whatever reason it wouldve been more organic if these goons were working for ghost and then in the end fishburne comes in to tell her story and convince her not to be the bad guy then she disables the thugs to save janet 

also the movies strains credibility at some points wouldnt that lab have been a complete wreck inside the way they were throwing the mini version around between vehicles also i dont think unshrinking the good guys car underneath the bad guys car would have the effect of toppling the bad guys car i think both would get wrecked",2018-07-09
"pretty disappointing movie it’s been a long time since i didn’t really enjoy a marvel movie and the trailer show a good portion of the action sequences

i like the whole cast but a lot of stuff was not landing for me",2018-07-10
"saw it last night was fantastic as per usual

in the middle of it i swear there was a quote from cassie where she said my dad doesnt feel so good anybody",2018-07-06
so maybe im just overthinking this one but can someone whos read more of the comics tell me if they ever explain the quantum realm like why can they breathe when theyre smaller than molecules or is that just one of those hand wavy comic book things,2018-07-06
"the more that i think about iti feel like this was kind of a throwaway movie  i didnt feel like any of the main characters were in any imminent danger the stakes werent very high  

i honestly expected a lot more i guess with a bigger tie in to iw",2018-07-06
yeah it is the usual marvel kind of movie pretty enjoyable and funny no real glaring issues just minor and nitpicking issues at most,2018-07-06
just saw it it was good funny and action packed i just loved the banter between everyone i do wish a lot of the cool things werent spoiled in the trailers but what can you do about that ghost was a good villain if you can call her that she had her own motivation and was just an antagonist i liked the fight scenes and everything the cast was great lol kim jong un goggins had a smaller role as did fishburne i wish janet was in it more cuz i love michelle glad to see she is getting more work heres a weird thought what if they had cast a younger actress as janet and explain that she didnt age while in the quantum realm that would have been interesting  tho that mid credits scene i cant believe it on a last note evangeline lilly is so hot in that wasp outift ,2018-07-07
so the feds didnt notice the exact building they found in the woods had appeared in an abandoned lot in the middle of san fran,2018-07-07
can anybody describe the after credits scenes i don’t have the time or money to go see the movie but i care about the story of thanos and stuff like that,2018-07-08
another great marvel film this was a really exciting and fun movie that had a lot of good humor and action scenes i might be especially biased because i was originally from the bay area though so all the sf stuff was especially fun to see ,2018-07-11
"bizarre opening for a movie it was just a bit too matter of fact enjoyable but weird 

solid movie overall was funny and the action sequences were good i guess that’s what we want from an ant man film it’s not changing cinema but i didn’t look at my phone waiting for it to be over 

the ending was cool but a tad predictable can we assume that fishburne will be involved in bringing him back",2018-07-06
"was i the only one who was not surprised by the mid credit scene with them disappearing i was expecting it and felt like i would’ve been more surprised if they didn’t disappear 

same with hawkeye i feel the only way to get hawkeye on the team again is for the opening scene of a4 is for him to lose his entire family he then takes up the mantle of ronin to avenge his family ",2018-07-06
i was actually bored the first 15 to 30 mins of the movie it wasnt tell ghost caught all three of them that i got invested otherwise it just felt like they were doing things kinda weak buildup to the actual main plot,2018-07-06
can we change the preview image thanks i dont wanna look at wasps,2018-07-08
"watching it the entire movie kind of has one glaring plot hole they could have actually helped ghost with her issue thus avoiding conflict entirely with her once they finished what they set out to do ghost wasnt inherently a bad person as she was merely fighting to stay alive and try and cure her conditionspoiler

overall it was an average film with the usual marvel humor though i was kind of surprised to see walton goggins in the film and its obvious that he was loving every minute of his character",2018-07-08
"very fun with not much else i enjoyed ghost to the extent of she was a little less cookie cutter only just 

a little underwhelming i’d say and not as good as 1 for me butttt still fun",2018-07-06
i havent seen it yet but was this movie funny like actually funny or just quips and cheesy,2018-07-07
were people really surprised by the end credit scene like i saw that coming from a mile away ,2018-07-12
"a bit of a letdown the villains were underwhelming sonny burch was a generic mobster with generic and bland motivations ghost had potential but throughout the movie it didnt feel like she was a real threat the fact that both the wasp and ghost were saved destroyed any remaining tension sometimes the jokes went on for too long scott lang was downgraded from protagonist to comedic relief sidekick he didnt change as a person at all

most jokes were good seeing hope as the wasp was the best parts

the whole movie felt like a feelgood family flick

edit this is a movie you watch on netflix if you wanna see it see it but if you have doubts and are looking to be convinced to go to the theatre take that as a sign you shouldnt buy a ticket",2018-07-09
critics sure love it 88 rt approval rating,2018-07-06
while on the way to the movie i squished like 3 ants in my car ive had a  ton of construction outside of my apartment for the past week or so so the ant problem has gotten really bad in my apartment and car ,2018-07-06
gotta hand it to the people who made the trailers who made bill foster seem like he was in the movie for comedic affect or effect idk didn’t expect him to be what i thought he was gonna be,2018-07-06
literally just saw it  wow just wow,2018-07-06
"i’m still processing the movie but i think i really loved it there is a real accessibility to the characters here that i don’t think other hero films have tapped into it could be the smaller stakes of the film but these characters have a lot more relatability to them i think it all comes down to how they consider the situations and their consequences throughout the story little things like scott always fearing his probation because he needs to prove himself to his daughter and how the story redeems the main villain in a considerate and nonviolent way

compare this to black panther and how aggressive t’challa is with killgrave a blood relative with a tragic life story he fully admits to empathizing with it’s like our hero forgets the lesson he learned at the end of civil war that villains are also people who can be understood and  reasoned with antman and the wasp don’t make that mistake and the movie is so much better for it

also i need more lazy houselounging antics in my life",2018-07-06
"scott possessed by janet and kiddie scott are the most hilarious scene for me surely they will be the scene that i will remember for a long time 

this movie gives me a good feeling until the end though the first after credit scene i dont feel so good anymore",2018-07-06
dont mind me im just here for the snap,2018-07-06
ghost was great im excited to see what they do with her character from here on but i wonder what shes been doing since captain america 2 when shield fell,2018-07-06
hank pym loves calling out hope and scott when their romantic arc is slowing down the plot,2018-07-06
that scene where hank faked heart attack and bill getting hanks almond case because hope was pleading was wholesome,2018-07-06
"in short — it was smashing a very fun film i thought the recap at the beginning was a little heavy with the narration but i loved the intro michelle pfeiffer was given to show the relationship with her daughter 

otherwise a lot of fun to be had very appealing to the eye lots of feel good and preparation for the post credits scenes both of which were not only unsettling but also so fitting ",2018-07-06
im getting a feeling that cassie will be assuming the role of wasp in the next avengers movie,2018-07-06
i thought at least one in the pym family would have left but the odds in their family is way too bad,2018-07-06
why did janet start to disappear when ghost was using the quantum energy wasnt she just human and stuck in there shouldnt have hank started to fade tooor the entire ship i know she has powers now just not sure how one affected the other ,2018-07-06
we always joked how funny it would be if randomly in the movie half of the people go away due to thanos i didnt expect them to follow through,2018-07-06
so scott is gonna end up traveling to the future or something right,2018-07-06
that ant is going to be doing scotts daily routine for a looong time,2018-07-06
"just saw it really enjoyed it 

was wondering how they were going to integrate with half of everyone in the universe being gone then forgot about it because the movie was so genuinely entertaining and then boom that postcredits scene ",2018-07-06
that was arguably the best mid credits scene so far,2018-07-06
"30 years spent in quantum limbo only to be turned to dust right after getting out

 i feel terrible for janet ",2018-07-06
wow really want jim to be mr fantastic i guess woo is fine,2018-07-06
no one seems to be talking about the mobster dudes who are they are they important for the future or were they just there as plot drivers i didn’t have an issue with them per se they were just kinda there,2018-07-06
i guess you could say that the pymsghosted,2018-07-06
holy  hank pym pulled a pierce hawthorne,2018-07-06
did anyone else find some of the momentary editing jarringly bad there were a few cuts that pulled me right out of the scene ,2018-07-06
luis complaining about scott’s dishwasher protocol was a great use of the truth serum to create comedy in their relationship,2018-07-06
im not sure if i missed it and they gave ava a last name but i wonder if shes supposed to be the mcu version of ava ayala one of the white tigers ,2018-07-06

funfact ghosts father is elihas starr aka egghead,2018-07-06
really enjoyed this movie i’ll defiantly bring my family next time i see it my only problem with the movie was ghosts resolve it seemed like they took the easy way out by delaying her death with magic fingers from a character that shows up 5 minutes before hand ,2018-07-07
cool wanted to make sure i wasn’t the only one that heard it and had the same idea,2018-07-08
"my mom thinks so as well
",2018-07-09
fun and lighthearted movie also the black matrix guy was in it pretty cool,2018-12-23
for the people that hated this movie because it was entertaining and funny and enjoyable dont worry the snyder cut of justice league is supposed to come out soon,2018-07-06
honestly i dont know how marvel keeps getting a pass on all the bad cgi  the car chase in the end looked like someone copy and pasted daytona usa for the sega saturn into the film,2018-07-06
"i enjoyed this but not as much as the others in my theater  they went nuts for so many of the jokes and i just kind was like ok

they lost their minds at the first end credit scene",2018-07-08
i kinda feel like the movie had a problem with juggling too many characters at once the sonny burch plotline should’ve been removed to make room for more ghost and bill foster screentime,2018-07-08
"i did not enjoy the guy sitting a few seats over who shouted ha huh huh ha ha huhhhhhhh at anything approaching a joke it was so loud that the rest of my theater stopped laughing at anything and sat stone silent throughout the film

yay popular movies",2018-07-09
this movie  im sorry it just did there were a few good moments but overall it was a major disappointment the entire movie was essentially unnecessary ,2018-07-17
death taxes car chase scene in a marvel movie,2018-07-06
better than incredibles 2,2018-07-06
does this film have good special effects,2018-07-06
"marvel is on fire this is a good movie i personally didnt like the ghost person the scene where they turn into dust was a good reminder that infinity war is still tied into everything the postcredits scene was funny but already featured in the trailerspoiler
solid 810 compared to the superior infinity war and black panther edit i see 810 is the most popular vote so far
the trailers i got were really  for some reason my theater laughed and even clapped at the end for some reason",2018-07-07
the funniest marvel movie,2018-07-08
i loved this movie the humor and the fight scenes were fantastic michael pena and co sorry i don’t remember their company’s name all have great comedic timing the truth serum scene was awesome the first post credit scene— i knew it was coming but the movie was so entertaining that i didn’t think about iw until that scene crazy bring on the next marvel film ,2018-07-06
so if they find antman then they can bring everyone back right i mean he has those quantum healing shot now right,2018-07-06
"michael peña is amazing
can someone explain what will happen to ava",2018-07-06
how the  did hank and pfeifer have time to go to hawaii and then back to sf when the snappening was supposedly occurring at the same time,2018-07-06
go bears,2018-07-06
i think this is a point that was mentioned in ant man 1 but i forgot already why is hank pym not using the antman suit is it because michael douglas thinks hes too old to wear tights ,2018-07-08
what was the book scott was reading at the beginning,2018-07-08
literally the definition of ‘meh’,2018-07-06
"this is a filler movie the same way the walking dead has filler episodes 


this is a throwaway film


it was funny but a bit pointless ",2018-07-06
"obviously not as good as black panther or infinity war but i still enjoyed it a great deal  i think moving the post credits thing up about 15 minutes would have been the better move and perhaps leave janet rather than removing all three but otherwise no real complaints  

like ant man before it its a much lower stakes dumb fun action movie and thats fine once in a while smaller movies like spiderman and antman help make the big movies seem bigger helps create a sense of perspective",2018-07-09
this was one of the best bank heist films of the decade marvel continues to nail diffirent genres with their properties,2018-07-06
everytime i look at michael pena i remember that hes a scientologist and it took me out of the film ,2018-07-07
"question about the midcredits scene 

it went by quickly but i could have sworn that i only saw two sets of ashes when they flashed back to the rooftop then the camera pans to the mic dangling also we dont see who each set even if there were three belong to  we dont see them disintegrate we just see the ashes was i wrong i cant find the scene online yet to checkspoiler",2018-07-09
that ending was the only time ive not only openly screamed but the rest of the theater did as well,2018-07-06
solid but forgettable like most marvel movies,2018-07-06
"incredibly average worst movie from the mcu so far i wouldn’t even download this illegally was there even a villain this has got to be the worst villain marvel thought of so far so much potential wasted on lawrence fishburne same with walter goggins the jokes were horrible as well the jokes were from start to finish but horribly executed they just turned out cringy and unnecessary most of the time seriously learn from thor how to make a good action comedy superhero movie

honestly people are just giving this  a pass because it’s from marvel the only memorable scene was the midcredit scene ",2018-07-06
boring and almost every joke fell flat glad i saw this with sinemia and didn’t waste money on it ,2018-07-16
dread it,2018-07-06
"the exposition scene with ghost and bill was shockingly unrealistic being interrupted with scott’s phone ringing i was wondering what the creative forces were thinking is this a serious moment or not it seems like the new path for marvel but i really wish they wouldn’t undercut every bit of seriousness with goofiness  
  
walter goggin’s character was reduced to a scooby doo villain within the same scene he was introduced he even ran around with his henchmen like a cartoon in the climax when he got on the ferry he might as well have shouted “smell ya later antman”  
  
aside from early on when ghost threatened hank’s life and the reveal that her intention is to  janet at the end she was merely a nuisance “i momentarily need your tech” the fbi was a nuisance to our heroes and my patience this was nuisance the movie  
  
honestly if you took away the comic booky elements of the quantum realm control over ants and size manipulation this would be just another by the numbers throwaway summer movie  
  
edit oh  apparently no criticism allowed downvoted to ",2018-07-07
"wow what a letdown pretty much the only positive things i can say about this movie are that i loved seeing more of hope in this installment and that they thought of some really fun and creative applicationsaction scenes invloving the sizechanging technology other than that the story was basically a rehash of all the jokes and shticks from the first one but with less humor and a sense of boredom hanging heavily over all of them centered entirely around the one little detail of the first movie that i found the worst quantum  pseudoscience they introduced a super cool antagonist with an insanely awesome visually if you ignore the pseudoscience explanation behind it power only to completely squander her by not investigating anything but the most rudementary cliche back story that honestly only half makes sense as a motivation for her disliking the main characters like youve gotta squint your eyes and tilt your head just right to see how she could see it that way over all id give this movie maybe a 510 only because i like all the actors and the basic premise but honestly it just feels like a real waste of a story that i thought was one of the lessappreciated gems of the marvel universe at least the cut scene was exciting

edit youd think if 15 people are going to downvote a review of the movie at least one of them would take five minutes to explain why they think its wrong just a bunch of blind sheep who feel threatened by anything that suggests an mcu movie was subpar",2018-07-06
can anyone tell me how this movie is part of the infinity waravengers storyline also a brief summary of the credit scenes would be awesome,2018-07-09
this film is absolute pure and utter trash,2018-07-19
okay film ruined by a loud audience and bad popcorn hope we get more michael pena such a great actor,2018-07-07
"this movie was extremely mediocre it really felt like they were just going through the motions in acting writing directing everything like they did the same get back before the feds catch me scene twice ghost is just healed by a deus ex machina hank and bill are mad at each other for years with hank refusing to help ghost until he randomly decides to i cant really pinpoint when hope and hank stopped being mad a scott because it just seemed to ebb and flow until everybody likes him again at the end there were basically no consequences in this movie until the after credits scene  

oh and this was probably the least funny mcu movie that ive seen i dont think anybody in my theater actually truly laughed at anything but then again i went at 4 pm on a wednesday so there werent many people 


",2018-07-11
"just got out of the movie  

initial reaction was theatre went nuts at the first end credits scene 

its funny that the van  family thinks its good time to go subatomic when the earth was under attack by thanos  

what happened to clints and scotts families being under house arrest  inconsistencies  

more later  ",2018-07-06
it was a great movie overall the only part that took me out of it because it was so unrealistic is when they were driving in the tiny cars and there was no turbulence whatsoever in reality they would have been wrecked in an instant,2018-07-07
"this is not going to be popular i imagine but does anyone else struggle with  evangeline lillys acting i found the little girl that played cassie to be less wooden

i also found laurence fishburne to be an unnecessary character",2018-07-08

"from someone who didnt see the first ant man i was rather lost trying to put together the pieces at the beginning it did fine eventually but the movie doesnt stand on its own that well my daughter and i laughed a ton but without seeing the first i didnt feel there was enough of a connection between the characters

as far as people saying they didnt like the cgi or the story line isnt as good as other marvel movies thats really the reason i never cared to see the first one the premise just seems too far outside the realm of the other marvel movies it had the corniness feeling of honey i shrunk the kids to me

movies are escapism for me just make me laugh or scare the  out of me and ill enjoy them which is what this movie did for me",2018-07-16
spoilers this movie is all over the place with tone it wants to b happy with his daughter scenes and really showing off wasp but then make ghost pretty much be 1 note shoulda killed her off at end yet they make wuts her name save her but not fully for some reason and then the old guy somehow miniaturizes the quantum realm portal and puts it in the back of a car i thought they were collecting the healing stuff to rematteralize ppl who got taken by thanoss snap but nope how long did this take and he got released from house arrest b4 this scene so he was free from house arrest for months or a year after it took them however long to put the portal in the back of a car yet captain america says he was still under house arrest i think in infinity war which is less than a full day b4 the snap happens all 3 of them get turned to dust and what about antmans daughter,2018-07-09
itt and itsr every movie ever made sucks,2018-07-13
i think scott survive the snap because he in the quantum realm time and space are irrelevant and in the avenger 4 they travel back in time and built big  quantum real machine and put everyone in earth in quantum realm so everybody survive the snap ,2018-07-06
i really loved this i was confused on the first end credit scene because i didn’t watch infinity war then i realized oh ,2018-07-06

also i was really distracted during the scenes with the older mom because she just looked like current day michelle pfeiffer in a gray wig",2018-07-06
i thought jimmy woos throwaway line about having dinner with scott would be a good way to introduce an lgbt character into the mcu,2018-07-08
never has a marvel movie not care or even be slightly invested in the characters at all the “villain” was so underdeveloped and one dimensional i would’ve loved to actually see ghost do some  crazy thing like kidnap the daughter also how pym and his daughter were  at lang for leaving so he wouldnt go to jail even though they didn’t really even need him anymore,2018-07-07
"i’m not saying it’s a bad movie but i just don’t care about marvel movies anymore because they are  out so often they’re good quality but i just don’t have the same excitement i did for say infinity war

whst happened at the end the after credit,2018-07-06
movie was pretty bad dunno what y’all are going on about,2018-07-09
i watched the first ant man yesterday and i watched ant man and the wasp today and what i get from it is that marvel took the basic synopsis from iron man and just ran with it for these to make it easier for them the villain in the first one is basically the exact same as obadiah from iron man in iron man 3 tony has a lot of trouble because his suit is buggy and glitches a lot sound familiar still i enjoyed both movies especially luis and his elaborate stories he goes into but honestly marvel just could have tried harder ,2018-07-09
"normally i would  and moan about a movie like this but this one isnt worth the energy if the people making the film didnt give a  why should i the story makes no sense the best moments are in the trailer and the action scenes are uninspired the concept behind ant man is so good and should lend itself really well to film but instead its just vapid and unimaginative

also movies in general need to stop pointing out their own plot holes being self aware doesnt give you a free pass to take narrative short cuts

anyways now im doing the exact thing that i said i wouldnt do and now im being self aware to justify my rant two strikes on me i guess

ps   the post credit scene that  was in the trailer",2018-07-13

edit maybe im missing something but feel free to point out to me how this post is political in the slightest or how im a trump supporter or how im complaining about how oppressed white males are im honestly confused as  because while its a negative opinion on the press run for the movie nothing i said is anything to do with any of that",2018-07-06

does anyone feel like it looked really bad marvel movies have always had the issue of looking incredibly grey and boring but the coloring on this movie was bad even for marvels already low standards only passable parts imo were hank pym preparing to go into the quantum realm and the quantum realm itself beside that it was good enough i enjoyed most of the rest,2018-07-09
well the cracks are showing this movie had so many fridge logic moments i lost count not the least being no one apparently being aware of the alien invasion going on,2018-07-07
x,2018-07-08
that first postcredits scene should have just been in the first twenty minutes of avengers 4 and im wondering if its literally just lifted from that movie its pretty jarring tonally makes no sense if you havent seen infinity war and is pretty key information for avengers 4 its good fan service but negatively impacts the film as a whole we go from that upbeat moment at the drive in to by the way everyones dead,2018-07-08
"recently i graduated high school and of course i’ve met and have become close friends with many different people within that span of 4 years for complex reasons that i wont bother disclosing here in a review for some  superhero movie getting the chance to see those close friends of mine at this time is not very easy but we managed to set aside this day to hang out and we went to see antman and the wasp being with these people makes me happy and we joked and laughed together while watching the movie and it all felt bittersweet because although i was having a pretty good time i didn’t know when i was ever going to hang out with that group of people again it kinda helped that we were all nerds since it was pretty fun arguing about the movie after the end credit scenes that come inherently with every marvel film we walked out still arguing and joking over movies and pop culture we ate ice cream walked around the stores surroundinng the theater it was nice you see maybe in a few months from now i might still be able to remember this day the specific movie we watched however i’m currently having trouble writing this review due to how quickly it fled my mind as soon as i got back and walked through my front door and this may or may not have something to do with why i’m stalling you with this paragraph as i’m trying to remember something worth talking about in this movie

antman and the wasp is the 20th film in the marvel cinematic universe mega franchise and a sequel to the 2015 film antman i surprisingly enough enjoyed te first antman mcu film very much and i remember it as one of the funner times i’ve had in the theater with a group of friends i say surprisingly because later on when i started to develop an interest in writing and art criticism i was surprised to see how many people hated the movie i on the other hand thought it was an awesome smaller scale heistadventure actioncomedy as much as i enjoyed the first film i really did not want this sequel to me made i wanted this film even less than i wanted the unnecessary solo a star wars story it would be an obvious and effortless cashgrab and due to the fact that it takes place before the events of marvel’s previous movie avengers infinity war there’s nothing that could have happened in this movie that could have ever affected the future of the mcu series that would have been the saving grace that would have given me more of a reason to go out and see this movie as soon as i could but i didn’t i would typically watch new releases on a thursday but this time i simply didn’t feel like it and i don’t regret it the only two reasons i went to see this movie is because i feel like i have an obligation to see every superhero movie that comes out and because i needed a movie to see with my friends antman and the wasp is about our main protagonist scott lang helping out some uneasy allies to save someoneout of some weird quantum dimensionand then try really hard not getting killed by some antagonisti think antman and the wasp is easily the most forgettable movie in the entire 20filmlong run of the marvel cinematic universe

alright lets get a few positives out of the way sure maybe a few action scenes here and there were a bit entertaining there was a decent amount of creativity to the whole shrinking and growing mechanic in action scenes but the main positive standout for me was how much i laughed during the movie i laughed quite a bit actually i actually feel comfortable classifying this film as a comedy among some other adjectives if there is a reason to see this film at all other than being a marvel completionist its the comedy within the second and third act there weren’t many audience members there watching the movie with us but some puns and one liners caused a laugh that would sound like it came from a crowded auditorium i have to admit that i had a couple hardy belly laughes myself the comedic nature of the first film carried onto the second film very well scott langs sidekicks played by michael peña david dastmalchian and ti would steal the show whenever they were on screen every character in this movie was brimming with charisma and likability and i couldn’t help but have a smile throughout many parts of this movie my smiles however were hollow and sometimes the comedy could get to be a little too much especially when coming from anywhere that wasn’t michael peña’s dastmalchian’s and ti’s characters

the first act was quintessentially mediocre the humor was frankly the opposite of clever any bit of emotional weight that could have possibly been developed was tampered down by continuous jokes they were jokes that were at times quite hilarious but detrimental to my investment in the story nonetheless and when they weren’t funny when they were just shoehorned in and felt like they were thought up of in a matter of seconds it made the movie a lot less enjoyable fortunately that didn’t happen much but i’m only talking about the comedy what about the story the story felty like it came out of an episode of a cw superhero show like the flash or supergirl they’re suitable for those disposable and cheap superhero shows on cable television but not for a 162000000 budget widerelease marvel blockbuster the villain in this film had lackluster writing easily one of the more forgettable marvel villains which is a problem that marvel has been having for a while in a lot of their films the story about saving a family member after being lost for thirtysomething years had little to no emotional weight and the movie was strangely littered with several little plot holes and inconsistencies for example when someone that has been living in a dimension where they’re smaller than an atom comes back to the real world she comes back with a jedi robe that she didn’t have originally when she entered in the first place and there is no sign of any rudimentary material to make any clothes out of or when our main character was told that he can’t legally be in contact with a specific character while he’s in house arrest accepts his inconvenience yet calls him anyways and snaps his phone in half so that the movie can tell you that he took precaution from getting caught yet the call still went through and can still easily be traced by the police if need be and since theyre seemingly tracking his every movement anyway i guess the writers forgot that the police will probably be tracking calls from his own house too i mean if the writers thought that through i didnt see where they explaining how he didnt get caught doing that or how the person from that weird dimension just magically conjured up a jedi robe out of thin air

i didnt have a bad time though  i had a good time watching rampage 2018 and that movie was pretty bad although it is completely forgettable although it is dumb although it does not do hollywoods superhero fatigue any favors it is still lighthearted and full of charisma so while i never ever want to see this movie ever again nor can i think of any reason anybody would think its interesting enough to see a second time what it all comes down to is whether or not i enjoyed it whether or not i think my experience was worth more than it took not whether im gonna enjoy it the second or third time but my one time watching it in the theater and in that one time i think i did have a decent experience if you dont have that same attitude in which you feel obliged to see every marvel movie then i cant recommended this movie to you but if you are then do yourself a favor and bring a few good old friends along it might just make the movie for you

im going to be giving this movie an

 too much",2018-07-09
how does one get botox injections and makeup from in the quantum realm how did she clean he clothes bathe and take care of her teeth,2018-07-06
"another movie that falls flat because they refuse to do anything with a male lead except let him be the prop for the character they really wanted the movie to be about wasp 

give antman some  agency for christ sake i hate marvels demasculation of their lead characters lately they have every right to be the  their own movie",2018-07-09
"tt sad paid off shills


lol this movie was garbage the villains were dog  the plot was dog  and the action was sub par",2018-07-06
"i dont mind a marvel movie thats a bit silly but i do mind if the movie cant take itself seriously at all especially if everything from ghosts upcoming death langs release date the quantum tracker deadline and the meeting thing for scotts new business all happening at the same  time walter goggins character was pointless michael pena and his crew were just as dumb as the last movie the best joke for me was a reference to animal house which was actually pretty clever after i thought about it later on 

the whole movie sets up the wasp and saves janet van dyne only to  them off via infinity war which is mainly a fault on marvel rather than the movie as a whole marvel had to release infinity war in the early summer but it definitely hurt this movie and the last postcredit scene was really   although i am curious to see how antman is saved by cap and friends next year 510 not a horrible time but not worth seeing again in theaters ",2018-07-10
the ending where he is stuck because everyone got dusted was so terrifying the first time i saw it,2023-02-23
in the beginning when hank and his wife are trying to stop the missile hank said he would have went subatomic himself but his regulator was broken he continues to say his wife’s regulator was working so she turned it off and went sub atomic if the regulator needed to be shut off to go subatomic and hank’s was brokennon functional he could have gone subatomic himself yet he spends the whole movie acting like he is mad that he couldn’t have sacrificed himself instead of his wife i rewatched the scene like 5 times to make sure i heard him right too bc it was a real “” moment for me,2023-11-02
and he was spectacular,2018-07-07
you may not be off,2018-07-06
im really disappointed that nobody calls hope ant maam so she can say call me the wasp ant maam was my mother,2018-07-07
i could die a happy man seeing thanos lip sync over luis saying and the big purple spaceman was like yo there aint enough resources in the universe for everyone we gotta balance that  out,2018-07-06
may we all be so lucky ,2018-07-06
luis recapping all of the mcu from iron man 1 to a4 is the only thing i want out of life ,2018-07-07
first time seeing it referred to as the snappening thats amazing,2018-07-08
the image of pena voicing thanos talking fast with sassy gestures,2018-07-08
i had a hall duty for 20 minutes a day this year as a long term substitute teacher first time doing it when i had my change over day with the teacher i took over she just told me to grab a desk out of one of the nearby rooms and bring some work to pass the time when i sat there i just wstched the same 10 kids come around 34 times i just told them to get back to class or at least keep moving if they decided to just sit there in class what am i gonna do chase em down tell me their name walk them back to their class its so much effort to care about hallwalkers i felt for that moment they nailed it ,2018-07-07
also the gym teacher in spiderman,2018-07-07
always glad to see brian huskey pop up in a movie,2018-07-07
do hall passes ever actually exist i don’t know anyone that used them ,2018-07-09
i liked the cute version of antman theme music played along with it,2018-07-14
hes google if it was a guy,2018-07-11
i was thinking about how we had to carry a sign out sheet to go to the bathroom in highschool and i only had it checked once in 4 years teacher asked and i literally raised the sheet to show them before they could even come close enough to see it theyre like youre good,2018-07-11
i love that actor so nice to see him get time on the big screen hes the if google was a guy guy and on adult swim with pretty great show ,2018-07-19
then his midexplanation diversion to the story about music and morrissey particularly after we hear scotts ringtone being a morrissey song,2018-07-06
the thugs all confessing after they tied them up and gave them the truth sereum was my favorite we steal technology and deal it on the black market to the highest bidders hes the boss thats true i am,2018-07-10
that scene had me in stitches,2018-07-07
his whole tangent about the danishes  killed me i was laughing so hard i couldn’t focus on the movie for the next five minutes,2018-07-09
i loved the truth serum running gag too,2018-07-09
luis is a brilliant character ,2018-08-22
and him singing the nursery rhyme to himself was hilarious ,2018-07-07
nice of the writers to actually know what baba yaga means,2018-07-08
i thought it was hilarious when he was talking about it and that string music in the background was playing lol ,2018-07-09
the film also seems to actually know what baba yaga is looking at you john wick,2018-07-09
although didnt he mispronounce it i thought the proper pronunciation had the emphasis on the last syllable,2018-07-09
i immediately thought of john wick,2018-07-13
literally everything with that character fell flat when i saw it not a fan of that character or ridiculous fake russian accent,2018-08-05
scott is now stranded in the quantum realm because of the snap he’s definitely the most affected,2018-07-06
i think hawkeye is going to win this contest in the long run,2018-07-06
eh what about scarlet witch she had to  vision only to see him getting killed again and then she died too but if you mean worst affected by snap and surviving then yeah,2018-07-06
nah hawkeye  mark my words i guarantee that guy loses his wife and kid ,2018-07-06
"i dont know man was tony really that much worse affected in terms of loved ones lost sure hes stuck on an alien planet but id say scotts situation is worse in that regard and we only really know that tony lost peter and rhodey thats not really worse than most of the remaining avengers and much better than rocket

clints probably gonna end up hit the worst though",2018-07-06
i like how thor is disqualified from this because everyone he cares about died before the snap,2018-10-04
was the postcredit scene filmed before or after infinity wars ,2018-07-18
did rocket survive,2018-07-16
i got the good vibe from him in the first too i felt he was genuinely sympathetic to scott but it wasnt going to stop him from doing his job nor in protecting a little girl who is going to get hurt by scott ifwhen he slips up and goes back to prison ,2018-07-06
i loved when the wife was rambling on about how the fbi couldnt do this and that and he just goes like actually they can,2018-07-07
i liked that they showed the exwife and stepdad still being supportive of scott even when it was obvious he was antman again he’s proved himself and they acknowledge that ,2018-07-06
"my motherinlaw would have her kids watch mrs doubtfire because it was one of the few movies at the time where there was a divorce and the couple didnt end up back together at the end and it was ok 

pierce brosnans character wasnt a  either which was also refreshing",2018-07-07
this was one of the things i think they did really well in terms of their relationship branching off from the first movie i hoped they wouldnt ruin scotts reputation as seen by paxton at the end of the film and it was such a nice breath of fresh air to see paxton still rooting for scott in the end loved it,2018-07-06
which is totally great because the same actor in mr robot plays a sociopathic murderer,2018-07-07
also subverts the “evil bobby cannavale” trope,2018-07-07
heck seeing the bad guys have a nice ending minus the evil souhern dude was wholesome as ,2018-07-07
its also refreshing because historically the actor typically portrays a less than ideal human being ,2018-07-07
i feel like between the antman movies and guardians vol 2 with yondu marvel seems to be good at breaking the evil stepdad stereotype ,2018-07-15
that was an easy paycheck for bobby lol ,2018-07-07
they did that in the first one this was just icing on the cake,2018-07-08
seriously the entire time i was expecting there to be some dickish comment made by him or something but no ,2018-07-09
loved this too but i really feel like bobby carnavales talent is underused in this role he wouldve made a pretty good marvel villain ,2018-07-09
i thought cannavale was underused but did a great job in his role,2018-07-09
"if you like that guy i forget his name check him out in mr robot the last season that aired three i think was outofthisworld good i never even watched the first two sesaons but enjoyed the third immensely and i really do mean immensely

edit bobby cannavale is his name",2018-07-20
"i digged that as well especially since bobby cannavale has played a totally bad guy so frequently

that said it just okay and too sappy and most of the jokes didnt land and much of the action was weak for mcu standards

computer load up celery man please",2018-07-07
i thought it was a condescending type of supportive ,2018-07-08
lily killed it,2018-07-06
"agreed i wasnt a fan of the first but the complete cast sold this one




complete opposite of guardians 2 where it focused too much on father son issues this one handled it much better",2018-07-07
kate killed it i mean lilly ,2018-07-08
dont laugh  ,2018-07-07
all the family stuff had me cryin,2018-07-06
i’m still kinda young and want to be a parent someday and this movie made me want to have a badass little girl as a daughter ,2018-07-08
that got an audible aww out of me and i dont aww,2018-07-09
stature for avengers 4,2018-07-09
well she’s like what 7 maybe in 10 years newcool stepmommy can be the wasp for a little while longer i think,2018-07-10
a guy in the theater was crinkling a plastic bag insanely loudly and nonstop during that entire scene for me,2018-07-15
i think it was better for her that they all got snapped as a family itd just be plain cruel if say  janet survived the snap and she lost hank and hope all over again or if both hank and hope survived and they lost janet a second time its better this way ,2018-07-07
a little offtopic but if time doesnt exist in the quantum realm then how in the world did janet age so much,2018-07-08
"that would be too good of an ending

if you ask me that scene made the movie perfectly balanced",2018-07-09
i was honestly surprised all three of them got dusted my prediction after watching infinity war was that all of the characters would be in the quantum realm for the climax of this movie explaining their whereabouts while thanoss crew was  up new york and either hope or hank would be the ones to get ethered while theyre inside then they come back to the real world at the end where everythings gone to  what they ended up doing instead was way darker ,2018-07-11
dammit janet,2018-07-09
you mean deleted,2018-07-11
i wonder if shed be erased if she stayed in the quantum verse,2018-07-11
she evolved in the quatum realm maybe that causes her to snap out of existence differently,2018-07-07
that and the baseball hat sunglass rip were incredible ,2018-07-07
i laughed out loud during the credits scene when they said quantum healing particles,2018-07-07
thats what i was gonna say,2018-07-06
"if we increase the quantum terrarium malforentofuge by disassociating the barametric clarity in relation to positron aggrevance it might work

yeah thats what i was thinking ",2018-07-10
pym needs to go to riamverysmart,2018-07-09
he would be great in cinema sins,2018-07-08
haha i kept waiting for him to put quantum in front of something ridiculous after that,2018-07-08
study physics and went to see it with two fellow students we had a grand time laughing our  off,2018-07-27
asking the questions so the audience doesnt have to ,2018-07-14
i noticed that too but i dont know enough about the quantum mechanics and the like to say they are using the word quantum too much ,2018-07-26
"the recurring magic bits kept me rolling

doesnt matter if you live in a world where the avengers exist alien invasions are a weekly occurrence and superheroes are popping up left and right all over the world magic is cool as ",2018-07-06
hes also a youth pastor,2018-07-06
i went in thinking he would be a unnecessary character i was so wrong he steals the show loved the whole dinner scene ,2018-07-06
i loved his character and i felt like it was such a relatable character even though hes this fbi captain guy or whatever hes still like howd you do that and running in to thwart the bad guy antman only for it to blow up in his face as hes sitting there playing rock band the social awkwardness this guy is like a more successful version of me lol,2018-07-07
"this movie is stacked with “great in everything” guys

randall park

bobby cannavale

walton goggins

michael pena

judy greer

and of course paul rudd",2018-07-08
you mean jim from the office ,2018-07-08
wait no thats john krasinski ,2018-07-13
as a fan of comic jimmy woo i was a little disappointed by him he was hilarious but i got really excited with randall park being cast because it was a good character and a good actor and it just wound up being comic relief ,2018-07-06
kim jong un lol,2018-07-07
bobby cannavale plays his part perfectly ,2018-07-06
a few divorced couples being cool while the majority are bitter seems pretty true to form in my experience,2018-07-07
most movies are unfortunately like that nowadays thats what i love about this movie,2018-07-06
good christian values eh,2018-10-30
hopefully ghost continues that trend as well ava was awesome,2018-07-06
well i mean he was in prison because he did the good thing so its easy to relate to ,2018-07-06
"that was also kind of an annoying part of the movie that scott was just trying to get off house arrest and run a business but hank and hope wouldn’t let him and he kept on having to justify not throwing his own life away only for them to not have sympathy

scott and the others are genuinely good guys and yet were repeatedly treated like trash i’m glad it wrapped up happily but i was annoyed with hank and hope during the movie",2018-07-08
literally a life peeve how terribly we treat people that were once imprisoned i would love to write a fun happy comedy that goes a little deeper into the inconveniences of being an excon ,2018-07-09
this was also a reference to the first movie when luis says the same thing to hank at the beginning,2018-07-08
what about gunn  ,2018-08-25
unless youre eric ogrady,2018-07-10
i thought this then realized he probably designed the place using super science to be totally self contained,2018-07-08
and that probably wasnt a solid or level foundation that house is going to creak like crazy and those cracks in the wall and ceiling,2018-07-07
its pym particles i aint gotta explain  ,2018-07-08
thats exactly what i was thinking lol have fun  in a bucket ,2018-07-07
i figured he resolved the electric problem he managed to power a portable building without a grid after all but i have no idea how you solve the plumbing issue unless he shrinks the waste to tiny size and fills a tiny septic tank,2018-07-08
 in the oceanman like  intended,2018-07-07
shrink da poo poo bring giant water tanks the size of tic tacs,2018-07-11
lol im glad i was not the only one thinking this,2018-07-07
shrink that  literally ,2018-07-12
the ending was perfectly balanced,2018-07-06
like thor ragnarok  except for that whole prophecy business,2018-07-09
it’s probably the most wholesome and most bowontop ending we’ve had in a marvel movie in recent years i hated it because i knew they had to acknowledge the snap sooner or later it was just this growing sense of dread until that first postcredits scene ,2018-07-13
was the postcredit scene filmed before or after the writers of ant man knew how infinity war would end and did they have to consult the writers of avengers 4 with what they were doing in the postcredit scene ,2018-07-18
such is fate when your movie is set to take place just a couple days before infinity war ,2018-07-24
his long hair in the prison scene haha,2018-07-06
lilys lipsync was legendary,2018-07-06
if you love that check out  history basically the same thing but with  historiansactorscomedians telling true stories ,2018-07-06
"for me this is honestly the best part of both movies

i would love to see them do this in avengers iv can you imagine pena doing a scene and drax rocket dr strange and captain america participating in something like that it would be hilarious",2018-07-07
i just loved seeing lilly lipsynch ,2018-07-07
didnt know how they could top the first one but this one is was pretty  good,2018-07-07
that was easily my favorite scene in a marvel film to date ,2018-07-07
that prison scene was amazing i hope therell be a clip of that on youtube soon i need to watch it about a thousand more times xd,2018-07-07
imagine avengers 4 with his cameo explanation and you have thanos lipsyncing to penas voice one can dream,2018-07-08
i just wish there was a hawkeye cameo during that scene when he picked up scott i was kinda expecting it but no dice,2018-07-07
i think the footage may have been sped up slightly  and then the speed was further adjusted so it synced exactly right it was really good lipsyncing,2018-07-09
you could tell that not only does he love to do it everyone else loves to do it as well,2018-07-17
i really love this feature of the antman films whoever came up with it is a  genius,2018-08-22
i like to pretend that pena is playing his character from “observe  report” in the “antman” movies ,2018-07-08
its like  history but sober and really fast,2018-07-10
i love it  history does this so well,2018-07-09
the ant jamming out at the end made it a little better ,2018-07-06
the postcredits are actually what gave us hope if you listened to what was said just before he went in  look out for time vortexes  soon as i heard that i knew were going the time travel route to fix things,2018-07-06
"intro to avengers 4

antman what the  is going on

antman what happ

looks around and sees no trace

sirens in the distance

antman cassie cassie

antman cassie

paxton visibly traumatized i dont know what happened theyre just gone sobbing",2018-07-08
"what a bomb they dropped they set the tone early on to be a fun jokey film that didnt take itself too seriously and just when you forgot all about infinity war boom completely shattered everything

not to mention the ominous emergency broadcast in the background of the ant playing the drums eerie

that reveal alone brought my rating of the movie from a 710 to an 810",2018-07-08
it was a great twist but i don’t like what it implies so aliens have been actively invading earth from multiple locations for something like a full day with ’ death wheels rolling through times square and skyscrapersized siege machines in africa and all of you aren’t permanently glued to the news channel maybe even trying to help,2018-07-06
also there are only half the amount of ants now toospoiler,2018-07-06
hello darkness my old friend,2018-07-07
literally how i felt goes to show the scale of thanos effect on the universe,2018-07-08
exactly my reactions,2018-07-12
glad i didnt stick around then unlike thor ragnorok where the end credits were compelling and exciting with a riveting track going these ones were humdrum and ordinary i walked out after ninety seconds i couldnt be bothered i gave then a shot two shots three shots but alas i just could not do it glad i didnt given the thanos issue,2018-07-20
"and even walton goggins just wanted to steal it so he could sell it when his crew confronted luis and the gang they didnt hurt then at all just used truth serum and then just left them completely fine when they got what they wanted

the villains were downright wholesome in this movie compared to other mcu entries the stakes were more personal and that made it compelling",2018-07-06
i wish hank and janet were around just so we can finally have all the og avengers,2018-07-06
my favorite part of both ant mans was how small pun intended the stakes end up being at the end the first one had kind of a save the world feel for a while but the final fight was just yellowjacket in a grudge match with scott this one never had any save the world feel at all and it was all the better for it hopefully the spidey movies continue to do it similarly ,2018-07-06
just the neighborhood hero trying to stop this truck from hitting people it is a great relief  ,2018-07-06
no sky beam 010,2018-07-06
i loved the lowkeyness of the movie the stakes were small and just really focused on the hero i feel like too many of the marvel movies are too end of the world so its nice to get the small scale movies nowadays ,2018-07-07
this was my immediate takeaway infinity war was such an overwhelming experience in a good way this film was the perfect breath of fresh air after that while still having such an engaging story ,2018-07-08
i feel like ghosts plans with his daughter could have been fine like she should have told morephus what well just grab her for a bit and tell scott we are going to hurt her but obviously never hurt her at all take her to the movies or something clearly not ideal but if i was fading away into nothingness id do it ,2018-07-10
so i saw it today i felt the same way halfway in the movie im like wait is this the plot is this the bad guy not in a bad way but just because im used to something else,2018-10-08
that little girl sold the  out of that line ,2018-07-06
with hope out of the picture and scott potentially warping to the future and marvel hinting at an older cassie for avengers 4 im betting peanut is gonna partner up with her dad as the wasp,2018-07-06
that thanks man felt so adlibbed and so el ,2018-07-06
shes a lot better than most child actors,2018-07-07
it was nice seeing hope smile a few times in this movie in both movies she’s got angry face on the whole time obviously because she’s upset with her father in the first but it feels like it’s more to show how badass she is because she’s a female superhero,2018-07-06
i can not wait for young avengers like eight years from now,2018-07-06
" thanks man

ok im an idiot and was confused if she said thanks ben or thanks man because neither felt right",2018-07-07
hope’s “thanks dude” was one of the most realistic lines of dialog i’ve ever heard the way she delivered it was so normal haha ,2018-07-13
except that made zero sense luis had just caused the lab to be stolen possibly making it so hope would never see her mother again after all that hope she had gained in this movie that she would get her back but like one scene later she is just there in the van palling around with luis like whatever ya goofball p,2018-07-10
shes so serious offended even when he laughs ,2018-07-14
peanut  barf,2018-07-17
cant believe jim halpert was in this movie,2018-07-06
randall park was great,2018-07-06
he wants closeup magic lessons,2018-07-06
"so randall park was very good at what he was doing but im kind of disappointed in the direction they took that character as historically jimmy woo is an ultra cool badass hes basically chineseamerican james bond going from the fbi to shield to atlas and hes friends with a talking gorilla also he hunted godzilla thanks for the reminder wikipedia

ah well a minor quibble

edit if he were to appear in a sequel all would be forgiven if he does his dork routine in front of a gang of baddies and then quickdraw drops them all but that doesnt feel like what theyre doing",2018-07-06
who wouldnt want to get dinner with paul rudd,2018-07-06
really wanted one of the post credits scenes to be them at dinner lol,2018-07-07
"i laughed so much at woos scenes 

even thinking back on his scenes makes me laugh",2018-07-06
“do you know what’s more destructive than a nuclear bomb words”,2018-07-07
he was honestly the highlight of the movie 100 batting average,2018-07-08
"when theyre watching giantman on tv

mom concerned

stepdad concerned

cassie maniacal grin",2018-07-07
i cant say ive ever thought to myself  this kid has great comedic timing before this movie ,2018-07-06
when she told scott not to laugh at her it was legitimately heartbreaking  her line delivery was excellent,2018-07-07
i find her comparable to that girl from logan shes pretty good too,2018-07-06
im hoping the mcu sticks around long enough to see her in her own movie,2018-07-08
 check out big little lies darby camp actress is 8yearold but she keeps up with the hollywood stars in the cast ,2018-07-10
cutest kid ever,2018-08-22
dafne keen brooklynn prince and valeria cotto could run rings around her but i agree she was terrific ,2018-07-16
"thanos doesnt have anything against pymvan dyne family

he said the snap randomly kills off half the universe",2018-07-06
ghost was a refreshing antagonist because she had her motivation s and she went after them  no sudden escalation like we have seen other villas do in the mcu,2018-07-09
i’m not even sure i’d consider her a villain decent character though,2018-07-06
luis better not be snapped just saying,2018-07-06
in the next avengers movie i really hope we get a scene where luis and groot have a conversation,2018-07-06
"the morrisey jukebox thing really cracked me up 

we just really dig those melancholic ballads know what im sayin",2018-07-06
 i want every marvel movie to have a separate audio riff track of luis narrating the entire thing ,2018-10-27
and it makes a lot of sense because new york would have been too busy with squidward to deal with antmans shenanigans,2018-07-07
lombard street was a pleasant surprise especially since the geography wpier 39 works,2018-07-07
as an east bay native the idea of having a car chase down lombard st is  hilarious,2018-07-09
"the architecture of the houses hilly roads and the muir woods that happened prior to lombard street didnt give it away 

you guys need to explore the world sf is totally different vibe from ny",2018-07-07
the transamerica pyramid was my tipoff that it was in san francisco,2018-07-10
yes i dont think i really realised until the car chase i deffo spent a few city shots wondering where the avengers tower or whatever were,2018-07-19
nah theyre saving that for hawkeyes kids,2018-07-06
i honest to  thought the second scene was going to be her left totally alone after both adults got dusted glad it was just a funny scene with the eerie tone from the tv ,2018-07-06
"especially after what they did to us with tom holland honestly it wouldve been too much for us

they did an excellent job with the bait and switch here made us think wed see cassie vanish but instead traded that in for pymvandyne family honestly brilliant i think ",2018-07-06
i honestly thought the mother was going to disappear a few seconds after being saved unfortunately it didnt happen but it would have been pretty shocking ,2018-07-07
cassie will be antmans partner in avengers 4,2018-07-08
and the question mark after antman and the wasp will return,2018-07-06
the way that scene ended with the shot of the walkietalkie and scott just yelling for help was a really haunting ending after infinity war i had so many questions about how antman would join the fray and after that scene i have even more about his role in all of this,2018-07-06
the worst part is scott is in quantum realm and screaming guys,2018-07-06
"mark my words there was a reason wasp mentioned “don’t get stuck in any time vortexes otherwise we can’t save you” and scott now has a container full of “healing particles”
i bet you that he’s going to get  into a time vortex and jump to a time before “the snap” then maybe use those “healing particles” to aid a hero or key individual to prevent “the snap” from happening then bing bing bing marvel universe restored",2018-07-06
i expected some of them to get snapped but not all three of them,2018-07-06
most of my theater laughed like straight up guffawing yelling  you marvel etc it was actually kind of annoying i like seeing movies opening night but it seems to bring out all the obnoxious people ,2018-07-06
i wish it was just scott and hope who disappeared leaving behind hank and janet then we could have the real og avengers in avengers 4,2018-07-06
i guess hank is just a bunch of pym particles now,2018-07-06
perfectly balants as all things should be ,2018-07-06
question for anyone i loved the movie and i love marvel that being said the only question i have is when thanos children attack earth at the first of iw don’t you think ant man and gang would of thought hey this might not be the best time for going into the quantum realm  ,2018-07-06
i reaaaallly thought and hoped that that would have been done at the end of iw but for hawkeyes family imagine it cuts to him and his wife just tucking their kids into bed then poof its just him left perfect reason why he is in iw2 and totally heartbreaking,2018-07-06
makes me wonder how is antman gonna have a role in avengers 4 if the people that know of his whereabouts are “dead” ,2018-07-07
there was a second post credit scene what was it,2018-07-06
my theatre erupted in surprised and angry shouting was kinda nice to see a reaction like that from an audience,2018-07-07
i left after that what was the next scene ,2018-07-06
im surprised people were surprised i was surprised the actual movie didnt have more to do with the snapture its kind of comical that the avengers are currently fighting in wakanda but ant man is on a parking garage also cant be day in africa and the west coast,2018-07-06
i just got back from seeing the movie heard a kid a few seats down ask his dad if it was supposed to be a sad movie,2018-07-08
that wasnt a camera pan it was a cut a pan is a smooth motion,2018-07-07
i think there was a chekovs gun in that scene though the mention of time eddies or what ever it was could be a way to undo the snap given how much he mentioned captain america im betting we get a scene in the next avengers where scott goes back in time and meets an earlier steve rogers who will of course not recognize him ,2018-07-08
it just made me think that if you dont watch that with the assumption that everyone comes back in aif2 that ending kind of ruined the whole movie ,2018-07-10
"honestly it didnt even feel like a twist or brave or anything  just left a bad taste in my mouth at the end of an otherwise very enjoyable movie

its like  did i feel something  sure but thats like a stand up comic tickling me in the front row and then saying you laughed  it counts",2018-07-06
that first after credits scene was annoying why can’t i  just go see antman 2 instead i got avengers infinity war part 15  it was a very good standalone movie but the after credits scenes ruined it,2018-07-08
i was confused as to why she is supposedly from argentina but had the thickest british accent,2018-07-06
holy  saaaame i thought the quantum explosion made him black or something ,2018-07-06
honestly thats some really bad editingwritingdirecting the whole time ghost spewed out that horrible exposition i was like why didnt they just put this sequence in the beginning of the movie and pet us have an ah ha moment when we realize the little girl is ghost it just felt amateur,2018-07-06
 i am ashamed to admit that i was thinking to myself does he look white from the angle i was sitting,2018-07-08
yep that was me,2018-07-06
yes i was so confused for a minute in the theater,2018-07-07
here too ,2018-07-06
me too,2018-07-06
yep,2018-07-07
 ,2018-07-07
yes,2018-07-10
yeah me i thought the experiments turned him white lol,2018-07-11
"i had to look this up because i had no idea what you were talking about

ive seen him in plenty of things namely fresh off the boat but i had totally forgotten about the office i should probably rewatch that soon",2018-07-06
he also played kim jong un in the interview kraskinski is a prolific actor,2018-07-07
what,2018-07-07
loved him in detroit ,2018-07-07
good for you for not noticing race ,2018-07-29
hed be a pretty badass carnage ,2018-07-25
one of my favorite stan lee cameos for sure,2018-07-06
i didnt understand the joke ,2018-07-06
if he thought that was bad wait til he sees people disappearing around him,2018-07-06
"this happened just as i was sipping my beer and almost died of laughter with the rest of the theatre 

keep ‘em coming stan",2018-07-06
it felt super forced to me but idk maybe it’s just all the stan lee news getting to me ,2018-07-10
was that just him straightup not even playing a character anymore what the ,2018-07-10
what was that  steranko slipped me,2018-07-15
antonio banderas cause youre a badass,2018-07-06
he was so proud of it too,2018-07-07
i feel like i was the only one in my theatre that laughed at that,2018-07-14
is it just an ant pun or did it have more meaning to it as well,2018-07-17
giant man,2018-10-07
that is exactly what i heard so pumped for a4,2018-07-06
"going to be very interested to see how thats gonna play a role in captain marvel the pics for a4 confirm time travel and we see scott in his antman costume there too so

when i say play a role in captain marvel most likely will just be a post credits thing but itll still be interesting ",2018-07-06
what was the reference,2018-07-06
 everyone talking about captain marvel using the time vortex but maybe that is how captain america will “die”  go back to his time his last scene will be him walking onto the dance floor with peggy,2018-07-20
surprisingly a lot of people missed it,2018-07-09
its amazing how much you believed it was her talking through him,2018-07-06
hes just a dude playin a dude possessed by another dude chick,2018-07-06
just like anthony hopkins playing lokiasodin in ragnarok,2018-07-06
reminded me of jack black channelling a teenage girl  those scenes were great ,2018-07-06
it was so weird and i wanted it to go further and get  up that would have been award worthy,2018-07-06
when will hollywood stop giving all the best female roles to men ,2018-07-06
u mean worlds greatest grandma award,2018-07-06
shouldn’t michelle pfeiffer get the award for playing paul rudd playing antman s,2018-07-06
reminded me of that spy as beyonce in goldmember,2018-07-07
only jack black playing a teenage girl in jumanji 2 was more convincing ,2018-07-08
best actress,2018-07-18
that payoff near the end for the world’s best grandma joke was perfect i was getting all teary eyed at cassie saying she wants to be her dad’s partner and all and then right as i think she’s going to say he’s the best dad she brings back that joke perfect payoff,2018-07-06
and he briefly became a grandma while being possessed by janet ,2018-07-06
to be honest i almost expected him to kiss hank ,2018-07-06
when scott woke up and realized he was holding hands with hank was hilarious ,2018-07-06
paul rudd as scott lang is just so  perfect,2018-07-06
i immediately thought of xmen when jean is talking through xavier except this one worked better ,2018-07-06
and then it worked perfectly later with pym disguising himself as fbi lol,2018-07-06
it is the most heartwarming moment of the movie and also the most hilarious one paul rudd imitating michelle pfeiffer was note perfect ,2018-07-07
a dude play the dude whos possessed by another dude awesome,2018-07-06
i was disappointed they didnt mention the hoodies but it was nice,2018-07-06
in my head i was like “tell that to cap in winter solider”,2018-07-06
that was so hilarious ,2018-07-07
"if the people in my audience werent laughing i wouldnt have known it was meant to be funny
",2018-07-08
i really want to see more of the post snap world seeing the tvs with the alarm was a good taste of that ,2018-07-06
antman and the wasp will return,2018-07-06
i really hope most people ultimately grasp that the eerieness of the post credit scene is not undercut by the ant drumming yes there is a blatant element of humor at play but the idea of this programmed ant going through its routine while the world has gone to  is  morbid,2018-07-06
when it fades to black with just the emergency broadcast signal,2018-07-06
"just think of the nick fury after credits scene within a second billions of people disappeared millions of drivers pilots utility workers etc just disappeared as they were operating heavy machinery think of the insane amount of damage that did

sure some people may come back if the snap is reversed but what about the millions who just died people on boats who were left without a captain people on trains without a conductor people on a plane without a pilot people just walking around and had a building fall on them because something crashed into it

its going to take a lot more than the avengers just reversing the snap theyre either going for the time travel angle which id prefer they didnt or they have to acknowledge a lot of people are dead and theres nothing they can do to fix the collateral damage",2018-07-06
but then hilarious,2018-07-06
it literally comes out of nowhere it hits you as hard as it would as if it were to really happen if you had no knowledge that the fight for the fate of university was happening ,2018-07-06
"especially since it was set up as this happy cute moment in the trailers 

“oh look that ant is playing the drums” is now “oh look that ant is playing the drums and half the world is gone”",2018-07-08
"soooo being out of the country they cut the film short after credits

i’m told there were two

if you wanna throw a spoiler blackout that’s cool but i would love to know exactly what they are yt just gave a breakdown and analysis i’d prefer to just see the clips or get the breakdown either way is cool",2018-07-07
i missed it i read online that there was the mid credits scene and then that the post credits scene was just the ant drumming again what else happens,2018-07-06
 i missed it what did it show,2018-07-07
it also makes no sense why was the giant ant still playing the drums why was he still giant paul rudd shrunk him down so he could get his ankle bracelet back on and my wife pointed why even was the front door open at all,2018-07-06
it was better than the rest of the movie ,2018-07-06
am i the only one annoyed that if half the people are gone then at least one should have survived ,2018-07-06
is an ant playing the drums that eerie to you,2018-07-06
nivadellir failing to start up the first time was a literal fault in our stars,2018-07-06
somebody make this asap,2018-07-06
i thought a good one would have been scott freaking out while reading game of thrones specifically the red wedding,2018-07-06
“even at half the price i can’t afford this”,2018-07-06
watched the movie in kabuki theater and there was an audible gasp as we saw lombard get destroyed ,2018-07-08
was it just me or would the characters be in one part of the city and then cut they would be in a completely different part of the city,2018-07-08
would probably want to make a move quickly before theyre brought back in the next film,2018-07-26
"does somebody want a juice box and a cheese stick 

 do you have that",2018-07-06
i love how hank is just an irascible old  who gives no  i want to kick him in the nuts and give him a high five at the same time,2018-07-06
i kinda wish that the kids had come back in from recess and scott had to pretend to be a kid,2018-07-06
him running with that parka drenched over him was  hilarious i was dying,2018-07-06
i love how like uncoordinated they make him look lol when he normally shrinks he keeps his speed and stuff but when he was running in the sweater he honestly just looked like a 5 year old,2018-07-06
i laughed so hard when i heard that,2018-07-06
that was some guardians level humor,2018-07-06
that was my favorite part of the movie my sister and i were still laughing for a good 2 minutes after the scene had ended,2018-07-07
man that was one of the best scenes but the one thing that bugged me was that i thought in antman 1 hank basically said that they couldnt open their helmets when theyre not normal size and this movie just shat all over that rule,2018-07-06
the part where theyre making out and paul just starts riffing was hilarious i love how they use head snaps to put emphasis on penas delivery seems almost involuntary ,2018-07-06
when she pops up out of nowhere baba yaga lol that had me laughing quite a bit ,2018-07-06
the truth serum scenes where so  funny hahahahaha,2018-07-06
they need their own movie,2018-07-06
there were gasps of anticipation and whoops when the cue for luis story kicked in,2018-07-06
yooooo this man had me in stitches during the truth serum scene  ,2018-07-07
ti kills it in this role the group have such great chemistry i would definitely appreciate ti in more comedic roles,2018-07-09
michael peña seems to steal every scene in each and every movie ive seen him in i always think why isnt this guy a bigger star hes consistently excellent in everything and hilarious,2018-07-09
he should narrate infinity war,2018-07-08
like baba yaga,2018-07-09
its not truth serum,2018-07-10
" are you talking about

yes everyone was great but ti is such a bad and cringey actor that it almost counterbalanced me into not liking those scenes at the xcon headquarters",2018-07-06
i like pena but ti is really not good in these movies at all ,2018-07-07
some of the scenes  others made me want to fast forward tbh,2018-07-07
hey champ,2018-07-06
i got flashbacks to stubby ryan reynolds from dp2 ,2018-07-13
all i could think was bilbo baggins it was so good,2018-07-06
im just sad he didnt get stuck in a runaway wheelchair while he was short,2018-07-16
lily tomlin should have played a cameo in this film,2018-07-08
i was like  im a bad dad compared to him at the start but hes been locked in the house for 2 years so im sure i would have done some crazy  too,2018-07-06
i wanted a hawkeye  antman team up so bad theyre the best dads in the mcu,2018-07-07
quips are the main superpower of all marvel heroes ,2018-07-06
but he still screws up and gets his friends arrested true to his character,2018-07-07
wait till they get dr doom in the mcu if the fox deal closes hes often a quippy sarcastic  of a villain sickest burns in all of comics hes awesome  ,2018-07-08
oy stark is an awesome dad to peter,2018-08-06
i thought he may end up in the past but i guess he could go to the future first then devise the plan and he ends up at some point before iw to initiate the plan they make,2018-07-06
oh yeah hes definitely going into that time vortex i wonder how the quantum energy he has harvested will help them maybe help with bring all the snapped people back,2018-07-06
yeah that time vortexes line from janet was definitely a hint to what theyre going to try in a4 ,2018-07-06
hes gonna go giantman and be like hey cap i got this thing here it could be cool to use,2018-07-06
what if he gets stuck in there for 10 years there was a casting call for an older cassie no itd be heartbreaking if the same hung that happened to hope happens to scotts own daughter and she grows up without a father then him finally getting out and finding some way to travel back in time to fix everything including the snap,2018-07-07
"orhe jumps back to the past and gives marvell just enough of the healing particles to prolong his death they travel back to the present with carol danvers and marvell shatters the cosmic stone before dying movie ends with an aftercredits sequence of thanos and marvell walking off into the afterlife that thanos envisions in infinity war 

its a stretch i know i just really want all the marvell i can get ",2018-07-06
spoilers wasnt there a scene being filmed with captain america in his age of ultron suit along with ant man fighting crossbones maybe it was all a fever dream but i remember it being posted to rmarvelstudios,2018-07-06
holy  like that one episode of teen titans,2018-07-06
"oh boy

seriously if they find scott bakula in there",2018-07-07
spoilers but in the leaked pics they are all wearing these devices on their arms that seems like it controls the quantum realmtime travel how do you think they get those does tony invent them after he meets scott,2018-07-08
"pfeifer don go into a time vortex
rudd oh well im in a time vortex",2018-07-09
we look like us at a baseball game,2018-07-06
i was giggling like a schoolgirl while the rest of my theater was all but silent  ,2018-07-08
glad the oh and save the world thats 2b was a throwaway line,2018-07-06
i remember some lines in the trailer about how we created the ghost she could destroy the world  really interesting how they have to sell these movies a certain way,2018-07-06
thanos is plenty of a world ending event for a while,2018-07-06
" in addition to the question mark after antman and the wasp will return

my whole theater groaned in unison after the question mark appeared ",2018-07-06
oh yeah no blue beam coming from the sky,2018-07-09
"antman and the wasp will return

marvel is twisting the knife again after that thanos will return",2018-07-06
i had a what the  reaction if they had revealed the title i would have yelled,2018-07-06
as if  the thanos will return wasnt dickish enough    dammit mcu  ,2018-07-07
again just the stuff with all of these movies coming out like spiderman 2 really take the wind out of the sails of that post credit text with he question mark i know they couldn’t keep it under wraps but it really spoils the since of fear and excitement,2018-07-08
eh yeah but who really believes that antman won’t return though if this movie does alright of course disney is going to greenlight another sequel ,2018-07-07
when that end tag said thanos will return i was so ,2018-07-10
it’s both even aged up with white hair and old lady makeup she was still hot,2018-07-06
right sometimes while watching present day janet i felt like they actually added years to her face vía cgi and made her wear a grey hair wig,2018-07-06
dude lawrence fishburne was straight shocking like gotdamn,2018-07-06
i was amazed that she could find mascara in the quantum universe,2018-07-07
yea its crazy how much that technology is advancing  i think the deaged michelle pfeiffer was probably the best one yet,2018-07-06
"everytime i looked at her i kept hearing the ol word meow in my head

youll always be my catwoman mrs pfeiffer ",2018-07-06
she barely has any wrinkles its weird,2018-07-06
both the job they did on douglas and fishburne was fantastic like where the  were these guys for rogue one’s leia,2018-07-08
im more puzzled by her flawless makeup when hank finds her like did she bring eyeliner and mascara with her,2018-07-14
the quantum realm has some fantastic plastic surgeons,2018-07-07
i just remembered that she and paul rudd made a terriblelooking romcom a few years ago ,2018-07-15
time flies if you measure in marvel movies its already been 10 years since the mcu began and 5 since avengers shell probably be grown right on time for the avengers after 4 and hopefully kate bishop too,2018-07-06
" it only occured to me that cute little peanut is the same cassie stature lang from the young avengers series

",2018-07-06
tbh i got a good feeling marvel wont miss a chance to do their signature young super hero team up film young avengers could be really good ,2018-07-07
i do like the way they played him on the fence,2018-07-07
,2018-07-06
,2018-07-06
and michael dougless ,2018-08-15
nooooooooooooooo ,2018-07-06

janet staying in the quantum realm for 30 years meant that she absorbed a ton of the quantum healing energy which they were shown to be getting at the post credits scene fosters and ghosts plan was to extract it out of her but hank believed that the extraction will  her all these outcomes are just hypothesised by the cast the twist was that janet didnt just absorb the energy she got new powers from it as well the new powers was able to remedy ghosts affliction temporarily as seen that she needs more of that energy again from the post credit scenes ,2018-07-06
" the cgi deaging scenes on the other hand were really good 

michelle pfieffer was my first moviecrush seeing her in all her 1980s glory took me to a wonderful place

then paul rudd did an imitation that was so close to home i now have a really confused ",2018-07-06
" watching fights between people with powers and seeing them used creatively just scratches an itch that nothing else can for me 

is there a moment in particular that made you think of this i love those moments too but i dont recall a single one scott was stuck with a malfunctioning suit that prevented him from using his powers creatively ghost was never countered the whole movie wasp was just solid cqc and shrinking ",2018-07-06
" then not killing her allowed her to be magically fixed instantly

since basically no one knows anything about the quantum realm they didnt know that janet can heal her with powers or some  so not entirely a copout",2018-07-07
yea ghost got blasted with quantum energy when she was a child which made her go in disequilibrium so now she wants to absorb more quantum energy from janet who has absorbed quantum energy for 20 years that didnt make any sense to me ,2018-07-09
ghost wanted janet for her quantum energy janet was able to just manifest it and use it to help it’s also why scott was collecting it in the pst credits scene,2018-07-08
i lived the mystic russian music whenever baba yaga was talked about ,2018-07-11

" the villains motivations were solid but her plan was a bit underexplained somehow killing janet was going to fix her then not killing her allowed her to be magically fixed instantly a bit of a copout in writing

they did cover this a couple times  janet had been in the quantum realm for 30 years absorbing quantum energy they stated that draining the energy from janet and focusing it into ghostava should heal her if at the cost of janets life 

kind of in the way janet herself ended up healing ava in the end but with less forethought or consideration for human life",2018-07-31

it makes me so happy that were at a point where they can refer to captain america multiple times and its called completely normal my favorite part of the mcu now is the persistence of the universe,2018-07-06
" the first marvel movie in ages in which the villain doesn’t die at the end

yes infinity war was quite a long time ago indeed

",2018-07-06
so one of my favorite moments in the movie was wasps first fight with ghost ghost picks up wasp and falls through a table causing wasp to smash into a table really cool way to show off her powers,2018-07-06
"so shield was pretty messed up turning a child into an assassin 

isnt that basically exactly what the bad peoplerussia did to romanoff",2018-07-06
i really liked that the movie didnt have a real villian just a girl in pain and some idiots who were really just annoyances there was a second though were i thoughthoped that janet was going to turn out bad and destroy ghost ,2018-07-06
"they just didnt do enough with her you get her tragic backstory and just enough reason for her to be a badass

walton goggins on the other hand should have been bad as a standard villain for money however its walton goggins so its automatically great",2018-07-06
ghost was an awesome villain didn’t want to take over the world just wanted to not die and had sick powers doing it ,2018-07-06
she was solid good motivation and her distortion effects were  awesome but i felt they could have done a bit more to flesh her out,2018-07-06
"between this movie tomb raider and ready player one this movie utilize hannah johnkamens performance really well

i am so glad that her career got a boost in movie department hopefully she got bigger after killjoys is finished",2018-07-06
im really hoping we see more of her especially since it was hinted that she needs regular dosing meaning her powers presumably can return,2018-07-06
pretty sympathetic she wasn’t evil just desperate ,2018-07-06
well she was nice to look at ,2018-07-06
when you really think about it she had the best motivation out of all the phase 3 villains she didn’t want to tear apart the avengers she didn’t want to balance the universe she wanted to live,2018-07-06
i like how marvel is really humanizing their villains it makes them much more realistic its much scarier to see how someone we can relate to can do something  up,2018-07-06
the mcu has really addressed the problem of poor villains  killmonger an ghost are both somewhat  sympathetic with more complex motivations while thanos and ego are just great villains period,2018-07-06
i didnt care for her she didnt really have an established personality her costume looked kind of cheesy her motivation was fine but not especially well explored and i didnt love her fight scenes also why was she strong shes not vision who phases through density why is she so strong ,2018-07-07
i would love a standalone flick for ghost i love how they visually represented her and her being a sympathetic foil was welcomed ,2018-07-07
they could have expanded on her a little but i thought she was entertaining and was visually interesting design and fight scenes,2018-07-06
i thought her abilities were really cool her suit was dope too her character was rather whatever though ,2018-07-06
she was fantastic and her motivation was totally understandable ,2018-07-06
she wasnt a straight up villain just the antagonist she was good tho ,2018-07-07
sympathetic antagonists are always the best  ,2018-07-09
"she was taken and experimented with and the entire film she just wants to fix her body and avoid death

in what universe is that not the making of a shockingly generic villain its even worse than generic because a generic villain would have some kind of generic character arc thst brings them back to the good side or shows good in them

what movie did you watch bro",2018-07-06
i would argue that odin being dethroned and on earth led to his death and him not making sure hela stayed in the underworld and that had pretty large consequences,2018-07-08
i def think peyton reed was the best guy for this film they are both top notch ,2018-07-09
yep my very least favorite thing about it,2018-07-08
thought the same thing,2018-07-06
if they manage to get fox in time then i think a result of undoing the snap might be mutants becoming a thing either by in universe time travel retcon or as an after effect of whatever crazy thing they have to pull off to fix the damage of the snap,2018-07-06
felt like a very subtle move in that direction yeah ,2018-07-06
i did not think about that that would be a neat way to do it,2018-07-06
i thought it was more of a reference to how captain marvels powers are gonna work janet seemed like a precursor to the other cap,2018-07-07
oh my  ,2018-07-07
"the problem is that they already have mutants which everyone ignores but agents of shield in that show there was an event which basically kickstarted mutants and now basically a large population of the world has powers which got completely ignored in civil war 

edit i forgot to mention im talking about the inhumans not the show the ones that appeared first in aos",2018-07-06
scarlet witch is a mutant right she does that hand on the head glowy power like janet too,2018-07-06
could be setting up a sequel theres a story line called the red queen from the antman series its an alternate version of hope van dyne who essentially becomes obsessed with the avengers and angry at them for letting her parents die she goes crazy and tries to  the avengers so if theyre setting up for another sequel they can make janet the bad guy have her slowly devolve into a version of the red queen also int he comics wasps wings are organic its possible that the mutation shes referring to could be the incorporation of her wing tech into her body so shes an organic shrinking bee woman would make for an awesome arc for hank hope and janet,2018-07-07
yeah that scene was actually emotional as well rather than just dumb or cringey,2018-08-04
dont want to spoil the show but altered carbon on netflix did almost the same thing but acted out even better not saying paul rudd  wasnt great just that altered carbon explored the same idea even deeper ,2018-10-02

" hank pym also got few moments to bust one or two jokes and it was fun to watch him did those i like that when he joked about how is school

not just that but he suited up and got his hands a little dirty it wasnt much but my son whose favorite super hero ever is hank pyms antman was over the moon to see it",2018-07-06
good work not using embellished language literally the best review of a movie i think i’ve ever heard,2018-07-06
i would have liked to get a couple more ghost scenes and a tad more of fishburne also more walton goggins humor and more desperation from hank would have been cool,2018-07-06
"i think they didnt want to do much with the quantum realm for the sake of surprising us in avengers 4

like they want to really show what the quantum realm can do there",2018-07-06
"i liked the movie but we need to address some concerns

 the random unexplained assortment of powers that janet has and that nothing about the quantum realm got detailed was disappointing and almost insulting considering we expected to get some answers about all of this 

 scott goes from being a smart guy with an engineering degree to being the dumb comedy relief

 hopes character doesnt get the actual spotlight because we need to care about scotts sideplot of running back to his house also randall park wasnt really that interesting in his role

 walton goggins villain is generic doesnt add anything in terms of plot or character development just bogs down the pace and steals ghosts screentime which could have been used to develop her instead of shoveling exposition down our throats during the crews capture

i hope the next antman movie hits its stride and that ghost can reappear because she was quite good also that school hallway scene was the hardest ive ever laughed in a theatre",2018-07-13
i thought michelle pfeiffer was horrible in this  every scene she was in was over the top corny  they rest of the movie was good but man she really took me out of it  it was probably mostly the writing i guess,2018-07-08
i would give good money to see him do a recap of any marvel movie and have the actors mouthing along all sassy,2018-07-08
ghosts motivation was good too  it wasnt to gain more power get revenge or do something nefarious  she was just out to save her own life ,2018-07-06
i think that is part of its strength it definitely gives a unique niche in the mcu,2018-07-06

you let marvel get away with this  which is why this keeps happening",2018-07-06

yeah the maze thing in the beginning was so cute little girl is a great actress,2018-07-23
maybe not so nice in the first movie  which made his hero worship and constant hugging of scott so funny in this one since it was only at the end of ant man that he had the change of heart  bobby canavale just goes all in on his characters,2018-07-24
"i 100 knew what was coming and it still floored me  after that whole movie having just seen them there janet just got back hearing the radio go out then the piles being blown away

while marvel may use quantum realm mechanics as an excuseexplanation for any plot errors or issues it could be possible that while in the quantum realm she gained energy or power from the air or materials around her we saw her heal ghost with what is potential power she gained then in the after credit scene antman returns to the quantum realm to get healing poweror however they described the material for ghost this could be the substance that preserved or fed her for all that time or maybe there could be quantumcows and quantumwaterstreams for her to live off of maybe even quantumdisneyland to keep her entertained ¯¯,2018-07-27

"hope said something about how scotts air wouldnt last long while he was underwater which implies that they have some amount of air stored within the suit that they can breathe  

presumably the suit that was made for the quantum realm has even more air  

that leaves the question of how janet could breathe for so long but she said something about adapting and evolution or whatever so that kinda explains it  

anyway is this really what youre worried about the entire concept of antman is completely ludicrous scientifically speaking thats what suspension of disbelief is for  

as for ghosts motivation thats just self preservation i dont see what is so hard to understand

" i dont get ghosts motivation just seems like a jealous brat

if i were to push your head underwater what would you do as far as ghost was concerned pym had the means to save her life but wouldnt

as for her outlook she was used as a weapon against her will for years do you know what happens to a kid in real life if you treat them as a tool and have them commit atrocities for your own agenda it gives them mental health issues

bill foster was the closest thing she had to a real parent since she was a small child and he was bitter about how things played out between him and and hank it makes sense that she wasnt entirely empathetic towards whom she believed had betrayed the only person in the entire world who seemed to care about her

all this considered she believed in foster and was working under the assumption that their plan wouldnt be lethal

so lets go down the list

 she was frightened for her life

 given her upbringing we have no reason to believe she thinks like you or i

 she was taken under the wing by somebody who let resentment get the better of him

 she was not led to believe her actions would be lethal

her motives are probably one of the most normal things in the film which i guess isnt saying too much since its a scifi action comedy but still

"i agree that cutting down on ghost wouldve streamlined the story but in keeping with their primary focus of essentially making this a comedy caper especially of the type which features 34 groups each after each other in different ways and for different reasons her storyline contributed greatly antman and the wasp hints at callbacks to old school comedies where were introduced to different groups early on and as we approach the climax all these people are invariably brought together for hilarious results

unpopular opinion though but i believe more than ghost and burch being unnecessary laurence fishburnes foster was ultimately the expendable character his biggest role in the movie is moral policing refusing to help ghost if she kidnapped cassie and attempting to convince hank to help ghost moreover his issues with hank are suggested early on but we dont really see them come to terms with each other in a meaningful way their truce seems circumstance driven more than anything else i feel a more efficient screenplay wouldve done away with his character and incorporated his actions within the other characters

perhaps instead of giving ghost that assassin back story she couldve taken after her father and become a reclusive scientist fighting to save herself intelligence couldve been added to her list of virtues it could also have suggested that shed contemplated every possible solution before surmising that she had no alternative but to sacrifice janet

but then again every movie is better off with a laurence fishburne than without",2018-07-18

also i am glad james gunn has not been hired back not because of the whole joke scandal thing but because i genuinely believe guardians 3 will be a better movie without him guardians 1 was a success because of nicole perlmans the writer contribution to the film before gunn joined the project she spent almost two years researching the characters and the world james gunn tookover everything in volume 2 and you can clearly see how much worse the film is the character arcs have changed drax becomes a parody of himself forced jokes plot points very rushed cliched it lacked the balance vol 1 had only redeeming quality is yondu just providing some info around why vol 1 was such a success compared to vol 2",2018-10-05

i also assume that because scott was left trapped in there at the end that he will somehow interact with beings in the quantum realm on the next film he appears infinity war 2 antman 3 idk",2018-07-06
"‎am i the only one that finds bill  avas relationship a little creepy did they mention if he had a family of his own

i read it completely and convincingly as a fatherdaughter type relationship and actually thought it was handled and presented very well

‎i have to question this films logic like how the  does no one see them constantly shrinking  growing cars in broad daylight just changing size left  right

absolutely agree when they shrunk the lab for the first time just disappearing a building in broad daylight in the middle of sf i guffawed out loud at the absurdity of it when theyre trying to be incognito but obviously they just decided to run with doing that to all sorts of things all movie long

hey champ how was your day at school and you want a juice box might be my favorite lines of this movie,2018-07-07
the audience in my theater just lost it when he was going down the stairs,2018-07-07
the change in the movies score during that sequence was pretty cool too,2018-07-07

no that scene was hilarious actually they could have cut any scene with walter coggins character though,2018-07-08

without exaggeration i think shes the best child of protagonist motivator character ive ever seen dont know how else to word a character like hers  i wish i had a daughter like that,2018-07-11
yeah she was amazing the scenes between her and paul rudd were some of my favorites in the film and really will make it all the more emotionally distraught when antman reunites with her in the post snap world presumably it will be years after so cassie will be older as well,2018-07-11
crazy how many actually good child actors there are around today,2018-07-11

also with the water scene i kept thinking all the tech would get wet,2018-08-09
i really liked this review even if i dont agree with it nice job ,2018-07-31
"trailer made it look bad however just like the first one it was good but if you remove both antagonists ghost and walter goggins it doesnt change the central plot or story

i enjoyed it but after avengers iw i was hoping we might get a villain and not go back to typical marvel fanfare of using the antagonist to push the plot forward",2018-07-06
yeah pretty sure there was a city left side of the shot,2018-07-07
"it makes you highly suggestible

so its a truth serum

its not a truth serum

i also love how they made the new boyfriendhusband a good guy who does not seem to have any rivalry with scott it is a nice shake up of the very tired trope of the new boyfriendhusband being a ,2018-07-08
the family dynamic very much had the same feel as the santa clause,2018-07-08
"just so you know where you wrote there is no she is stuck in the middle the way i think you were trying to get that across would be to write it like this

there is no she is stuck in the middle

what was it,2018-07-09
think of it as a starlord relationship with your mom shes still here with you through her favorite music,2018-07-09

sorry for your loss,2018-07-09
"when scotts suit was misbehaving while they were in the school and when he shrunk down to a medium size the moment when a school teacher saw him and he escaped while wearing a lost hoodie his mask was removed but to think of it we have never seen any scenes where scott has removed his mask while being ant sized or smaller

but hank and janet were maskless in the quantum realm for quite some time how they could breathe or even survive are questions which would tear apart the entire story ",2018-07-16
the wasps dynamic in the comics with the avengers generally speaking is that of a good leader  shes good in a team environment helps push others to succeed  thats a good point about the antmanwasp dynamic  perhaps she is a strong character but lacks levity when needed,2018-07-19
i was half expecting the ant in the postcredits scene to dust away,2018-07-20
if you consider ever single event happening in the universe there are probably trillions of views of the future the 14 million views are probably the wants relevant to the fight with thanos ,2018-10-03
dont forget about zemo he managed to become one of the most dangerous villains in the mcu without powers just by careful planning,2018-12-07
you could try schindlers list,2018-07-27
rudd threw the perfect amount of fear into that line ,2018-07-06
the one true catwoman,2018-07-06
yeah if you watch strange again the out of body traveling scenes are basically the quantum realm backwards,2018-07-08
michael pena is the true hero needed to defeat thanos luis has the gift of gab,2018-07-06
judy greer and bobby cannavale were great too they all play off paul rudd so well,2018-07-06
was it really a deux ex machina it was revealed early in the movie that janet had special powers able to leave a message with scott that latter turned out to be the antenna where she controlled him then she helped hank in the quantum realm and explained how she changed and essentially has powers ,2018-07-07
right i was not prepared for that from such a funny and heartfelt movie d my heart was once again ripped to pieces,2018-07-07

i wonder how long its been since completely forgot since i see so many movies and am  to the trailers,2018-07-07

"we had one for the meg  most unfortunate naming of a movie  i expect plenty of photoshops involving family guy

edit replied to the wrong comment",2018-07-08
most likely they just arent ready off the top of my head this is the largest gap between 2 mcu entries since phase 1,2018-07-08
if michael keaton can be a hero and a villainslight less hero then all rules are off,2018-07-07
"i think paul rudd thinks that too and he shows it in almost every scene as antman where inuniverse scott just acts like an average joe  into a hero role

and it is amazing",2018-07-08
i used to think the same thing about robert downy jr now its hard not to see him as a superhero  ,2018-07-07
im just glad he is playing scott lang instead of joseph gordon levitt as they were the final two choices for the role,2018-07-08
"walter coggins was great but honestly this would have been a great time to have justin hammer get out and come back 

unfortunately i’m sure after an oscar sam rockwell’s quote is much higher ",2018-07-07
it’s funny i thought goggins turned in to a more decent villain than ghost in retrospect,2018-07-07
yeah goggins and his crew were overkill  he was great but they seemed unnecessary unless his “buyer” was someone significant to the mcu  i don’t recall ever finding out who he was working for though  who wanted pym’s lab,2018-07-07
i thought he dodged it because he had a 5050 chance,2018-07-07
nah its a chance thing everything in existance is whipped out if it was meant to be wiped out by the snap ,2018-07-08
would absolutely love this but isn’t lego or at least the lego movies owned by warner brothers they also did lego batman and other dc herovillain cameos ,2018-07-10
yes to all of this this was a  good sequel just slightly below the first imo which is totally fine since i loved the first and this one,2018-07-08
yes,2018-07-08
remindme may 3 2019,2018-07-08
but if hes stuck in the quantum realm and risks going into the vortex how is he gonna be able to help the heroes in the past since he wont have any knowledge of thanos,2018-07-09
i think the spear is just one of the wings from her suit that got stuck there after all the years in the quantum realm,2018-07-08
i mean shes the wasp in the comics janet van dyne is the wasp and hank pym is antman the idea of having them be the older previous generation antman and wasp was the movies idea,2018-07-09
i personally found it to be the funniest marvel movie so far even more hilarious than thor ragnarok i think its because this movie had such a great supporting cast,2018-07-09
interesting  i found the first one to be a lot funnier  the funniest bits in this sequel for me were related to the truth serum especially kurtdave daltmachians character  michael douglas also had a couple of good quips  but i found the first movie to be hilarious throughout  aw was sillier throughout but the humor didnt always land with me,2018-07-09
theres prolly world ending catastrophies every month in this universe stopping all activities every time theres a spaceship across the country would halt all activities indefinitely ,2018-07-10
at the end of that post credit scene they should have had the ant dissolve into dust as it finished its drum solojust to really kick the audience in the face with the feels ,2018-07-11
"




no one dies but its not like the stakes in the movie were super high either but that is a good thing",2018-07-15
but the snap was at the end of the war doesnt explain where he was during it,2018-07-14
yeah she is one of the highlights in this movie,2018-07-06
its almost her movie she carried the action and its her story basically ,2018-07-06
thank you i was trying to figure out where i have seen him before,2018-07-07
"i liked it a lot too but then im very sick of the grimdark selfserious tone of the avengers franchise and with nearly every other marvel movie trying to match that tone its great to have a movie like antman  the wasp to break up the monotony theres nothing wrong with being a fun action movie

i think the way the story rolled out was markedly less tense than the usual marvel movie in fact thinking back amw was kind of a subversion of the marvel formula in that there wasnt really a sudden escalation of danger at any point and the villain wasnt motivated by greedsociopathy

something else i  loved i could actually tell what was happening during the fight scenes and they were good really inventive and interesting to watch so many movies use that  shakycam effect anymore that id just gotten used to not being able to parse fight scenes used to them being a confusing blur of action where the cause  effect is never quite clear",2018-07-08
liked it for sure i think most people did my only real problem with it was janet just randomly having the power to heal ghost that could have been setup better,2018-07-08
that wasnt the issue at all the story and villain lacked big time,2018-07-08
i had to remind myself that its a comic book when i was watching the second guardians of the galaxy movie the scene near the beginning where rocket takes on a whole troop of bad guys was completely ridiculous ,2018-07-08
i was about to make the joke but given the username i cant tell if the typo was actually intended after all,2018-07-06
yes they will ,2018-07-07
im ron burgundy,2018-07-11
total troll  i loved it as well   the entire theater blew up in rage when it came on ,2018-07-08
i’ve noticed that both regal and amc lately have had ridiculous amount of trailers,2018-07-08
20 minutes at amc down south they showed an ancient trailer for alpha that i swear i saw 6 months ago,2018-07-08
yeah they had like 30 mins of trailers in front of the last couple movies i saw it was really annoying,2018-07-08
i had to watch both the 2d and 3d trailers for mi6,2018-07-08
just get there 20 minutes late i dont understand why more people dont do this,2018-07-08
" why are there so many trailers

because million of people see mcu movies
",2018-07-08
"i’m probably in the minority here 

but i  love the trailers ",2018-07-08
biased,2018-07-08
i forgot what did he say,2018-07-08
i laughed harder at that line than any other,2018-07-08
you might be right they just cast a 16 year old for the new cassie lang,2018-07-09
i feel like the quantum realm will be heavily involved in the 4th avengers movie so probably not,2018-07-09
it was also a meta joke as well as a drug joke since the 60s were when stan lee helped create antman,2018-07-09
i also didnt get it what did he mean ,2018-07-10
i feel ya there was a group of girls by me that kept getting up and leaving back and forth and they were on their phones the whole time,2018-07-10
yes it was mentioned by the directors in a interview that half of the animals died as well not to mention insects are the true kings of this world in number of species total number and total combined mass so if thanos wants resources to last more he should  as many arthopods as he can,2018-07-19
makes no sense why thanos would spare ants ants devour resources too,2018-07-18
since it wasnt addressed in the movie you just have to accept it as it is scifi has had that phasing through the ground issue forever and its almost never talked about same with how can an invisible person see,2018-10-05
next to cap the antman movies are my favorite standalone marvel movies i liked the sequel a lot but my only criticism was that there was not a real villain i have no qualms with ava but she was more of a tragic hero however if you have a walton goggins in your movie you should not underuse him he should have been the main villain and his character was too comical i like that the antman movies generally have a lighter tone but still they made cross a menacing figure like when he turns that guy to goo in the beginning,2018-10-21
agreed wholeheartedly she seemed to get the most development of all the characters well besides hank her character was really fleshed out this movie she did a really great job portraying these changes,2018-07-07
i liked her allot more in this movie  she seemed so cold and distant in the first one  ,2018-07-07
loved her in thehurtlocker,2018-07-07
"came her to say exactly all this 
",2018-07-13
"dude yes it was just me my pops and one other guy in the theater last night but when that happened i went oh my  and my dad memory problems went wait what whats the big deal

had to explain it to him afterwards but i rarely make big exclamations like that in movie theaters",2018-07-13
didnt he say he was working the security job from home he was the expert and his partner brought him the specs to see,2018-08-01
of all the unrealistic  that happens in the ant man movies these things are the only things you have beef with xd,2018-07-31
i just assumed his exwife was providing most of that ,2018-08-04
the sun is rising everywhere on a grateful universe,2018-07-15
was also daytime in ny in the avengers after credits,2018-07-14
good catch if wakanda is in central africa it would be 9 hours ahead of sf if the snap occurred in wakanda in the late afternoon then its already daylight early morning in sf so it could be daylight in both locations i suppose someone can analyze the lighting on the pier when scott and the pyms engaged in their quantum tunnel mission to see if it matches early morning lighting or not,2018-07-14

i dont think everyone vanished at the same time",2018-07-15
what,2018-07-07
everyone that was dusted is going to come back in avengers 4 wasp included,2018-07-07
in regards to wasp in a4  if they go to the future maybe the wasp is cassie but i think well see the dusted folks in some spirit realm so thats where we could see hope,2018-07-07
that and they wouldnt sign the accords and hand over their tech,2018-07-08
yeah basically,2018-07-08
i think they didnt want to adhere to the accords as well same as cap falcon etc,2018-07-08
sonnys buyer was probably just hammer ,2018-07-08
loved that dont laugh scene too so freaking adorable,2018-07-08
my operating theory is that he goes into a time vortex that janet mentioned in the postcredits scene  it would also explain why spoilers for avengers 4  i guess antman was photographed on set in a recreation of the battle of new york in avengers 1 apparently end,2018-07-08
if ghost is still around not too long or his ex or daughter ,2018-07-08
" i have a feeling avengers 4 might take place a few years after infinity war

id heard the casting rumours beforehand for an older cassie in a a4 so wasnt surprised,2018-07-08
pena is underused full stop,2018-07-08
haha i loved christophe becks score and that was very funny gave me video game vibes,2018-07-08
" i have a feeling luis will be the one wholl save scott then narrates how people disintegrated

luis will save scott emotionally or literally",2018-07-08
"the story reason for that would be that janet is just too nice and too quantumskilled to show herself in any interactions that arent necessary contact especially when scottie was with cassie

the technical reason would be that it would be too weird for marvel to do it in a kidfriendly family movie",2018-07-08
luis flashback stories are my favorite part of this series i wish we had more of them ,2018-07-08
pena is so  funny in both this and the first i get disappointed when he plays a nonfunny character like in the martian,2018-07-08
totally agree pena stole or tried to steal every scene he was in and his flashbacks were brilliant,2018-07-08
it certainly implies that they thought about it ,2018-07-09
didnt this movie occur well before infinity war,2018-07-09
that might make sense but i think its been established shes currently on the kree homeworld   skrull if they could get the rights in time,2018-07-09
sonny motivation was pretty clear he was looking at a billion dollar sale as quantum energy was the next big thing and it was assumed the hank and hope were working towards it or at least had the most advanced tech he could sell to his buyerinvestor ,2018-07-09
it’s bechas ,2018-07-10
isabella from sicario is a pretty amazing child actress both dazzled in their characters ,2018-07-11
yeah she was amazing cant wait to see her in other projects ,2018-07-11
its a really nice transition after watching iw you know but  that post credit scene got my whole theater like woah ,2018-07-11
b a b a y a g a,2018-07-28
i think him being in the quantum realm will factor into the avengers defeating thanos in the new avengers,2018-10-18
" one thing that i dont understand was why did they need to send scott using the machine didnt he go there and got back just using the suit in the first movie

if i remember correctly the first time scott was in the quantum realm he seemingly began losing his grasp on reality and the passage of time he had to hear cassies voice to regain focus

if the machine can pull him out then thats probably advantageous",2018-11-04
honestly if you didn’t see infinity war it needs a lot of explaining not sure why someone wouldn’t see infinity war but there are dozens of them out there ,2018-07-06
aww now i have a sad,2018-07-09

its like tom cruisehes a nutjob butwhatever hes not hurting anybodyprobably",2018-07-09
this is exactly how i feel about beck,2018-07-09
yikes what a bummer i didn’t know that he’s such a talented actor ,2018-07-09
aww man he is dead to me now ,2018-07-09
the animation is soooooo bad  in every single shot only the things actively moving have any motion at all and the rest is completely still and isolated  faces bodies everything just so  robotic and creepy,2018-07-07
i could have done without walton i was afraid it would turn out to be spiderman 3 which got ruined with too many villains ,2018-07-07
"rudd acting as scott lang impersonate janet van dyne is soooo subtle it was so funny

often actors overdo the acting to elicit laughter in this kind of situation",2018-07-08
and the music changed to suit his new size too great scene,2018-07-06
shell probably pop up again in the mcu like the winter soldier,2018-07-07
i mean can you even call her a villain  she literally was just terrified of being phased out,2018-07-07
pretty sure he got lucky his daughter might not be as lucky though,2018-07-07
i was thinking about exactly this on the drive home im thinking maybe this is why strange didnt just immediately hand over the time stone to thanos if he knew how it was all going to end i think he had to stall for time to make sure scott would be in the quantum realm during the snap ,2018-07-07
i was wondering the same thing ,2018-07-07
i would need to watch it again but i would swear i saw what looked like a city in the background of the quantum realm when they were leaving,2018-07-08

both antman and hawkeye are in avengers 4 according to concept art that leaked a few weeks agospoiler,2018-07-09
hopefully this isnt constituting a spoiler for you but its been confirmed both antman and hawkeye will be in a4 ,2018-07-09
in the comics there are whole civilizations in the microverse with textile industries and cosplay conventions ,2018-07-09
bold prediction but i think ant man will be in the post credits scene somehow  either going back in time to the 90s to warn captain marvel about thanos and she says that ill be ready whenever the event comes in the future fast forward to nick fury signaling her at the end of infinity  war or they just meet each other in the quantum realm,2018-07-09

but there are theories that it is all living beings too  those theories have some hiccups thoughwhat do we consider a living being  is bacteria a living being  if so shouldnt half the bacteria in our bodies be dusted away half the crops we have half the livestock etc leaving to orders of magnitude more deaths than the mere social collapse from dusting half the sentient populations",2018-07-11

actually in the comics there are beings that exist in the quantum realm and in the film you can see a city in the background of one of the quantum realm shots so there is likely a society that functions where she could survive,2018-07-11
i wondered that myself maybe part of her evolution was to not need food ,2018-07-11
"my line of thinking was that since the laws of physics are different in the quantum realm maybe she didnt have to eat i dont know  

",2018-07-11
"well there are quantum healing particles and stuff down there so maybe she just stayed healthy

but where did she get her cloak",2018-07-11
in addition to the food i was confused as to what they were breathing as well,2018-07-11

i think the quantum realm protected him imo look at who got snapped in infinity war and who didnt original avengers all good every one else straight snapped,2018-07-09
probably as its sort of a different dimensionkinda,2018-07-09
the quantum realm protected him the gauntlet only works in the universe it’s in so if scott was in the quantum realm it’s a different universe and time space,2018-07-09
he did have radio contact with them still if that means anything ,2018-07-09
id assume he was just a randomly chosen survivor seems like hes written out of the next one based on how it ended dont know whod get him out or even know about him,2018-07-09
we already know time and space are wonky in the quantum realm  seems totally plausible that sustenance wouldnt be required when youre that tiny,2018-07-09

there were like 10 adults in my theater who did that,2018-07-18
i said oh ,2018-07-23
i just watched it and this one black couple yelled  naw in unison,2018-07-28
everyone else went on the run as fugitives clint and scott both took a plea deal to be put on house arrest in exchange for having their families be left alone by the whole situation  it was explained in infinity war,2018-07-19
he went to germany to help captain america steal a aircraft in order for them to reach siberia in time to stop the new winter soldiers which in the end were already dead thanks to iron man and his team invervening only cap and bucky manage to reach siberia with the rest of caps team being arrested in the end of the movie cap saved them with scott and clint hawkeye likely making a deal with the government in order to remain with their families why did the government agree no idea but this is what happened so yeah,2018-07-19

i enjoyed it more after that scene honestly felt like there was something on the line now,2018-07-06
but will she be stature or stinger,2018-07-06
it kind of felt like a movie without a true villain which was kind of refreshing ,2018-07-08
i mean she was kinda ‘evil’ towards the end she was willing to kidnap scott’s daughter and perhaps  janet if need be,2018-07-08
"this is the most shill sounding post i ever read

very solid

who hurt you lol to be honest though it would’ve been a bit more fitting than the ant playing drums at the end it was a bit odd ending that scene with joke considering what just happened to the world,2018-07-06
this is brutal and wouldnt fit the mcu i loved the dichotomy of the ant playing drums  as it was programmed to do as it will continue to do until someone stops it  against the backdrop of a world changing apocalyptic event its funny and jarring and makes you think,2018-07-06
probably my favorite scenes,2018-07-06
i felt some parts were influenced by the car chase scene in matrix reloaded ,2018-07-06
except the black market guy,2018-07-06
ghost threatening to foster to use scotts kid against him with torturey undertones wasnt really nice though,2018-07-07
i wasnt expecting it to be the pymvan dyne crowd this whole time i figured cassie was going to be getting the dust treatment and that would be what gets scott in the next movie,2018-07-06
small scale,2018-07-06
i think those were his baths ,2018-07-06
next time we see him he should get his own suit like not even a suit with powers yknow just a suit would be great like it doesnt even have to be anything fancy yknow,2018-07-06

scott at least could have done something",2018-07-07
"hank being a  is on purpose in the comics hes the avenger everyone pretends to like but cant stand theres an infamous issue where he hits janet which i assume was the inspiration behind bill fosters she was the only one who could endure speech

thankfully they toned him down a bit for the movie ",2018-07-06
"  is hank kind of a 

this is very accurate to if not downplaying most peoples opinion of him in the comics both inuniverse and by readers",2018-07-06
ever read the comics he was more than “kind of a ” there especially in earlier days ,2018-07-06
" the postcredits scene was kind of a weird place to leave off on and im wondering how theyre gonna explain it in the next avengers

time vortex was the key phrase in the aftercredits scene",2018-07-07
i think that the post credit scene might tie into captain marvel she didn’t come to fight thanos and even if she was far away from earth she probably would have heard about him collecting the stones i’m guessing that she is also stuck in the quantum realm and that her and antman will team up to escape in avengers 4,2018-07-07
that’s one of the things i really liked there wasn’t much down time in the movie when there was it moved the plot well imo ,2018-07-06
that hit me as i was leaving the theater seems like every movie has a point where i want them to move a little faster and get where theyre going but amtw was just perfectly paced ,2018-07-06
"there was certainly a lot more going on in this movie out side of scott and hank like in the first movie it felt pretty chaotic where as the first movie felt more like a superheromarvel checklist movie which some people had a problem with


this movie took the best parts of the first movie expanded upon them added antmanwasp dynamic duo and took some small risks which made this movie good for me i had more fun in this than black panther",2018-07-07
wasnt she dusted,2018-07-07
no doubt when i saw him on screen i was thinking that they must have something fun in store for him but the role he played could have been pretty much given to anyone hopefully tarantino will be making good use of him once more with his next one,2018-07-08
"  his villain fell flat and was totally unnecessary

he wasnt really a villain more he was just there to have henchman for antman and wasp to fight",2018-07-08

the russo brothers twitter confirmed that he survived by luck,2018-07-12
thats a fetish ,2018-07-16
i wouldnt say i felt turned on but i did feel like that scene was awfully  there hope was fidgeting with his regulator which they even draw attention to how close that is to the nether regions with a joke implying that scotts balls got shocked when she was trying to reconnect the electronic components and then when he returns to regular size theyre both noticeably breathing heavily and giving each other googly eyes plus you know size play is a real fetish and a brief foray into fan art concerning these two characters well usually the original antman and wasp but still demonstrates its something the fandom is well aware of i dont know might all be a coincidence and the scene was just a lot more sexually charged than they intended it to be but it all felt pretty deliberate,2018-07-17
in the midcredits scene janet van dyne says something to scott about not getting trapped in a time vortex while in the quantum realm it sounds like a throwaway line but im about 90 sure that scott will use one of these time vortexes to travel back to 2012 and the battle of new york where  warn the original avengers about thanos ,2018-07-18
that is if she didnt go poof,2018-07-16
really hope it isnt a time skip more than irl time it would just be weird seeing the movies represent what they think will be instead of what is,2018-07-17
the bulk of this movie takes place weeks if not months before the events of iw after hank recovers janet from the quantum realm the pyms and scott build a new quantum tunnel small enough to fit in a van how long did it take them to build that new tunnel  days weeks thats not directly addressed in the movie but it certainly wasnt built in a single afternoon so some time lapsed between this movie and iw when the attack on wakanda occurred its doubtful anyone in the outside world was aware of what was happening not until the snap itself,2018-07-17
yup but it was fake on the show,2018-07-18
its a real world reference also,2018-07-23
pure destruction  she didn’t do much disarm it as fly through the inner workings,2018-09-10
some people said this movie has no tiein to infinity war so that part surprised me,2018-07-07
" awesome fight and action sequences 

my only complain was most the action stuff was shown in the trailerscommercials giant man in the water would have been cool if iaudience didnt know it was coming or wasp running along the knife as it was in the air
",2018-07-07
its a  cartoon and i love it,2018-07-12
so creepy complete silence except for the emergency alert ,2018-07-06
i was happy that it was lighthearted after the depressing ending to avengers and then come the post credits scenes choo choo here comes the sad train again ’,2018-07-06
maybe she did wasnt too long before thanos snapped his fingers,2018-07-08
protip never come to these discussion threads looking for positivity,2018-07-13
whats the stinger,2018-07-13
her return may come sooner than you think based on janet healing her she owes everything to her but who knows how long shes actually cured of her conditon in the mid credits scene we see scott gathering healing particles to help ghost but he never makes it out of the quantum realm so i foresee ghost helping scott in avengers 4 to save the family,2018-07-07
yeah theres like a 125 chance of that happening,2018-07-06
,2018-07-06
it just kind of felt off tho in a lot of marvel movies the stan lee cameo feels smooth and works with the current situation example stan lee cameo in homecoming i personally felt like this cameo was just off putting and dragged me out of the movie,2018-07-06
"in the last scene in the quantum realm before they get into the quantum sub when the camera pans out you can catch a glimpse of a yellowish city

in the comics the quantum realm is called the microverse and entire civlisations exist there presumably the same is true in the mcu so janet probably got help there",2018-07-07
the makeup was ridiculous,2018-07-07
shes far below the subatomic level shes below the level where food water dirt etc even exist so shed have no need for those things i dont think we know if she is unstable or perhaps was and was able to work through it over that time,2018-07-07
i feel like shell be in iw2,2018-07-07
scott may be on parole but the rest of the ant man crew are fugitives of the law probably not much time to watch the news or have an active smartphone that can be traced  ,2018-07-07
all they know is that the avengers fought maw and the spaceship left i assume the news team werent covering wakanda,2018-07-07
the black order only attacked where there were infinity gems so they would not be in san francisco im kind of assuming the events of iw take place in the time after janet is rescued and when the midcredit scene takes place they obviously needed time to build the new quantum tunnel,2018-07-07
the ship stuff was dumb i agree but wakanda is still a semi secret country so it makes sense that no one would know about that ,2018-07-07
remember that the entire iw movie takes place over a very short period of time a day or so,2018-07-07
i loved it the whole theater shrieked when it happened two girls next to me started crying it reminded us that not everything was well and good in the mcu ,2018-07-07
awwww that scene ,2018-07-07
youre right time is not a thing down there the countdown clock is for the surface world or whatever they call the regular sized world so hank knows how much time they had before they lost janets signal,2018-07-07

"yes

 i saw that and mouthed what the fuuu in the theater i was wondering why nobody else seemed to mention it online and i couldnt find anything about quantum realm city on google it seems like thats gonna be a big  deal in the next movie i mean hopes mom had that staff and gear that she must have gotten inside the quantum realm so there must be an entire civilization

also how is nobody calling the wasp ant maam  ",2018-07-07
glad i wasnt the only one who noticed that there are a few off shoot comments that make me curious  like the time vortex thing at the end of the movie,2018-07-07
"the ship hank was in was gonna back out at full size so they needed the building back to regular size also hank was already in the quantum realm when they shrunk the building again so it didnt affect him

the spear was made from her wings i believe,2018-07-10
it looked like a makeshift weapon either cobbled together from her armor or a piece of the trippy landscape ,2018-07-10
ok i get the weapon but how did she eat water where did she go  how did she survive the quantum realm if you’re at that size so you need to sustain your human flesh when she came back would she be starving bc she hadn’t eaten anything in 30 years,2018-07-10
pretty sure her suit had 1 wing still attached i assumed the spear was made from the other wing,2018-07-10

i liked that bill came in as a foster parent for her he really doesnt need to help her but he knew that girl didnt deserve this and tried to do right by her for no reward the scene where she hugs him at the end is extra touching because he really doesnt need to stay he fulfilled his promise but he chooses to stay whereas the biological dad him staying would seem more expected,2018-07-07
and then laurence fishburn and michelle pfeiffer do it,2018-07-07
they saved elementary sized scott for us isn’t that enough ,2018-07-09
yes hank is another form of henry like  and richard or bob and robert,2018-07-22
i think ive figured it out you know how scott gets really tired when he grows too big presumably thats because of increased metabolism and energy consumption well the converse happens when you shrink  your energy consumption goes down so janet would have had enough energy in her regular human form to sustain her quantum size for years if not millenia now i dont know where the energy is stored but i thought it was a neat explanation just my theory,2018-07-06

"a marvel mutant is typically someone specifically linked to having the x gene and involving a person evolving through naturally aging janet is implied to have changed due to exposure to the quantum realm so to me thats not really any different than bruce banner evolving from exposure to gamma radiation or anything like that

hed go huhthats weird hope the avengers are ok and he would just go back to his life a day or 2 later the wakanda battle would be happening but antman would have no idea about it or the significance to the universe ",2018-07-17
he never shrunk an existing building instead he build a scale model increased its size had the equipment brought inside and ordered his ants to attach everything to wallfloor a real building wouldnt have a handle to carry it around like luggage,2018-07-06
did you not see the giant duracell battery,2018-07-06

internal plumbing and lots of generators,2018-07-06
if they shrink to ant size the lab would be like a piece of sand still way bigger than an atom,2018-07-06
the lab was shrunken ro like 110000 its original size it would need to shrink like a million more times to go to subatomic size it was probably the size of a mint in the car and the equipment maybe a few grains of sand,2018-07-06
i do feel goggins was wasted thoughhe did great in his role as always it seems but like with tomb raider the character just wasnt given much,2018-07-07
it was weird in general because that was also the clip that pym saw when he was checking in on the ant decoy for scott it just felt like why did i wait five extra minutes to watch this again great movie overall i just thought that last scene was pointless,2018-07-07
do you really have that,2018-07-07
and a string cheese,2018-07-07
what did you do,2018-07-07
the quantum realm is a new universe theres a lot we dont understand and i dont think its that simple she said she has changed a lot in there it could have been 300 years for all we know im sure we will find out more about it evantually ,2018-07-07
your last sentence is interesting is someone supposed to forget to speak a language after not speaking it for a period of time,2018-07-07
"it’s complicated

the main antman and the wasp in marvel comics is hank pym and janet van dyne hank was a scientist and so was janet’s father vernon van dyne they knew each other and when he was killed janet convinced hank to help her become a superhero so that she could avenge her father’s death 

they then went on to found the avengers janet instantly fit in and held her own while hank was suffering from mental illness and he constantly felt he was lesser than the rest of the team it didn’t help that janet used to use her relationships with the other members to get his attention 

anyway hank and janet did get married eventually they broke up and divorced they’ve been off and on through the years they don’t have any actual children together in the comics so hope doesn’t really exist there’s was a story that took place in an alternate universe where they have a child named hope so that’s where the name comes from but otherwise she doesn’t exist ",2018-07-07

no one he’s going to jump into one of those time vortexes janet told him to stay out of and it will spit him out in another time ,2018-07-08
i would guess ghost and laurence fishburne since she needed what they were gathering and fishburnes character could probably figure out what to do ,2018-07-08
i feel the need to point out how dumb that setup was scott should have been in control of shrinking and enlarging for precisely the reason shown in the movie ,2018-07-08
that works as a nice mirror to the pym fatherdaughtermissingmother storyline theyve got running through the two films,2018-07-08
i would love to hear candidate in captain marvel ,2018-07-08
"new york happened in about 15 minutes tops and as far as they know the only thing that probably really hit the news is the fact that an attack happened and that stark is missing something i dont think scott or the pyms care too much about

scotland seems to have totally gone under the radar and i doubt anyone knew what was going down in wakanda since even nick fury only found out just before the snap

theyre also in another state and were pretty much constantly on the run though we dont know the time between the ending of this movie and the snap  even during the post credits scene i believe the pyms are still technically on the run since they were never caught in the first place and scott is on probation so theyve probably been laying low while working on their quantum tech to help out ghost  

scotts only links to the avengers falcon nat and cap were also on the run themselves and they were pretty much busy and constantly on the move so when nat brought up that he was on house arrest that was pretty much that  neither side really had the time",2018-07-08
ive seen this pointed out a lot but what were scott and the bunch supposed to do really  the thing in nyc happened really quickly with scott under house arrest on the opposite side of the country and info about the stuff going on in wakanda wouldntve been spread quickly at all  ,2018-07-08

2 the ship was using the quantum bridge i dont think it had new and improved tech that let you safely move to and from the realm without the help of the bridge if it was that easy to get around they wouldnt have needed the quantum bridge in the first place",2018-07-09

ghost had to be at least a little insane  she was basically being tortured physically nearconstantly while she was awake,2018-07-08
" ghosts motivations werent terrible but her blaming pym for her dads death seemed like a stretch

ghost was a little girl who loved and idolized her father  she was raised by a man who hated hank pym  given the choice of blaming her father for her situation or blaming a man she only knows of through someone constantly badmouthing him which do you think shed pick

 ghosts costume just rubbed me the wrong way it looked cheap and really uninspired

its fairly faithful to ghosts costume in the comics so make of that what you will",2018-07-08
"yeah the suit looked super cheap it looked like a snap together basic painted 3d printer job when she takes it off at her apartment it’s super noticeable

did you see the after credits scene  the serious tone is still there ,2018-07-08
"from the interior of hanks building it doesnt look like a real building it looked like hank built it in miniature then enlarged it as needed some of the pieces inside looked like enlarged objects such as the padlock on the wall so its not a shrunken fullsize building but an enlarged miniature if that makes any sense the house he set up on the beach also looked like it was made in miniature   


a normal building wouldnt work very well without a foundation under it so the way these buildings could be enlarged and not crumble makes me think he engineered and built them as selfcontained models that could be dropped anywhere and enlarged",2018-07-18
the fbi gets a tip that hes at the university and go check that out but they dont think to check the house where he lives lol okay movie,2018-08-12
burch was there to provide thugs for the big action sequences cause otherwise it would have just been ghost  they also used him to involve more characters in the film and move parts of the plot along,2018-08-11
honestly that felt a bit weird to me to but it seems like she wasnt cured permanently ,2018-08-17
what i really didnt like about ghosts introduction was how everything was explained in a bluntly expository manner all her cards were laid on the table in one shot and there were no more cards left for the rest of the movie ,2018-10-16
i agree and the mom plot or house arrest or ghost plot didnt raise the stakes high enough overall it felt like a side story with no real danger its an okay movie imo ratings should be toned down a little,2018-10-06
"i also noticed the lack of blood and injuries more than usual without consequences it all just feels wrong and nonsensical

exactly this ,2018-07-07

true but most movies would be boring if there were no conflict lol,2018-07-07

shes clearly been changed and seems like shes seen some  so hopefully it gets fleshed out ,2018-07-07
im gonna assume theyve explained it perfectly in the comics but didnt have enough time to go further into it,2018-07-07
yeah how bout the clothes she was wearing ,2018-07-07
they might dig deeper later she had stuff with her that doesnt look like the stuff she went in with so im guessing shes been through some  and wasnt just floating around for 30 years,2018-07-07

me too i was a bit confused,2018-07-06
ava definitely looks mixed race though,2018-07-07
i thought they were gonna dust the ant too,2018-07-06
yeah i think that is the thing it is not about the plot in some cases as much as it is about seeing the characters develop a good balance of both types is what makes the mcu so appealing to me ,2018-07-06
oyster smiled,2018-07-06
its literally plot armor,2018-07-06
do we have a count i mean 50 is kind ofa lot ,2018-07-06
yeah clearly more than half of the heroes were dusted there must be entire cities  completely unaffected and entire towns being dust,2018-07-06
oh  shes going to be able to communicate with him from within the soul stone antman really is the key in all of this ,2018-07-06
she told him to look out for the time vortexes foreshadowing to him using those somehow in a4 or maybe a teaser in captain marvel of him time traveling ,2018-07-06
i’m pretty sure that the new york invasion happened along side the events or directly after ant man and wasp,2018-07-06
i dont think it had anything to do with it just the same 5050 chance,2018-07-06
it’s either that or he was part of the half that didn’t turn to dust after the snap,2018-07-06
yeah i think so it seems quantum realm isnt affected by the snap or anything,2018-07-06
im remembering that they specify the universe in iw id think that the quantum realm is technically outside of this universe,2018-07-06

eric wareheim in antman 3 ,2018-07-07
yes,2018-07-07
so thats who kept calling her,2018-07-08
sogoing in their earandgrowing to normal size,2018-07-08
that would have made it a rated r movie,2018-07-09
ya i noticed that,2018-07-09
dr strange said it was the only way implying some odd time space thing ,2018-07-09
avengers 4 has already been filmed most contracts expire after that movie rdj is done scarlet johansson is done thor is done samuel jackson is done jeremy renner is done chris evans is done though he’s asking for an extension don cheadle is done basically everyone who didn’t die in the last avengers has their contract ending marvel plans to recast roles but the end of avengers 4 will give them a break ,2018-07-09
they are all gonna be brought back in avengers 4 next year ,2018-07-09
they already had a quantum tunnel built so they probably just shrank the one they had and revised the supporting tech a little bit,2018-07-09
"so after really thinking about it the fight in new york last what like an hour or two tops then the rest is on titan or in wakanda and well the beginning in europe

scott isnt an avenger scott has no way of contacting the avengers and he is under house arrest the snap happens in wakanda",2018-07-09
"we can probably assume that theyd ground the flights with the giant space ship in new york they probably wouldnt pick up scott because of the urgency of the infinity stones vision is a priority theyd use a quinjet to get around and not really be impacted by faa this leaves scott with two options to get to new york from san francisco car or bus and train

that car ride will at best take 43 hours the bus and train combination is three days the car mind you is 43 hours straight through no stops either way puts him impossible to reach the avengers hq in time hed get at the avengers hq and itd be empty af this also means he cannot physically get to wakanda ",2018-07-10
because theyre affordable,2018-07-10
im noticing car product placement a lot more in the mcu as of late there was that toyotalexus car chase in black panther and now weve got two brand new hyundais in antman,2018-07-10
same with michelle pfeiffer that white gold,2018-07-11
interesting i just saw it and i rank it as my favourite one almost on par with infinity war ,2018-07-12
and then a midcredit scene of wongstrange watching the magic website,2018-07-08
"that would be a surefire big laugh

somebody get the russos,2018-07-08
freckles has been bae for the past 15 years dude,2018-07-06
can you spoil what happened to me i probably wont watch it but wanna know about the post credit scene ,2018-07-06
i can actually see cheryl tunt saying this,2018-07-09
well shes in the title can she really steal a night thats already hers,2018-07-06
haha that was a secret,2018-07-07
ghost was used by shield no ,2018-08-03
imagine starting a song of ice and fire 20 years ago,2018-07-06
"1 they said that time and energy dont work the same in the quantum realm safe to assume that janet either saw herself age extremely rapidly or found herself requiring much less sustenance as a result we saw scott get extremely exhausted when he was extremely big  maybe its the opposite when you get extremely small

2 i agree but to mitigate this i just assume the entire movie is from scotts point of view they start spewing science i just nod my head like yup makes sense

3 ghost didnt have a normal childhood  saw her parents die and to double down now her entire existence is pain and phasing bill did his best but the only raw connection he had with her was being the first one to acknowledge and attempt to help fast forward ten years or whatever to now and you know youre going to die if you dont get a theorized treatment  yeah id be irrational  only one person in the world cares about me so why should i care about anyone but that one person",2018-07-07
my cousin thought it was a trailer,2018-07-07
it started pretty abruptly i thought,2018-07-07
yeah i was confused i thought that it was apart of the trailers,2018-07-08
i really hope they get him a suit with no powers,2018-07-09
yeah i love when he does those ,2018-07-09
thankfully wasp is in infinity war part 2,2018-07-11
or not having any food or water that would be the bigger question its not like she was frozen in time she clearly aged and aged well,2018-07-11

i love quality time realm i got a pretty good laugh,2018-07-06
i thought about that too like did her and luke go to the same seamstress but seriously though i think it just adds to an affect rather then her showing up in her old uniform,2018-07-06
"in the last scene in the quantum realm when the camera pans out you can see a glimpse of a yellow looking city 

in the comics the qr is called the μverse and there are greenish humanoids living there among other things janet presumably got some help from there",2018-07-07
again tim had to have paid money to get this role money that could have been spent on the show so that we could have ditched the germ assassin nonsense real film experts would agree with me on this one we’re going to have to disagree to agree that this movie is a five bagger,2018-07-06
thought it was john wick ,2018-07-06
i agree i like the misdirection parallel i hadnt even thought of that ,2018-07-06
maybe she did she had a weapon and a poncho,2018-07-06
also under house arrest he got the same deal as scott,2018-07-06
retired for good to be with his familyuntil they dust on him and motivate him to come back,2018-07-06
playing tag ,2018-07-06
key word in there was the time vortex  timey wimey  coming in a4 for sure,2018-07-07
i too thought it was a trailer for a moment,2018-07-07
hahahahaha ,2018-07-07
or just a failsafe counter on the computer they know they have to pull him out they have a reasonable amount of time it should take safety would dictate some precautionary device to automatically pull him out in the event they jumped or something happen to them,2018-07-07
"yeah i feel like its just going to be one of those mcu offscreen things like scott will probably meet up with tony like i have a time machine in a van these are the same people that never explained onscreen how thor got back to earth in avengers 1 outside of some vague allusion to odin using magic so i dont think its a big deal clearly the only reason they had scott using the quantum generator in that scene instead of them being at the dinner table or something is to show you theyll use it in a4 
",2018-07-07
just curious what are the other 7,2018-07-07
nah janet mentioned something along the lines of like time travel  in there i think hes just gonna jump back in time and somehow and fix everything maybe even go in the future they had pics of the avengers in their original outfits and they casted an older version of antmans daughter,2018-07-07
black panther did too with the un conference ,2018-07-08
which ruined it it would have been such a great little sight gag after a jarring midcredit scene like how in spiderman homecoming the captain america psa was such a great laugh after seeing vulture in jail but then again it might have not worked given the funny end credit scene in last thor movie didnt work after the midcredit scene of thanos ship reveal perhaps they should have just dropped the end credit scene and had the midcredit scene as the end credit scene like they did with infinity war ,2018-07-08
i feel pretty much exactly the same i liked the movie a lot my mom will probably absolutely love it also perhaps exactly the right movie to come out after iw,2018-07-09
hank pym was in it,2018-07-09
"working backwards

infinity war duh

black panther bucky

thor ragnarok hulk

spiderman homecoming iron man

doctor strange thor not sure if it counts its just a postcredits scene that ended up being a scene from ragnarok

civil war duh

antman falcon

age of ultron duh

guardians of the galaxy probably the last standalone without a crossover",2018-07-09
"what the heck definitely not most of the movies in phase 1 were standalone with many after that with no other appearances from other heroes

 iron man
 the incredible hulk
 captain america the first avenger
 iron man 3

 black panther

",2018-07-09
guardians vol 2 didnt have one in it ,2018-07-10
i think abby is done with the cassie role for now they have that emma girl cast as her for a4 though so i guess she could be in it too if its present and future and i guess it depends when future antman movise take place,2018-07-09
im guessing most of the movie isnt happening at exactly the same time as iw  maybe just a few days earlier and then the after credits scene is when it matches up to iw ,2018-07-31
well all of infinity war happens in like 1 day and the endcredits scene is clearly set in the future compared to the rest of the film and it seems like they were preoccupied with testing their quantum technology so they probably werent looking at the news,2018-12-05
plenty what,2018-10-30
i feel like the plot repeated itself a bit too much get the lab like widow said once the genie is out of that bottle this movie was very clearly set up to introduce some new elements into the mcu that are much needed later but not to be the standout film itself like spiderman or black panther in that aspect it holds up in my eyes whilst indeed it will never be looked upon as the greatest ,2018-10-03
"i really dont think that its fair to describe the desire to survive and to live painlessly as childish  

pretty sure that most adults want that too  

i kinda hate the i dont care if i make people suffer because i myself suffered a lot i dont know why but it feels pretty cheap  

its not like she actively desired to torture them she wasnt a  she was just selfish and in selfpreservation mode  ",2018-10-11
"a tunnel lets you safely go back and forth to the quantim realm

scott has connections because she saw him before and they were both at the edge of the realm 

the original wasp has healing powers because she was in the quantum realm for 30 years and it changed her molecular structure

the growing discs are more dangerous and if you actually watched the movie the only way they could locate her was with the tunnel

shrinking the building smaller is a good point

janet wont always be there to heal ghost if they collected enough of it ghost would be able to do it herself",2018-07-07
" how did scott have connections with the original wasp what was that antenna she mentioned how was she controlling him

the answer is a little bs and marvel movie magic there is something called quantum entanglement and it is believed you can connect two atoms so if you moved one or froze it or enacted force on one it would effect the other so think of this as having a ball in one room and you bounce it and the other starts to bounce in the other room or even across all of space so they have a one liner that says scot and wasp 10 had their minds quantum entangled from when he was small together it is a big or marvel magic but its based on that principle

    ",2018-07-07
for the last question i could see it being a temporary fix the problem is that would make hanks psychadelic mind wanderings something that can only be temporary fixed too right but i guess its fine because you can just get healing quantum energy whenever you want,2018-07-07
i assume the tunnel and ship was so they could easily locate and navigate to janets position after all the quantum realm maybe effectively infinite i also further assume that unshrinking would return you to the same place you shrank which in janets case would be the middle of the ocean,2018-07-07
i agree theres a lot of aspects that were used but not explained also how did he get the trackers on again he said he slept for 5 days after civil war but was fine after a minute after growing to a bigger size and his regulator seemingly doesnt work but works when its convenient,2018-07-07
if im not mistaken steve rodgers briefly explained in iw during the first meet with iron patriot and bruce that scott and hawkeye got a plea deal to be under house arrest to be with their family ,2018-07-07
the stepdad bucked that trend in the first one i thought ,2018-07-07
" the movie could have used a bit more wasp action what we got was fantastic i just wanted more

interesting i thought she got tons of action and you could almost call the movie the wasp  antman which i liked",2018-07-07
my guess is they were so focused on making the smaller quantum portal that they wouldnt have seen a tv or anything that could tell them the news,2018-07-08
"but what were they supposed to do

the attack on ny happened in a few minutes and then they were gone meanwhile antman happened in san francisco

remember hank pym dont want anything to do with the avengers or tony stark",2018-07-08
keep in mind that lang had just got back into the good graces with hope and hank after running off to meddle in tbe avengers affairs i doubt hed run off to do the same thing again especially when the attack seemed to be contained already most of the serious fighting was going down in wakanda and on titan ,2018-07-08
it’s actually confirmed on agents of shield that it is a huge deal in the news breaking on tv so yeah that’s a bit of a flaw,2018-07-08
thank you i was thinking of this too reminds me of what happed in guardians 2  the giant purple thing came out in missouri and it wasnt talked about in civil war or any thing like that  i feel like it would be a pretty big headline  maybe disney needs to think more before trying to sell toys and mediocre movies,2018-07-08
yeah and i cant believe hes almost 50 he looks so young ,2018-07-09
yeah i knew it had to be coming but didnt expect it to be all three of them it was depressing when it cut back to them and just dust,2018-07-16

you needed the comic relief otherwise the question mark would have been too much fake people out with humor so they let their guard down then knife them in the heart ,2018-07-06
i want to agree but i really dont think i would have been able to handle all the emptiness or even just cassie walking around to me it needed the drumming ant cause just thinking about the emergency signal in the empty house gives me crazy chills,2018-07-06
well to be fair no one would be in his house right cassie would be with mom and moms bfhusband but yes i thought it would be their house and cassie would be alone ,2018-07-06
the timing is unknown the film proper could have ended a year before iw for all we know and only the post credit scene lines up with it ,2018-07-06
"alien spaceship sets down in new york city yea what else is new

also the attack on wakanda started only a few minutes before thanos showed up for the snap it felt longer in the movie because they kept cutting back to titan and the other plotlines people just didnt have time to react to the alien invasion before they had to react to everyone turning to dust

take the postcredit scene in iw for example maria hill says multiple bogies the outrider ships just touched down in wakanda just moments before her and nick turn to dust",2018-07-06
"its not really a huge alien invasion

there was a small incident from the beginning of infinity war and then the wakanda battle which wouldve been happening at the same time as the midcredits scene it makes believable sense that they wouldnt know or care too much about anything infinity warrelated",2018-07-06
"the ship in ny was kind of dealt with rather quickly if i recall so much so that spidey got stranded in space

we also have little to go on in terms of timepassage

wakanda is also still very much and unknown publically so that attack could have gone largely unnoticed

i think we have to assume the set up the pyms did took a while on that rooftop  and they werent really tuned into cnn or anything ",2018-07-06
i got the biggest hunch during the movie that she is not that sane or at least is harbouring some plans of her own,2018-07-06
did you not see the massive batteries in the background,2018-07-06
she talks about it when hank rescues her “evolution and adaptation” i believe the movie wants you to infer that the “quantum healing” and her becoming one with the quantum realm allowed her to survive and overcome those things ,2018-07-06
something to do with the quantum realm i think,2018-07-06
i think not giving antman one of the blue discs when going into the quantum realm is a bit of an obvious plothole but ill wait to see how they explain it because theres no way they didnt think of that,2018-07-06
"i dont know if this is it but i have no idea why ghost and bill specifically need janet for quantum energy if they can open up something to the quantum realm at all

likecant they just find another way cant they potentially put ghost into the quantum realm to fix her",2018-07-06
over precautions maybe it seems like a lot of people wanted to know where they were probably more than just the government and scotts place would be the most likely for her to show up  ,2018-07-06
they are in hiding so she’s hiding ,2018-07-06
"how did michelle pfieffer find eye shadow in the quantum realm for 30 years

still a great movie tho",2018-07-06
i think that hank pym said something about that in the first film something along the lines of the rules for time and space are completely different in the quantum realm vs in our realm so maybe time passes differently there that what was 30 years for hank was just a few for her,2018-07-06
the more marvel movies that are similar to the winter soldier the better,2018-07-07

also paul rudd appeared on tim and eric ",2018-07-07
from tim and eric awesome show great job yep that was him ,2018-07-07
yeah that was him if you look closely you can see tayne in a scene or two,2018-07-07
yep his characters name in the credits was captain daniel goobler ,2018-07-08
yes between this and other leaks about infinity war ii ive figured everything out ,2018-07-08
definitely three but it was luis van so he could be nearby he could somehow save scott  though i think the time vortex comment from janet is a dead giveaway to what will actually happen ,2018-07-09

yeah it ties directly to infinity war and itll get resolved in avengers 4 next year ,2018-07-09
i was wondering how she was able to sustain herself at all foodwise,2018-07-09

people have mentioned seeing a bubble city of some sort when they are leaving the realm ",2018-07-09

i figured the cloak was from a repurposed parachute but as to why she needed a staff im really not sure,2018-07-09
or the future,2018-07-09
i think she could be a really cool hero character in future marvel films i love her powers which dont seem to be 100 cured according to the credits scene,2018-07-11
no janet was actually a founding member of the avengers,2018-07-10
"i would like to see marvel take some more risks like not every character should be a wise cracking jokester

i feel this is almost an unfair complaint against a genre of movies inspired by comics as in comical theyre supposed to be funny thats kind of the whole point",2018-07-13
they casted an older cassie for avengers 4 and there are theories that avengers 4 will be based around time travel and stuff so it is very possible that there will be an older cassie stinger in avengers 4 to fight alongside her dad,2018-07-31
i thought from the beginning they would snap cassie but thinking about it it would look a lot like they showed a kid dying in the mcu obviously we know they’re not gone forever but it would look bad ,2018-08-06
near complete agreement one slight edit is im of the mind that the time vortex created was from thanos cutting back 20 seconds to save the mind stone from being destroyed by wanda which would correlate to when scott was specifically in the quantum realm i think that would add one crucial story element  it would line up wanda very difficult decision in the last film to go from feeling meaningless to being a key reason the team is eventually able to save the day ,2018-07-07
or he sees 2028 is a utopia paradise with plentifully resources  and everyone is happy living in harmony looking out there cabins to beautiful landscapes,2018-07-07
but how does captain marvel fit into that,2018-07-07
thanks for the potential spoilers,2018-07-07
hey buddy  this thread is for ant man spoilers not spoilers for a4,2018-07-07
janet was in the quantum universe where time space all things are irrelevant also being that she shrunk subatomic i dont think she even needed to eat or anything she always remained stagnant and never needed anything like a normal person would just my guess,2018-07-13
or getting her makeup,2018-07-13
taridigrade milk  like luke skywalker did on that jedi island  ,2018-07-14
"thanos having to reverse time in order to obtain the mind stone is going to have some kind of unforeseen effect on his wiping out half of existence

did he actually reverse time or did he not use the time stone to restore the stone like strange did to eat and uneat that apple in dr strange didnt require any time travel there just the effects on the subject wanda was still in the same spot she was 

edit never mind went back and rewatched the scene  mordo flips the  out at strange and says that even messing with that apple that can cause branches in time and interdimensional openings that was clearly on purpose

its  on then",2018-07-06
solid theory lets see if it picks up having thanos be the one to undo his own plans is in character at least his comic character so i find this theory plausible since mcu thanos is a bit different and hasnt really demonstrated that self impeding success attribute i can see this theory being more about consequences and morality versus character attributes,2018-07-06
yeah you can see a city like structure in the background alluding to the microverse maybe ,2018-07-06
yeah that aspect wasnt well thought out  he said after the battle in germany he slept for 3 days  but after wasp gets him out of the water and wakes him up he is good to go for the rest of the movie with no sleep,2018-07-06
"pym particles aint gonna explain  

dont take any science in mcu seriously its all plotconvenient magic",2018-07-06
she also reminded me of the fury adepts from mass effect 3 she even had their phasing ability,2018-07-07
i would upvote this 100 more times if i could even from the trailers i thought thats what i was looking at ,2018-07-07
"the fbi agent was jimmy woo

the motivation of the villains was that some people who were implied to be violent found it worth a lot of money 1 billion to get the lab for business reasons",2018-07-07
the motivation is pretty clear cut pyms technology is worth hundreds of billions if not trillions of dollars you would gain a lot of wealth and power from it of course the sort of people that want those sort of things want his technology pym just wants his wife back ,2018-07-07
those credit scenes were intense they definitely felt like they were alluding to the impact of thanoss snap half of the planet disappearing would be a catastrophic event and those two scenes left me with chills,2018-07-07
"for the villains motivation

they say very brieflylike literally once that theyor the real boss that we don’t get to meet wants the lab in order to produce quantum energy",2018-07-07
yessss me too ,2018-07-11
"and apparently you get magical superpowers there that of course solve the villains dying curse how convenient

its based on a comic book where you can get powers from falling into toxic goo instead of getting mortally poisoned im willing to give them some room there

also unless im missing something fishbournes character didnt make a whole lot of sense he took pym hostage so they could try to fix ghost and then later he says pym could help so why the  did he take him hostage why not just make a deal with him at first if her life was in danger why not offer him shelter in exchange way back when pym was still running

they hated each other they state this in the movie pym hated anything shield and fishbourne assumed that pym wouldnt help its classic hubris drama i felt that part was realistic",2018-07-17
" and apparently you get magical superpowers there that of course solve the villains dying curse how convenient

at least the  villain came into contact with them at all because she was specifically seeking the working quantum tunnel to reexpose her to the energies that destabilized her in the first place its great for her that janet ended up being able to manipulate those forces intentionally to help but her plan wasnt factoring that in ahead of time",2018-07-18

baba yaga is a part of the cultural zeitgeist in a huge part of the world its like mentioning santa claus,2018-07-06

well no one went to applebees so,2018-07-06
wait september was in the movie i couldnt recognize him who he was ,2018-07-06
my take isnt as harsh as yours but yeah this was the weakest marvel movie in recent memory i actually fell asleep in the middle,2018-08-09
following house arrest he was on 3 years probation without superhero antics,2018-07-15
i mean considering the movie its in they used the pym particle to just make it smaller,2018-07-15
i assume the avengers just didnt know,2018-07-15
thats how i am with most of them i think they are generally entertaining movies but they hardly ever do anything super interesting or memorable because they are always just setting up for the next one,2018-07-06
saw it in 3d cant wait to go see it again ,2018-07-06
i only rewatch to watch a certian scene or check for a detail that someone points out but yeah only a few of the movies are rewatchable for me,2018-07-11
had this exact feeling for this movie watched it purely for the infinity war tie in absolutely no desire to watch it again,2018-07-06
some of these films are the most disposable movies of this decade,2018-07-06

really wasnt there a rapid gun barrage on the chandelier ,2018-07-16
iron man and dr strange have been take care of the aliens so no one needed to go there also the main attack was at wakanda probably pym and scott didnt get any info about that attack ,2018-07-10
"i thought i was the only one that found that hard to really grasp in the stinger i found it more confusing on why they just didnt mention it and make that part of the objective 
",2018-07-10
"this was my biggest gripe about the movie i don’t care if scott said he was out you’d think the biggest fight in the history of the world would warrant a call like the stakes were high 

that post credit scene did nothing but  me off and leave me asking more questions if scott quit the avengers to be with his family wouldn’t  concerned that his family could possibly die 

do none of the avengers know of hank pym it’s so ",2018-07-10
" he should have just bailed

just in response to this i think he says at one point that hes gotten some very powerful people involved in this i assume the ones who want to buy the lab so it might be more that he has no choice",2018-07-11
"why did laurence fishburns character have to be called bill foster 

dr bill foster is a superhero on the comics called black goliathgoliath they were just using the same character comparing sizes scene was a nod to that  


so they didnt named him bill foster they just adapted a character already stabilished as bill foster",2018-10-05
about the foster thing i never thought about that until you brought it up coincidence i guess since we all know jane isnt returning ,2018-10-03
"also ghost still had weeks couldnt they just explain to her in like 2 minutes that theyll help her after they save the mom who is on a really really tight schedule jeeez

she was told that she had a day left to live and that there was only one method that was somewhat guaranteed to save her life 

her life only prolonged because of what the mum did to her after escaping the quantum realm ",2018-10-04

i was thinking of search for spock when scott was speaking as janet  that said the memory bit where hes in her memory seeing out of her eyes was a bit creepy,2018-07-06
if you watch non speaking characters react to things youll notice this a lot,2018-07-06
"its cuz if it was a genuine real life thing hed just be standing there with a blank look on his face

"which one

midcredits scene antman goes into the quantam tunnel to retrieve some energy for the ghost hes in there and the radio cuts out the scene cuts to show us hank mrs pym and evangeline lilly suffered the snap

postcredits showed antmans house tv on emergency channel hear the drums beating in the background camera moves through the house to show an ant playing the drums not really worth sticking around for if you ask me",2018-07-07
good catch  whomever he is speaking to will probably be a future villain in the antman universe maybe even the entirety of the mcu  i am not knowledgeable in antman comic books but how about dr doom to help bring in the fantastic four  feige and co could use this to give the earthbased heroes a megavillain for phase 4  probably a future antman villain but fun to think about,2018-07-07
yeah i couldnt catch if they said a name  possibly a tease for a potential sequel  unfortunately it was open ended enough that it could be anyone from the mad thinker to the roxxon corporation,2018-07-07
i mean scott is estranged from the rest of the avengers and is in california plus agent hill and fury barely knew anything was happening to them before they were dusted even being in ny its not really that surprising i dont think many people outside of the avengers and wakanda had any idea what was happening,2018-07-07
"sometimes you just need to take 30 seconds and think before jumping to “plot hole”

the nyc battle is over in like 10 minutes  antman is based in california",2018-07-07
its explained in the movie that after the two year house arrest he still has a three year probation so even if he was aware of the situation i dont think he couldve done anything about it just my two cents,2018-07-07
thats not a plot hole its reasonable to assume that scotthope choose not to insert themselves into that situation and theres no inherent contradiction with him choosing to stay in san francisco,2018-07-07
well he does live on the other side of the country and maybe he didn’t want to interfere bc of what happened when he joined in on cw,2018-07-07
i don’t think they were in nyc i think they were on the west coast and didn’t hear of it ,2018-07-07
yeah that plot hole was the exact same thing i was wondering none of them lent a hand to save the universe really,2018-07-07
really eerie scene that goes through scotts house which is now silent except for a sound coming from a tv which is playing an emergency broadcast that reads this is not a test then pans over to the giant ant playing the drums,2018-07-07
it shows scotts apartment after the snap theres a psa announcement on the tv telling people that theres a state of emergency and to wait for further instructions while scotts ant doppelganger is playing the drum set ,2018-07-07
i don’t think she wanted to risk it incase something was wrong when she came back scott now has nothing to lose,2018-07-07
"this who knows more about that 
",2018-07-08
isn’t there a whole subatomic universe in marvel comics i could swear the hulk has been there,2018-07-08
wow didn’t notice the city but i thought that the twist would be that there is a whole parallel dimension in the quantom realm  and it even was hinted in the movie once   so maybe thats confirms my theory ,2018-07-08
well its the quantum realm it isnt well explored or studied and perhaps it has a gateway of sorts to the dimension where all the snapped people disappeared to,2018-07-08
came here looking for this question,2018-07-09
came here for this yep saw it looked up micronauts in wikipedia and doesnt look like marvel owns the rights to that so what could it have been,2018-07-09
"i can’t imagine they would leave him out of two movies 

i’m sure him being in the quantum realm will factor  into how they defeat thanos ",2018-07-09

100 agree on heidecker im not even sure what the point of having him was as he didnt even have a funny line maybe he did but they had to edit it out or something,2018-07-11
whats his backstory ive seen his name come up several times now in association with antman,2018-07-11
i don’t think it’s odd at all paul rudd probably asked heidecker to do it since they’ve worked together before i thought this movie was funny as  and that cameo made sense the humor for me felt very wet hot american summer at times like when michelle pfeiffer’s character is taking over paul rudd’s body,2018-07-12
probably my favorite part once i saw his name in the credits is whale boat captain daniel gooobler ,2018-07-12
"i dont think that wouldve panned well

right now we are judging ant man and the wasp right now with the criteria with also how well it blends in with infinity war

in a few years we will be judging that movie as itself any stuff that isnt really relevant to the main story should be in the post credits

imagine seeing wandaquicksilver in winter soldier or buckysamsteve in antman it would just throw off the cohesive vibe of the main story having teasers for the future in the post credits is the best way to handle it",2018-07-11
savage,2018-07-12
"essentially scott goes down to the quantum realm to harvest some kind of energy to heal ghost with hope and her parents staying in the normal realm ie real world to retrieve scott as they count down from 5 to bring him back the sound cuts off at 3 5 4 3 and its clear somethings wrong scott panics down there cut to real world and you see 3 sets of ashes presumably hopehankmom forgot her name implying those 3 did not survive the snap with scott surviving and being stuck in the quantum realmspoiler

well i dont think diversity in casting should be celebrated because thats the way the world actually is movie casts for the most part should be this way you dont get orange slices for not going out of your way to make 95 of the population of any given movie white ,2018-07-17
its better that way ive turned around on the big celebrations and praising of diverse casts but its nice to see it go by unnoticed and have the movie not draw attention to it,2018-07-18
maybe they care more about the story than diversity that being said it was nice seeing a superhero movie with traditional villains and bad guys as a change for all the huge and epic stuff in the other marvel movies,2018-07-17
fast and furious franchise has been doing this for years,2018-07-18
and of course some people were  that the wasp was female even though shes always been female in the comic books,2018-07-23
"honestly i think wasp was the lead role in this not antman

that is my major problem with both ant man movies ant man himself has not been the lead character in any of the three movies hes been in hes just a peripheral character a hired goon doing work for the pyms who have actual backstories and motivations it reminds me of why i disliked final fantasy 12 where the main character is also completely superfluous and just a background character in someone elses important story they tried to give ant man some kind of urgency with the house arrest subplot but that subplot was dumb and more of a mostlyignored annoyance than a substantive plot point 

i think they couldve been bolder and just made this movie the wasp and written scott as the side character that he shouldve been based on the plot theyd have to make hope a more likable and interesting character to do so which would also be good ",2018-07-24
"cause its 2018 and people have been touting for diversity far too long to get excited just cause disneys finally slowly getting itself there

dont get me wrong happy theyre doing it but disneys not exactly leading the charge on diversity in movies so it wouldnt make sense for them to get praise for doing something even dceu managed to do by its third movie",2018-07-21
i bet he uses the time vortexes to go back to the battle of new york there were set photos of antman with the cast in their old costumes,2018-07-06
i agree man i saw it with a girl who has never watched a marvel film and i was super paranoid shed be bored my parents didnt like black panther and it was the first movie we had watched together for ages but we loved every moment of it a lot of people saying they were bored i mean i get that it isnt high stakes but it was a laugh the whole way through ,2018-07-08
"  whos julia 

there isnt a character  named julia ",2018-07-09
completely agree i thought the logic of janet “evolving” and being able to fix ghost was completely ridiculous and in general i thought the antagonists here were lackluster and among the worst of any marvel film also i love laurence fishburne and i love goliath bill foster from the comics but was super disappointed by his character in this,2018-07-09
yeah the whole premise was she had energy that ghost wanted to steal to heal herself the twist was that janet could control that energy so there was no need to steal it,2018-07-09
but how does she know how to utilize this shes also been out of the field of science for 30 years 30 years ago we were still analog yet still has a modern mastery,2018-07-09
"  it’s likely that like a wasp she is covered in healing particles and the healing particle residue was enough to keep ghost’s powers at bay for the time being it isn’t magic or anything it’s the healing particles 


um are you saying that normal wasps are covered in quantum particles


",2018-07-09
"i like how the super villain is just a scared person trying to survive and not take over the world

unfortunately she was a  and was trying to steal from them something that they wanted to give her 

my problem with this movie was that the conflicts were completely forced there was no reason why ghost shouldve been their enemy there was no reason why hank and hope shouldve been hunted by the fbi as you said there was no reason why scott shouldve been worrying about this quantum  two days before he was done with house arrest they couldve just waited for two days before finding out about the silly 2 hour limit thing and they couldve been free to do whatever they wanted and without being on the run from the fbi i think they wouldnt have had to deal with the black market guy there shouldve actually been no antagonists in this movie at all the way it was written so they had to resort to please let me explainandthenthegirlfriendstormsout levels of character conflict ",2018-07-24
i suppose the car speed is the same logic behind scott being just as powerful whether hes antsized or humansized though that doesnt change the fact that the wheels circumference is what would really affect the speed not the engines power,2018-07-18
"i think the fbi just wanted them for their knowledge and tech

i think bill just wanted to keep ghost safe since another organization can take her to be a spy like what shield apparently did ",2018-07-21
the biggest waste in the movie was janet she feels like nothing more than a plot point the reunion in the quantum realm was laughable all this set up and that hallucinatory intro just for her to pop up and go ah yes hello its me lets go ,2018-07-08
the pieces are not in the same place janet is back and hank is not egocentric anymore i think this is more of a hank character arc than a scott and hope movie,2018-07-08
"agreed while not bad it wasnt great i think they just released it to be comic relief after infinity war p1 lots of funny moments and i dont regret seeing it but i dont see myself watching it again it was more of a what was ant man doing during infinity war oh just living his life okay 


also a bit annoyed that the 2nd post credit scene was literally in the trailer first scene was good even though i called it immediately ",2018-07-08
i think the problem is that we never knew janet  we had been told she was dead  so trying to save her didnt feel important,2018-07-08
ragnarok was a much better movie,2018-07-06
you’re forgetting that hank is the og antman who’s to say that he isn’t the title character lol,2018-07-06
i kind of started wondering if maybe they are setting up a “young avengers” situation and preparing to pass down the torch in the future ,2018-07-06
way down the line they can do young avengers but probably not for at least 10 years need wanda and vision to have kids too,2018-07-06
"was it the ant playing drums

if so that was also in the movie  unless it had the emergency broadcast beeeeeeee in the background",2018-07-06
nope black panther also in the trailerscommercials u him in un which was the mid credit scene,2018-07-06
i didnt notice that but it wouldnt surprise me if marvel would at least hint at the microverse,2018-07-06
that question mark slowly appearing got a gasp out of me such mood whiplash at the end even though i knew it was coming in some shape or form,2018-07-07
"that is totally what i thought i saw also janet van dynes character was wearing a different outfit coming out of the quantum realm and it felt like she had been through some things like maybe there are beings living in the quantum realm
",2018-07-07
i feel like the quantum realm is going to be really important in avengers 4 maybe that is were all the heroes who died wound up,2018-07-07
someone else mentioned it ,2018-07-07
"i honestly liked the no real villain idea and that this was a low stakes plot not every film has to have the weight of millions of lives at stake

i think this and homecoming worked so well because they were low stakes personal movies",2018-07-07
"having the villains not be mustachetwirling evil for the sake of it cardboard cutouts is nice

especially because in cases like this it just kinda makes sense ghost isnt the way she is for kicks and once her problem has been resolved she doesnt have to continue to act the way she did before and they kinda set it up for her to show up in more movies probably in an antihero role",2018-07-08
"  the ending will blow you away 

yah i expected the snap to happen in front of scott to lets say a much younger person that might have warranted thethe ending will blow you away",2018-07-08
"there have been set photos of rudd in costume shooting avengers 4 

i think i’d be funny if he just appeared out of nowhere during the climactic battle and says something like “oh it was a time warp”",2018-07-09
i dont expect antman to be stuck there long enough for him to go through what janet experienced ,2018-07-09
sonny burch character shouldve been justin hammer they couldve casted walton goggins for a much better role in the future mcu films,2018-07-12
so janet said “watch our for time vortexes” over the radio and there are leaked behind the scenes photos of scott in the battle of new york for avengers 4 so we can assume time travel of some sort,2018-07-07
pretty positive the science junk will play a big role in avengers 4 so they have to set that up well,2018-07-07
yeah the second post credit scenes usually arent worth staying long for the jurassic park fallen kingdom one was kind of dull like this one,2018-07-11
its basically a scene thats in the movie itself too we just see it from a different angle,2018-07-10
thats been bothering me too he doesnt have to compare to the  pymvan dyne family tony stark etc but scott has a masters degree in electrical engineering he should have at least a very basic exposure to quantum physics,2018-07-11
"i think the bumbing stuff came from him being behind the other characters in terms of what was going on  a lot of the movie hope and hank know what theyre trying to do where they can go what they have to work with and scott is just reacting to it

once he knows what the  is going on or what the  he needs to do hes much more effective  like how he kept sneaking back into his house or when he mounts a rescue  ",2018-07-10
"i dont think ghost really had enough depth to warrant more screen time she was in an accident she has painful superpowers and shell do anything to survive and get cured thats a complete summary of her characterization

this movie had a really interesting balance of humor and drama janet possessing scott stood out as a really interesting intersection of a funny situation and a touching moment id say this movie was precisely what i expected after the first antman",2018-07-15
"there there was a second postcredit scene

"downvoting doesnt really matter the default sort is new anyway  also people being afraid to post their opinions because they get bad internet points which mean nothing is what causes circlejerks

dang it’s not even one of the better marvel movies,2018-07-06
"i agree with you to some extent on all points but to a lesser degree

first i totally agree about goggins unnecessary character and i think more time with ghost would have been better served by replacing him  

as far as the as long as its fun well yeah kind of  movies dont all have to be these artsy masterpieces  this wasnt supposed to be silence of the lambs  its antman  

i do agree the marvel formula is sometimes a little overboard on its quipiness i disagree that every character is somehow tony stark  the one character you could actually say that for is dr strange but otherwise no character is anywhere close to stark in terms of personality  ",2018-07-06
i agree with you about the bland cinematography although it’s gotten slightly better over the last couple of films the humor is something i love about these films i mean i agree the humor at times is a bit much i strongly disagree with about the characters having the same personality from the first iron man it was established that tony stark is snarky wise  captain america was always been the boy scout scott lang is an every day man who really has not business being a superhero from the moment they were introduced on screen each character has been true to who they are regardless of the arc they were given humor and quips don’t necessarily mean each characters are the same it’s more reactionary i think regardless the films quality character building has been the mcu biggest strength which is why the films are so popular ,2018-07-06
"look i won’t bash you for an opinion even though i disagree but i have to ask why are you still watching movies from the mcu it’s 20 movies in now and clearly their style isn’t to your liking so why not just move on

also the reason the post credits scene is being talked about more than the film itself is likely because it’s the last thing audiences saw and it changed the movie from a low stakes comedy to instant dread i’d be surprised if people weren’t talking about it",2018-07-06
they hated jesus because he told them the truth,2018-07-09
"you took the words right out of my mouth as much as i have a problem with so many aspects of this film your last point cannot be understated

this is one of the most visually boring films ive ever seen especially in terms of the environment how people can even attemp yo excuse walter goggins cartoon character of a villain straight out of looney tunes and ghost who has no character arc or development is simply beyond me

i know mcuheads are a bit blind when it comes to villains but i thought it being this bad were surely kick them out of their hivemind thinking people want to make fun of dc for films like suicide squad but how was this movie any better

annnddd your point about these tony starklite characters i could go on and on phase 4 cant come soon enough as fiege promised some more original flicks",2018-07-06
" yea dude spiderman 2 is for sure the greatest superhero movie of all time imo

anyway just chiming in to say your opinion is absolutely valid and i agree with like all of your points i still however enjoyed the film because like you said it was fun it helps a lot when thats all youre expecting going in and its 5 tuesdays i do think youre getting a little too worked up over how average this movie is though as if everyone else enjoying it is a personal affront to you other people enjoying it should not detract from you not enjoying it and i dont think you should shame people for having a good time with it

but man let me reiterate your favorite marvel movies line up pretty well with my favorites people get so confused when i tell them spiderman 2 is one of the greats but  they just dont get it",2018-07-11
i disagree with most of this but i respect your opinion,2018-07-07
im a huge mcu fan but i can see where you are coming from and i agree with some of the points youve made i respect your opinion its what im saying after all these are just movies,2018-07-06
"you know what youre comment got me thinking i already gave my mini review on here and i liked the movie but there were things about it i did not like 

overall i felt emptyish with this movie like in hindsight id relate it to iron man 2 it had a lot of nothing in it in the sense that the characters actions never really move the movie forward or at least theres pauses and then it jumps their story forward all of a sudden many scenes were just for fun instead of having more purpose which i dont have a problem with but get if someone else does 

when it comes to villains i liked ghost her powers were cool and her motivation made sense she was dying but she needed pyms science to help her survive 

goggins on the other hand i completely agree was pointless take him out of the movie and youd pretty much have the same thing the only reason hes in the movie is to tease some guy pulling strings behind the scene whose probably his supplier or something 

oh and i completely agree with scotts change in character so dumb he was smart but goofy in the first one his main shtick wasnt being useless in the first one he did stuff in this one he was the butt of a lot of jokes and that wasnt cool the fact he never really had control over the suit  it was really for comedic effect but it wasnt fair they shouldve fixed it halfway through that way he could do some badass   

overall i had gripes with this movie but at the same time i did like it it all somehow worked out to me like it didnt make the movie  but ill admit i was a lil diappointed how the movie was the way it was ",2018-07-07
i dont understand why these shallow empty movies keeps getting rated fresh,2018-07-07
"i agree about the exposition bit the whole opening sequence was unnecessary i get that its for people who havent watched the previous movies but there has to be a point where movie makers stopped pandering to those people and if someone decided to just waltz into the billionth movie in a series without seeing the previous ones then thats on them 

even the exposition where parks character explains why rudds character is under house arrest to the latters daughter was so incredibly lazy and they had the gall to play it as a joke that whole explanation could have been peppered throughout the movie considering how often his house arrest comes up but they had to dump it all in one scene 

that aside so much of the science fiction elements in the movie were also incredibly lazy the scene in the end with michelle pfeiffers character healing ghost was by far the laziest  thing to happen in this movie universe so far didnt even bother to address what just happened 

those glaring issues aside i generally had fun with the movie i even thought it was better than the original which looking back i wouldnt really wanna watch again this one was definitely lazier though ",2018-07-14
"you sound like youre upset the movie doesnt fit your specific formula of how movies should be enjoyed

this has a style tempo and sense of humor a lot of people find pretty good just because it doesnt suit you doesnt mean youre some kind of persecuted film critic it just means youre being a bit pretentious and you need some humility when it comes to what you like vs what others like",2018-07-08
 is all garbage,2018-07-07
"yeah i don’t consider scott lang hank pym nor hope van dyne to be tony stark lite 

scott’s character didn’t just suddenly turn to a “quip machine” if you watched the first movie you’ll see he cracks a few jokes doesn’t take everything seriously but being a good father to cassie or his idea of one is his priority 

also it’s the mcu dude it’s been exactly like that for what 20 movies by now movies that the general audience and most comic book fans love and follow almost religiously being just “fun” doesn’t achieve that 

i’m sorry you don’t like it but it’s just not your cup of tea no need to bash incessantly on the movie constructive criticism with ways to improve are good which your post is not ",2018-07-07
i can’t thank you enough for this comment i knew coming into this thread that everyone would be as usual posting “funny quotes” from the movie and just talking about the ending scene such an average movie ,2018-07-07
i agree on a lot of your points i still enjoyed the movie but this has been the most mediocre film in the franchise in recent years,2018-07-13
i think what would have helped goggins character is one small scene with the people he works for maybe threatening him or his family just like his character in tomb raider which hannah johnkamen was also in some of the humor in this film worked well pint sized antman was hilarious the family connections i think help also i just tried to not overthink this movie just sat back and enjoyed the ride ,2018-07-06
i fully agree with you i barely remember anything from this movie ,2018-07-08
dude amen to that,2018-07-07
dude i just got into an argument about the whole everyone is bootleg stark trope some people truly believe that having all of your characters act like another equates to good writing,2018-07-08
"im one of the people who downvoted you and wanted to give you a more lengthy reply

i liked woo too and im not sure why people should be upset hes not a badass

the exposition dumps i understand the issue there i just dont think it really affects the movie i had to think about them to recall them they dont stick out to me so for me personally i didnt find them so blatant or tedious

i dont know why youre so upset by the prologue i didnt mind it bc i didnt know what the movie was about other than ant man so i felt it set the stage

the splicing in of jokes as you put it i find to be realistic because people do it in real life thats how people act idk what to say other than that 

people like marvel movies for multiple reasons and you dont even seem to try and understand why i like the silliness in the ant man movies because as an every day dude and dad it helps me connect to paul rudds character more not because i like a laugh honestly a lot of your gripes sound like they come from someone who thinks movies are art and shouldnt appeal to the masses 

your post is rather long so ill just say this ghost shouldnt be seen as a villian thats why the character seems like a bad villian to you the colors in the quantum realm are  loved it i never once forgot what they were trying to accomplish in rescuing janet so when the moment came i enjoyed it thoroughly i thought the lack of a villain fits well with the mood of the movie and what ant man and the wasp are trying to do 

if you cant distinguish between the characters thats on you having watched the marvel movies multiple multiple times i strongly disagree about how the character development i think youre saying this without having actually examined the characters in depth",2018-07-06

"oh its another one of the all marvel movies are the same people visually bland how you know they have animated comic movies too maybe thats more your style i dont know how you can say visually this is comparable to guadians thor dr strange or infinity war for example

also lighter is better it makes the serious characters stand out more id rather have more guys quipping than more emo guys dragging the mood down it also helps the serious characters stand out even tony was more serious in civil war and infinity war

also infinity war was pretty heavy they needed to bring the mood up again with this",2018-07-06
"710 trolling you’re actually pretty good unlike most trolls nowadays

that linked subreddit is a cringefest tho ",2018-07-07
i think the issue is that 99 of marvel fans enjoy most of the movies in the mcu  every fan can find things we do not like and a lot of things we do like  if youre the mod for  that heavily implies you are a troll because a normal fan person doesnt join a sub like that or even think of becoming moderator for such a place  every fan accepts legitimate criticism but shouldnt tolerate  reasoning,2018-07-06

i think black panther wins by virtue of production value the music the costumes set design etc are just too hard to top for a marvel movie,2018-07-06
definitely not this one was good fun but nothing more than that this one had better cgi and arguably better character interactionsvery arguable though but black panther explored deeper themes and social issues and also had a much better villain all while handling a ton of worldbuilding that its insulting anyone calls bp a generic marvel flick no marvel movie made an entire civilization feel so real and fleshed out like bp plus bp had an outstanding score antman i only remember the main theme ,2018-07-06
i feel like in some ways black panther is objectively a better movie however i personally enjoyed antman and the wasp more i just had more fun with it,2018-07-06
yes im a much bigger ant man fan than bp tho,2018-07-06
not really the cgi was better but i prefer bps willingness to challenge the audience with real social issues,2018-07-06
very different characters and styles so i liked them both for very different reasons ,2018-07-09
i certainly did,2018-07-06
yes actually but thats probably from the initial rush of giddiness i got from watching this only an hour ago ,2018-07-06
i liked the great wall more than black panther and id probably watch the great showman 10 times before i even go near either of these mcu flicks,2018-07-07
peyton reed had already established himself as a great filmmaker i hope after marvel gets back the rights to fantastic four they put him in charge of it ,2018-07-06

i think cap probably assumed that since antman  hawkeye took that plea deal instead of running away that theyre done with the whole superhero thing if antman were to have participated hed get 20 years jailtime,2018-07-06
"i wish they would have elaborated a bit more during the midcredits scene but remember that the events of infinity war take place over the course of like a day or two its possible that there was simply no time go and get scott and hope or considering they had a wakandan army at their disposal it wasnt much of a priority 

the only thing that bothers me is how nonchalant they were about it then again id bet that when they were filming that scene the actors and possibly even the director didnt know about the snappening that stuff was so hush hush that they could have filmed it under false pretenses ",2018-07-06

"it would be interesting to see what they even did with an mcu thunderbolts  comic book ghost especially after he started appearing in thunderbolts is such a wildly different character  

half of what made him so much fun in thunderbolts was the way that his crazy conspiracy theory obsession clashed with the other thunderbolts  he was too crazy for moonstone to manipulate  he was so crazy that he creeped out crossbones  what made it even more hilarious was that he was surprisingly one of the most useful members of the team  he would rant about chemtrails and cia sensors being implanted in his food but he never had any trouble understanding the mission at hand or his role in a given plan  everyone else could act sane but theyd always try and backstab the team or have a psychotic break at the worst possible moment but ghost was the opposite  he acts like the least reliable most obvious traitor on the team and then he was perfectly competent on a mission  i loved that after a while the long term members just kind of learned to roll with it  new guys had no idea what the  was going on and old guard was just like yeah hes like that  its fine 

mcu ghost is so different  shes barely crazy at all  sure ghost wasnt always as crazy as his thunderbolts characterization but he was obsessed with wealth and corruption going all the way back to his debut as an iron man villain  mcu ghost is starting from a very different place  shed interact with the other team members very differently than comic book ghost does  heck most of the thunderbolts dont exist yet in the mcu or theyre as different from their counterparts as ghost is  how does mcu ghost interact with mcu zemo although now that i think about it i dont think that ghost and zemo were never on the thunderbolts at the same time in comics  but still  interesting to think about how they would handle it and how her character would work in that context ",2018-07-07

"its a possibility thing when ghosts powers are going off on their own the effect is showing her in many positions that she was previously in and then others that she would later be in in any given moment she could be in a certain number of states and her powercurse is that she fluctuates between all those states none of those naturally occurring states is a person falling through the earth

why,2018-07-07
can you elaborate on the editing decisions  im interested,2018-07-08
i found the editing to be especially bizarre around paul rudd i don’t know if some of his scenes were refilmed separately or if there was some other issue but his dialogue often felt kind of awkward in scenes particularly with hope and hank and rushed ,2018-07-08
and not just the ant men but the ant women and ant children too ,2018-07-08
i think the reasoning why they did the ant after the snap is because in the background you can hear the emergency broadcast signal going off,2018-07-09
it’s a major spoiler not just because people get dusted but because of who gets dusted in what circumstances and the consequences for scott ,2018-07-09

" how was antman unaware of what was going on with thanos in new york at the time why would they go through to the quantum realm in such an unstable time

the new york stuff happened in like under an hour 

the wakanda battle happened a day or 2 later antman wouldnt have had time to fly over its possible he didnt know about the wakanda battle and they had no reason to think itd affect their experiment 

 on the other hand antman will have that healing power to a lesser extent when he comes back

the ant was playing the drums in the freaking trailer thats why we felt cheated dont put your post credits scene in the trailer marvel,2018-07-07
i feel like it might have worked better if they made the scene with the ant the mid credits scene and the scene with scott and the pyms the post credits scene then rather than having audiences leave feeling like they wasted their time with the post credits scene of the ant playing the drums it works instead as an appetizer to the real meal that being the pyms disappearance,2018-07-07
unnamed southern techarms dealer you mean sonny burch the first antman movie relied heavily on cgi as well i meanhe is called antman in the first place most of the time sequel movies especially marvel ones tend to be inferior to the origin movie,2018-07-16
"there was one scene where unnamed southern techarms dealers car whisked around a corner and it was blatant cgi it sucks that a big budget movie would cut corners like that

i havent seen ant man and the wasp but ive been noticing bad cgi in all their marvels recent films black panther had really bad cgi infinity wars was better but there were times where it was pretty bad at least for such a big budget film it seems like a trend and im really hoping they stop taking shortcuts on cgi for their future movies ",2018-07-16
isnt that the entirety of the history of all world conflicts though,2018-07-08
the point was both were effectively in a time crunch with few certainties on how to solve their problems so neither was unwilling to divert from their mission especially ghost tunnel vision under both sets of circumstances is kinda understandable,2018-07-08

"just to add to your comments the avengers wouldnt even bother calling on scott or pym because neither are in the avengers and scott was thought to be powerless he convinced the fbi he destroyed the suit and pym and hope were on the lam so why would the avengers even bother trying to reach out to them especially given the avengers barely had warning of the attack and were too occupied afterwards  

i liked how this movie as all mcu movies do dovetailed into events from other movies we dont need to get carried away documenting how and why every single character isnt present for every emergency",2018-07-11

"well keep in mind the original attack happened in nyc and just stopped even with wakanda opened up its safe to assume only people like fury were even aware there was a wakanda attack so a lot of people probably believed it was just another avengers incident that got resolved in one big fight

additionally scott wouldnt be all that itching to jump into action again  it was a short time frame and they barely had time to set up in wakanda anyway not to mention the fact that scott is in california and spent a good portion of the movie worried about helping hank and hope and being seen in the suit again they probably saw what happened on tv and scott got teased over going to help his buddy cap again",2018-07-07
antman already had so much exposition do they really need to stop and say oh jeez i cant believe what happened in new york ok lets continue with the experiment it would have been so forced and them disappearing would have lost all impact,2018-07-07
"what time was it

it was daylight in east africa when the snappening occurred 

could not have been light in san francisco ",2018-07-07
"true but put it in context there was one attack in nyc which only lasted a few minutes in terms of collateral damage i dont think many civilians died in nyc  after that the ship disappeared from nyc and the battle went to titan wakanda is reclusive and no one outside knew what was going on even fury and hill had no clue what had happened in wakanda  
  
  
now take the world of the mcu between netflix  the films there is always something crazy and cataclysmic going on somewhere for them the ny attack and tonys disappearance were something that happened in a matter of minutes and then nothing else till the snap the whole world was clueless it was tony stark getting involved in something just like he has in every of his own movies and the avengers films not to mention what happened in lagos germany dc and in every other mcu film  
  
  
plus scott was in trouble for violating the sokovia accords he just got his life back the fbi knows he is antman he doesnt get the slack that tony does why would he leave san fran to chase a ship in nyc that appeared and disappeared within moments nyc life was disrupted and then suddenly continued the world of the mcu at this point is used to 911 size events happening all the time like how mass shootings are these days in our current world ",2018-07-07

"i mean infinity war took place over the course of 2 12 days no telling how much time between the end of amatw and the mid credit scene took place but ill say maybe few days tops do you normally watch news about things going on on the other side of the country

they were kinda busy managing xcon catching up with janet and shrinking their quantum tunnel also i imagine hank and co are still laying low plenty distraction to stay away from the news plus that ship was on earth for a total of what 1015 minutes tops theyre in san fran by the time they even got there thered be no one to help mind you the news footage caught was the ship already leaving not while it was actually here i just dont think there was enough time",2018-07-09
i think only the post credits scene takes place during infinity war also with it could have been on the news they just didnt see it or assumed the avengers had it taken care of they saved nyc from a full blown alien invasion in avengers 1 and stopped a floating city in avengers 2 an alien ship showing up destroying  10 cars  only a city block or two and then leaving while still news worthyprobably wouldnt seem as importantdire as the other events  ,2018-07-09

the wait for captain marvel and avengers 4 will make this upcoming 7 months left on a cliffhanger painful did think the two end credits were extremely eerie killing the recently retrieved janet along with hope and hank did love that janet refered to hank as henry and san fransisco suddenly abandoned with the eas playing just made that end credit sting no pun intended especially hard i flat out cursed at the screen in shock with a kid in front of me because it wasnt expected  i hope the mcu movies continue to surprise",2018-07-12

"dont forget this is hanks first time seeing him since he got everyone in trouble i dont think its a stretch that scott goes to help cap especially after this movie we see more of scott and his daughter she fully supports and loves that he is a hero hes more into it because she is and who is the most heroic hero captain america

weve seen that scott has a problem with doing things that are equally good and bad which gets him into trouble the original crime that put him in jail taking on the mantle of antman and many things in this movie impulsive is the wrong word  he just has trouble weighing the good and bad of his decisions when cap calls its in scotts character to answer

as for coincidences they arent really a problem in fiction unless they solve a dilemma for a hero and if they do add pressure can they be traced to the actions in the movie so finding janet before loosing a lock is the main pressure scotts house arrest doesnt really add pressure since he would have to get back to his house and fool the fbi even if he had a year left and the ghosts demise may have been sped up by her actions in using her suit and powers to steal things from the heroes she is out of her safe room longer so it may be through the actions of the characters and the plot that she becomes more desperate rather than coming into the story with the one week that lines up with everyone elses week",2018-07-18

she can still control her powers to a certain extent even without the suit the suit helps her concentrate for better control i guess,2018-07-11
one of the worst mcu villains in recent memory interesting conceptbackstory for ghost but it was almost cringeworthy to watch her “suffering” or whatever he  she was doing the entire time i’m not trying to be a crabby old man rn but i certainly feel i’m not alone here with this critique ,2018-07-06
"honestly i thought the humor was all it had going for it the rest was incredibly meh  i dont remember another mcu movie where they just kept spouting exposition at you the whole time  

",2018-07-06
dont you just love it when people are downvoting you for your honest opinion i largely agree with you im not sure about the worst of the mcu though,2018-07-06
it was like watching  justice league jokes that didnt land and nobody laughed to,2018-07-07
"i agree that the movie wasnt that great but i disagree about why

allow me to make a case here  the first problem is that the movie would lead you to believe that the protagonists of the film are antman and wasp but its hank pym  the entire plot of the film follows the sins of the father trope and we are always catching up to mistakes and righting the wrongs of pyms past  in fact it is pym that resolves the main conflict of the movie by bringing back the mcguffin janet van dyne and it is janet that pacifies the antagonist ghost by healing her because reasons  an anticlimax which left me wanting more from the story

another issue i had was pacing and story structure  im used to most marvel movies having a recognizable 4 act story problem rising action emotional climax and then the final climax revolving around a physical confrontation  i could not identify  breaks in the acts and the pacing was wonky  quick cuts that jump the timeline forward when some sort of transition would have been nice

my next issue was with antman himself  what was antmans character arc  what did he take away from this experience  in my opinion he had little agency on the plot at all and his arc if you can find one is shallow at best

i think in the end the movie suffers for two reasons  first because it appears that the ideas and concepts presented in the movie must carry over to the larger mcu  likely to help explain and push avengers 4 forward  secondly it also suffers because of the fact that it is the 2nd entry of a trilogy that needs more lore to justify the 3rd movie  we dont learn anything new about scott lang and thats regrettable",2018-07-06
i can’t think of any point during iw when any of the characters had the time to go to san francisco and get scott the new york incident seems to go pretty quick and is over in minutes cap and his team go from scotland to avengers hq then to wakanda pretty quick as well ,2018-07-06
yeah most of those awesome moments were in the trailers lame  sicario lol ,2018-07-07
sicario has josh brolin,2018-07-07
"everyone has a different sense of humor my friend to my left was busting a gut my friend to the right laughed every once in awhile

comedy is hard and definitely cant hit everyone",2018-07-11
completely agree maybe since it just followed infinity war idk it all seemed so much like a filler tv episode rather than a movie,2018-07-11
i agree to an extent i thought a lot of the more lighthearted dialogue and jokes especially at the start before scott got picked up by hope was incredibly weird and forced especially most of what agent woo was saying,2018-07-11
i had a similar reaction posted about it somewhere in this thread,2018-07-11
til about the first credit scenes,2018-07-08
well i watched ant man 1  2 soooo,2018-07-06
both scott and hank atoning for their mistakes  ,2018-07-06
sat in a theater near a family with kids it made me realize how many jokes targeted them it doesn’t feel like a pg13 movie,2018-07-06
i would guess the pride except the mcu doesnt cross over with marvel television at all i cant think of anybody on the west coast who would be that big and powerful,2018-07-06
i personally feel ghost will come get him and theyll go meet up with cap,2018-07-06
cap sends bruce banner to enlist dr pym and scott for the fight against thsnos finds the van brings back antman by ctrlzing the quantum tunnel,2018-07-06
hope mentioned getting stuck in a time vortex or something i think he might find a way out and bump into avengers,2018-07-06
prediction avengers 4 will begin with antman using one of those time vortexes to travel 7 or 8 years into the future set photos show iron man with grey hair and they cast somebody as a 16 year old cassie then  team up with the other avengers and use the quantum realm to go back in time and retrieve each infinity stone before thanos,2018-07-06
as far as they know everything was fine after the new york attack considering iw mainly took place in isolated areas,2018-07-06
scott could have lied he got in trouble for running off last time ,2018-07-06
after ny how would he get in touch with cap he can’t just call them and they i do wish they mentioned it at least though ,2018-07-06
the post credit scene definitely takes place at least a few weeks after the movie cap  crew probably werent keeping up with scott day by day if they were at all i can easily see them not putting focus on seeing what antman was up to in san francisco while they were hidden  around the world having to avoid the us and needing to run to sweden on a dime ,2018-07-06
well i think the ant could probably just crawl oit of the drumset just fine not like he’s tied down,2018-07-06
"i only saw 2 piles of ash maybe hope is just in shock and will pull him out shortly 

also didn’t they see  was going down in ny and consider holding off on the mad science",2018-07-06
yes you wont understand the character relationships fully youll figure it out but having watched the first one will make it matter more,2018-07-06
the first one is an easy watch its small scale heh funny and relatively short ,2018-07-06
to fully enjoy it yes specially for the side characters,2018-07-06
sorta but not really it would help its a fun movie anyhow so might as well do it,2018-07-06
they mention he would still be on probation for another few years,2018-07-06
he didnt go help because marvel wouldnt be able to make antman and the wasp if he did ,2018-07-06
"i think it would have made more sense if the quantum realm altered the rate at which time advanced so scott goes in before the first q ship ever arrives above new york and then they wait for him but disappear before he can be pulled out

this isn’t the case and does bring up some questions though i wonder if he didn’t get involved because it was possibly happening concurrently the timeline is a little tricky to figure out",2018-07-06
he didnt go help because paul rudd wasnt in the script for iw,2018-07-06
"hes on probation but if steve rogers asked him or clint to help they would have come running  they took the house arrest deal to be with their families  cap wouldnt ask them to risk never seeing their kids again

side note  what does the world see in iw  team thanos attacks nyc which ends once maw takes strange  the assassination attempt on vision was much smaller in scale  next attacks were in wakanda which is fairly hidden from the rest of the world   even if scott wanted to help would he know something was going on",2018-07-06
"because he probably couldnt contribute to the extent the others could and when the invasion of wakanda happened it would have been nighttime in san francisco not to mention that the wakanda battle probably lasted a few hours at most before the snap

even if he had been able to be contacted which i dont think there was time to do and get him there he probably wouldnt have left peanut ",2018-07-06
he was fun and entertaining but his character is pretty pointless,2018-07-06
he puts on a good performance as always but his character is moderately irritating,2018-07-06
himself and daniel kaluuya have a scene in widows   scary af,2018-07-07
hilarious hes like an inept boyd crowder but a blackmarket dabbling restauranteur the trailers would paint it like he might be one and done early on but he pops up quite often through the film and even advances the plot if you want a comparison hed be like eric roberts or the russian character in the dark knight where they pop up from timetotime and  disturb ,2018-07-07
i didnt  whats that about,2018-07-07
she blamed hank it seemed unlikely that she would listen to him,2018-07-07
he said his character is based off of a person he knows irl on a jimmy fallon interview when the 1st ant man came out ,2018-07-08
i mean therere a lot of questions about her experience in the quantum realm the spear came from the wings but where did the hoodie come from why is she wearing that hoodie how did her makeup stay perfect as she aged 30 years her hair what did she eat where did she shower or go to the bathroom,2018-07-09
i assume she made it out of quantum realm material  she had 30 years to figure a lot of  out,2018-07-08
who said she was the only one in there,2018-07-08
or that spear,2018-07-08
sadly no it took me by surprise when i saw her in the first film ,2018-07-09
big ant playing the drums ,2018-07-11
nothing worth waiting for ,2018-07-11
"it takes exponentially more energy and force to move as a creature gets bigger so if you doubled the size of an elephant it would take 4x more energy for it to run not 2x  

plus the doubled elephant would collapse under its own weight assuming it was proportional to the regular elephant in other words it would need disproportionately thicker bones to prevent it from breaking its legs whenever it walked 

its the inverse of the same principle allowing ants to carry multiples of their body weight smaller creatures will always be proportionately stronger so if you make a goliath ant it wont be a super strong monster itll just be a super weak giant ant  

antman gets around some of that because  you know  pym particles but maybe there are still similar forces at work when you goliathize a creature 

pym particles dont seem to influence muscle strength relative to body weight for instance the gigantized ants arent super strong  they cant lift 10x their bodyweight

tldr  scaling a creature up doesnt allow it to maintain proportionate strength also pym particles ",2018-07-13
"because hes antman
",2018-07-12
they did explain it takes a lot of his energy  maybe that’s it,2018-07-12
pym particles,2018-07-12
air resistance ,2018-07-12
i agree the ant playing drums would have been way funnier if it wasnt in the trailer,2018-07-07
"dont watch trailers
",2018-07-07
seriously outside of the car chase this whole movie felt so bland,2018-07-06
as far as mcu goes yeah id agree i enjoyed my time but ultimately thought it was pretty forgettable first one was way better,2018-07-06
id much rather skip thor 1 thor 2 and the hulk,2018-07-06
its because they dont add much to the main marvel storyline,2018-07-06
dont forget dell and mercedes,2018-07-08
too little comedy  i thought exactly the opposite  the movie had nothing besides the comedy,2018-07-06
after she knocked their  to sleep i’m guessing she took everything in their pockets ie keys the altoids box you mention etc ,2018-07-06
it was probably in his pocket,2018-07-06
except for thor 2 iron man 2 and avengers 2,2018-07-07
and also thor the dark world and black panther,2018-07-07

he thinks there is tech inside worth millions or billions

so hes the same as he is in the comics ,2018-07-10
im glad that they showed how much of an  pym is in the comics hes kind of a monster sometimes,2018-07-10
his assholeishness mightve been exaggerated by the suit shrinking for cross the villain in the first movie mad him become hyper angry and insane ,2018-07-10
i agree with all of this id add that it was really sciencey almost like they heard the criticism from the first one and leaned into it ,2018-07-14
yea we are def in the minority i had trouble connecting with any of the new characters introduced and felt the exposition dumps were painful to sit through,2018-07-08
totally agree it was painfully boring for the first 40 minutes predictable plot twists cookiecutter ending and gotcha moments  me off some jokes were cringeworthy i dont know maybe it wasnt movies fault but rather me being dozy pena was adorable rudd was ok ,2018-07-08
i agree with you this movie was relatively mediocre and i feel its not worth the movie ticket,2018-07-09
i agreed with you im huge ant man fans while watching itthere’s something wrong but i cant identify it until you mention ‘pacing’ lack of details is another one,2018-07-08
weirdly enough i agree with most of what you said but i enjoyed the movie a lot despite these faults i was just very entertained the whole time in a weird way ,2018-07-08
the story was pretty small but i still found it enjoyable they couldnt have a big story with infinity war just about to happen,2018-07-08
so you didn’t like the movie at all then proceed to list things you liked about it,2018-07-08
youre not wrong  ,2018-07-09
this is the problem with marvel movie storytelling no consequences for any poor decision,2018-07-09
" i so saw that coming though

right im really surprised that so many people didnt see the snap coming its kind of a crucial detail if his timeline was ever gonna catch up to current events ",2018-07-06
wasnt ythat the case with deadpool it was just as shocking only in the opposite way,2018-07-06
"just wanted to add my two cents to your opinion 

first off how many secret operatives could shield have lots it’s shield that’s kind of what they do 

your point about scott and hope being able to take down ghost at any time if they just teamed up sure but scott hasn’t been antman for two years and their relatively dumb reason for hope being mad at scott you mean the fact that he went behind her and hank’s back stole the antman suit and made them enemies of the state a little more than relatively dumb if you ask me 

i do agree that there was a lot of exposition i thought randall park’s agent woo’s exposition of why scott was locked up on house arrest was done well and humorously but ghost’s unfortunately back story was lazily done but sometimes that’s what you gotta do to keep the story moving forward 

i think that janet van dyne’s personality not changing was fine she points out that in the quantum realm she went through evolution that can easily explain why she didn’t go crazy because of isolation over 30 years  

i agree that ghost will probably be the one to save scott and possibly through being in the quantum realm scott will have some answers or solutions in iw2 ",2018-07-06
" was also kind of annoyed that michelle pfeiffer didnt seem to change at all personality wise from being down there so long

i was really expecting her to be slightly evil after being down there and the way she was holding ghosts head healing her part of me anticipated a really dark neck snap

but then remembered its a marvel movie so no dice",2018-07-06
i’m positive they said it was 2yrs after civil war which was part of lang’s house arrest,2018-07-07
how lost will i be seeing this one without seeing the first,2018-07-06
i saw it too,2018-07-07
where was the tim and eric reference other than tim on the boat ,2018-07-07
tim was in the movie too haha i cracked up seeing him on the ferry,2018-07-07
thats a good question,2018-07-07
im sure they didnt know all the thanos stuff was happening im guessing that infinity war all happens in the space of around 3h just around 30m more than the runtime of the movie it seemed to all be happening in the same time as the movie was going on in this case ant man and the wasp happens over 3 days we also know that this post credits scene takes place about 1 week after that so lets say that the new york battle happened 2 hours before scott went into the quantum realm im sure itd take more than 2 hours to set up that portal in the back of luis van so lets say they were putting the portal into the van and not looking at the news so they didnt know it was happening ,2018-07-07
the old suit wouldnt work without the part they took apart to make that thing to track down the lab hank mentioned he had that technology available but never implemented it for scott,2018-07-08
they needed to get the suit for a specific component it had right maybe the suit couldnt function without it,2018-07-08
i hate the mulfunctioning suit so much,2018-07-08
i thought she straight up stole reys outfit while in the quantum realm maybe she found the midiclorians and studied with them ,2018-07-09
why would marvel want to be brought down to star wars level after rotj all the sw movies have either been bad or bland,2018-07-09
im glad the stakes are so much smaller heh in the antman movies if every threat is bigger and badder than the last it just gets exhausting ,2018-07-09
i have to imagine yeah in the midcredits scene scott was gathering the energy for their new friend ghost i imagine that means she needs to be replenished now and again in order to remain stable,2018-07-09
"they made it seem like she could given the fact they need to get the quantum healing energy which makes it seem she isnt 100 cured

",2018-07-09
"i feel like this would have aired and worked so much better before iw 

i know thats not a simple easy change but if that same movie had come out 23 months before iw i think we all would have liked it more and it could have set up some real tension like the post credits scene dont actually show them fading away but show the hanging walkietalkie mic etc ",2018-07-09
michelle pfeiffer’s character almost died but i agree this is definitely the same tone as the first antman more light hearted and fun but with some stakes the first one the yellow jacket almost kills cassie and scott goes quantum to save her marvel films just don’t do death really and love there fake outs even with infinity war you know they are gonna get everyone back minus heimdall and loki probably,2018-07-13
it was certainly a high stakes movie ghost janet and scott couldve died janet and hank pym couldve been lost in the quantum realm forever and scott couldve gone to prison there were more than enough deaths after black panther and infinity war,2018-07-15
have you not seen the midcredits scenespoiler,2018-07-13
i found it more disturbing than anything ,2018-07-08
the marvel movies have been doing this for a while one aftercredits scene is something substantial the other is just a joke,2018-07-08
i thought that after credit scene was brilliant it’s not just a gag that was some  up lynchian high art an ant stuck in a continuous loop of pretending to be human while the world is struck by a cataclysm outrageously eerie it’s such a dark joke if it even is a joke one of my absolute favorite post credit scenes,2018-07-08
could you give a brief description  i stayed for the first after credit scene and didn’t realize there was a second,2018-07-08
ive got a habit now of waiting til after the midcredits and then checking my phone for what the after scene is paid off this time as it was well past midnight and i didnt feel like waiting around for that ,2018-07-08
"was it animated i could be wrong but my recollection is that it was static miniatures 


thank you",2018-07-08
are you talking about all the miniatures i don’t think it was animation but actual miniatures maybe some cgi drawings but the only thing that looked like it was moving was the camera and the credits ,2018-07-08
youre bad at watching movies then shame,2018-11-05
careful this sub will downvote you to oblivion for not liking a marvel movie,2018-07-06
"personality wise i think they are quite different i dont even think they joke in the same way

 tony is egotistical he believes that he is always in control everything begins and ends with tonyboth good and bad he makes jokes at his enemies as a way of showing superiority this is a trait carrying over from his business work

 thor is a leader hes desperately trying to keep his teams morale up his jokes are different they are usually trying to make light of a terrible situation they are about to be in to make sure everyone will go through with it

 scott is insecure he feels out of place and tries to mask his insecurity with general lightheartedness his jokes are usually not aimed at anyone but just general goofiness when hes doing something hes actually skilled at  like breaking into a place to steal some   he doesnt joke

 rocket is damaged he believes nobody out there can love him as a response he tries to push everyone away to prove his subconscious point his jokes are cruel they are targeted at people to try make them feel as bad as he does

 peter quill is a child hes desperately trying to hold onto his past because its the only connection to his humanity and his mother he has his jokes are a form of superiority like tony but unlike tony hes immature and doesnt know when to stop",2018-07-06
"tony is a sarcastic 

thor is a jolly bighearted meathead

scott is a goofy quip machine

i think that marvels whole show is that it’s a film given to you with comedy action inspiration and drama 
there are definitely memorable set pieces the cars the pez the office

"yeah this was kinda how i felt it was like one of those movies thats just kind of there as a movie like your basic  b movie   nothing was really memorable and the story felt kind of forgettable it sucks because the actors were all really on point really felt more like a screenplaystory and maybe director issue

i think you hit the nail on the head seemed like a very boring linear plot and comedy did not land,2018-07-07
"yeah i went in having low expectations and walked away slightly disappointed the villains were boring the only comedy bit that landed for me was penas story telling shtick always good the action was good but yeah i agree there was little to no creativity to the set pieces for the movie than made the first movie stand out


i was expecting the story element tying this to infinity war to be a bit predominant than a mid credits scene oh well",2018-07-07
agreed on pretty much everything ,2018-07-07
yeah i thought this was a pretty standard movie i really dislike people giving it a pass because oh its just a silly marvel film you do know just because its silly that doesnt mean it couldnt have been written better ect ect,2018-07-07
yeah with you on this one ,2018-07-07
i agree with most of your assessment there were a few memorable action scenes like using the truck as a state board i definitely thought the movie was pretty vanilla but no where near the worst mcu film thor 2 holds that one forever in my book ,2018-07-08

they really ruined the movie by not investing in antman such a sad thing to see him not even be that relevant,2018-07-09
wasp was awesome in it youre watching the wrong movie antman is supposed to be light comedy adventure not epic like infinity war ,2018-07-09
go hate some other movie this was great,2018-07-09
as far as regularish people on earth goes there was a brief alien attack in ny the avengers fought them off and they left they dont know whats going on in space or in wakanda so as far as theyre concerned crisis over,2018-07-08
who was going to call them  pym seemed to want to stay out of the avengers affairs in the mcu i mean and in any case was still a fugitive following the sokovia accords  and cap says in iw that antman is on house arrest still   he could have been mistaken but it does explain that he was not interested in recruiting him again,2018-07-08
the only thing that people would really notice is the ship in new york  it appears messes some stuff up then disappears with iron man  this takes about 15 minutes way too fast for anyone to react to  the one in scotland appears similarly briefly  when they come in force they come to wakanda which obviously wouldnt be covered by the news  so essentially they would have just heard about the first ship in new york and have no idea that there was more coming,2018-07-09
also michael peña character at first thought the ant was scott but then later acted normal when he talked to scott ,2018-07-11

ikr he did a pretty good job being both annoying and a villain,2018-07-06
i love the antman movies a lot more than other marvel flicks because hes a superhero and dad i really like the scenes between him and his daughter the small talk with other characters like agent woo him having hobbies  these small things more defined the universe which i at least appreciated whereas it seems like other superheroes just straight up fight all day every day,2018-07-07
i wouldn’t call it boring but i left saying it was “meh” it was entertaining enough but i don’t feel i had to see it in theatres like the other marvel movies the most exciting part for me was the midcredit scene but yeah i see where you’re coming from ,2018-07-07
there really isn’t and the film even pokes fun at the exposition it does lay out you call a 2 minute origin story a screeching hault jeez,2018-07-07
the movie has pacing and tone problems but i dont think its due to exposition ,2018-07-07

totally agree with this comment  i had the exact same sentiments,2018-07-08
i do agree that it felt slightly like a promotional teaser for infinity war part 2,2018-07-08
the pena gag was  hilarious this time around too i was glad they delivered,2018-07-06

youre not being overly critical and you gave legitimate reasons as to what you enjoyed and didnt enjoy about the film yet youre being downvoted like crazy  reddit sometimes,2018-07-09
the only countdown that bothers me was evas her deadline and event of the movie are so closed together other than that im fine with it especially fbi vs scott races it becomes such a nice comedic moment,2018-07-09
there was also a lot of we need x to facilitate the plot  we need a quantum doohickey  we need whats in scotts head  we need to talk to bill foster we need an old suit   we need that grandma trophy  we need access to our lab  xcon needs to revise those plans with scott  oh no they took all our stuff  we need it all back,2018-07-09
why is diversity in characters bothering you,2018-07-09
im sure there was an indian or native american kid excited to see someone that looked like them in a superhero movie and remember marvel movies are seen by international audiences,2018-07-09
"i think there are at most 6 dramatic count downs you give     
1 fishburne to ghost you have a couple weeks to live     
2 fishburne to ghost you have days to live     
3 the security proposal is first thing in the morning     
4 the vector shift in two hours will leave me lost until the next century     
5 we only have 15 minutes in quantum space      
6 lang leaves the university to beat wu to his house    
7 lang leaves the lab to beat wu to his house     
8 lang leaves the pier to beat wu to his house     
but 1 and two are the same countdown its just that time has passed 
ditto with 4 and 5 both of these count downs make a lot more sense than having a timer on a bomb 6 7 and 8 arent really countdowns i dont know exactly what they are 
race conditions maybe  and number 3 is a deadline so no less than 2 dramatic countdowns and maybe as many as 6 ",2018-07-09
why would you ever look at discussion about a movie before watching it,2018-07-06
"same im casually reading through the thread and spoilers even though i am a huge mcu fan and literally went offline for a few days before iw release to avoid spoilers

" i will never understand why people cheered for the pager scene in iw the reality is maybe 23 people knew who danvers was from the comics and was legitimately excited about that money the other 20 were probably people who read internet articles about the captain marvel film and cheered in attempts to pass off how cool and “in the know” they are about comics 

why does this even matter just enjoy the ride and dont worry about other people no offense but this is kind of coming across as like minor gatekeeping",2018-07-06
why does people being happy make you so angry,2018-07-06
or maybe people just got done watching half of their famous funny friends die and were cheering at the idea of someone coming along and making everything okay again,2018-07-06
"this is the case with every thread on every big movie if you look at the black panther reaction thread positive reactions were downvoted

it’s a result of reddits system where people vote up or down only when they have a strong opinion about a post when someone writes something thats kind of interesting they’ll just read on when they think yes or  you they’ll vote this leads to  kind of hivemindy voting trends in the bigger subs

the best thing is to just not let it bother you too much",2018-07-06

infinity war sequel opens up scott is floating around the microcosm a random person picks up the twoway radio and tells scott about half the world disappearing scott is shocked while wondering who is thanos the person says they cant help him he gets them to call his daughter she is also missing he is determined now he dodges some water bears and finds the very time vortex he was told to stay away fromhe disappears to before the snapspoiler ,2018-07-06
ghost just wanted to get the secret serum that cured her literally nothing else she never changed once in the entire film and then magically got cured that is as onenote of a villain as you will ever see,2018-07-06
huh i kind of felt the opposite way i thought iw performed as expected not the best avengersmultiple superhero movie but sufficient enough personally i thought ghosts storyline especially the ending was pretty weak but in this movie the protagonists carried the show with the humor and ability to connect with the audience i enjoy movies where i can connect with the characters on a personal level ant man was that kind of movie for me ,2018-07-07
"huh i felt really different compared to you on this movie i felt a lot of the humor was off for me like there were some genuine funny moments that i laughed at but there were also a lot of moments that were set up to be funny but just fell flat for me and the theater audience i honestly laughed more in gotg2 and i didnt find that movie that great either 

i also felt like the villains were  poor in this movie which really made the movie feel as you said underwhelming this was the movie that made me realize and agree with that statement about marvel movies needing good villains 

ghost was a decent antagonist but she wasnt much of a villain and the mob guy was just straight up cartoony the movie never made me feel super invested in the outcome i didnt feel enough tension within the movie itself and its characters the movie wasnt bad but it also wasnt exciting for me which brings me back to that underwhelming feeling  it sucks because i really loved the first movie which really thrilled me with excitement and then this one felt like it was just kind of going through the motions its better than the bad mcu movies like thor 2 and iron man 2 id even put it past gotg2 but thats about where it sits for me just a bit past gotg2 i feel like they could have done a lot better with the story of this movie but got complacent for some reason ",2018-07-07
im pretty sure there were ashes floating in place of all three of them though if hope survived there would have been just two ash shadow things  right,2018-07-07
what would be really depressing is if she had her suit on just in case something happened and after her parents got snapped she shrunk and we see the dust from hank and janet but then they pan down and show us the tiniest amount of it on the ground that would make me cry,2018-07-07
in theory couldnt scott use the regulator to regrow from the quantum realm or is that not possible because of the going in through the quantum tunnel,2018-07-07
that’s a possibility her first reaction on seeing her parents disintegrate would be to shrink and observe ,2018-07-07
well scott is under house arrest for 2 years so infinity war could be happening anytime during,2018-07-08
" so cap says that ant man is still under house arrest

he could have been mistaken and not realized he had just gotten out or was generally referring to the fact that even if he was done with house arrest he still had a plea deal that would have taken him away from his daughter if he got involved again

same as hawkeye they had families that needed them  i dont think this line proves a timeline  it was just one character explaining why two others were going to sit out",2018-07-08
" you are right it doesnt add up even if you assume there is a time jump in iw because they do fly from europe to the us and to africa giving a little time for the events to be playing outand scott to get off house arrest there is zero chance they are conducting some experiment during the middle of the crisis after new york was attackedtheyd be geared up


but but but there is a chance war machine just isnt fully up to date on scott and hasnt been keeping close tabs because he doesnt want to mess with his family life hes not a soldier after all hes just a good guy so am2 takes place before any of iw

so the experiment to get the energy might had been so they could get ghost ready to fight after the attack on nyc in iw thats the only way it makes sense

edit also the after credit scenes dont always seem to be fully canon for example im getting thunderball ross to join the avengers when im2 seems him being rejected from the team ",2018-07-08

theres no universe where this movie was worse than thor 2,2018-07-10
it was personally one of my favorite mcu movies easily in the top seven for me yea you have to disconnect from logic a bit but you have to to do that for every marvel movie the jokes hit the action scenes were creative and entertaining and i loved the dynamic between lang and his daughter in addition a more grounded movie was exactly what marvel needed after iw ,2018-07-11
"im not cold or anything i laughed out loud the first antman which i love ragnarok i died gaurdians everything though most of the jokes in gotg2 fell flat 
but i hardly laughed watching this movie the entire theater was losing it and im just sitting there feeling like im watching on of the worst marvel movies and wondering if i was the crazy one

i heard this movie had very little post production feiges words and it shows it was just kind of a mess and worse yet all the world building they were doing with goliath and the quantam realm is going to have serious repercussions for the future of marvel as a whole    and that worries me

tldr  i loved antman and i found this movie to be a terrible mess",2018-07-10

pro tip dont watch trailers for movies youre definitely going to see,2018-07-07
"i 100 agree that when other movies like spiderman got to use the mcu to not have to spend time on narrating their movie antman and the wasp definitely suffered because a lot of the development of the story supposedly happened off screen and not even in another mcu movie  it feels like a whole movie or at least a short or tv episode was missing that gave us backstory
the whole story was pretty much meh and predictable  but i’ll give it points for cooldifferent action scenes of shrinkinggrowingphasing and  an after credits scene that made the movie really worth it",2018-07-06
"good points

had a lot of jokes stretched over too thin a plot ghost was an interesting idea but poor execution janet is the same thing that truth serum scene just went on and on it’s funny but not that funny the action was solid

i’d see a movie with more ghost i’d see a movie with a more interesting rescue of janet

this one was just not that satisfying",2018-07-06
"interesting analysis to be honest i actually have a theory that ghost could be sort of an anti hero come the next avengers film considering the 35 of the main people helping her have turned to dust you have to wonder if she survived if so she might still have her powers if they still needed the quantum energy

also to me part of this movies charm to me is how it gives us a breather from the whole thanos fiasco gives us a still interesting story with jokes and action then reminds us at the end that this is where the fun begins",2018-07-06

 hes seen on set with iron man  cap  and hulk in nyc so he has a big real i believe,2018-07-08
my read of that scene was that it acted as an opening for him to be in infinity war 2 there is also currently speculation that thanos snap didnt  people but just removed them from ever having existed the theory is then that all the characters will forget about the people who disappeared within this theory scott would maintain his memory due to being in the quantum realm at the time of the snap,2018-07-08

put it this way  he’s bigger than the guardians of the galaxy bigger than vision or scarlet witch doctor strange etc if i had to compare him to someone in terms of “bigness” or importance i’d say he’s similar to black panther

"so because they became quantumly entangled janet was prepared just in that brief exact moment hank and hope fired up the quantum tunnel to communicate through scott 

she isnt exactly busydistracted  and has had loads of time to contemplate and prepare for future possibilities

nbsp

so how did they program the ant to follow scotts meticulous housearrest activities schedule

theyve had ants doing everything from household tasks to assembling complex machinerycomponents im not sure why you would choose here to end your suspension of disbelief also recall from the first movie that the ants can be instructed to do virtually anything via thoughtstimulation

nbsp

so hope meets burch dressed casually and ten seconds later is suddenly dressed in a brand spankin new suit just in time to fight no big reveal of her or of what is clearly the better suit

remember how small a size the suits are shrunken to when not in use its easily within the realm of possibility that she simply shrank and swapped outfits in a few secobds before dramatically reappearing in full costume

nbsp

hank seemed okay letting her deal with burches mooks all alone but got anxious when the ghost arrived if my daughter were surrounded by gunmen even with a supersuit id be worried

a healthy portion of her arc in the first movie revolved around hank not wanting to allow her to rusk her life  he is afraid of losing her like he lost his wife  the reveal of the wasp suit at the end was the culmination  hank finally accepting his daughters will to act and effectively giving his blessing if he reverted to panicking at the sight of her fighting some goons telling her to run or something it would totally undermine both that key theme of the first movie and a main theme of the second movie selflessly helping others despite personal risk  contrasted by ghost selfishly albeit sympatheticallyunderstandably risking others to save oneself

nbsp

so they can take off their helmets at different sizes i was under the impression it worked like a spacesuit with its own atmosphere inside and that they couldnt breach it at different sizes without being effected  dying why am i bother asking this in an antman movie

the helmet protects from adverse effects to the brain caused by exposure to pym particles afaik they are highly recommended for prolonged exposure but not totally mandatory at all times

nbsp

oh so bill foster the guy they just happen to be asking information from on their ghost troubles is also coincidentally behind the ghost troubles they are investigating well how about that

is it that absurd though he is pretty much the only other expert on the subject and hank was likely indisposed when they searched for someone to help her that  his ties to hank and shield make this not that far of a stretch imho

nbsp

i love stan lee  but this has to be his worst cameo in a marvel movie it was a slow humorous moment totally crammed into a fastpaced action scene it stood out like a sore thumb

subjective taste i thought it was hilarious and if got a  huge pop from the packed theater i was in actually might be my favourite stan lee cameo so clearly we had a polar opposite reaction lol

nbsp

just like half of the laws of physics in antman movies the physics of the quantum realm are left ambiguous but it would have been nice to explain why hank needed to suit up if he could just survive in that environment without it or how janet managed to survive several decades there or how it changed her

again the suit prevents adverse effects of exposure to pym particles not mandatory at all times but prolobged exposure without a suit has serious repurcussions see how crossyellowjacket went unhinged in the first movie

nbsp

bill foster gave ava a matter of weeks to live so why did she get so desperate as if she had hours even enough to kidnap cassie or  janet

he gave her 2 weeks to live and offered no concrete alternative telling her nothing beyond hank and his wife are smart maybe they can help you as far as she can see the only tangibleactionable cure is healing herself at janets expanse  and the window to do so while she is in the quantum realm ia rapidly closing along with the window to rescue her she grows to think that bill is going to let her die by refusing to act imho this is all perfectly incharacter for a woman who was used as a cold blooded assassin coerced with the promise of a cure then betrayed and abandoned to die when shield collapsed

as per janet yes hopefully they will explain much much more in a thurd movie",2018-07-07
are you me,2018-07-06
no thats pretty accurate however i dont think every one of these movies needs to be a huge thing i really enjoyed that it was relatively low stakes and pretty laid back especially after the body blows to the feels that infinity war delivered,2018-07-09
wel li see it as theres no clear cut villain because overall at the moment thanos is supposed to be the main threat we have in our minds so this film having some not really villainy antagonists is more than enough it doesnt take away from what thanos is doing and hes still fresh in our minds especially after mid credits it reminds us yeah hey this was a good film but dont forget thanos still  everything up type of deal,2018-07-09
i really didnt mind not having such an intense villain the last release being black panther we got a good villain and a lot of action this movie was more of like a heist movie it seems more realistic when some movies can not have such high stakes fighting and more of a smaller mission oriented movie to set up future plot lines in the larger world,2018-07-09
"marvel genre bends a lot of the films to keep them fresh and distinguish them from each other they hired an actor known for his comedic performances for a reason because antman is being handled as more of a superhero comedy compared to the others out of the entire new lineup his superhero gimmick is probably the silliest and so they try to embrace that with a more lighthearted tone

i cant really fault them for being campy and lighthearted because its antman some heroes deal with cosmic demons and international terrorist organizations and some heroes ride ants and build box forts with their daughters

one of the things i like about the mcu is their willingness to shake up the formula from time to time i think this movie was timed perfectly after the more somber infinity war the avengers have been getting more and more grim so antman was designed to show us the fun and wacky side of superheros again",2018-07-09
"antagonist  villain

ghost was an antagonist which was refreshing",2018-07-09
i agree with you but i will say that there isn’t anything wrong with a fun superhero movie with low stakes it uses the characters well you have fun watching it and as long as they portray the “superhero abilities” well then it’s a success it’s refreshing to me to have a fun movie that just tries to be fun and not make it into a “the world will end” scenario it’s light delightful and easy to watch i’m okay with that,2018-07-10
" dont see a logical reason as to why ghost and laurence fishbournes character couldnt have had a conversation with hank at some point during the movie about ghosts condition

well the fact hank had ghosts father fired and discredited one reason second fishbourne and hank dont like each other 

or even have had a conversation about ghosts condition in the years leading up to the events in this movie

well hank and hope have been on the run and hiding in the years leading up to the events in this movie so thats a problem

also they gave no explanation as to how janet was able to cure her

they did she has year inside the quantum realm absorbed quantum energy and that energy help stabilize ghost its bad comic book bs but it is what it is",2018-07-09
"hank hadnt started any serious work on reaching the quantum realm until after the events of the first antman and with how janet and hank were on the run its not hard to imagine that it took a ton of time for any real progress to be made on the tunnel its possible that ghost and fishbournes character didnt even know about it until they noticed that someone had been buying a bunch of stuff for a quantum tunnel years later it was also established that fishbournes character had a deepseated resentment towards hank and was way too pigheaded to seek him out for help

with janets powers i have a feeling the quantum realm powers are going to be one of those powers of convenience where they do things that suit whatever situation they want as for why she has them in the first place she absorbed them after having been in that realm and studying the energy for 30 years",2018-07-09

that is what makes ant man feel so different from ant man and the wasp

edgar wright made the first movie this one is just pure peyton and you can feel it

the movie is just a straight dvd movie ",2018-07-10
that kind of stood out to me too but i just figured thats probably just scotts love for naming things coming out ,2018-07-06
"  i think it took away from any question about whether janet would make it back or not

it didnt really ghost was pretty close to killing janet when she was her way back from the quantum relm so the suspense was still there also they had janet in the flashback for the first scene so either way she had to be on the poster since she was integral to the story",2018-07-06
shes probably signed for multiple movies and put it as part of her contract thankfully i didnt notice the names on the poster beforehand this was the most blind id gone into an mcu movie in a while ,2018-07-06
"are you implying that there was even a slight chance that the resolution at the end wasnt going to happen

of course she was going to come back marvel have a big problem with these solo films and their incredibly predictable plots there was no way that they werent going to save her and therefore there are no stakes or tension for what is the major plot point

we shouldnt be praising films like this i want to be at the edge of my seat questioning whats going to happen next not waiting for walter goggins character to be thwarted and the mom to return from the shadow realm",2018-07-06
"the giant ant is playing drums 

thats it yes ",2018-07-06
"after the end of the credits an extra scene returns to scotts house where a tv is showing an emergency broadcast transmission the camera pans around the house as the sound of drums can be heard its revealed that the giant ant hank programmed to mimic the daily routines of scott under house arrest is still there playing the drums

the scene turns to black and the words antman and wasp will return are displayed",2018-07-06
because the plot demands it ,2018-07-07
shrinkexpand,2018-07-07
i kept thinking someone is gonna disappear ,2018-07-07
bill is simple hes a good dude but he resents hank and he wants to help someone else who hank hurt ,2018-07-07
i think the heart of the story was really hank trying to find janet everything else including villains is secondary and i think that’s a good thing,2018-07-07
i really thought we were gonna learn who goggins boss was in one of the stingers i was kind of surprised that never developed ,2018-07-07
what are we supposed to be looking at here his background thats just particles in the quantum realm its not a person or entity,2018-07-09
popular fan theory is thanos his presence just spread at the moment of the snap doubt itd be dormammu or some other entity cuz i just cant imagine them getting into having antman fight a secondary antagonist in avengers 4 ,2018-07-09
pretty sure the ship only showed up over nyc to get the time stone from dr strange and then bounced,2018-07-10
"like the other guy said the ship was a brief appearance then it was mostly in space except the wakanda stuff which was probably a few days until the big battle then thanos shows up and snap 

black widow says scotts on house arrest before they go to wakanda so maybe that happens a few days before the snap then the plot of amatw in those few days",2018-07-10
it seemed like everything in the movie besides the midcredit scene happened before the snap which means scottantman was fully available to help the avengers they just didnt call him,2018-07-10
i thought the giant man and toddler man sequences were creativeinteresting,2018-07-09
"you actually struck on something i felt was missing but couldn’t pinpoint it i really did miss the tiny antman adventures from the first one good point i don’t agree with the villain being one dimensional which villain and what dimension i’m not sure there is a conventional villain it’s just a smattering of antagonists which is kind of refreshing 

also i’m not sure calling a movie the worst marvel movie of recent years is even a critique there has been such a ridiculous high bar set in recent years i loved the movie yet i still might call it one of the worst mcu films of recent years though i’m all for people downvoting opinions in pursuit of objective truth and appreciation of quality i don’t believe your post deserves that have an upvote",2018-07-09
"why is everyone downvoting this he makes good points

the villains were bad and going small in this movie was mainly used to disappear the fight scenes in general felt pretty lame

i’ll add ghost and bill foster were bad charactersantagonists the glossedover fact that pym  over foster at some point early on and the terrible janetevolvedandcanhealghostfornoreason final act despite some funny moments from the supporting cast this was a step down from the original imo",2018-07-09
"horrible subplot with the southern guy

how memorable this movie must be that i watched it 2 nights ago and cant remember what youre talking about",2018-10-30
"i agree with your assessment it felt like a complete lack of any conflict the entire movie could have been avoided if instead of stalking hank ghost and laurence fishburnes character approached hank like  adults 4 years ago or whenever it was that ghost broke free from shield

just a simple hey hank heres a little girl i turned into a crazy phasing assassin but shes kind of dying and you know about quantum  so maybe you and i can work on this together rather than just me in a old house somewhere

like man i get that they apparently kind of hated each other 30 years ago but i have trouble believing that he wouldnt put it aside to essentially save his pseudo adopted daughter it seemed weird that he made her hate hank only to change his mind last minute i never once believed he wanted hank hope or scott dead

like maybe make hank actually 100 responsible for the death of ghosts mother and father then i would totally buy why she didnt want hanks help and her hatred is a little more justified but hank kind of hand waves it away and then its never really brought up again

then at the end ghost just disappears down an alleyway so is she just running around free now

and getting janet seemed way too easy shrink and go on a  wonka chocolate boat ride and there she is

also walton goggins is a  treasure and he felt wasted here if he was going to be in mcu man he could have been a great villain somewhere",2018-07-06
"im guessing different humor for different folks while i 100 agree with your assessment about tension we are total opposites on the funny scale when it comes to comparing ragnarok and this movie i laughed many more times over to ragnarok than i did to this movie  i think that just amounts to different personal tastes in humor 
as you said though the story really lacked for the lack of a better word the tension it needed to really root for the characters ",2018-07-07
"yes i’m not alone i didn’t think ragnarok was that funny it had about 5 jokes that made me chuckle but i cringed during the shake weight and  hulk bits easily my least favorite phase 3 movie even though vol 2 had forced jokes the heart drama visuals music and sincerity in it overrode the humor imo

amw was the complete opposite of ragnarok for me because i thought it was hilarious almost all the time maybe a handful of jokes fell flat but most were great i was laughing hard at some scenes like luis’ recap little scott running around the school ants getting chomped rip and every time woo was on screen it had some pacing issues but the characters more than made up for that",2018-07-07
this movie just didn’t feel as exciting as the first one and the plot wasn’t as focused in my opinion,2018-07-07
too much monologuing  by all characters not just the villains   editspelling,2018-07-09
"yeah it never really felt like they shouldve been fighting her felt like the hero path wouldve been to team up with her after goliath revealed the situation then together they would face the villain which would be the black market guy but they never really built him into a credible enough threat to either group let alone them combined so they needed to keep fighting ghost because the goons and government were never built into serious problems 

the whole we need to drain hanks wife because shes soaked up quantum energy thing made no sense surely one super genius would think why not just build a container to capture the energy instead of having to find someone that has been shrunk to a subatomic scale for 30 years who may not even be alive which is obviously what they did in the end credit scene with the container collecting quantum healing energy for their new ghost friend",2018-07-09
it seemed like everything in the movie besides the midcredit scene happened before the snap which means scottantman was fully available to help the avengers they just didnt call him ,2018-07-10
my biggest issue with the movie is the amount that they turn to the camera and say hey this is whats going on,2018-07-06
the prologue shouldve been ghosts origin we already know the story of janet and hank ,2018-07-06
"when was thanos in nyc ebony maw and obsidian was in nyc short fight then the rest in space fight way later in wakanda where thanos shows up and does the snap plus antman is in california odds of hearing about are slim maybe about hearing tony missing 

ps loved the movie felt like a rescue mission more than a straight villain movie like that lighter feel for his movies 8510",2018-07-06
most likely “cap” and the gang had no idea scott got out of house arrest and scott just decided to work with the pyms instead,2018-07-06
"the nyc attacked probably lasted 20 minutes and they obviously didnt know the wakanda attack was coming

its really not a stretch to fill in the blanks as to why antman wasnt around ",2018-07-06
its mentioned by woo in a conversation with cassie that scott will be on parole for 3 years after his house arrest maybe scott thinks its easier to fly under the radar and not violate the terms of his parole if he works with hank hope and janet versus the avengers,2018-07-06
i thought that too but ava was dying and she couldnt be reasoned with shes been through so much in her life and so much pain that she was tired of waiting morpheus promised to fix her and he couldnt ava was not going to take the promise of another scientist ,2018-07-10
my thought exactly but then i think that shes already fed up with all the promises about a cure and she didnt trust anyone anymore,2018-07-10
noticed that too one explanation i thought of is how were irrational when under immense pain and i think they tried to go that route too but they couldve done a better job establishing it imo,2018-07-10
curious as to why you saw this but not infinity war,2018-07-10

that is michael douglas not martin sheen fyi lol,2018-07-10
michael douglas wants a word with you,2018-07-11
lol martin sheen isnt that the robot bartender from passengers ,2018-07-11
" i liked it but coming off of movies with significant weight like black panther and infinity war i will say that it feels like there is less at stake  

honestly it was refreshing not to have some dumb world ending plot its a more ant sized story

significant weight to me just means ridiculous overdramatic stakes that of course arent going to get blownexcept in infinity wars case but even the consequences clearly arent very devastating nobody is actually dead from the snap

its really hard for me to get behind any film that uses such stakes anymore ",2018-07-06
"  what the dickens

i think that was the point of the character he was already giving off a weird nerdy and wholesome vibe it was completely in character for him ",2018-07-11
hes meant to be  portrayed as a wholesome wellintentioned agent on the rise,2018-07-11
thanks for the downvotes,2018-07-09

"i actually wished we didnt see the ant and just got that ominous beeping of the emergency broadcast and instead of the funny antman and the wasp will return bit just give us thanos will return

just go all in on this marvel",2018-07-06
yes,2018-07-06
its subjective  i liked the 1st better but it seems most like this one better,2018-07-06
a little better than the first,2018-07-06
yes both are great id rank them in the bottom half of the list of mcu movies but were also talking about a series of movies that have been primarily awesome overall so thats not a bad thing ,2018-07-06
no first one was funnier had a more compelling narrative and more relatable characters this one wasnt bad but not particularly great either,2018-07-06
no ,2018-07-06
the actress that played ghost was the main character on syfys killjoys glad shes getting more exposure shes both talented and gorgeous ,2018-07-08
how rude you dare forget antonio banderas’ death by the jaws of a bloodthirsty seagull,2018-07-10
unless you count the post credit scene then it’s probably a few trillion at least,2018-07-09
that you see i imagine a lot of those goons in the cars had pretty critical injuries,2018-07-09
i think all mcu movies are just an automatic pg13 at this point,2018-07-10
yeah but isn’t that the point of the end credits scene not everyone did end up happy and even if they did what’s wrong with that,2018-07-13
the previous movie literally killed half the cast at the end a happy ending is fine by me ,2018-07-13
i see potential for a crossover with dr strange in relation with the subatomic,2018-07-08
i think theyre saving that for infinity war part 2,2018-07-08
i agree the film wasnt bad but it wasnt something id be interested in watching again either ,2018-07-11
i don’t think he cares ,2018-07-07
"his goal isn’t to  half of life his goal is to preserve resources by killing half of life big difference

 if some more than that die it’s not a big deal",2018-07-07
its not dumb its collateral damage ,2018-07-07
"they are used to the avengers doing their thing and they had no idea about wakanda or the stakes  hank was always very happy to stay out of that stuff  and they had to get ghost her quantum healing stuff it seemed pretty clear that the machine worked well and they werent concerned about any issues

fury didnt even seem to be aware of what was happening until it was too late",2018-07-08
"i doubt anyone knew what was happening at wakanda only characters with advance tech like samuel l jackson knew something occured there and he didnt even know what just high energy around that area remember wakanda is pretty secluded from the rest of the world until you actually get in wakanda through that field it looks like basic african land

as for the new york battle involving tony stark  happens in new york all the time basically from loki to vulture also the only way characters like wanda or vision knew about it was through watching tv  and i doubt scott or the pym family watch tv that often",2018-07-08
they probably didnt know about what was happening in wakanda because fury was just learning about it in infinity war scene ,2018-07-08
"they werent doing an experiment they were trying to make sure ghost stayed out of quantum phases they were doing it on the rooftop because theyre still not legally allowed to sue this tech and need to be low key

maybe they were trying to leverage the tech to help against thanos on their own we dont know the details and they wouldnt have known of the snap coming at that exact moment maybe they thought things were focused in wakanda for now",2018-07-08
"infinity war takes place over a relatively short period of time maybe like one or two days the only events they might even know about are new york and that lasted maybe an hour and a day or two before the snappening

they could definitely think its no big deal to be 3000 miles away from new york wont be the first time a major event happened somewhere else in the world iron man fights all over the world spiderman is new york avengers new york and sokovia hulk is brooklyn and new york thor is new mexico cap america is dc un and germany even dr strange wraps up hong kong like it didnt happen",2018-07-11
the low in other words personal stakes was a plus for me refreshing to see an engaging plot thats not about the fate of the galaxy etc,2018-07-09
would argue the stakes are highest for the character i wish they made the justinthenickoftime moments more exciting,2018-07-08
feels like the movie spells it out for us they werent really in a position to be checking news broadcasts ,2018-07-06
agree about the thanos fight but my friends convinced me that its not worth nit picking that aspect ,2018-07-06
i can’t believe people like you exist who sees a sequel without seeing the original,2018-07-07
i feel like you might have not understood a decent amount of the references made in regards to what happened in the first movie by not watching it should have probably watched it before going to see this,2018-07-07
youre weird dude you didnt watch the first one are you five ,2018-07-07
i think an interesting aspect of that is that while some found it to be an end credit gag others found it eerie and disturbing it’s a window into the post snap world you have an empty house with the tv alarm going off with only a programmed ant going through his daily motions undisturbed for who knows how long,2018-07-07
tbh i thought the first one was way funnier,2018-07-06
yeah twenty films ago their humor  but now their humor is really hitting its stride obvious s because iron man 1 has tons of great jokes,2018-07-06
" i thought janet was going to betray hank and  him

any reason why you had this theory",2018-07-07
dont know why youre being downvoted i think a small group of people were theorizing that janet would turn out to be bad after being driven insane by being gone for so long ,2018-07-07
strongly disagree on ghost ,2018-07-07
the guy trying to buy and then steal the lab was the laziest villain to me he seemed to only exist to throw unnecessary drama in at least ghost tied into the story though i believe if she had just asked they would have gladly helped her ,2018-07-08
" imo the laziest writing anyones done in the mcu to date

the first ant man is probably one of the worst villains ive ever seen only rivaled by jurassic world 2s villain i doubt ghost could be even 5 as badly written as those",2018-07-07
i see why you may think its fillery now but i dont think this comment will age well i feel like this movie was a foundation builder towards critical avengers 4 events specifically the quantum tech and janet,2018-07-08
it would need to have some kind of self contained power supply as well and assuming they have bathrooms self contained plumbing too there are lot of magic science in the movie does anybody really think you can train an ant to play the drums ,2018-07-09
" wouldnt that lab have been a complete wreck inside the way they were throwing the mini version around between vehicles

i thought the same thing i feel like that wasnt explained in the movie",2018-07-09
i feel the  stuff is organic since part of the premise is that hope and doc pym are fugitives in the eyes of the government they are criminalsso makes sense they have to work with criminals to get the resources they need they cant exactly buy stuff from legit distributors ,2018-07-09
i said the exact same thing to my buddy  this is this first marvel film in a while that i havent really loved  it was a fun watch but i have no interest in ever seeing it again,2018-07-10
yeah when woo broke into his house when the ant was taking scotts place and cassie covered for him by saying he was really sick and puking a lot,2018-07-06
"my dad doesnt feel so good

i missed this lol",2018-07-06
fantastic really,2018-07-07
wats ur point ,2018-07-06
its like the speed force basically its plot magic anything the plot needs can be found in the quantum realm it makes no sense ,2018-07-06
i for one appreciate the smaller scale not every super hero has to fight the end of the world especially not someone like ant man,2018-07-06
lol i bet people are thinking youre being racist for stating one of his previous roles that hes well known for randall park was kim jong un in the interview for people who are confused ,2018-07-07
i think they actually made michelle pfieffer look older than she actually was so she could look closer in age to michael douglas,2018-07-07
abandoned lot in sf  bwahahahaha    no such animal ,2018-07-07
you think they keep tabs on all the abandoned lots ,2018-07-07
you really think that widow just has scott’s legal trouble memorized or that it’s even public knowledge lol he literally got off house arrest like a day or two before infinity war theres no way for widow to know that,2018-07-07
he lives on the west coast and hangs out with fugitives i dont see how he could have gotten to nyc or wakanda in time ,2018-07-07
antman is stuck in the quantum realm because janet hope and hank got “snapped” janet also mentioned something along the line of “dont go into a time vortex while in the quantum realm” so that might come into play during 4vengers,2018-07-08
"udinosaurgonads did a good job of explaining the first after credits scene now ill tell you the second one though fair warning i may not do it justice its quite brilliant in my opinion and describing it may detract from it

so context scott is under house arrest so when hope and hank had to take him with them they chemically programmed a giant ant to imitate his daily routine while wearing his ankle bracelet so that the feds wouldnt get suspicious

the second scene opens in scotts house with a tv displaying the emergency broadcast image and playing a constant tone you can faintly hear sirens and other sounds of chaos from outside the house as the camera pans through the apartment you hear a beat alongside the tvs tone the camera pans into a hallway showing the giant ant playing on a drumset it finishes its recital with a little flourish and the screen goes black

the emergency broadcast tone continues playing for 23 more seconds",2018-07-09
yeah that prologue laid the thesis of the movie on incredibly thick,2018-07-06
i am shocked there are people who didnt see it coming,2018-07-06
that isnt a plot hole the heroes say as much but ghost is kind of off her rocker and doesnt listen or care ,2018-07-08
she blames hank for her parents death and the last time she trusted someone to fix her they turned out to be nazis ,2018-07-08
i think you nailed it  goggins was a blast and ghost was a missed opportunity great stuff,2018-08-01
yeah this is a funny movie,2018-07-07
if you liked the first one you would love it,2018-07-07
most of the comedy didnt land theres a recurring bit about truth serum that was cringe,2018-07-07
i expected it to happen that way and really liked it it sets up antmans situation for avengers 4 nicely,2018-07-12
unless yo  is uncle ben,2018-07-09
i think the earlier deaths in infinity war mattered possibly comic books would never bring people back to life,2018-07-09
"its obvious that the next movie is going to address the snap in some manner and its easy to presume that will bring about some kind of corrective resolution but its a pretty big assumption to claim to know what form that resolution will take

it seems a fairly safe assumption that deaths from iw will be revered in some fashion yes  that doesnt mean all of them will you cant say that character deaths dont mean anything when we really have no idea what may or may not be reversed at this point",2018-07-09
ghost definitely had a threatening presence,2018-07-09
"im sure theres a transformer coming up soon thatll be more up your alley

and i can not stop laughing at your last sentence",2018-07-09
or the past  could go far enough back to stop thanos from attacking thor though im 100 just guessing at this,2018-07-06
i took them as being indicative of how active of a black market for exotic tech is now that so much of it is openly in the world why deal in machine guns when you can deal in quantum doodads and such,2018-07-06
 it was a couple shots of scotts apartment followed by his ant substitute hitting the drums scene from the trailer,2018-07-06
into scotts place and you hear the emergency broadcast signal move up and find the big ant playing the drums the antman and the wasp will return comes up on screen then  appears at the end ,2018-07-06

i didnt notice the 3d much  most dealt with people standing infront or behind glass,2018-07-06
yes mainly for the quantum realm sequences and any action scene with the shrunk heroes,2018-07-06
we must be outliers but my wife and i literally commented to one another that the 3d was really good  id recommend it,2018-07-06
what part of the movie would that have been i dont remember burch ever mentioning shield,2018-07-06
special thanks is usually dedicated to people that the producers or crew wish to thank in this case they wanted to thank jorge lucas ,2018-07-07

"i agree the magic hands solution was very weak and kind of out of no where they set up that she might be more than human only a few minutes prior but it completely erased the story arc of goliath trying to convince ghost to let her live because shes this scientific genius that can come up with a solution 

it was just odd ",2018-07-07

is it that they dont see a lot of movies and really get a kick out of them 

are they simpletons and just super giggly

in fairness they explain this in an offhand line in infinity war when cap and everyone meet up with banner someone asks where clint and scott are black widow responds by saying something about going on the lam like cap falcon and black widow did being too tough on their families so they took a deal that put them on house arrest which also explains why hawkeye isnt there in iw,2018-07-06

i havent laughed this hard in a while if this movie doesnt prove that marvel are completely untouchable then nothing ever will

the reality is all people care about is humor and cool visual effects in action scenes they dont care that this is a cookiecutter thin plot they dont care that marvel must have purposefully tried to make two villains that turned out this bad they dont care that not a single character had an arc or any real development so much so that they end the film as the exact same people who began it

marvel has no obligation to craft meaningful stories which they have proven they can do but only when they want to people just want popcorn flicks now with cool references and over the top comedy

took the words right out of my mouth and remember the seagulls they were such a nuisance,2018-07-08
that scene was the worst part of the movie they tried to make it out to be a parody of scenes where villains monologue before the heroes but it was so poorly executed the incredibles handled it so much better because syndrome became aware of what he was doing laughed and then stopped this scene just goes on and on and on and on ,2018-07-07

absolutely nothing to do with it

first scenehank janet and hope send scott into the quantum realm and as scott is in side the realm the snap happens and hank janet and hope all turn to dust leaving scott inside the realm with no way out

second scene shows an empty scotts house likely the results of the snap and it pans until it shows a big ant playing the drums",2018-07-09

the whole movie scotts on house arrest just him not his family why would they put the family on house arrest they didnt break any laws,2018-07-06
i doubt they are getting minute by minute updates of scott langs legal entanglements he took the deal thus the house arrest to be with his family not to serve it out and leave his family to help with their  he retired by accepting the deal and not going on the run,2018-07-06

do you always find her that way 

i mean her character is supposed to be woodencold in the movie ",2018-07-08
it is a sequel you simply can’t judge a sequel without seeing the first movie smh,2018-07-17
" but then make ghost pretty much be 1 note

is she supposed to sympathize with scott or hank or something  shes dying in 2 weeks and desperate af

 shoulda killed her off at end yet they make wuts her name save her but not fully for some reason

janet probably used the same healing particles they wanted to extract from her  it would have killed janet because ghost wanted to use everything she had janet only helped her in the moment and they had to search for more particles

  i thought they were collecting the healing stuff to rematteralize ppl who got taken by thanoss snap but nope

this is just dumb to think  even post snap unless they had met the avengers and went through everything with them they would have no idea what is going on

 so he was free from house arrest for months or a year after it took them however long to put the portal in the back of a car yet captain america says he was still under house arrest i think in infinity war which is less than a full day b4 the snap happens

i doubt it was months or years probably days at most  they probably dont know the exact date of the ending of his house arrest and even if they do scott is still under probation for 3 years after  otherwise its just a very minor mistake in continuity

im sure there are some real reasons to dislike the movie like having generic evil businessman just be in the way  but the things you list here dont even make sense if you put any thought at all into them",2018-07-09

to be fair we dont know how much time passed between the end of the main story and the snap scenes like hank and janet setting up the house on the beach side at the end implies there was a pretty decent amount of time covered between the end of the main conflict and the post credits the story could have happened a week or two before iw its still a bit of a gap but a bit smaller if you assume there was some time between,2018-07-07

i was suprised because that got less laughs in my theatre but it was the best joke to me,2018-07-11
i like to think that even they have no idea what they do besides heal quantum realmbased problems so they just name it what it does,2018-07-16
except everything he says is correct inuniverse at least,2018-07-26
riamverysmart,2018-08-07
in a weird way it might make it cooler  in our world you think that was a neat slight of hand  in the mcu you think oh man did my friend gain superpowers ,2018-07-07
the funniest bit in the movie was the recurring joke that only other grown men find the card tricks impressive cassie and judy greer didn’t give a fuuuuuuuck,2018-07-21

paul rudd and randall park being awkward is meant to be,2018-07-06
they really should to the jimmy woo and the agents of atlas movie now,2018-07-08
he is kinda famous character from comics he has some small fan following because of agent of atlas  series ,2018-07-13
his fbi title would probably be supervisory special agent ,2018-07-08
john krasinski should just change his name to jim fromtheoffice,2018-07-08
hey hats off to you for not seeing race,2018-07-19
well they only show him being a people manager for all we know he could legitimately be a badass field agent he was just 1 step behind scott every time though,2018-07-07
maybe  be the coulson of phase 4,2018-07-11
i mean he could still be a badass field agent but just a bit of a goofball its not too late,2018-07-18
for sure im pretty sure hes second to cap in terms of character creation date in the films i hope he shows up in other films,2018-07-09
i remember the interview ,2018-07-08
it’s weird seeming him in stuff after mr robot he’s a legit chameleon ,2018-07-14
lol  neil and his sweaters,2018-07-10
i love her powers same with antmanwasps so cinematic,2018-07-06
coolest costume ever imo looks like a hunter from destiny,2018-07-09
the next time she would appear i’m unsure if i’m supposed to expect stabilized powers or just all cured and removed,2018-07-08
id definitely love to see her as a hero shes in a similar spot to winter soldier with having been an assassin so it makes sense she could want to make amends especially if goliath guides her in that direction and she has some cool powers presumably janet didnt take them away by curing her she just stabilized herstopped the pain,2018-07-10
she was one of the most relatable villians theyve had  i loved it ,2018-07-08
shes like intensely beautiful after scott wakes up in her lair im like wow i didnt know a human could be so with it so woke,2018-07-20
i think she might be the one to pull scott out of the quantum realm,2018-07-11
i love that actress on killjoys so i was really excited to see her in this the fact that she not only survived but was also a sympathetic antagonist made it even better ,2018-07-10
maybe shes the key to beating thanos,2018-07-30
i mean he was a thief before he did the good thing,2018-07-07
i think it was honestly out of spite theyre  selfish but also have nothing else to really live for atm due to the horrible situation scott helped place them in they were out of time patience and sympathy,2018-07-08
"to be fair they only had a limited time to find mom you can cut them some slack most people who only had a day to save a loved one would desperate and selfish

that doesn’t make them bad people it just makes them human obviously hope likesloves scott and hank is fond of him in the sense that he will respect the man his daughter is seeing",2018-07-10
to be fair they were only on the run because scott took the suit to help captain america without asking them,2018-10-07

"you could have a stout little pipe just draining off the edge directly onto the sand would be pretty nasty without a water source to get it moving down to the ocean but you can dig a ditch and try to get the waves to take some of it away which would seriously threaten the house whenever the tide comes in

 i always forget about that show i remember it being pretty hit or miss though episodes were either riotously hilarious or pretty boring,2018-07-08
it was my favorite  history episode besides the alamo one,2018-07-11
i hoped so hard that when luis was recapping he’d cover the germany battle a little bit so we could get a quick cameo from other avengers recreating some stuff from then but lip syncing to pena,2018-07-07
they should use luis to recap previous movies as the mcu equivalent of the star wars text crawl,2018-07-08
thanos though,2018-07-09
not with that public warning screech on the tv that gave me shivers,2018-07-06
until you realize that the ant was just going through the motions of mimicking scotts daily routine in a desolated postsnap earth ,2018-07-07
if i was scott id form an all ant band and sit back and collect the billions of dollars theyd make,2018-07-06
i thought the antjamming scene had its on slight bit of horror to it  the television with nothing but an emergency  broadcast message playing  clearly the world is falling apart,2018-07-07
then the antman and the wasp will return  me up,2018-07-08
besides the fact that the national emergency signal was playing on the tv,2018-07-07
i thought we’d see the ant get dusted too,2018-07-06
is lang gonna go into the mind of the ant and control it like michelle pfeiffer did ,2018-07-08
im just angry they had that in the trailers ,2018-07-11
i cant help but feel that  lend a hand in getting scott back ,2018-07-07
like travel to the 90’s perhaps,2018-07-07
not necessarily theres also a movie paul watches near the beginning where a guy says an entire universe could be contained within one molecule thats a pretty big hint for multiverse,2018-07-15

that seems really lame  the gauntlet has the time stone in it beating the infinity gauntlet with anything but the infinity gauntlet will seem anticlimactic,2018-07-16
hope there is some back to the future type tropes ,2018-10-06
" you

i mean this is great and should happen but  you for suggesting it ",2018-07-08
"well theres also been some speculation that when thanos snap his fingers he also altered reality making it so no one would even remember the people who disappeared if this were the case it would mean antman would be the only person who remembered anyone presnap
interesting theory imo",2018-07-08
"ny battle with tony stark involved hank pym could care less hed actively attempt to not talk about it plus that ship hit the planet tony and peter fly up and no one else knows the difference 

crisis averted   

wakanda invaded but still under the hidden camoflage to the world 

plus they went in to harvest at a specific time the pyms moved to hawaii then they had to sneak back to sf  and do their mission extremely fast",2018-07-07
i mean when iron man was battling against the aliens and later disappeared people would assume the crisis was gone only the avengers knew about thanos and his plan there would be no reason to suspect more was coming then for the africa attack well remember that wakanda is still hidden from people they may have branched out but as seen in iw when cap enters wakanda theyre still very much invisible all the other attacks took place in space so there was no reason to believe anything else would happen  ,2018-07-07
people are probably accustomed to news of devastation at this point  after chitauri ny shield downfall at washington the fall of sokovia the clash in germany and the vulture failed hijacking and crash  theyre all probably assuming heroes were involved and with the accords in place already being taken care of another clash in ny with iron man an accord signee is probably run of the mill at this point kinda like school shootings ,2018-07-07
dont forget about an alien spaceship that crashed into the chicago skyline killing many and breaking peoples legs,2018-07-13
i dont know man the baddie committed a bunch of health code violations in his restaurantsome of them unspeakable thats pretty unwholesome in my book,2018-07-08

theres no such things as truth serum it only exists in movie,2018-07-08
"  then just left them completely fine when they got what they wanted

except for when they went to literally shoot luis and only got stopped just in time",2018-07-15

personal stakes grudge matches are the best ,2018-07-08
and then taking off on it like a scooter,2018-07-06
it was such a good lowkey moment,2018-07-06
for me her highlight was that  grin on her face when they are all watching ant man on tv,2018-07-09
theyre got to give her a time when when can be his partner on a mission ,2018-07-07

it was literally my favorite part of the movie i wish the movie had a bit more heart to it like that",2018-07-07
i was very impressed with her in general most child actors kinda  but she was great,2018-07-19
i dont think i couldve coped with seeing her get dusted,2018-08-02
she actually looked straight at the camera during that scene but she did a great job  ,2018-10-10
it was so cheesy,2018-07-25

rumor in casting claims that cassie has been recast with a teenager for avengers 4 so theoretically theres going to be some sort of time skip ,2018-07-07
she is a  the comics staturestinger since theyre hinting hard at using at least the basic ya for this cassie kate and wandas twins,2018-07-09
whats el,2018-07-07
yea her character felt more rounded this time around,2018-07-06
also i think because she obviously loves scott and like her mother and father he left for a mission without telling herasking her she was clearly angry at him because he put himself in danger and she had no idea and could have lost him too ,2018-07-21
i wonder what tommy and billy’s origin will be since both of their parents are dead ,2018-07-10
i feel like her  and vocal expressions captured that petty well though haha,2018-07-10
props to you for not seeing race,2018-07-06
i knew i recognized him from somewhere,2018-07-06
looked like dear leader to me,2018-07-06
i knew he looked familiar,2018-07-07
thats where i knew him from  that was really bothering me,2018-07-07
thank you i knew i knew him,2018-07-07
maybe they could meet in the holodeck,2018-07-10
" randall park was is always great

",2018-07-06
he needed a win man ,2018-07-06
i just checked and thats the guy who plays kim jong un in the interview  hilarious ,2018-07-14
huh i thought it was john krasinski,2018-07-08
loved that running joke hes practicing in his office when they barge in lol,2018-07-07
i want close up magic lessons,2018-07-06
i thought the last scene with them would be him showing scott he learned the card trick,2018-07-09
wait till hes revealed to be a skrull,2018-07-06
my take is that for someone that awkward and silly to be in the position he is he must he really good at his job ,2018-07-06
i love that final interaction because woos trying to be an  to scott but they have such similar personalities that they almost become friends instead  at the very least  probably become an ally to the team in the next movie  randall park and paul rudd have such great comedic chemistry together i kinda want a midnight run situation as a plotline in the next film  id love it if he became like coulson was in the early mcu  have jimmy woo pop up in every film set on earth from now  ,2018-07-07
theres still time for his character to change,2018-07-06
i think he the character woo is hamming it up with his fellow fbi agents in order to appear less like a threat  he was former shield in a hydrainfested shield after all  they are always going to be looking at him wondering if he was actually hydra  so he acts a tad goofy and harmless which is pretty much sop for shield agents undercover isnt it,2018-07-08
i got some definite putting on an act vibes especially since he was a lot more serious and composed away from the lang family or perhaps the opposite he felt so much trust for scott and really believed he was just trying to do the right thing that he felt badawkward accusing him throughout the movie ,2018-07-07
hey man no offense and i say this as a friend but if you don’t believe randall park should take up the mantle after daniel craig’s contract is up then you can go  yourself randall park would make a perfect james bond ,2018-07-07
coulson was a giddy captain america fanboy but he still gets moments of badass framing is an important part of characterization,2018-07-09
"imdb says hes actually the leader of a superhero spy team called agents of atlas which of course means hes gonna get his own tv show spinoff any day now

my guess is that janet’s line about “time vortexes” was there for a reason ,2018-07-08

him and tony go back in time to the battle of new york ,2018-07-07
just watched it tonight i have a feeling that quantum energy he collected is going to play a role in the next avengers movie,2018-07-07
that was wonderfully jarring  a rollicking fun movie an unabashedly happy ending gut punch  i havent felt that way since rufio got stabbed or since the final zoomout on the prestige,2018-07-07
didnt hank say something about how antman needed to be careful of getting  into a time vortex maybe that is how he gets out he gets into a time vortex and is spat out somewhere question is how does tony go with him i want to see a iron man armor meshed with antman armor so we have a super small ironman,2018-07-10
"janet says something like dont fall into a time tunnel 
a little on the nose there guysdoesnt leave many questions",2018-07-15
"well the specifically say don’t hit a time storm in the quantum realm

so it could be that scott hits one and goes to future either inside or outside the quantum realm where he may get the tech to enter and exit the quantum realm at will and use timestorms to go back through time

that would give them the rumoured time travelling ability",2018-07-08

that’s always been my experience until i moved to la and starting going to the movies in burbank i’ve been doing it for over a year and have been to at least 2030 movies here and haven’t had a single issue and i think it’s because this is a movie town back in boston in was torture always assholes ruining things ,2018-07-06
not too bad for my showing today i remember seeing avengers opening day and people were crying and yelling no everytime an avenger died it was so annoying that people yelled back telling them to  ,2018-07-08
i laughed mainly because i was waiting for it to happen when he went down into the quantum realm just seeing them turn into ash was just absolutely fantastic,2018-07-11
annoying but people cope with dramatic emotion differently they were probably the most shook in the theater,2018-07-07

thank you i just got out and this really bothered me they were obviously going quantum at the same time the wakanda battle was going on youd think theyd tell antman and his new partner about that especially because they told the govt to shove the accords theres no reason he shouldnt have known,2018-07-15
maybe goliath or ghost assuming they survived that is,2018-07-07
it was scott jamming out on the drums,2018-07-06
it was a couple shots of scotts apartment followed by the ant that was his substitute hitting the drums scene from the trailer,2018-07-06
it was dumb but the first was amazing so i guess it balanced out,2018-07-07
"i know this was a week ago but in case you didnt get the answer you were looking for it was the big ant jamming out to scotts drumset just like animalepton said

also in the background you can hear cars screeching lots of screaming and the emergency braodcast signal the snap did some damage",2018-07-15

theres definitely some overlap where itd be daylight in both places 8 am in california would be 5 pm in central africa its not crazy to say thanos snapped his finger in the evening in wakanda where their battle had been going on all day while antman was heading into the quantum realm the same morning in california",2018-07-07
you buy in that there are talking alien raccoons ’s from another realm a super soldier frozen in ice from 80 years ago a billionaire  turned justice vigilant a mythical physician and a big green guy but you draw the line with timezones,2018-07-06

janet warns him about them before he goes into the quantum realm in the midcredits scene ,2018-07-06
"i swear she said “don’t spend too much time with the tardigrades they’re cute but they’ll eat you”

did no one else catch that or did i see a different movie",2018-08-15
nailed that classic 1990s  symbol vibe,2018-07-06
its like whoopi goldberg channeling patrick swayze in ghost ,2018-07-07
personally i prefer tayne,2018-07-06
yes we need more rockwell  i was hoping that somehow he would be the buyer that goggins was working for ,2018-07-06
man i was so disappointed in the villains of this film they had walter goggins and related him to such a pointless position,2018-07-06
 sam rockwell was wasted so badly on iron man 2,2018-07-10
you know now that you mention it he was so good i forgot that wasnt actually tom hiddleston shapeshifted hopkins can bring it,2018-07-09
he was such a treat there dude went completely for it ,2018-07-06
also they really set her up for becoming a superhero in the future like her comics counterpart she might actually be really important in avengers 4 they had a casting release for a teenaged version of cassie since actual cassie cant be aged up ,2018-07-07
but janets not a grandmaunlessoh no,2018-07-07
a michelle pfeifferpossesed body kissing michael douglas while evangeline lilly watches has always been my fetish so mad it didnt happen,2018-07-06
say yes scott,2018-07-08
me too,2018-07-12
good call,2018-07-06
"except this one worked better

 no",2018-07-06
he looked a bit like stan in that get up and that’s where i thought they were setting up the cameo,2018-07-08
just watch the pilot episode of the leftovers,2018-07-06
this won’t happen but holy  i would love if daredevil season 3 was just daredevil trying to keep everything together and deal with the inevitable anarchy that would be postsnap new york,2018-07-11
did agents of shield get renewed ,2018-07-06
i really want the next avengers to take place like a year after the snap,2018-07-07
im ron burgundy,2018-07-06
i wouldve preferred if it just said antman will return since wasps got snapped ,2018-07-06
why is antman and wasp,2018-07-06
"theres a short story written in the 50s where a nuclear war occurred but an automated smart house has survived and tries to go its day until the lack of infrastructure and refill of food and water destroys it but yeah not an ant but somewhat the same theme i can’t remember the title though

edit there will come soft rain by ray bradbury thank you umcmqsmith ",2018-07-06
yeah i saw some comments saying it was pointless but in a way i thought it was more haunting than the first post credits scene  maybe being a slight comment on the film itself  antman was a fun movie but it is also distraction from the traumatic ending of avengers ,2018-07-07
that any went through the routine of scott when scott wasnt around this look at the post snap mcu could be at any point  its pretty chilling and achieved a massively eerie tone after a pretty funny movie   perfectly balanced,2018-07-07
also people forget that half of all life in the universe was destroyed not just human life the ant was also lucky to be alive,2018-07-07
didnt really register anything about the eerieness of that scene i heard the drumming and knew it was the ant so i got a laugh out of that noticed the television screen was odd but didnt think too much on it,2018-07-07
i was so focused on the ant that i didnt even notice any alarms,2018-08-09
"its all over

but the crying

and nobodys crying

but me",2018-07-06
dont look at the sky,2018-07-07
or they go multiverse route go back in time and defeat thanos before he even gets the stones but then they return back to their time and half of everyone is still gone they only make an alternate timeline which all future movies will be set in while the original timeline is simply ,2018-07-06
its hilarious on the surface but really unnerving when you think about it the entire world has gone to  you can hear sirens and screaming out the window and heres this ant just doing exactly what it was programmed to do play drums watch tv take bath sleep completely oblivious to the horror going on outside scotts house ,2018-07-06
i wonder if ants can get snapped,2018-07-06
"okay but how the  did they get an ant to mimic things like lounging on a couch like a human or playing drums

and dont you  dare say pym particles",2018-07-06
at least we know thanos doesnt care about ants ,2018-07-06
half the universe is gone,2018-07-12
"scene one antman goes into the quantum realm to get more quantum healing particles for ghost theyre counting down to bring him out and five four three two static cut back to three piles of dust floating at the control panel 

scene two inside scotts apartment pan down the hallway theres the ant mimicking scotts daily routine playing on the drums theres an emergency broadcast tone playing on the tv as the camera passes it cut to black the tone fades out

the words antman and the wasp will return appear and the period changes to a question mark",2018-07-12
the point of the ant drumming scene was to show that the snap had happened but the ant didnt care,2018-07-06
the ant drumming scene is classic juxtaposition  the point is not the drumming but to compare what is going on in the apartment to the world around it  where everything has gone straight to ,2018-07-09
the ants drumming sure but the scene starts by showing a door left stuck open to scotts place a tv stuck on the alert color bars of a tv and the whole place is empty the open door would indicate that scotts wife the stepfather andor cassie were in the house at some point  either they were turned to dust by the snap or someone survived and ran outside,2018-07-23
who cares if he no longer needs to do it if i had a giant ant trained to play the drums id declare him my new best friend,2018-07-06
"the door could have been opened by someone opening it to check on the commotion outside as seen in infinity war people who get dustedspoiler seem to happen a different times so it not crazy thats what happened

to be honest i didnt even notice that part really so this isnt a hill im going to die on i think the scene got the point across did you guys enjoy the movie",2018-07-06
i thought the door was open because maybe his ex her husband or cassie were there before we see the drumming ant maybe they were dusted themselves one of them was and the others escaped outside to see  is going on the drumming ant was the least of their problems,2018-07-23
because most of those ants are basically pets scott got his bracelet off whos to say how he spends his life with ants,2018-07-07
house could have been raised by people needing supplies ,2018-07-07
to be fair nothing compares to the events of infinity war,2018-07-07
it was completely random which half of the population got zapped  it wouldnt always be exactly half of any group you happen to be in  all of them could have disappeared or none of them,2018-07-06
im pretty annoyed that your scope of 5050 is only what you see in that specific scene  ,2018-07-07
when you hear screams and sirens outside with the tv signals all out then yes its freaking terrifying ,2018-07-06
thats a made up word,2018-07-06
it bothers me that thor calls it nivadellir the first time he says it but everyone else including him says nidavellir for the rest of the movie,2018-07-08
pls post to rmoviedetails,2018-07-07
you made that word up,2018-07-07
ooooooohohohoh,2018-07-12
seeing how infinity war ends i think game of thrones would have been appropiate,2018-07-15
this is not perfectly balanced ,2018-07-24
"i was thinking similar during the movie  they mentioned some streets but it seems like the third act was mostly in north beach

how the  did ant man afford that house in sf if his company was about to go out of business  he had a  yard in a house to himself",2018-07-08
it would sometimes cut to an entirely different city  atlanta,2018-07-08
biggest laugh of the movie in my theater,2018-07-06
string cheese,2018-07-06
do you have any orange slices,2018-07-07
it would’ve been better too me if hank said orange slices ,2018-07-06
"did you destroy the suit

that moment when you just know  get mad no matter what answer you give",2018-07-06
also like how he knows scott is totally eye  and other stuff with hope calls him out almost every time,2018-07-07
hes rick sanchez ,2018-07-08
i think that would’ve been way too much effort to green screencgi to make it look cohesive,2018-07-06
probably a deleted scene somewhere in there ,2018-07-07
a scene with paul rudd lining up to go down the slide having a kid push him on the swings see saws etc,2018-07-08
it really stood out how they were clearly saving a few bucks there by not having any kids appear at all during the school scenes ,2018-07-13
i enjoy your enthusiasm despite the fact that it was a hoodie and drenched means covered in water ,2018-07-07
the sleeves that were too long for his arms really sold it,2018-07-13
probably only when they are micro sized being fun sized probably isnt all that problematic ,2018-07-06
they cant open their helmets while shrinking besides that need facetime foe the actors,2018-07-09
"the longwinded explanations were some of my favorite parts in the first movie almost like a subtle deconstruction of flashback narration the only thing i think this one was missing or maybe i missed it was him talking about an unexpected hobby

i was at a wine tasting with my cousin ernesto which was mainly reds and you know i dont like reds man you know it but there was this rose that saved the day it was delightful

and there was like this abstract expressionism exhibit but you know me im more like a neocubist kind of guy",2018-07-06
that asian chick doing the head snap when she says “you gotta be more specific” in the first movie always sticks with me,2018-07-08
"head snaps

snaps

snap

triggered",2018-07-09
he was so pale and scared it was hilarious lol just rocking back and forth looking down hahaha,2018-07-06
i love that he was singing the nursery rhyme for baba yaga when she popped out and ran away,2018-07-07
with a  pencil,2018-07-06
my russian friend was losing it every time they said baba yaga ,2018-07-06
the entire time i was fantasizing a john wick cameo in this movie after he said that,2018-07-08
but theres no such thing as a truth serum  ,2018-07-07
he could be just a suit with no powers  man ,2018-07-06
they need to bring back the marvel one shots because those shorts were fun a great worldbuilding tool and make great companion pieces to the main movies ,2018-07-06
id watch a show of them where antman randomly pops up,2018-07-06
statistically speaking 1 or 2 of them need to not be dust first ,2018-07-06
id watch a tv show about the security company ,2018-07-07
he’s not a leading man but he gets plenty of good character actor work fury and the martian come to mind even if he didn’t have much to say in the latter ,2018-07-13
i was laughing when he was giving an interview at the end with his hat barely on his head,2018-07-08
how was school today,2018-07-06
how was school,2018-07-06
but scotts is awkward banter,2018-07-07
ummm no  no he is not  not even a little bit  he gives peter a suit and asks a completely green teenager to fight against cap for purely selfish reasons then immediately abandons him with no instruction so he can go party on the other side of the world  he is a giant piece of   on the plus side by the end of iw i think he finally realizes just how big an  he really is ,2018-10-13
antman is the key to all of this ,2018-07-06
if he goes to the past what if he shows up in captain marvel,2018-07-06
i personally think he goes to the past and finds captain marvel might explain why shes not a big deal in the 90s because she bounced forward to our timeline ,2018-07-07
future foundation ,2018-07-06
since the next avengers is possibly the last one for the first group of avengers having him jump to the time of the first avengers film would be a great coda,2018-07-08
on set photos show that avengers 4 takes place during the battle of ny from the first avengers so likely going back in time ,2018-07-06
i caught onto him probably using the time vortex but didn’t think about him using the quantum energy in some way  i’m confident it’ll play a role in a4,2018-07-06
i think that quantum energy would be one way ticket  to one trip into the past  ,2018-07-06
i think hes going to use the quantum energy to upgrade iron mans suit because dr strange needed to keep tony alive for the endgame,2018-07-08
heal tonys stab wound maybe ,2018-07-06
i heard the infinity stones dont work in other dimensions maybe theyll use it to pull thanos into the quantum realm,2018-07-09
i think the quantum energy will be used to heal the gauntlet,2018-07-08
2b mean something ,2018-07-09
wow i didn’t remember that in the trailers all she wanted was a cure and that was it,2018-07-07
more like universe ending,2018-07-07
my theater did that as well as the entire place waited for the second post credits scene,2018-07-07
antonio banderes will return,2018-07-06
"in the theater i was in everyone reacted to that line like the scene in the simpsons where everyone is waiting on crashes at a nascar race 

antman and the wasp will return

ohhhhhh

question mark appears

groan",2018-07-06
just had to check shes 60 by the way,2018-07-06

was it just me or did she actually look younger than she did in stardust here ,2018-07-08
for real i commented to my buddy that even when they tried to “hag her up” and make her look old and tired she still looked hot,2018-07-07
catwomans still got it ,2018-07-07
forget that where did she find all those clothes that wasn’t the same suit she wore when she went in,2018-07-07
makeup and food i have so many questions is there a walmart in the void ,2018-07-07
my sister in law also mentioned that to me ,2018-07-07
that’s literally all i could think about anytime she was on screen ,2018-07-08
"honestly the deaging for michael douglas and michelle pfeiffer was amazing in this movie  it was actually the first movie where i couldnt find a single flaw with a digitally deaged face in any scene  


edit u47ronin has brought to my attention that young bill foster was played by langston fishburne no deaging tech needed  still major props to langston and the makeup team because i didnt even notice",2018-07-08
she has aged wonderfully well ,2018-07-07
shame she never got to reprise it ,2018-07-14
guarantee tons of makeup and plastic surgery you could for sure see her lips were a bit messed up too tight,2018-07-06

as everything should be,2018-07-06
uh spoiler,2018-07-06
didn’t think deadpool would get spoiled for me in the ant man thread but there you go,2018-07-07
dread it,2018-08-02
perfectly balanced ,2018-07-09
i heard one kid yell oof,2018-07-06
dont worry there is a 5050 chance  get banned in less than a week,2018-07-06
one asshat in my theatre cheered too,2018-07-06
we had a kid gasp and ask “what happened” it brought some much needed humor to the rest of the theater goers ,2018-07-11
i was the person saying yes in my theater because ive been saying since i saw infinity war that the end of this movie would involve someone getting snapped,2018-07-07
but he’s also banned so this is somewhat awkward,2018-07-08
maybe he knew thanos as a friend from work,2018-07-10
how annoying ,2018-07-13
"its a metaphor for lifes fragility

hits blunt",2018-07-06
the crackle over the radio has newer meaning i can’t wait to see this film again,2018-07-06
would you say you don’t feel very well ,2018-07-07
he did get himself out in the first he had that small blue disk that makes anything grow so maybe he has another just in case ,2018-07-06
different suit with a different regulator ,2018-07-06
no need to mention any of that stuff we dont know how long after the movie the after credits scene takes place  infinity war happens in at most 1 day if they were wrapped up in their own work its easy to miss the news for a bit ,2018-07-06
yea a bit strange there wasnt even a casual mention of a 200 meter spaceship hovering over new york city,2018-07-07
"i went in an afternoon session and somehow was the only one in the cinema

i actually went what the fuccccccccckkkkkkkkk out loud lol",2018-07-09
i thought the quantum realm visuals were bad but  if those end credits were not just a  mazing,2018-07-06
you really didnt expect that it was extremely obvious as soon as they brought up the quantum realm at the start of the film,2018-07-11
i think they were toying with the audience during that scene you saw how they waited extra long before they counted down and sent him in and paused before scott confirmed he was safely in the quantum realm i sat there expecting the dusting to happen at any moment,2018-07-13
oh i audibly gasped at that,2018-07-12
this is their no i am your father,2018-07-06
"same thing happened with my nephew totally loved the movie super jovial mood and then that happened and its like someone started playing fortunate son 

he hates thanos so much",2018-07-06
yahmy 10 year old son freaked out and started yelling noooooo no no nooooohad to hush him but dang little bro im feeling it too,2018-07-06
its actually a perfect foil to deadpool 2 that film ended on a bittersweet note but then midcredits scenes brought everyone back this one ended on a happy note with zero deaths but then,2018-07-06
but i’d also be jealous of someone who didn’t get to experience the mcu gradually like i did i was 12 when iron man came out and it built a strong love for these movies in me that has yet to be extinguished i love seeing how this whole thing develops,2018-07-06
dude no  me and my  wife we were like   ohhhhhhh  thanossssss,2018-07-06
when i was a kid i remember the you were my brother anakin line was really impactful to me,2018-07-08
mine was transformersthe movie my entire childhood got curbstomped in the first 20 min of that movieand the rest was a bunch of new guys and weirdass japanese anime  it was great,2018-07-06
you bring up the wheelers but you dont remember mumbi she was horrifying ,2018-07-06

well i saw artax die,2018-07-08
mufasas death was intense as  for my generation at least ,2018-07-08
"lol this is awesome  as a jaded adult that has three decades of understanding how comic books work the deaths fell flat for me  yeah yeah they died whatever  nobody ever really dies in comic books and these franchises are making a fortune  theyre all gonna be back in the next one

but for a kid without that cynicism holy smokes  those scenes must have been absolutely shocking  i wish i could have experienced them like that",2018-07-13
i was excited that my kid 7 could see this one then that scene she’s too young for iw yet so that would be some explaining ,2018-07-06
 wheelers man creeped me the  out,2018-07-07
dudewheelers were freakynever gonna forget them but i completely agree with your point,2018-07-08
honestly im 8 months from being officially an adult and that ending left me in a broken state for about 3 hours i was crying at first but  i just started thinking how they just nailed the ending so much,2018-07-09
ill never forget megatron blasting a hole through ironhides chest   that one was totally irreversible  oh  ,2018-07-09
we had the challenger ,2018-07-06

really refreshing because i didnt give a  about sokovia in age of ultron,2018-07-06
same here avengers infinity war made me interested in the mcus plots again,2018-07-06
"i have one question so while thanos was wreaking havoc on earth team aw were just worried about getting michelle pfeiffer backor making the quantum tunnel smaller

i’m just confused because if the movie ended the way it did we have to assume thanos had done everything that happened in iw did team aw just not know at the very least that the entire northeast coast of country was under attack 

i loved the movie just want to see if anyone can help me understand better ",2018-07-06
i was halfexpecting it going into the film and i was still surprised,2018-07-06
gasps from one side of the theater angry yelling from the other side people are really looking forward to the sequel,2018-07-06
i was hoping for janet to survive ,2018-07-06
improbable things happen guardians lost 56 while the original avengers got hit with 06 probability is like that,2018-07-06
yes you did most mcu movies have two ,2018-07-06
yeah dude right next to me was in awe after the first post credits scene and kept complimenting the movie out loud to my annoyance then after the second one he left his seat cussing like that single scene invalidated the whole movie like really dude are you going to be that ,2018-07-06
the 2nd one wasnt worth waiting tbh we already got a glimpse of it thru pymms phone ,2018-07-06
its a truth serum,2018-07-08
it is truth serum,2018-07-06

"hope flying into the van and subsequently kicking the  out of the guys who were in there doing flips and  shrinking and growing between hits its in the trailers too but that sort of sequence really makes me smile

honestly the fact that all supers are famous now makes me so happy this is exactly how it would play out in our world seeing all the people on the dock with their phones out instead of running away is perfect i love the little scenes also in thor ragnorock with the two girls asking to take a pic with thor,2018-07-17
eh it’s part 1 of 2 were yet to see what happens to thanos at the end,2018-07-06
excuse you all those people you call heroes are the true villains of the movie thanos was the hero the universe deserved,2018-07-07
post credits is pretty much outside the scope of the movie as far as i’m concerned ,2018-07-16
every fight scene was a highlight in this movie especially the kitchen one,2018-07-06
also her threatening hank with her hand through his neck ,2018-07-06
 yeah that suplex was pretty cool,2018-07-06
its been established in previous movies and shows that shield isnt always 100 good sometimes they do some pretty shady morally grey stuff project insight using the tesseract to make weapons the tahiti project none of that exactly screams were the good guys,2018-07-06
to be fair couldve been the hydra parts of shield using her at the time,2018-07-06
this would have been back when they were secretly controlled by hydra so no surprise they got up to some shady ,2018-07-06
hail hydra ,2018-07-06
i kinda assumed that was just the hydra branch of shield turning her into an assassin  ,2018-07-06
i think she was recruited by hydra plants inside shield thats definitely something evil that they would do like thawing bucky out and giving him a robot arm and turning him into a super assassin ,2018-07-07
sheild was hyrda though hyrdra infiltrated and ran a large part of sheild i assumed ghost was a hyrdra project ,2018-07-10
probably wasnt shield shield but hydra within shield,2018-10-20
that’s a good point i’m not even sure what to refer to ghost as i feel like antihero wouldn’t be accurate either ,2018-07-06
yep this was a great contrast to the heaviness and gravity of infinity war it felt good to watch a hilarious light hearted movie about a guy and his friends trying to save pyms wife its why i loved the first ant man low stakes movies are great because the struggles the characters go through are real and can be related to the audience ,2018-07-06
i thought the idiot villains were great they just wanted money plain and simple and were comically evil then “fighting” with the security company xcon was hilarious,2018-07-07
yeah i kind of liked that aspect too when people said wonder woman fell apart in the finale i always just thought it suffered from the limitations of the super hero genre with that film the whole plot was building up to a reveal that there is no big bad for ww to fight but since it was super hero film it had to end with a fight with a big badspoiler but then antman 2 was probably better off not having a major villain in it,2018-07-06
i mean i dont wanna jinx it but its so cool that marvel is finally figuring out how to utilise their bad guys or in this case  not so much a villain but simply an antagonist who simply opposed our heroes for most of the movie definitely one of the better mcu villains for sure,2018-07-07
goggins character was the only real villainand even though he was great in the role they probably couldve cut the character,2018-07-11
"yeah i definitely liked that it was different in that sense but of course if its not a perfect and generic three act structure with a villain to be beaten by the hero someones gonna say something like its too all over the place or things just happen and go nowhere 

im perfectly content with it ",2018-07-08
when she showed she was willing to go after the kid is when i started thinking of her as a villain the only reason she didnt was because dude said he wouldnt help her if she did but she was still willing to,2018-07-09
 i had the same thought of janet as well when she went in to cure her i thought she was going to vaporize her or something and turn to hank and say shes not the same person that would have been  trippy and then have the snappening happen and have the movie just end i guess i shouldnt direct a marvel movie lol ,2018-07-14
wait you wanted ghost to die are you serious bro shes adorable,2018-07-20
agreed i love me some goggins and he played that role as best as he could but it was really just a standard villain trying to make money  it would have been nice if they gave him some more motivation  did they ever mention who his buyer was  i didnt catch that if it was in the movie but they could have done something with that potentially ,2018-07-06
"i feel like both characters werent great but the actors worked their  off to make it work

ghost had enough story to understand her motivation but i feel like they could have done more as i just got home i havent had much time to think about what they could have done but i just feel like there could have been more to her however hannah johnkamen did an awesome job with what she was given and made me really feel like she was in this incredible pain and was doing what she had to

waltons character was a generic money hungry bad guy and written as such but hes an amazing actor and did what he could to make it not terrible",2018-07-06
she was a pointless villain honestly everything could have been accomplished simply by talking things out in like 10 minutes she was however incredibly neat to watch and the fight scenes were a visual treat ,2018-07-06
i had a hard time liking her because it was one of those moments where the conflict arises from awful communication skills no one ever thought hey lets combine our efforts and make something that could mainline the quantum energy into her and stop fighting,2018-07-07
"walter goggins whose entire motivation was quite literally and i quote

dramatic camera zoom 1 billion dollars

that guy i could not think of a worse villain in any movie ever except ghost in the very same film",2018-07-06
yeah we could really see the pain in her eyes she was so desperate to alleviate it i like how dr bill foster lawrence fishbourne recognized this and was actively trying to help her without going against his own values,2018-07-06
was ego really a great villain thoughehh,2018-07-06
i agreed with you until ego he was  the rest were great,2018-07-06
bushmaster roo,2018-07-11
the conflict couldn’t have been solved by talking the issue was that nobody knew exactly how to help her they knew that they could help ghost by pulling the quantum particles out of the mom but also thought that that might  the mom but they also didn’t really have any other specific ideas of how to help her while of course it turned out to have a solution that made everyone happy none of the characters actually knew that until the final moment ,2018-07-06
he was dying anyway freya remarks in thor tdw that the odinsleep is taking longer and longer ,2018-07-08
"makes sense as to why they pushed things back time travel with the quantum realm  with the past changing humans in the future after the snap is reversed would be perfect then the mcu would be absolutely bonkers

just realized that maybe ghost will have something to do with it as well as they specifically mentioned shes living in different realitiesand the fact shes basically a mutant that cant control her powers",2018-07-07
theres basically undeclared levels of canon here old star wars expanded universe style if it happened in the movies its canon in the shows but nothing thats happened in the shows so far has been established to be canon in the movies not a single miniscule reference,2018-07-07
thats because none of the marvel tv shows are cannon the mediums belong to two different people dont try to convince yourself that theyre part of the mcu youll only hurt yourself,2018-07-07
those are inhumans not the same thing,2018-07-07
probably more of a rights issue although theyre the same property theyre different mediums with different rights ,2018-07-07
unfortunately theres been no confirmation of scarlett witch being a mutant in the mcu they called her and quicksilver miracles and their powers were given to them by the mind stone someone correct me if im wrong,2018-07-06
"scarlet witch in the mcu at least would be a mutate by the comic definition which is a human that gained powers  as opposed to mutants which are born with the xgene and latent powers through that

i think there are even some mutant mutates mutants that gained additional powers in addition to whatever their xgene lets them do",2018-07-16
agreed i would love for that to not happen ,2018-07-09
yes that actor in altered carbon did it 10 times better  that was a trip lol,2018-10-08
im surprised they didnt since they seemed to be very against his antics in the first movie seemed like a complete heel turn this movie but probably because of how he saved them at the end of the first one,2018-07-08
all the quantum realm stuff was straight out of jack kirby illustrations this movie and doctor strange pulled it off so well,2018-07-06
you’re telling me going to a thesaurus to find the most pretentious possible word for everything doesn’t make you smart or a good critic,2018-07-06

"it really is and i hope we get to see cassie and scott team up cause that would be both gnarly and warm everyone’s heart at the same time 

i’m betting we see a younger avengers team going forward",2018-07-06
i think it has a lot to do with just how much of a tonal shift it was from the rest of the movie which was a pretty lightweight fun ride ,2018-07-06
much,2018-07-06
well they did in winter soldier and civil war,2018-07-07
"i dont understand why everyone thinks shed be so understanding and patient were you guys watching the same film

shes been in chronic pain and is very irratic in fact lawrence fishburnes character is the only reason she didnt completely go off the deep end

she wanted to  hank   talked out of it by fishburne who suggested she watch him instead

wanted to kidnapphurtkill scotts daughter  again stopped by fishburnes character

i highly doubt them trying to reason with her would have actually done anything once she was so set on her original plan plus theres bias against the main characters because of fishburnes character",2018-07-06
"people have responded but i think everyones missing the main key point

ghost had a solution to her problem  she was going to take energy from janet problem solved  what hank and the others had to offer was to try to come up with something in a few weeks which may or may not have been successful  if janet came back then she misses out on her opportunity for guaranteed recovery  

she didnt seem like she was willing to take the risk  especially putting her trust in someone who she believed cause the problems to begin with",2018-07-06
"to be fair theyre all like this at the end of the movie not sure hank wouldve help because laurance fishburne character thinks hes an 

the only one that doesnt want this is ghost herself",2018-07-06
i didnt understand how hank upgraded the wasp suit and  up the new ant man suit so hard and then scott kept using the new suit despite the new one  him over constantly ,2018-07-06
yup this conflict might be one of the most talkthisthroughable in the entire mcu,2018-07-06
not a funny line but when cassie says “don’t laugh” my heart melted ,2018-07-08
"yeah id have to agree i loved the first ant man and i loved how it basically served as a pallet cleanser to age of ultron

while i had fun with this one i felt it was missing something that i just cant put my finger on but i think it deals with the pacing of scotts character arc

throughout most of the film i just kept thinking huh no real arc from scott i dont really know what inner demon hes trying to overcome and how hes going to evolve 

then after that conversation with his daughter where he breaks into the fbi cell to rescue hope and hank i thought to myself oh heres where theyre trying to give him an arc but something about it falls flat

im not sure that this is it but scotts daughter basically gives him a lesson of needing a partner but im not sure that thats the lesson he needed to learn since the beginning of the film like hes never much of a lone wolf and if anything hes the one whos been a bit ostracized from hank hes not doing any machoman i can take care of myself 

long story short i feel like reevaluating that character arc would have made the movie stronger and it could have still served as a perfect postavengers pallet cleanser  

",2018-07-06
holy  that movie had a lot of recognizable actors in it,2018-07-06

"i get this sub is still riding the dc hate train but let’s not get ahead of ourselves here antman 1 and this as well are both mediocre movies and pretty far from what i would call well made poor writing character motivations plot story and consistency are just a few things that come to mind as to why this movie was  the villains were  terrible the plot and story were terrible and uninteresting to the core and everything in the movie was played for laughs in the most insincere way possible i guess when you throw enough low effort jokes at the “laugh at anything” audience any piece of  can start looking like a “well made” movie


tell me if this is a “well made” action comedy then what is incredibles 2 a far superior film which came out just about 2 weeks ago or what is baby driver you guys on here will eat up any superhero  with marvel studios in its name",2018-07-06
wonder woman is only okay too what a shambles the dceu is in at the moment id certainly have it as a better movie than some of the mcu movies but i reckon that at least 10 are on par or better than it including basically the whole of phase 3 apart from maybe guardians 2 that third act really let such a great opening 2 down ,2018-07-21

being that she is a genius level scientist i figured shed just been working on ways to get out most of the time youve also got some time for her to lose her mind then regain it and she said time works differently there so they could always hand wave it with that ,2018-08-02
yeah i can only guess she actually had lots to do maybe there are other beings there whole societies or something ive never read the comics so i have no idea but seems like something they would do,2018-07-27

how would a conversation have solved anything in either movie",2018-07-06

word on the street is an older cassie is being cast for iw2avengers4 so shes probably not snapped ,2018-08-02
maybe not dues ex machina but it was certainly very underwhelming the choice was either save the mom or save ghost but the movie had its cake and ate it too meaning that the whole thing would have been resolved if ghost just asked for help right from the start,2018-07-22

my only theory is the snap isnt instantaneous as  much as it is a wave think of titan they all disappear at diff times in wakanda people disappeared at diff times granted this was probably for the sake of the film so we could see everyone evaporate but think how much time passes between bucky and then spidey,2018-07-07

my rationale is that if i was reading a comic book and wouldnt question it why should i question in the movie format its just that the live action film medium makes it harder for viewers to suspend disbelief,2018-07-24
i dont know why youre downvoted but seriously to think this whole movie could have been entirely avoided had only hank not decided to shrink the lab down for whatever reason that he did it ghost wouldnt have gotten it the other idiots couldnt have snatched it from fbi and no last minute oh no lab is shrunk and we cannot get from quantum realm to lab unless its big again probably nit picking but i definitely think 1st was way better than this movie,2018-10-03

ye but it didnt serve the story of antman universe itself either not much new info about the quantum realm no new tech only new thing is a phasing person and that theres healing stuff for said phasing in the quantum world nothing special ,2018-10-09

at least foster engaged me as a viewer in several different scenes every time burch reappeared my reaction was him again why is he still in this movie,2018-07-18
the crime boss was very onedimensional and i want your tech has been done before in the mcu but at least he made sense in the movie they are on the run they need to make deals with shady people and one betrays them and goes after them its nothing mindblowing or original but whatever ghost on the other hand made no sense the way they handled that character why not just have hank pym help her instead of doing the  she and fishburne did and her backstory is relegated to one short flashback and expositionheavy technobabble when it could have been way more interesting i also would have preferred if she was just a desperate person trying to save herself instead of some highly trained mercenary ,2018-07-17
i agree with you i think burch should have been a oneanddone appearing only in the scene about his meeting with hope ghost and the fbi had compelling reasons for relentless pursuit of the pyms it was ridiculous for burch and his thugs to be hounding them like javert in les miserables,2018-07-18
"that’s what i’m saying tho— in the aftercredit scene the four of them are conducting experiments to go to the quantum realm when they get snapped  it appeared to me that this was happening well after the end of the main movie ie sometime after he gets out of house arrest 

maybe no one bothered to check in with ant man in that time but idk i thought iw took place over just a few days  at least antman would have been around for the final day or so",2018-08-16

"i was more annoyed at the fact that everything would have been destroyed and upside down inside the building but maybe some sort of force field keeps that from happening i dunno

pym built a transportable building i think hes smart enough to make sure everything inside is locked so it wont budge even if the building is shaken",2018-07-25
why you thinkin about it so much,2018-07-25
thanks i appreciate your positive words,2018-07-31
just read an article that mentioned it glad i can get some confirmation here too cant wait to see a still of it because ive seen the movie twice and missed it,2018-07-07
the back and forth and delivery between the actors was spoton ,2018-07-07
hahahahaha ,2018-07-07
the giant ant that was posing as his double was doing a drum solo at his house while the emergency broadcast system was on and no one on the streets post thanos snapboth funny but bleak ,2018-07-07
you didnt miss much camera at scotts house drum music turns out to be giant ant playing drums,2018-07-07
the ant that was programmed to do his daily routine was playing the drumsspoiler  i hated the second scene lol  made me wait all that time,2018-07-07
"second trailer  one minute 16 seconds in  

should have switched mid and final credits scenes lame that trailer spoiled it too",2018-07-07
the snap duh,2018-07-07
"personally scottasjanet felt a little off paul rudds acting felt like it was straight out of an snl skit especially in the beginning where his voice seemed to take on a more pitchy almost whiny inflection and then there was that weird bit where hank and antennascott were holding hands and both of them were laughing but it felt like it was them being out of character and cracking rather than genuine laughterattraction

i also really did enjoy randall park  for fans of the office i also found it funny that his characters name was jimmyvery fitting",2018-07-08
i love that too in a way it helps makes scott a nice guy because he doesnt have to go through the trope of fighting off the exs new guy through underhanded means like weve seen in other movies scotts biggest and seemingly only flaw is that he is a thief but hes a thief with a heart of gold hes the type guy where you wouldnt trust him with your bank account number but you know he would be the greatest babysitter youve ever hired your kid would be calling him uncle scott in no time ,2018-07-08
"but i am not quoting anyone also if you are using quotations shouldnt you use a comma before the quotations going by your sentence it should read

there is no she is stuck in the middle 

but even then it doesnt make any sense because again i am not quoting anyone if there is any correction the phrase should be italicized as in there is no she is stuck in the middle",2018-07-08
you seriously left before it was over,2018-07-09
scott gets stuck in the quantum realm while hank janet and hope get snapped,2018-07-09
isnt it just during the shrinking process that they need the mask on im not sure i think there was a line or two explaining it in the first film ,2018-07-16
"i too wondered how she survived in the quantum realm for so long but maybe when youre that small oxygen and food is no longer important even thought she still aged which indicates metabolism and throws hands up and mutters comic books

loved the movie though",2018-07-17
its explained in the first film that the suits helmet maintains the brains chemistry somehow so you dont go insane so taking it off whilst shrunk down can scramble up some eggs ,2018-07-16
his plan didnt make any sense tho the fact that it worked made civil war ,2018-12-07
yes had chills when i watched the audience reactions on youtube and heard the line again,2018-07-07
saved by cat litter,2018-07-07
luis for motormouthhttpmarvelcomuniversemotormouth confirmed,2018-07-06
true they were underrated as well,2018-07-06
im just glad judy greer got some lines in this time,2018-07-08
even if it’s not technically deux ex machina it’s still a moment of lazy writing,2018-07-07
it still was here let me touch your head and now youre fixed,2018-07-07
black panther had avengers iwavengers had antman and the wasp  i think thor had black panther   i kinda thought wed get a tease of captain marvel,2018-07-07
the not xmen kids the adam sandler  dracula cartoon the nutcracker a few others ,2018-07-07
this makes no sense  one of keatons career defining roles is batman,2018-07-07
i loved him in justified good to see hes still getting roles and in that sense he was kinda wasted in this movie,2018-07-07
my theory is either hammer or osborne ,2018-07-07
thank you i rolled my eyes any time they showed up they seemed tacked on and unnecessary just to provide more drama he only mentions buyers so im guessing the comically villainy reasons to give him a part in the story ,2018-07-08
goggins wanted the lab to resell everything inside i figured his buyers were just generic baddies and not really some mysterious big villain he was basically just trying to do the same thing vulture tried to do in spiderman homecoming except with pym tech and he had no special suit or a sympathetic backstory ,2018-07-08
either scenario could be true since its not explicitly stated it was just a thought i had,2018-07-07
thats a possibility as well but all the avengers except the 6 original ones were erased so we could assume that scott would be erased,2018-07-07
and theres only a 1037 chance of that,2018-07-08
hmmm idk just coming up with theories  maybe he uses it to jump ahead then tells the other avengers he knows how to use it to go back as well and reenters it,2018-07-09
oh i know that but does the “comic” wasp ever get quantum powers the whole persona and character design seemed like they were going for a new “hero” entirely separate from the wasp ,2018-07-09
even evangeline was getting laughs from me,2018-07-09
the ants getting eaten by seagulls almost killed me ,2018-07-09
i liked both but i also thought the first one was funnier there were multiple luis scenes from the first one that had me cracking up even how he tells scott about his gf mom and dad in this one he mainly had the truth serum scenes that were funny,2018-07-11
theres always an alien battle cruiser or a corellian death ray  or an intergalactic plague intended to wipe out life on this miserable  little planet,2018-07-11
i kept waiting for that to happen,2018-07-11
he was under house arrest,2018-07-15
i really didnt feel like any of the avengers films were anything close to selfserious or grimdark even at their darkest the characters are quipping constantly,2018-07-08
i dont think it was terribly random  ghosts whole plan hinged on janet having absorbed enough quantum energy to stabilize her  she just had a different delivery method in mind,2018-07-08
she said the quantum realm changed her isnt that clear enough,2018-07-08
that felt like such a cheap way to do it like even bill says shes a brilliant scientist who could help her but instead of using her mental abilities a simple touch fixes her coulda shown a small scene of her calibrating the machine or some  ,2018-07-11
maybe because you wanted a villain and instead you got a more grey antagonist instead,2018-07-08
"i disagree i enjoyed the story which was very low key and didn’t involve the cliched save the world trope

i also liked that the supervillain wasn’t really a bad person and had a real motive to their actions",2018-07-08
personally im glad that they are varying up the tone at least a little having all the movies be carbon copies of each other was getting boring its nice to have some serious movies like the last 2 captain america movies and also some comedies like the most recent thor and ant man i mean lets be honest the entire concept of ant man is ridiculous so i dont even know how you could make it super serious if you wanted ,2018-07-08
or will they,2018-07-07
same ill be going there from now on,2018-07-08
ok its 415 what can we go see well theres a 400 movie by the time we get the popcorn we should be good ,2018-07-08
i do,2018-07-08
because with moviepass you can’t get tickets ahead of time and don’t want to end up sitting in the front row,2018-07-08
based,2018-07-08
something along the lines of im really paying for the 60s now,2018-07-08
because acid and shrooms can  you up down the road and not necessarily in the now,2018-07-10
i hate when im reserving seats on the day im going and see that i might be the only one in the theater then i show up and either families and couples are walking in 10 minutes after the movie starts still having their outside conversations as theyre finding their seats and blocking the screen with silhouettes or some group of kidsteens who obviously theater hopped as they have no concessions and look lost when coming into the auditorium when its reserved seating and yet they still have the gall to be disruptive and be on their phones thru the movie because they are just passing time like babysat children instead of enjoying the movie,2018-07-10
this reads like a copypasta,2018-07-10
did any part of what thanos wanted make any sense,2018-07-20
animals kinda are  resources though thanos is just a giant idiot,2018-07-27
fair enough  i can suspend disbelief for that because actually what i found even more unbelievable was that bill foster was apparently teaching an advanced probably phdlevel quantum mechanics course that had at least 50students in it and most of them were women,2018-10-06
not even wormhole xtreme could figure it out ,2018-10-06
thats because of the haircut she was all business ,2018-07-07
hoeslty yeah 2 story in sf proper ,2018-08-07
certainly looked like early morning light in sf,2018-07-15
he punches people once and they get kod,2018-07-07
still find it a bit odd marvel would already confirm her for a4 given the mid credit scene even if we know shes 9999 coming back i thought they would try to keep us on our toes in regards to her fate oh well the confirmation will at least make the next 8 months a bit more tolerable,2018-07-07
"hank is pretty adamant about nobody getting their hands on his tech no matter the cost

it drove him to leave shield and it drove him to do the events of the first antman

makes sense he would hate the sokovia accords as well",2018-07-08
i’d love that sam rockwell is awesome,2018-07-08
oh so he goes back and undoes everything,2018-07-08
hes also a scientologist ,2018-07-08
in the mcu finishes reading ,2018-07-08
porque no los dos,2018-07-08
emotionally via truth serum,2018-07-09
no it is happening right beforeduring,2018-07-09
looks like someone didn’t stay for the ending credit scene haha,2018-07-09
"but i think its been established shes currently on the kree homeworld

where has this been established

shes clearly going to learnget powers from the kree jude laws marvell but beyond that i dont remember seeing a confirmation of where she iswhy she isnt present in the current timeline that and the likely lack of aging between the 90s set captain marvel and the modern day mcu are also questions that have yet to be answered

skrulls are confirmed to be in the movie with the super skrull being the thing up in the air ",2018-07-09
i thought the idea was she was in stasis somewhere where thanos cant find her because if you stay perfectly still you become invisible  ,2018-07-09
yea i bought it was already confirmed that he appears in the next avengers ,2018-10-19
true true,2018-07-09
hes hilarious and a great actor  but yeah that is kinda disappointing that hes a scientologist   crazy yo,2018-07-09
i dont think he said anything about hindering his moviewatching experience he just said that that fact is offputting,2018-07-09
love him also helps that he is one of those rare comedy actors who also happens to be really good looking,2018-07-08
paul rudd acting as scott lang impersonating michelle pfeifer as janet van dyne,2018-07-08
and when scott stepped on the stairs effortfully hahah i’m legit laughing,2018-07-07
shes an antagonist but not a villain ,2018-07-07
well she was willing to  an innocent person without their consent so she could live also her path to janet led to people getting hurt but she’s redeemable in the fact that she hasn’t killed any innocent people yet i guess she killed that fbi guy when he was defenseless tho i mean he’s not innocent or anything but he didn’t deserve to die,2018-07-07
im guessing shes fine since an older actress will play teenage cassie in avengers 4,2018-07-07
dittoalmost looked like it was in a bubble or something,2018-07-08
yeah i saw it as well,2018-07-08
that’s a problem with all movies everyone wakes up with perfect makeup it’s her “quantum abilities” ,2018-07-08
they shrink in stages the tardigrade scale was microscopic and they then went beneath that at the next step so the whole journey is shrinking down from lifesize to smaller and smaller and smaller until finally you were at the smallest possible level ,2018-07-08
hanks ship continued shrinking after that encounter with the tardigrades,2018-07-08
"glad they didnt go that route tbh
",2018-07-09
even evangeline lily confirmed she will be in a4,2018-07-09
but ant man doesn’t even know about thanos although i guess they would have seen the ship landing in new york on the news before the snap,2018-07-09
so is half of the trees and grass also disappeared,2018-07-10
probably cause  is wrong and disgusting ,2018-07-10
insects can be considered a resource part of the food chain maybe thanos concept of the snap is sentient creatures that only consume and pollute are affected,2018-07-11
no one asked if he meant john wick,2018-10-17
actually that pun wasnt intentional but yeah lets go with it lol,2018-07-06
i missed that city shot then it would explain where she got her sword from and clothes any screenshots of it yet,2018-07-11
i heard someone saying something about seeing a city  i must of missed it and dont read comics like in depth whats the city,2018-07-12
"maybe she absorbed the energy antman was getting after post credits that maybe sustained her because of the limitless energy

edit another thought i had

when antman grows to giant man he gets physically very tired quickly his size burns massive energy thats why he slept 3 days afteralso wanted orange slices so turning the opposite way the energy burn in the quantam realm is infinitely small maybe she didnt need to eat once because her energy can last for decades",2018-07-11
i don’t think “you know i’m an avenger” now was either ,2018-07-07
rhodey made it too although i suppose he is in phase one even if hes not an avenger he is a major character in the first two iron man movies and of course rocket made it out alive too ,2018-07-09
i disagree with the quantum realm being protection thanos is in control of all of this reality be it small or big i would agree that scott making it to the quantum realm before the snap is important,2018-07-09
hes going to be a big part of the next one according to concept images  behind the scenes,2018-07-09
maybe time  vortex to the 90s,2018-07-09
i hope she had toilet paper in there,2018-07-09
i for one made an audible gasp,2018-07-18
dafuq  i think i forgot about this ,2018-07-19
"could be a they are technically heroes who have helped saved america in the past so we can cut them some slack kind of thing

alternatively could sorta be using them as low key bait hoping theyll come in contact or be contacted by the others",2018-07-21
"what was the deal about thou  

",2018-07-20
but she was talked out of going for cassie,2018-07-08
i cant believe theyd support that murderer,2018-07-09
to be fair if i really were a shill i’d be praising almost every aspect of the movie and saying it’s like a 9 or 1010 film which i clearly don’t say i did list a criticism and i could have put down a few more i do have a pr degree so i guess i’m used to writing in a fanboyshill sounding style lol ,2018-07-09
yeah the ant helped lighten the mood maybe but you seehear that emergency broadcast thing so it was a little jarring ,2018-07-06
its a common postapocalyptic trope and i love it every time i mean even walle did it ,2018-07-06
i bet cassie died too and her mom and stepdad ,2018-07-06
well maybe its the dirty minded teenager in me and my friends but we took that different and could not stop laughing ,2018-07-06
no john wick is the one you send to  the baba yaga,2018-07-06
ill take your word for it im not saying its a bad thing just an observation,2018-07-06
yes but like when dr manhattan was vaporized im suggesting that she gained the ability to control things at the subatomic level even her own particles ,2018-07-07
but what if dusting the person just sent them to the quantum realm where they are so small they dont disrupt the universes resources,2018-07-07
is he in the next tarantino movie i think that bit of news missed me but if that’s true i am thrilled i have mixed feelings on the hateful eight but more negative than positive but one of the biggest bright spots in it was the casting of walton goggins he and samuel l jackson played off of each other so well,2018-07-08
i have come to bargain,2018-07-09
thats what im guessing scott is going to go reality jumping in a4 retrieving dead heroes from alternate timelines,2018-07-10
well either that or her andor stepdad were dusted,2018-07-11
definitely  also pretty sure they setup the explanation for cap marvels powerset with the quantum energies janet utilized,2018-07-18
do remember that before the wakanda part there was a fairly large attack on new york and also the smaller conflict in scotland probably the ramifications were never widely known though,2018-07-18
i expected it because rudd said on seth meyers that it tied in ,2018-07-07
ah thats fair the only thing ive ever seen was the wasp running on the knife i try to make a habit not to watch trailers although its impossible to avoid when seeing other movies sometimes ,2018-07-07
public service announcement don’t watch any trailers for movies you already know you’ll be watching my movie experience has been so much better since i started this practice,2018-07-08
tell me about it he it’s fine i want to see the movie again we have an imax theater in the city and the movie looks gorgeous the quantum realm it’s amazing and because of the size of the screen you truly feel like an atom in there ,2018-07-13
"a name for any postcredits scene its often used as a type of easter egg for people who stick around for the credits when most people had left the theaterchanged the channel sometimes a comedy will include outtakes sometimes the outtakes can be better than the movie

this is often used to provide some kind of sequel hook but may also be there just as a final gift to the audience such as a comedy giving one final joke and punchline to the audience or a dramatic work showing that maybe the guy who made a heroic sacrifice is not quite dead

often done as a form of thats all folks it can overlap with creative closing credits if the format of the credits almost constitutes a special production in and of itself



sorry ive been reading too much tvtropes lately 
",2018-07-13
well i guess to each their own i also liked the homecoming one a lot since you mention it ,2018-07-06
i dont know that this one felt any more off than the others i tend to hate the stan lee cameos in general because they almost always seem very forced and out of left field to me,2018-07-06
i figure it would be almost like being in prison in solitary except trippy as  i still think id lose my marbles if i was there for 30 years i was really waiting for her to somehow go crazy nuts evil on us out of no where ,2018-07-07
if she survived the snap,2018-07-07
"im not talking about the battle per se im talking about the ship that wrecked bronx or it was washington
were is this movie located",2018-07-07
why are you quoting yourself,2018-07-07
if its not a thing down there how did the mother age at the same rate as hank,2018-07-07
dont forget the interview as well,2018-07-07
awesome get this guy into shield,2018-07-07
its called the microversehttpmarvelwikiacomwikimicroverse ,2018-07-07
its a thing in the comics but i cant remember what exactly its called the fantastic four visit there on occasion you basically shrink so far down that you enter into another dimension ill have to see if i can look it up right now ,2018-07-07
slightly more than have the people i have talked to interpreted the post not mid scene to imply exactly what you were saying i find that unlikely given the fact that scott was not home at the time,2018-07-07
the link is a spoiler tag,2018-07-07
they did it just didnt stop and say the stuff before hand,2018-07-08
nah this one was worse we were all wanting another infinity war tie in the gotg one was great because it introduced a new character and a new aspect to the universe we had already seen the ant playing drums before that,2018-07-09
but gamorah is in the soul realm and also didnt get snapped,2018-07-09
oh sweet i didnt really read up on casting notes but it seemed like a way to put them out of a4 but i cant wait to see more evangeline lilly to be honest ,2018-07-09
no because then he would be arrested for conspiring with super heroes ,2018-07-09
giant luis would be  hilarious,2018-07-09
yeah i kinda thought that too still liked his involvement tho,2018-07-10
in all likelihood youre right ,2018-07-10
"in the quantum realm you only need to eat and  once every 300 years because quantum

",2018-07-10
"maybe the healing stuff is also nourishing stuff so you dont need to eat

you can  anywhere though no reason why not",2018-07-11
" this is the same with many marvel movies when the characters cant keep their  masks or helmets on

theres actually a very good reason for this dc has the benefit of many of their characters wearing half masks or no mask unfortunately for marvel a lot of their characters have full face masks 

this means to get reaction shots during big fight sequences the filmmakers have 2 options 1 animate the mask to show reaction what they did with the new spiderman mask which runs the risk of it looking really cheesy or 2 find some reason for the mask to come off one of the best examples is in the spiderman trilogy when peter parkers mask ends up torn or ripped in almost every big fight 

marvel has gotten pretty created with how they handle this especially lately mechanical mask for spiderman phasing masks in black panther but sometimes the easiest and best solution is to just have them take off their mask
",2018-07-15
"they usually need to take their maskshelmets off to show emotion an actor can only do so far to portray something without his face

thats why we have closeups of tonys face inside the helmet almost everytime hes in the suit same with rhodey etc",2018-07-13
"i dont have a problem with the characters taking their helmets off when not engaging in combat my problem was the plothole of the size shifting and him not wearing his helmet because it was established in the first movie 

this film is sort of like iron man 2 and 3 not really good films perse but the cast give enough charm and talent to make it feel decent",2018-07-13

i can buy this then what about her aging like someone said i know im nit picking here and its a movie ,2018-07-06
looked like she turned one of her wings into a spear like weapon ,2018-07-06
thank for this i was ignorant on the quantum realm but this makes perfect sense ,2018-07-07

tbf hyundai motor finance is a  of a company,2018-07-10
yeah i agree with you there her being a mysterious amazing fighter where tid bits of history was dropped throughout would have been a lot more interesting i guess the movie just really want to focus on the saving janet plot ,2018-07-11
"every spacefaring government would immediately be aware of the spaceships chilling in orbit to deposit the black order and outriders even if wakanda is secretive it would have been on the news everywhere 

but honestly its not a terrible mistake",2018-07-17

it was being thoroughly covered by the ny news so idk why they didnt at least include a little clip of him watching and being like huh thats weird",2018-07-17

"was it not necessary to go smaller than an atom to trigger it

in the first movie lang shrunken twice when fighting yellow jacket so he can go inside his suit and destroy the electronic components but that resulting him to go unstable and he become subatomic janet did the same when she tried to destroy icbm

they both are still bigger than an atom or they wont be able to cause destruction to the electronic components",2018-07-06
i have to agree hes wasted on characters that arent given enough screen time to flesh out their personalities his personality and more importantly his inherent charm are his best assets id like to see him in the third film as the primary antagonist a klawelike character doing the bidding of his powerful buyers who like thanos in avengers are the true villains i cant imagine we will see a primary antagonist without powers at this point though helmet is really the only primary antagonist to date that had no powers and didnt gain any and he was more catalyst than antagonist ,2018-07-07

"yes i knew a kid in gradeschool who was from italy but grew up speaking english as as second language after 8th grade his family moved back to italy he spoke italian primarily and after about 5 years forgot how to speak english properly when he came back after college he had to learn english over again

yep  he knows pym tech and may find the quantum tunnel and hed know how to operate it,2018-07-08
precisely they should have given him control so when an angry purple alien from the moon titan collects 6 stones that control the universe then snaps his fingers to destroy half scott would be able to pull himself out i mean this is the precise scenario i think of when installing safety features,2018-07-08
ot in avengers 4 imagine elegia playing during the opening credits as they show the fallout from the thanos snap all over the marvel universe,2018-07-08
ah that makes sense,2018-07-08
i’m content with this explanation,2018-07-09

agree its so easy to do hero vs villain much more interesting when theres multiple parties involved especially because were trying to look for the clear villain who opposes our hero but when its not so clear it keeps us more on our toes,2018-07-08
"it’s not that the design isn’t faithful to the comics it’s the materials and production quality 

the scene op is talking about in particular where she takes the helmet apart into two pieces at her apartment absolutely took me out of the film  it literally looked like 2 low end pieces of 3d printed plastic being snapped apart

"i am only talking about the actual movie not the post credit scenes i made a separate comment on that so it didnt distract from my actual thoughts on the movie itself

my point is that scott was not under house arrest during infinity war they built the new quantum portal in luis’s van after his house arrest ends building a portal takes a long time even with janet’s knowledge of the quantum realm i get they didn’t have a lot of time to go pick up scott and clint but they could have,2018-07-09

i asked my friend what movie the trailer was for but it was the start ,2018-07-08
actually in the comics there are beings that exist in the quantum realm and in the film you can see a city in the background of one of the quantum realm shots  so there is likely a society that functions where she could survive,2018-07-11
yeah hank cant even explain quantum stuff entirely in the comics,2018-07-13
tim did not have to pay money to get this role that is nonsense and its something only a greg apologist would say this movie did a complete 180 compared to the first ant man and is an undisputed popcorn classic just like fant4stic,2018-07-06

you really like to say timey wimey dont you,2018-07-07
what is the time vortex i didnt get that part very well,2018-07-07
failsafe may be there but im still doubtful mcu hank has always been pretty arrogant so its possible he may have thought of himself as the failsafe followed by his wife and daughter ,2018-07-07
there has to be a reason janet mentioned time vortexes i have a feeling that scott will enter a time vortex and get transported 56 years into the future  which explains why the avengers all look very different from what they did in infinity war we know how they look in a4 through set photos concept art etc thats just my theory though,2018-07-07

in real quantum entanglement interacting with one of the atoms would break the entanglement thankfully its not a big deal that they butcher science in a comic book movie ,2018-07-07

in the first one he softened up once he realized scott was just trying to do the right thing under weird circumstances  in this one you could feel him genuinely rooting for scott  he was overly emotional in a sweet way,2018-07-07
it is a huge deal in the news but it was a really abrupt come and go event no one really knew much about it and as someone else mentioned most of the fighting happened in wakanda which scott most definitely didnt know about,2018-07-08

theres a theory well was unless you change it a bit that the avengers use time travel of some sorts to travel back to the battle of new york in the first avengers movie to warn the members antman and the wasp would time travel back therefore retroactively making them avengers founders of course with the recent events and the unfortunate mess the pym family has left its unlikely wasp will be time traveling with antman,2018-07-10

i agree with you but it doesnt make sense that she would naturally age 30 years after that though i was expecting her to be the same age she was when she entered the subatomic realm,2018-07-13
thats what i was implying i probably couldve articulated myself better but yeah thats what i meant that using the time stone to reverse the effects of time in the mind stone will have some sort of effect and said effect was actually sneakily tested by the brief moment of lost contact with scott while he is in the quantum realm edit spelling,2018-07-06

i can understand people who dont like every character to be funny although personally i think it works well for the superhero genre but to call every character tony starklite is a really lazy and inaccurate way of framing that argument its actually pretty impressive that marvel made so many distinct ways of delivering humor considering how many characters they make funny",2018-07-06

in other words amtw leans into its genre and knocks it out of the park black panther tries to subvert its genre and while it mostly succeeds i think it makes its flaws a little more glaring even if they arent as big as the ones in am",2018-07-06
yeeeeeeesssssss your down votes only make me stronger,2018-07-06
it’s almost like we have different opinions or something ,2018-07-06
given the threat at hand as cap already saw the capabilities of thanoss children youd figure that hed want all the help he can get though im under the assumption that he didnt want to drag scott back into the frying pan just because of his family and that they really didnt want the government on their radar heading to san fran mightve detracted from the mission to save vision given how quickly proxima counterattacked in wakanda also i think scott may still be on some sort of probation,2018-07-06

that makes sense for the most part  but it doesn’t really match up with her powers in that she can phase through objects and buildings  she wouldn’t be inside those at any given time,2018-07-07
thats actually a cool explanation on how her powers work,2018-07-07
spoilers for the last season of agents but coulson is already there ,2018-07-07

"pretty much just characters and implied actions that arrive on scene as needed with no setup shot or time to arrive the character has to be at that scene because its relevant to the plot so he that character arrives

i think the biggest offender of this is when ghost and scott finish their last battle scott is called to help our with something and so he of course does so there is nothing to indicate exactly how he got by ghost or why she let him go or anything the characters simply have other things to do

same here,2018-07-08
honey i shrunk the kids 3,2018-07-08
"but not the mid credits scene that ugenericperson2 is referencing i had the same thought why would they decide to do that and not see what hopescott can do to help

but then thought about how hank and hope are still technically on the run and not as easy for them to fly out to wakanda and the ny events resolve rather quickly",2018-07-16
i did but what was she going to do after that like if going to prison was in her mind from the start then itd be better for her to choose death instead ,2018-12-17
ah well thats worse,2018-07-06
who has them  im not sure if its another thread belonging to the ten rings,2018-07-06
ghost makes a plan to kidnap langs daughter and laurence fishburne tells her he wont help her if she does so ,2018-07-06

with a black widow movie happening maybe a team up there  a spy thriller,2018-07-06
"not really it was still a really fun movie and the mid credit scene didnt take anything away from that

it was kinda inevitable that they had to tie up the timeline to match the ending of infinity war some people from the antman crew had to get dusted and theyre certainly not going to have that scene at the beginning of avengers 4",2018-07-07
i mean i guess what a tragedy i had feeling something like this was gonna happen but i pictured something else entirely  ,2018-07-07
how so,2018-07-07
there is a reason it was a post credit scene and not in the actual movie by the time antman 3 comes out i’m sure janet hank and hope will all be back ,2018-07-07
if you see it its dark and impactful if you consider all the aspects of it,2018-07-08
wait for the captain marvel discussion thread next year ,2018-07-08
if only,2018-07-08
yeah good point  my brother is a very casual movie goer and he was thrown off even by dr strange in iw,2018-07-08
ghost still has her powers because janet only temporarily stabilized her thats why the antteam got into the quantum realm again to collect the energy to heal her ,2018-07-08
funny how you said morpheus instead of goliath haha,2018-07-09
you forgot about the creepy public service announcement and the empty streets of san francisco,2018-07-09
thanks ,2018-07-09
oh yeah thats right i forgot about that if theyre smart theyd do a deal and let marvel to do the movies but keep the toy sales not that im a high flying deal maker or anything ,2018-07-10
"oof

wait is that why it kept malfunctioning",2018-07-10
"yeah haha that was just so on the nose heh i just wonder how big of a role will he have in captain marvel if its gonna be something bigger or just a credit scene and then just avengers

also hoping for showing some first movies stuff like he shows up for a sec as tiny in tonys house while he is testing iron man suit heh or maybe this time around he will try to create avengers himself hmm not sure about that but its definitely gonna be interesting",2018-07-12
it was playing them in the movie as well,2018-07-07
black panther mid credit scene were i  commercials wouldnt be the first time it happened,2018-07-07
"that’s sort of been marvel’s formula all along though there might have been ones before it but i’m pretty sure they’ve been doing it since the first avengers when thanos was the mid credit scene and the after credits was the almost jokey scene of them eating schwarma winter soldier had the first post credit scene where the maximoff twins were introduced which had major implications for the next avengers film and the post credit scene was bucky that only had bearing on the next captain america movie

there’s plenty of examples but marvel always puts the major one in the mid credits and throws a joke or light scene after the others probably because even at this point there’s people who might not stick around ",2018-07-07
expect in the ant one we see the tv on alert and ppl and sirens in the background its the first time we r seeing the after math of the snap with scott its before the snap i dont think it would have worked well if u reverse them,2018-07-07
yeah i think that only the captain america series has had consistent high quality with sequels avengers 2 thor 2 iron man 23 and gotg2 were all inferior to their original films imo,2018-07-19
"honestly i think only guardians and controversially arguably iron man were the ones where the first ones in the series were the best

yeah i liked iron man 3 a lot come at me",2018-07-17
"im guessing that infinity war demanded so much cgi which is causing the dip in quality  


i liked the cgi in this movie though",2018-07-17
" hoping they stop taking shortcuts

from what ive heard its more last minute changes not necessarily shortcuts",2018-07-18
from what ive heard from friends whove worked on these films they leave cgi until the last minute sometimes and things get rushed they dont have much opportunity to explore and experiment the rubberiness of a lot of the scenes is getting obtrusive though ,2018-07-19
lol yeah probably i just expect more of my marvel superheroes this conflict was so unnecessary they should have resolved it by naming ghost’s mother janet and having hank shout “why did you say that name” at her,2018-07-08
she also blames pym for the death of her parents and definitely doesnt trust him she made her mind up about the entire situation beforehand so even if they could help eva which it was clear that they werent sure they could without killing janet she wasnt likely to  risk the time it could take to save her,2018-07-08
"it wasnt tunnel vision though  when team ant showed up at the college to talk to foster foster never told pym hey that problem youre working on  i know someone who is suffering from a related issue  we should team up  when pym found out about evas problem he was utterly dismissive of the fact that she was dying  i think we got one throwaway line along the lines of yeah yeah  when i rescue my wife ill deal with that

scott never called hank out on the fact that he was willing to let some woman die rather than have a conversation with his old partner or to take a minute to think about possible synergies between the problems

and there was no time crunch for rescuing janet until they triangulated her position and the two hour window was established  prior to that the only time issues were that it had been 30 years since she vanished and 2 years since she made contact with scott  yeah im sure hank was eager to reunite with his wife and hope with her mother but they had no reason to think time was a factor",2018-07-08
janet van dyne helped her when she came back from the quantum realm  in the first credits scene they showed team ant going back to the quantum realm to get particles that would help ghost long term,2018-07-08
is that in the tv show i must have forgotten about that still cant deny its a cool move,2018-07-06
wow i like your username,2018-07-06
it originated in a budweiser commercial,2018-07-06
the first captain america movie itself pretty much was a two hour long trailer for the avengers,2018-07-06
good call just went back and found it in the teaser i wonder if it was originally supposed to end the movie or if they already knew at that point that it would be a postcredits scene,2018-07-06
it was light with nick too,2018-07-07
to be fair sokovia accords only govern international heroing americans doing heroics in america is a problem for the american gov it was the globe trotting aspect that  them in germany,2018-07-07
to the eye that scene definitely brings on 911 vibes i get what he’s saying though after the battle of ny in avengers 1 you’d think when aliens came back that  would the main focus of everyone on earth,2018-07-07
,2018-07-07
yeah this is true never really thought about how long after the movie the mid credit scene took place i assumed it was during though because didnt they say in infinity war that scott was on house arrest ,2018-07-09
the real question is how is it daylight in africa and san francisco at the same time,2018-07-09
" do you normally watch news about things going on on the other side of the country

thats a silly question to ask on an quasi news internet forum   of course we pay attention to things happening  more giant space ships and sorcerers showing up in new york would be at the top of rall in a heartbeat",2018-07-09
" do you normally watch news about things going on on the other side of the country

not normally but if some giant alien spaceship came and had some guys fight with dr strange and iron man i would assume that would make national news pretty quickly and not just be some thing only the locals know about",2018-07-09
"eh im adopting your explanation as head cannon but i still think this was one of the weaker parts of the movie 

we see ironmans disappearance and massive alien ships on tv in iw its how vision and scarlet witch are notified whats going on while in a different country 

im supposed to believe that scott lang and now hope wouldnt be gearing up and trying to go help out theyd rather have a carefree joking dive into the quantum realm while all their friends are preparing for an all out battle in wakanda",2018-07-09
there had to be more time between the end of the movie and the midcredits scene it took hank and hope like 2 years to make the first tunnel cant we assume it was weeks or months to make the smaller version,2018-07-09
it also cut to “antman and the wasp will return” and then a “” phased in ,2018-07-09
we all laughed at anty 20 doing the drums in commercials and in trailers but we’re horrified now of it because meanwhile half of humanity got dusted thanks to thanos,2018-07-09
you are right,2018-07-09
"no one knew about the war in wakanda fury and maria hill find out about it from satelite sensors minutes before the snap the general public wouldnt know about it and it wouldnt be on the news

in new york the battle went ship arrives grief happens ship and iron man fly away and thats it no more to see antman and all that probably thought they could do nothing and iron man was handling it",2018-07-14
well the aliens briefly visiting new york is the only thing he would realistically know about a better question is why none of the avengers thought to call him when they needed all hands on deck maybe they thought scott would still be tied up with the feds or they didnt have a way to contact him,2018-07-15
tbf you gotta hold down the transmit button to be heard on the radio they were using so if hope went first the radio would just die i doubt hank or janet would in the seconds after watching hope fade lunge for the radio to update scottspoiler,2018-07-13

then theres why did she want to leave and why didnt she tell him about it ",2018-07-06
ragnarok is imo the best mcu movie in general ,2018-07-06
and aw is no where near ragnarok ,2018-07-06
ants,2018-07-07
thank you,2018-07-07
nope,2018-07-07
can confirm not a single spider plenty of ants though close ups of legs and heads   not sure if that would still trigger anything i’d say if she’s seen the first one she’ll be absolutely fine,2018-07-07
thank you very much,2018-07-07
thank you for the info,2018-07-07
you mean they were just adding quantum before everything ,2018-07-07
well most of it made semi sense scientifically ,2018-07-07
she said it helped with her phasing i think it helped her remain solid and at the very least it would offer protection either ant man or wasp land a punch to her without a mask and i’m pretty sure she’s going down ,2018-07-07

"the only one that really comes to mind is that in spiderman homecoming the sceneheader at the beginning of the movie says 8 years ago when it was supposed to be 6 years ago if it was right after the events of the first avengers movie but they have admitted to that

outside of that there arent any glaring plot holes per se but a lot of the characters power levels tend to fluctuate as the plot dictates but thats a staple of every superhero ever",2018-07-09
no youre absolutely right my friends mentioned that too and another major issue with the movie is that literally none of the characters have an arc the protagonists set out to achieve a goal and then they achieve it everyone is basically the same character by the end of the movie,2018-07-06
"not to mention there was no reason for them to actually be in conflict in the first place  bill foster and ghost had no reason what so ever not to be working with hank pym from the get go  

and then there is zero resolution to bill fosters arc at all they just dumped them in an alleyway  ",2018-07-06
yeah thats what we all want in our comedic superhero movies right an hour of completely nonsensical technobabble those parts felt like a bad bmovie if thats what they were going for they nailed it thats not a compliment,2018-07-06
gotg2,2018-07-07
thor 2 iron man 2 age of ultron and dr strange were all worse than antman 2 imo antman 2 was kinda middle of the road mcu for me,2018-07-06
by the way its staying around 0 id say some people are upvoting too,2018-07-06
yeah man i have no idea why so many people found it funny,2018-07-07
well it’s called antman and the wasp they didn’t specify which ones ,2018-07-06
"we dont learn anything new about scott lang and thats regrettable

youre completely right  scotts journey to redeem himself in the eyes of hank and hope  basically to reestablish where he was at the end of antman",2018-07-06
but if the earth was invaded by aliens againi think it would make the news enough so that people in sf would at least hear about it,2018-07-06
but i guess that the movie goal so they did it really well not every movie needs to be dramatic like infinity war so maybe you were waiting for something more elaborated than a simple comedy and left out disappointed,2018-07-12

if they did mention ny then i completely missed it lol ",2018-07-06
good points i guess we will find out in the next avengers ,2018-07-06
yeah he was totally wasted here somehow he managed to give a great performance while playing a pointless generic forgettable character i really hope they cast him somewhere else in the mcu,2018-07-06
for a second i wasnt sure if i was in the antman discussion or the tomb raider discussion,2018-07-06
i wanted to know the same was she living all alone in that strange wilderness like castaway was anyone else ever there did she hunt and live on those strange giant microbe monsters ,2018-07-09
they did say at the quantum level there is no concept of time or physics so maybe that stuff didnt matter she just existed and thought though if there is no physics i dont get how hank was able to walk around outside the ship,2018-07-09
"depends on where they go with it but in the comics the quantum realm isnt exactly empty  


and if it isi dunno maybe she wove it out of her own hair maybe she had a rapunzel look going on for a while ",2018-07-09

really  yeah it was a nice surprise and she was so good in that small part wish they had brought her back,2018-07-09
more importantly it showed the city empty and a tv was showing an end of broadcast signal  ,2018-07-11

nice,2018-07-12
am i supposed to walk back out of the theater if i get to a movie early ,2018-07-07
put doctor strange and iron man 2 on that list too  ,2018-07-06
nah you have to watch thor 1 before thor became another comical clown,2018-07-07
i think from an mcu perspective that this true but they are fun,2018-07-06
they dont add much to their own storyline either,2018-07-07
" dont forget dell and mercedes

dude and hotwheels too ",2018-07-08
if it did then it really fell flat on me but thats 100 on my comedy tastes it just felt like they were always explaining sciencey  and giving exposition over and over with maybe one joke to break up the tension,2018-07-06
you know that does make sense considering the bit with scotts phone  i like it,2018-07-06
and iron man 3 and thor 3,2018-07-07
ohboyherewegogif,2018-07-07
aw  good catch,2018-07-07
"but in truth he was there to add henchmen antman and wasp could fight

i hear you on that haha though he already had a buyer lined up i cant remember if that was who he was calling while on the ferry or if that call was just for a pick up i was hoping someone with more comic knowledge had an idea of someone the dude dealt with a lot because im not finding anything on the web",2018-07-07
hmmm never read the comics didnt know that ,2018-07-10
correction  i did like 5 minutes of this movie  there you go,2018-07-08
i wouldnt quite say that the whole point of avengers 2 was fallout for tony making an ai and subsequent films are still exploring those consequences through the sokovia accords,2018-07-09
"for the secret operatives well yeah youre correct but i meant more how many times are we going to hear that shieldhydra ended up coercing people with super powers into doing their bidding just feels old at this point and makes the mcu feel smaller thats why i liked the first antman villain new guy new agenda didnt have a grudge against the avengers or stark or wanted to take over the worlduniverse      
      
i guess you could argue that scott not being antman for two years would make that more suspensefulintriguing but being antman doesnt seem to be something thats relatively hard to be you get small you get big occasionally throw a punch or two flying like the wasp though seems much more difficult 

yeah still a relatively dumb reason at least the way they portrayed it hank and hope seemed to treat them being enemies of the state as a mild inconvenience they were already pretty secluded and under the radar before all that and there was really nothing stressing just how desperate their new situation had become ie something like a downtrodden hope having to wear disguises just to buy groceries or hank frustrated about being cooped up all day 

still we see hank losing his mind the first few seconds he walks down there and its hard to imagine that she didnt suffer some sort of damaging long term effects or changes from that sure you could say janet survived that same experience with her mind intact because of 30 years of evolution but that honestly just felt lazy writing like the quantum realm is just a giant storytelling mcguffin that does whatever it needs to do through needlessly overcomplicated scientific explanation


agree on your last point
      


",2018-07-06
that rings a bell now that you mention it im seeing it again tomorrow so itll probably click when i watch whatever scene it was mentioned in ,2018-07-07
not very the plot relevant parts are recapped  and as long as you’ve seenknow what happened in civil war you’ll be good,2018-07-06
"like 5 minutes before that scott mentions something about his peppep 

paul rudd has also done a skit on the show before ",2018-07-07
when they pulled the regulator the old suit sparked out and smoked  given they were in a rush through the entire movie i dont think they had the time to fix it  also hank is a complete  to scott and likely thought it was funny,2018-07-08
i liked it it forced him to go through scenarios at a given size instead of just changing size to solve all of his problems,2018-07-08
i liked it at the school when it made him tiny but hated it during the final fight,2018-07-08
i see your point but i fundamentally disagree if only for rogue one which was an outstanding film,2018-07-09
yeah but vision also had a glaring weakness,2018-07-11
"uh yondu 

also gamorra went before the snap so shes probably gone for good  plus zoe kinda slipped up in an interview and said the it was strange to be out of the mcu after spending 5 years in it additionally while marvel was upfront about spiderman dr strange and black panther sequels having their main casts back they  james gunn are being very cagey about gotg vol 3  iirc gunn even said that the casting  story of vol 3 wont be announced until after a4 comes out 

final real goneforgood deaths are coming in a4 that was the beauty of the iw ending the three that everyone swore would be the big death at the end tony cap or thor were among those spared  feige has said repeatedly that a4 will not only close out phase 3 of the mcu but the mcu itself will be changed after it personally i think they should call it a volume marvel seems to be very aware of fan chatter and playing with expectations so the ending of iw was most likely a feint and a4 will end with tony and probably cap gone after they bring the rest back ",2018-07-14
like i meant no one died,2018-07-16
"yes i know that 3 die but

it’s very likely they will come back

that’s my guess anyways ",2018-07-13
yeah it was a joke scene but there was definitely a eerie vibe to it with the empty house and emergency broadcast the creepy aspect of it was a lot more interesting than the humor imo,2018-07-08
same everyone in my theater was laughing but i found it to be really eerie ,2018-07-08
same i felt really disturbed by the whole emptiness feeling it had well at least until i found out the ant was still there,2018-07-08
that spiderman homecoming scene with captainamerica was the first gotcha  they had i think,2018-07-08
the very last credit is usually just a joke few are worth the wait imo,2018-07-08
but at least the previous ones have been funny this one was kind of lame and also spoiled if you saw the trailer,2018-07-08
this deserves gold,2018-07-08
the camera tracks through scotts house  revealing the television set getting emergency signal due the thanos snap and no one running the stations  the camera than moves down the hall to reveal the enlarged ant  the one that was left to cover for scotts absence  playing the drum kit  thats it,2018-07-08
well it was animated to the extent that the camera panned around the static figures i couldn’t tell if they were physical objects they had created or virtual,2018-07-08
yes those,2018-07-08
it really isnt good,2018-11-06

shuri is the most annoying character in the mcu imo and its entirely because of the  technobabble prominent in her scenes ,2018-07-06
but as a villain he adds nothing to the film nothing a five minute rewrite could eliminate the character entirely,2018-07-06
"i agree with this im a dad and some of the best scenes are with his daughter

the agent stuff was okay for me i dunno he seems too dumb to have that position in the fbi but i havent really thought about it much 
i think the problem is i dont feel a really connect to everything the drama feels drawn out my biggest issues with the movie come from the pacing and tone 

",2018-07-07
ghost riding a bike its  joke ,2018-07-07
it felt different to me because you’re referring to stark’s character the narration was a specific gag but yeah even though it was recycled i still very much enjoyed it haha just an easy laugh is all ,2018-07-06
absolute trash is a ridiculous exaggeration the sort of thing reserved for something like catwoman or fant4stic  however the comedy did feel jarring at times particularly at the start of the movie where thor was spinning around on the chains and at the end with korg providing commentary that undercut the tragedy of the whole thing,2018-07-07
would be fine if he was downvoted but its not fine for reddit to make the downvoted comments disappear thats just effin  its a discussion board it shouldnt stifle dissent,2018-07-09
"yup

oh after 30 years this even convinced you to start trying to see if i am alive luckily you finish it after two years luckily two hours before the deadline good timing that

i could have forgiven it if it did something refreshing like if you miss this chance its going to be an entire year until you can try again ",2018-07-09
i agree fbi vs scott racing home had its place  it is the only one i was ok with  literally putting 1500 on a timer is silly,2018-07-09
mcguffins,2018-07-09
we need van dynes powers to fix ghosts powers  what,2018-07-09
it is so forced that it takes you away from the movie  if you want better on screen representation show diversity in the fbi agents the scientists friends etc  also who benefits from diverse representation among bad guys  are children in other parts of the world celebrating that someone who looks like them has a a bit part as a nameless  on screen,2018-07-09
agreed that these are calculated decisions but to make sure bad guys are represented by all races  shouldnt those outreach characters be fbi agents and scientists,2018-07-09
the entire movie takes place in at most 3 days  ghosts countdown to death changes for no apparent reason the vector shift was given by van dyne as a 2 hour deadline  i seem to recall the 15 minute countdown being the safe amount of time for pym to spend in quantum space but i could be wrong  i am just pointing out that characters constantly saying were running out of time is lazy writing to heighten drama,2018-07-09
especially when this sub is overrun with edgelords contrarians and wannabe film critics,2018-07-07
"wellits not an iw movie so thats the point

all the events in this movie is presnap still up until the credit scenes

other than thatits just another marvel movie with its independent story line

you want an iw movie you wait till a4  thats where youll get all your postsnap action from ant man that you seek they wouldnt give that away just yet

this sets that up nicely tho

its a great movie",2018-07-06
its really fun movie had low expectations bud had a blast during the whole movie cast is great suits look amazing story is surprisingly good and overall its a really really good movie,2018-07-06
even star wars has become a  fandom i was not a fan of the last jedi  but jesus christ the guys who harass the actors and are petitioning for a remake are insane and make me hesitant to a voice my dislike of the last jedi  b  associate myself with the fandom ,2018-07-06
"see my response above 

also that statement over simplifies my frustration my frustration isn’t people being happy  it’s people thinking they have to be the loudest to be considered the biggest fan",2018-07-06

i asked my local lcs owner how many people actually pulled carol danver’s book at the time of the film apparently only 4 people did ,2018-07-08
yeah so if you read my comment youd see that her motivation is what i liked about her,2018-07-06
true i gotta watch that part again ,2018-07-07
definitely 3 ash clouds ,2018-07-07
i think because he used the tunnel which allows him to go to a fixed point he probably wasn’t wearing the regulator ,2018-07-07
its different suit he may not know how the new one works,2018-07-07
she didnt have the suit on though,2018-07-07
the point was that if infinity war were happening during scott’s house arrest then the snap and people disappearing would have happened in the middle of the movie not during the credits,2018-07-08
"

except for in infinity war falcon says they have been running for 2 years  that puts the events in infinity war right along side this movie",2018-07-08
" edit also the after credit scenes dont always seem to be fully canon for example im getting thunderball ross to join the avengers when im2 seems him being rejected from the team 

i always thought that scene was more fury and widow playing reverse psychology on tony

he is immature enough that the only way to make him want something is to tell him he cant have it",2018-07-08
the ‘i don’t want to go mr stark’ meme also killed any impact it could have,2018-07-07
i don’t know if i’m going to get downvotes but the disappearing thing was so phoney in iw and is phoney in this one still the way they framed it in this scene in particular was so predictable we were only waiting for it to happen so when it finally did and only showed the remaining ashes we couldn’t help but laugh since it was such a foreseeable scene,2018-07-07
if he had lost his daughter i think it wouldve been too much ,2018-07-07
ah good to know guess stark probably find him,2018-07-06
didnt he direct half of it or something,2018-07-18
kali maaaa,2018-07-06
so hes totally giving the finger snap to wild boar kudzu and ticks right,2018-07-07
so are humans,2018-07-07
"how would he have time to shrink and ship the suit  they had a  brawl at the airport  the authorities would have been on the way  
  
i dont think anyone on the outside of the situation in antman would have know that hank was involved ",2018-07-11
eh there are plenty of lighthearted family movies that have great witty scripts imo this was not one of them i feel like a kid could have written and directed this ,2018-07-10
"i think a big factor is the movies are getting more and more comedy focused characters start feeling like caricatures and i cant suspend my disbelief anymore because the stakes dont feel real

case in point

 fbi agents are dumb as a brick theyre incredibly tunnel visioned on the whole keep antman arrested but theres way bigger things happening the way randall parks scenes went he looked like a  and comedic relief

 youre telling me this gangster who has made a ton of money and has lots of contacts is also a  who couldve ended his arc the second ghost shows up but instead contributes nothing to the movie while adding to the mess that was the plot

 ghosts motivations and conflict with antman made no sense but what really made no sense was the finger healing

 talking about things that make no sense this woman was trapped for 30 years in a place where time works differently but she ages but shes alive but shes legit been there alone for 30 years but her hair is perfect and she made herself a shirt out of human hair and they need a tunnel to go pick her up because its impossible to get out of the quantum dimension except it isnt
 and this is the biggest problem with antman itself this is all supported by the fact that their made up science works but it doesnt i can accept thor flying around and throwing lightning bolts because hes a  but if youre gonna change how basic physics works and youre not even gonna make sense within your own world then how do you expect me to get invested antman is a 80kg man who shrinks and sometimes weighs 80kg and sometimes he weights 2 grams depending on what the plot needs and that is only the tip of the problems with their logic

yes i did like the kid and the action while not my cup of coffee could be entertaining enough but the things i mentioned made me want to leave the room when watching",2018-07-11
i legit like the first half of iron man 3 including the whole mandarin meme ,2018-07-10
kinda hard when the last 5 films i saw played a trailer for it,2018-07-07
"im sure ghost will stick around and im okay with that because i think her character has potential i think she could have been killmongeresque but im okay with her being an antihero or even transitioning to a hero after seeing her remorseful for some of the things shes done

i dont mind the movie being a breather from infinity war i just felt like it seemed oddly underdeveloped in many areas not just as part of the mcu but as a sequel to its own original film",2018-07-06
but the entire after credits scene felt racked on and out of place and ultimately just a lame way to take scott out of the action so the original team can take one last crack at thanos same thing with the guardians of the galaxy black panther spiderman,2018-07-06
yeah and the rudd as the wasp scene seemed like he was playing it for laughs but it was edited and came across as sincere it was a weird mix ,2018-07-08
quick eerie with a hilarious send off absolutely worth it imo,2018-07-07
i mean the movie was pointless in the grand scale of things besides the mid credits scene it was more small scale so if anything it just affected ant man and the wasp the most,2018-07-07
but it doesnt really lead to it its a tagline on a movie that meant nothing the plot to save janet could have been handled in the second movie  at the end of iw one of the end credits could have been about how they built a tunnel to go to the quantum realm to potentially save janet scott goes in they disappear and hes stuck now in avengers 4 scott finds janet and she and him travel through a time pocket and get out in the future and then the rest of avengers 4 continues from there you didnt need a two hour movie to set up that ,2018-07-06
but what did it do as a sequel did i miss the character development perhaps it was lost between the awkward quips and lazy plot ,2018-07-07
 dammit losing on a technicality again fair point haha,2018-07-06
ava  ghosts father is elihas starr aka egghead in the comic you also notice his bald egg like head lol,2018-07-06
"ghost was a villain in the comics

then again nebula from guardians of the galaxy was also a villain in the comics but she seems to have become an antihero in the mcu

ghost was a man and a completely different character in the comics so the mcu completely changes her character and background",2018-07-06
you shonnuvabish,2018-07-07
 i knew what this was going to be and i clicked anyway,2018-07-08
its probably the other way around and the people who disappear with the snap continue to live in a new universe while those left at the end of the movie are the ones forgotten hence thanos line about hoping they remember starkspoiler,2018-07-08
someone suggested maybe ghost and perry white might come alone and free him they where collecting the energy to help ghost not a reach to think 1 might stop by,2018-07-08
thats cool ,2018-07-09
interesting ,2018-07-09
according to imdb she was young janet in both movies  ,2018-07-09
even in the first movie  i thought they showed her face briefly  ,2018-07-09
what about wherever nick fury and agent hill were ,2018-07-08
thanks  i really liked the movie  wasnt trying to be negative  just asking  ,2018-07-08
"ghost and bill foster theorised that they could use quantum energy to heal ghost which janet had been absorbing and they could extract by force

my explanation for them being able find janet despite the illogical idea of how small stuff is is that they say the quantum realm ignores the concepts of space and time and is rather a separate dimension that is accessed by going so small",2018-07-14
"well riding the flying ant or whatever is for like you said to get places quickly lol

other than that i agree with everything you said here just didn’t feel that marvel charm i usually feel felt like how i felt after watching thor dark world",2018-07-14
at least for me if you want a serious bleak uneven and overlong superhero film then infinity war is right up your alley just my opinion by the way this movie just put a smile on my face from the first minute and it never let up,2018-07-07
i did and that scene was 100 times more effective then it was in iw i actually cared about the characters in this film which is not really something i can say about iw,2018-07-07
honestly not really my life has been pretty  recently and this movie made me feel better,2018-07-07
" antman is actually a pretty big marvel character he was in the original avengers line up 

hank pym not scott lang 

im not the biggest comic book nerd on the planet but i know that much scott lang or hank pym for that matter as an mcu character is not a major player ",2018-07-08
" antman is actually a pretty big marvel character he was in the original avengers line up 

that would be more hank pym and not scott lang i love paul rudd as scott but he isnt a major character in the comics pym is the main antman and he always had a major role in the comic storylines

in the comics he created ultron in the movies they gave that role to tony in fact bruce banner kind of replace pym as starks science buddy in the movie series ",2018-07-08
i hate  fans like that,2018-07-06

it did but it was misleadingly eerie",2018-07-06

as all things should be",2018-07-08

what i have explained the joke in 2 out of 3 comments in this thread,2018-07-18
when paul rudd tells asian jim that he’s good with children he says thanks i am also a young pastor pretty sure that was an intentional reference to,2018-07-17
looking back upon it it was probably the darkest joke in a marvel movie too dark for a marvel movie even heck it wouldn’t have been out of place even on its always sunny in philadelphia no wonder very few got it,2018-07-17
a lot of jokes fly by peoples head because there were so many and it just kept coming i like them though,2018-07-18
speed force,2018-07-09
not everything does not everything has to the ancient one,2018-07-10
i thought reed made a lot of changes to antman after wright left i remember reading something about how lilys character was very minimal before wright left and even then its not like her role was even nearly as impactful compared to this movie ,2018-07-10
yeah possibly or he might have said oh its that ghost,2018-07-06
thats exactly what im implying  normally i wouldnt have thought twice about it but after infinity war raised the stakes it wouldnt have been out of the question for them to pull some sort of twist since she was on the poster i didnt even worry at all ruined a bit of the experience for me honestly,2018-07-06
 sounds like i missed something wonderful ,2018-07-06
that would require the suit to be wrapped around the bracelet which would shrink the bracelet down with him he can’t just shrink without putting the suit on first to get in and out of the bracelet ,2018-07-07
and also part of it was ego as it was clearly stated he thought he could save ava and not  janet while doing it,2018-07-07
its just a wall of flashing colors i dont get why people say they see thanos ive watched the film twice and took vid of the acs dunno what people are seeing ,2018-07-09
regardless though it would have made the news is what i think they meant like why didn’t ant man  co link up with them after ny battle,2018-07-10
while the toddler sequence was fine for a simple laugh i felt like it was unnecessary they could just as well have found his suit at his home if i had to say i would say that on top of the comedy served to reinforce his connection to his daughter which i feel didnt add much to the movie in terms of enjoyment ,2018-07-09
im not sure either man i love all marvel films and had no expectations for this movie and i could have forgiven a lot of the villain stuff if at least the shrinkinggrowing action was interesting and i didnt even get into the hokey magic powers stuff the takeover of langs body and the healing powers i never had trouble suspending my disbelief in a marvel movie until this film,2018-07-09
and i just saw this notification and had no idea what the  it was referring to,2018-10-30
"also walton goggins is a  treasure and he felt wasted here if he was going to be in mcu man he could have been a great villain somewhere

i totally agree my best hope is that he gets the andy serkis treatment and his character is randomly brought back for a more substantial role in a later mcu movie",2018-07-06
yeah it feels like ragnaroks humor gets graded on a curve because people werent expecting it to be funny so they got points for trying the only line that really got me was the grandmaster saying i now dismiss you fromlife everything else was just mildly amusing slapstick at best for me i understand why someone would think it was funny it just wasnt for me,2018-07-10
monologuing,2018-07-09
"they just didnt call him

big if lets get some things clear natasha was aware that they couldnt contact scott or clint because they had families that relied on them even if they knew scott was free they wouldnt ask him to help because if scott was seen associating with criminals like capnatashafaclon he would be a wanted person again those 3 guys can be on the run forever but they know scott can not live that life with a daughter and wouldnt ask him to risk that

another point natasha and the squad wouldnt even know that scotts house arrest is over not to the exact day

another point hank despices stark and the avengers also hope and hank were  at scott in civil war for interfering with the avengers and getting those 2 characters on the run scott has a close bond with those 2 characters and wouldnt dare hurt them like that again 

another point the attack on new york during infinity war was pretty short in comparison to events that occured with loki or vulture in ny sokovia in age of ultron or first battle scene in civil war or the first battle scene with hydra in age of ultron that new york fight was over in minutes and as far as scott was concerned it was over occurrences in the mcu world are pretty common there are probably way more battles that are not on screen that the avengers faced

as for the wakanda battle only characters with advanced tech like nick fury knew something happened in wakanda but he didnt even know what just high energy around the area remember in wakanda unless you go through that portal everything in wakanda looks like regular african land ",2018-07-10
yea the exposition was really bad,2018-07-06
"hank how do we technobabble the technobabble

janet we have to technobabble the suits technobabble before we can technobabble the technobabble

larry fishburne technobabble technobabble i hate hank pym technobabble technobabble

paul rudd joke about technobabble insert laugh track here",2018-07-06
"youre right i said thanos but i meant his children it still strikes me as a newsworthy event the throwaway line in infinity war was that scott had cut a deal with the government we find out the details of that now but we also find out that he is willing to flaunt the deal to an extent

basically im curious if the avengers didnt even call him assuming he would be unwilling to join

i loved the movie and agree with your 8510 but everyone is all  about the credits sequence and i think that was probably one of the weaker parts if it had been released prior to infinity war it may have been more surprising but then they would have been more careful in revealing thanos goals because youd know he won",2018-07-06
wait so real life aliens from another world show up and california doesnt get it on tv or the internet that  would be lighting up all media ,2018-07-06
"i took the events of infinity war lasting at best two days on earth  in that time frame day 1  tony parker  strange disappear and arrive in space  day 2  the battle on wakanda and the snap  

for this movie to be affected they first all get the news of an event in new york that lasted shorter than the event causing less damage but led to the departure and disappearance of tony stark someone both pym and lang arent too fond of  then next day while doing experiments either to prepare or to test out they get caught up in the snap",2018-07-06
this is my thought i think i replied elsewhere that im guessing they didnt even call him and just assumed he was unavailable,2018-07-06
even if cap knew i dont think he would call scott or clint as it would endanger their ability to ever see their families again  steve would probably respect their choice of taking a deal,2018-07-06
"the timeline of the wakanda attack is pretty confusing to be honest how does the nick fury postcredit scene go from them detecting the signature to people being snapped in less than 30 seconds

i thought that maybe they were detecting the energy of the snap itself but that doesnt really match up with what maria said about the energy signature",2018-07-06
lol i love how you call him morpheus thats what i kept calling him in the movie too,2018-07-10
no real reasons i just missed it didnt plan ahead ,2018-07-10
"they sort of fix that in the next line of dialogue in john wick  
 viggo tarasov that  nobody is john wick he was once an associate of ours we called him…baba yaga

it sounds cooler than boogeyman,2018-07-16
he mentioned quite blatantly that he moonlights as a youth pastor so,2018-07-12
yeah that makes sense was he in the first one or in any other marvel films i just felt like i was missing something the whole time with him,2018-07-11
exactly asian jim is also a youth pastor,2018-07-13
woo ghost and mobster no one died not sure where that was coming from ,2018-07-08

i almost started counting the number of cliche movie lines if anyone goes back and listens closely so many of the lines in this script were stereotypical actionsuperhero movie linesscenes,2018-07-13
"he meant stakes not in the literal physical sense but the emotionalmoral sense obviously if the world is at stake then we cant let that happen but if the stake chooses to focus on one character in this case janet van  or a smaller group of people like in the dark knightthen the stakes need to have an actualy capacity to carry considerable weight which in the case of janet in antman and the wasp possessed no actual stake 

you didnt really gather an actual sense of who she is after rescuing her how shes alive or any relevations from her that is why the stakes fell short and doesnt do anything different as uredbarrel puts it",2018-07-11
how did i miss a scene or line that says the film is taking place concurrently alongside avengers the mid credit scene is set a week at the earliest after the movie ends,2018-07-06
yeah what the  is that about ,2018-07-07
i watched the return of the king without the other two,2018-07-07
ive watched deadpool 2 without seeing the first,2018-07-07
someone who didnt care that it was a sequel and wanted to just spend time with their family besides there was never a point in the movie where i was confused because i didnt see the first one so it was all good,2018-07-07
it never once crossed my mind to see the first movie before seeing this one but the movie was still amazing even with missing some of the references,2018-07-07
youre getting strangely offended by my decision to not watch the first movie,2018-07-07
the dead silence aside from the emergency distress alarm and the drumming was very chilling,2018-07-07
like that ray bradbury story about the selfautomating house functioning after nuclear war ,2018-07-07
the formal introduction to janet seemed fake like it was too good to be true after 30 years of being stuck in the quantum realm i would think she would want revenge for what happened to her,2018-07-07
i feel like her formal introduction felt too good to be true,2018-07-07
i didnt see any prerelease info so i dont know if it was mentioned but i thought for sure ghost was janet,2018-07-07
ghost didnt exist as the films main antagonist tho its the movies problem overall randall park and walt goggins seemed like bigger problems honestly ghost kind of became a minor inconvenience if anything  i also felt it was way to convenient that her little room the cube thing integrated with the quantum tunnel or that it could get set up as fast as she did it nor did they explain how it got back to the lab although one can assume it was of course shrunkthe entire end of the film invalidated what little arc she had which is sad because she was very well acted and the character design was spectacular unless janets quantum powers are super important i dont understand why this storyline with laurence fishburne was forced in when ghost could have just been a mercenary working for goggins or something i still want to stress i liked the movie but as others have said there was a lot going on ,2018-07-07
aw man dont compare anything to jurassic world 2 lol just saw that last nite one of the wordt experiences ive had in recent memory watching a movie in theaters ,2018-07-07
yeah janets gonna be a wizard or some kind of cleric orbaba yaga,2018-07-08
to be fair they didnt teach it to play the drums but just programmed the motions into it its basically an organic robot,2018-07-09
which is a shame because they couldve made a great gag out of scott trying to pull out a chair or move a desk and finding out its literally nailed to the floor,2018-07-09
think parker in infinity war,2018-07-06
stakes dont have to be worldending for them to feel important,2018-07-06
yeah every time i see him i just think of kim now lol ,2018-07-07
thats interesting ,2018-07-07
no but there are multiple cameras keeping watch on every part of the city at any moment and an entire building suddenly appearing in the skyline would be noticed very quickly,2018-07-07
they probably didnt know im guessing that scott wasnt really keeping in touch with the avengers at that point,2018-07-08
ooooooohhhh,2018-07-08
i know he found her in argentina but was it ever claimed if it had been the nazis who were experimenting on her i cannot understand how she went from whenever she was from when the explosion happened to argentina ,2018-07-09
honestly i thought the truth serum thing was one of the few jokes that actually worked for me,2018-07-07
"spoiler yeah what was funny when i went to see the movie there were a few kids sitting a couple of seats across from and when that end credit scene happened one of them said nooooo i hate thanos  i lost my  when that kid reacted lol
",2018-07-12
yo chill satan chill,2018-07-09
she was definitely cool in that edgy kind of way but i personally felt like the movie didn’t allow her to be threatening when her hand was in dude’s neck there was some suspense but after that the only person she was putting in any real danger was a character we had never met before ,2018-07-09
it’s because the stakes weren’t end of the world that ppl think she was meh ,2018-07-09
not sure why your attacking him for his opinion honestly i felt the same and so did my brother thought the movie was overall fun and enjoyable but i would definitely say the plot felt extremely weak and would not rate this as a good movie by any means ,2018-07-09
the people who actually enjoyed this movie would feel at home with the transformers series ,2018-07-09
dont kid yourself buddy  marvel movies are on the same level as transformer movies  theres nothing thought provoking or artistic about them they are popcorn flicks so put down the bowl of your own farts and get over yourself ,2018-07-09
"one in particular when ghost kicks the fbi agent trying to steal the lab and then it cuts to hank and hope in the patrol car while an agents walkietalkie says officer down

it was just very sudden and the patrol car shot was too tight to establish any sense of location after a beat i figured it out because we see hope getting in the patrol car earlier but it just felt very sloppy 

there were a couple of others that stood out as i was watching that ill try to remember ",2018-07-06
i feel the important part of that scene is the tv the emergency broadcast i couldnt read what it says hopefully some of the screen grabs it,2018-07-06
oh ok thanks,2018-07-06
only for the quantum realm scene when hank first enters it’s pretty crazy looking,2018-07-06
you seem to be the only yes  are these scenes utilizing the full 3d are they enhanced with it,2018-07-06

i dont think she completely healed her it was a temporarily fix that is why scott went back into the quantum realm in the mid credits scene they were getting quantum energy so they could help bill cure ghost,2018-07-07

sw and mcu fanboys are becoming one and the same,2018-07-07
that really should have been justin hammer,2018-07-08
i thought so too the character seemed to exist only to include the tired 80s movie era gangster villain with his gang of goons for the hero to punch out and for the classic car chase scene,2018-07-09
exactly and its not like he will have any lasting impact ghost and foster are clearly here to stay for a while develop them a bit more,2018-07-08
i dont think they really carried it in the final product either,2018-07-08
you got me,2018-07-09
"i live in san antonio and wont go to alamo theaters anymore because talking is a huge problem there

heh i was at a flix which is similar sadly i just moved away from austin and there is no ad here i really miss all the free preview screenings since i averaged over one movie a week to get top brass for many years it is nice to see someone condescend like theyre awesome for knowing the drafthouse exists,2018-07-09

a bad movie is a bad movie has nothing to do with the size or budget of a film it was a disappointment because it was bad where the first one was good this movie just seemed really rushed ,2018-07-18
in the sense where by the 50th minute of the movie you’re like “alright we get it” and the movie has a mother hour to go ,2018-07-18
did they deage michael douglass again it looked great in the first one,2018-07-06

what was the post scene,2018-07-07
thank you ,2018-07-06
but in iw the reason given for antman not being there is because he is on house arrest,2018-07-06
thanks,2018-07-08
the mcu dosent do filler movies even thor the dark world had ramifications to the wider mcu ,2018-07-06
so 2 hours for one line ,2018-07-06
i mean team cap yeah thats what i call him are fugitives and ant man is paying his sentence by house arrest i can see the team leaving him alone since he is doing the right thing also hes not an avenger perse so why get him involved,2018-07-06
nope even black widow says hes on house arrest in infinity war,2018-07-06
"didnt they mention he was on house arrest during the iw 
although youre right why would they go back into the quantum dimension the next day",2018-07-06
he was still on probation and hankhope were still fugitives,2018-07-06

because those people are bad similar to how other religions are bad except that this is a recent invention and theyre still bad have killed people etc you may as well ask why it matters that actor name is an avowed neo  or something,2018-07-08
it isnt a big deal but if you view for other threads on this subreddit about micheal pena every comment is about his religion ,2018-07-07
i was just kinda assuming theyd have a deadmans switch to pull him out of the quantum realm after x amount of time regardless of their intervention  youd think theyd learn their lessons and such,2018-07-09
were pretty sure antman is in avengers 4 so he gets out of there one way or another i doubt  be hanging around in the quantum realm for too long ,2018-07-09
i think the survivor could have run to the edge of the rooftop or something to see what the  was going on all around them dropping the mic in the process and will be there after the scene we saw to rescue scott ,2018-07-09
there were definitely 3 clouds ,2018-07-09
one of them is obscured by some of the machinery but you see the third pile as it pans around to the communicator,2018-07-09
no why my family just doesnt like it when were vocal in a theater and weve never been in one thats vocal cause were never for opening nightsexcept for infinity war and this one,2018-07-06
there were people who screamed in my theater,2018-07-06
his line about his restaurant while he was under truth serum was literally the only good thing that came from the character he might be the most wasted actor in the entire mcu,2018-07-07
cool did they also plan to release an incredibly average unmemorable badly written movie too if they did then their aim is true in my books ,2018-07-06
"i would argue the seagulls scene did not portray itself as a lazy addition that padded the runtime it was humorous and did not arbitrarily delay antman’s goal antman planned to go in small the seagulls changed his strategy  
  
on the other hand the fbi prevents scott’s continued assistance with hope and hank he has to run home just to have more quips with agent woo scott has a momentary falling out with hh then those two are arrested by the fbi scott breaks them out ending their unnecessary capture and irritation towards scott that’s some nuisance right there",2018-07-08
i have seen many people on here make similar claims is this guy and no one has backed it up with any real examples was it a perfect movie by no means but absolute pure utter trash come on now lol good luck getting a well though out response from anyone,2018-07-19
" the 2 villains   the black market bigshot was like a tv bad guy

 the security company guys  the sidekicks  were just there for comic relief and they did a poor job of it because they were just goofy 

 half the movie was about scott and his  kid and not breaking his probation  i dont care

 this movie was made for the teen and preteen crowd  im neither",2018-07-20
"so thinking this movie is mediocre means im cynical lol better than being a shallow minded fanboy i guess  

do you get paid to defend these marvel movies or what ",2018-07-13
thanks for the clarification,2018-07-06
if its coming off like i didnt like the movie thats incorrect i enjoyed it unfortunately in this love it or hate it landscape i fall around the middle but definitely slanted positively i think the two previous mcu movies were the real palette cleansers because they really felt fresh particularly black panther in terms of storytelling and directing this was still a fun time dont get me wrong,2018-07-09
"haha she is awfully good looking

but i definitely appreciate your perspective on fishburne i guess i found it all a bit contrived with all of the subplots going on i do think it is refreshing that they twisted on a classic villain character",2018-07-09
"hmm i actually really liked her in lost and have no personal vendetta against her

i think i need a second watching to get to the root of what i am feeling",2018-07-09
most of the marvel movies have actually been pretty decent in this regard civil war was the first captain america movie i watched and i had also only seen iron man before avengers they hold up really well without context,2018-07-17
"i doubt it was months or years probably days at most they probably dont know the exact date of the ending of his house arrest and even if they do scott is still under probation for 3 years after otherwise its just a very minor mistake in continuity

not only that but this is a universe where weve already accepted that tony stark can build a new iron man suit a week and fabricate it in under an hour  if youre going to start dissecting the movie on realism that ship sailed a long time ago  and this movie is supposed to take place a month or two before the events of infinity war and ends just after the snap",2018-07-09
thats exactly what im saying its hilarious how much this blows without the kind of groundwork edgar laid in the first film to work off,2018-07-06
i was cringing all throughout the film,2018-07-06
he was talking when we was getting sleepy in giant form idk if that could be heard or not though ,2018-07-07
anyone could have been in there yes but the fact that he could have been in there and literally the fbi just waves it off and decides to not investigate further is hard to believe i get that he was supposed to be the most cartoony villain here but cmon ,2018-07-07
thank you,2018-07-06
this is so obtuse as to be hilarious that isnt even close to what i am talking about ,2018-07-08
"during the whole see you later conversation paraphrasing here

scott i thought you maybe wanted to have dinner or something

jimmy no i didnt oh never mindwait did you want to have dinner because im free",2018-07-08
how is it forced,2018-07-09
look it wasn’t a terrible movie it just not that good there’s nothing edgy about pointing flaws in a piece of work and if you’re gonna respond with some   like “lighten up it’s a superhero movie” you’re absolutely right but if a studio spends millions of dollars on a film shouldn’t the written characters actually be  decent shouldn’t actions make sense,2018-07-07
bam,2018-07-09
hence why i said the post credit scene and not the mid credit scene,2018-07-13
"ill keep it concise since once again i feel like full blown discussiondebate isnt quite worth it

everything surrounding janet and her magic healing abilities at the end

mostly everything related to shrinkinggrowing is in the trailer 

when ant man calls out the script for inserting quantum in front of words or how goggins purchased a ferry ticket this might sound trite but its an annoying new trend in films as of late looking at you deadpool 2 ",2018-07-13
i think this is right the movie takes place in san francisco and i assume thats where they still are at the end the events of infinity war in ny and then wakanda take place over just a few hours wakanda doesnt seem to have totally come out of the shadows yet in iw all of that taken together makes it pretty easy for me to believe they either werent aware of what was going on not fully anyway or were just so preoccupied with their own work that they were like eh the avengers got that handled,2018-07-06
that bothers me as well i get why they do it but imho it makes the characters more shallow than theyre supposed to be,2018-07-08
"i know that im not saying that the movie is bad or something because of this it just makes the characters feel a bit shallow imho the same thing with tony not being an alcoholic or the fact that vision and wanda had a super nice relationship although that had less focus so it doesnt bother me that much
",2018-07-08
yeah but that character isnt as prominent as hank pym,2018-07-08
score is way to high ,2018-07-08
laugh track ,2018-07-09
sure but the way its being brought up in press interviews its acting like its the first women actress to take part in a marvel movie it seems awfully dismissive to just handwave away every other woman whos been in the movies before honestly,2018-07-06
"lol what

what makes you think im a trump supporter and where the  am i talking about white male oppression either 

jesus christ dude talk about reading into something that isnt there

im sick of hearing about the male actors being babies for saying their costumes are uncomfortable because yeah no  theyd be uncomfortable just because theyre getting paid a lot doesnt mean they cant complain about the problems they have calling them babies because they complained about something is just rude and unnecessary would you call a woman a baby for complaining her feet hurt if shes wearing heels

of course not at least not if you arent an  people are allowed to have things that upset them

but hey sure pretend im some sexist trumpet and  yourself off 

not that youll be interested but if you want to know how i lean politically im a socialist wild right",2018-07-06

ultron is a great film and ragnaroks tendency to choose comedy over drama is a problem,2018-07-08
i think you meant most unique lists nothing wrong with having different tastes than everyone else,2018-07-08
this is one of the worst comments ive ever seen all film is subjective you idiot,2018-07-08
"i meant coloring as in color grading marvel movies are as dull as it gets when youre looking at color grading movies can still be colorful and incredibly dull looking the only marvel movies imo that look truly vibrant are the guardians movies and thor 3

dude if aliens showed up in east timor tomorrow and the worlds mightiest heroes had all gathered there to fight its going to get attention,2018-07-07
im more thinking about the end when they are doing the testing and the snap happens theyve been good for long enough to build a mini tunnel they would be aware of aliens,2018-07-07
except new york and wakanda,2018-07-07
"so it doesnt affect the main story much

thats not the point it makes you leave the movie with a polar opposite emotion than the actual movie left you with and accomplishes nothing other than fan service


its not like marvel referencing a previous film is something theyve never done before

its not a reference though most other marvel movies you can follow without having seen the others you may miss small references or beats that pay off but the plot mechanics still all work they tacked on killing three main characters and our main character being horrified and trapped in the quantum realm as basically the last scene in a comedy movie its weird and jarring",2018-07-08

fine then i dare you to personally claim antman is the best  the marvel universe if you are so quick to defend what they did with him then say without lying antman was the best he could be and you now consider him an a level talent in the marvelverse say that and actually put your money where your mouth is say you personally are invested in hisc character and would fight anyone who said he was bad ,2018-07-09
its everywhere lately the girl is always smarter more determined more focused physically stronger and better trained than the guy all the guy does is show up on screen and make it seem like hes only the lead because hes a guy and they need a male name give him some freaking complexity and grit,2018-07-09
thanos doesn’t care that’s the point he just has a philosophy he’s dedicated to the fault is still on marvel for a bit of poor planning and execution in this movie infinity war is fine as it is ,2018-07-10
i never said wasp saves janet i said the movie sets her up and has janet saved ,2018-07-10
favorite part of the movie hands down  that or the joke about the baseball caps and sunglasses calling back to civil war,2018-07-10
they did it for everyone including the guard and lady sif,2018-07-14
maybe the avengers go through him to find and save scott,2018-07-07

maybe instead of something in infinity war 2 it could be a short video released before the film of luis reminding the viewers of the events of the first film,2018-07-12
are you questioning their security company dude they got it on film for sure ,2018-07-16
easy luis is secretly a watcher ,2018-12-09

er why though,2018-07-10
i really did think im gonna disintegrate you was an edgar wright thing and the luis sequences seemed right up his alley too he did cowrite the original script for the first movie so i think they just kept that stuff because it worked so well and then adapted it for the sequel,2018-07-09
thats just dumb stuff from tv,2018-07-19
no the pilot left things vague on purpose skye sees ward talking about his grandma and become a seemingly open book but he later says that it was just a trick and that all the information he gave her was just level 1 stuff,2018-07-26

you were a profit,2022-10-13
"yeah but thenonce he gets back its gonna be bad

i really hope they didnt dust cassie",2018-07-06
i think that may be worse because if he thinks that the tunnel just broke he may be waiting for a rescue that will never come ,2018-07-09
maybe he could still be antman sans suit ,2018-07-08
they’re tony and rocket though “stranded” is just a tuesday for them they’ll be together in no time,2018-07-09
tony has nebula with him plus the guardians ship has to be parked somewhere close by as for rocket he may stick with thor and the avengers for a bit plus thor has the bifrost for travel too,2018-07-13
i mean she was in there for 30 years i imagine that had something to do with the saturation of abilities,2018-07-08
he tried it right at the end it didn’t work because hank changed the regulator design from the mk1 to the mk2,2018-10-05
clearly what he was doing while the avengers were fighting thanos,2018-07-07
i get that reference,2018-07-07
what,2018-07-09
"does she not wear underwear

also the baby was actually born already they named him nathaniel pietro barton",2018-07-06
what would be worse is if she turns to dust but the baby doesnt ,2018-07-09
yeah but did he have to  them only for them to be brought back and killed again didnt think so lol,2018-07-13
we dont know if pepper got snapped,2018-07-06
right my brain somehow decided it was only the core avengers left but youre right rhodey made it ,2018-07-06
i love that the fbi agent actually wanted to have dinner with scott that was cute,2018-07-20
to see his exwife and her new husband defend scott against the fbi treatment of him was very heartwarming compared to the first movie i like to believe that they wholeheartedly support and are proud of him for what he did in germany essentially becoming a real avenger in their eyes ,2018-07-08
is there a name for that trope i cant think of any examples of when that happened,2018-07-10
season 3 he plays a fixer for the dark army,2018-07-08

i can’t believe it took you this long to watch it ,2018-07-08
exactly the delivery of that line that just wrecked me miss the little girl so much,2018-07-24
question does cassie have shrinkinggrowing as like a natural ability or is it through the use of a suit like scott,2018-07-18
but which order did they go,2018-07-10
aside from to me the hair only enhanced her beauty ,2018-07-11
id hoped it wouldve been scott and hope and hank and janet would assume the roles of antman and the wasp one last time in avengers 4 their knowledge could contribute a lot and i want to see hank and tony butting heads ,2018-07-18
and hank and hope pym got recognized still ,2018-07-14

and how cap and falcon disguised themselves in civil war ,2018-07-24
yeah its kind of a thing with a lot of geniuses in comic books theyre always right but theyre always arrogant about it,2018-10-24

indeed ,2018-07-08
he won an emmy for his performance in boardwalk empire and its very weird seeing him in anything after that ,2018-07-16
 hes in mr robot too had to stop great  show but  season 2 had me thoroughly depressed but maybe ill give it another shot,2018-07-24
they really used this movie as a vehicle to showcase how cinematic their powerset is i feel like theyve definitely come a long way in terms of justifying the characters to audiences,2018-07-07
yeah the quantum effects were absolutely stellar ,2018-07-09
"aaahhh thank you it’s been bugging me for the past few hours i was like where the  have i seen this it’s shame she didn’t have a cape and some kind of phase sword

hopefully we can see her control her powers in a sequel",2018-07-10
its kind of uncanny how similar she looked to destinys hunters loved the getup ,2018-07-22
considering they were getting magic healing particles for her id say stabilized powers but she needs to heal after fights,2018-07-08
she wasnt even a villain to me just the antagonist ,2018-07-08

this kid movie sure does have alot of dark themes you know just some torture manual genocide of half of the population more torture watching a beloved character being brutally choked to death and another one getting stabbed and killed watching all your favorite super heroes all fade into dust while the rest are left to watch in horror then watching the aftermath of half the population being killed off ,2018-07-09

"im honestly not sure how i would feel if it turned out that a bunch of people in the mcu turned out to be skrulls on the one hand secret wars is a great story and it would make total sense for marvel to go there after avengers 4 given how theyve expanded the mcu to the cosmic scale

on the other hand reveals like that almost always feel cheap like it was all a dream the whole time levels of cheap if theyre going to go that way it needs to feel like there was always a point to it not just a twist they inserted in the 4th act so they could keep the story going",2018-07-08

they can always do another marvel short for him i mean prior to agents of shield thats pretty much how they fleshed out agent coulson we didnt really get how badass he was until that short of him kicking  in the convenience store ,2018-07-06
his character can be all those things and goofy it doesn’t have to be one or the other ,2018-07-09
personally if were getting a well known asian american actor playing james bond i think john cho fits the look and attitude better randall park is just a bit too thicc and has too much kindness in his eyes,2018-07-10

i am fairly sure its on a racebyrace basis 50 of each race so as the last titan hes immune to the snap i think,2018-07-11
some people have the theory that thanos was going to get snapped too but the infinity stones used their power to save him or maybe save themselves and thats why the gauntlet seems to be broken at the end of the movie,2018-07-15

id like to think that strange reaches out to scott via time vortex at some point  strange goes off camera for a bit during the thanos fight thats my theory ,2018-07-07
if scott doesnt get himself out he might be able to reach out to foster  or possibly since pym just left all his equipment and the building out in the open tony or bruce get a hold of it at some point postsnap,2018-07-08

and then he has to wait 20 years until the present like janet waited 30 years in the quantum realm,2018-07-19
maybe it has something to do with undoing an effect of the infinity gauntlet perhaps the quantum particles negate any effects from the space or time gems,2018-07-08
could be he masters how to time jump in the phantom realm while trapped there so he uses that to comes back to present day postsnap and realized he needs to go back in time ,2018-07-10
i thought it would be the other way with just hank getting dusted,2018-08-03
this movie did such a fantastic job of distracting me away from infinity war  i am a little bit embarrassed to admit i was blindsided by the midcredits end after just enjoying the movie,2018-07-09
i dont know why you are getting downvoted i had the worst cinematic experience of my life last night watching this movie in imax the guy next to me was reacting vocally to literally every thing that was happening everything and he would yell laugh at the slightest hint of a joke my right ear was and is still in pain im glad he enjoyed the movie but his overthetop reactions hindered my personal experience ,2018-07-06
infinity war was almost ruined for me because of this for every little thing people would shout or cheer now i understand if its a cool moment like cap showing up or something but not for every action scene ,2018-07-06

seems wakanda is supposed to be on the eastern side of africa  which could be a 11 or 12 hour difference  and this scene is definitely happening noonish in san fran and in most cases the wakanda day is shorter than a us summer day so i think even if its 11am in sf it should be dark in wakanda by 7pm again im pretty sure its a blooper,2018-07-07
"looks like wakanda is potentially 11 or 12 hours from us west coast and apparently the our world location of thanos sunset is the philippines

but for now we can say beyond a shadow of a doubt the filmmakers absolutely knew it was 8pm in africa and 8am in san fran the more in story problem is why is ant man not in africa since this movie didnt give a great reason why my money is on this scene happens before the snapture but how or why beats me",2018-07-07
who says these two films happen at the exact same time  it could happen a little bit before infinity war  or at least the battle in wakanda,2018-07-07
antmans films are always nitpicked by dweebs who thing the science is unrealistic ,2018-07-25
it’s supposed to be set in our world and last i checked we still have the one sun this movie was full of obvious bloopers and sloppy cuts so it makes sense they would fumble with trying to shoehorn a snapture tiein but i really do hope this scene happened before and explains why ant man didn’t help the avengers i enjoyed the movie but can’t see myself watching it again ,2018-07-06
maybe so for the rest of the movie but the mid  credits has to have happened duringright after the end of iw since characters disintegrate during it,2018-07-06
"no ive seen films use the wrong accents for latin american characters ie luke cage s2 has a dominican druglord but he speaks spanish with a mexican accent but this is the first ive seen using a british accent

and argentinians and chileans have a really obvious accent with they way they stress syllables so if they were to even speak spanish you would easily catch it

im just going to assume the use of argentina was just to pick a setting for the experiment i just was confused because i was fully expecting some sort of spanish accent even if mexican

fyi the actress is british",2018-07-06
"actually argentina has a lot of white europeans ancestry youd swear theyre from europe with their light skin and light colored eyes but theyre born and raised there like any other south americans for example alexis bledel is from argentina and grew up speaking spanish and didnt learn english until she went to school

but im going to guess that elihas starr egghead is actually british but took his family with him to argentina to conduct his experiments i guess that would make more sense since he probably worked with pym in the us",2018-07-06

" the meta joke is that what stan lee was doing in the 60s wasnt drugs or at least not just drugs stan lee was making these marvel superheroes with his brother and jack kirby like antman was one of the first being created in 1962 and wasp being created in 1963
 
 
 
 so now years later stan lee the cameo character is paying for what stan lee the man did in the 60s because wasp just shrunk his car

thats a far better joke than it just being he did drugs in the 60s i actually thought it was one of the worst cameos the meta joke makes it far far better ",2018-07-06

couldve sworn the aftercredit scene started from the outside of scotts apartment showing a door stuck open as if someone had just opened it so it might hint that his ex her new husband andor cassie mightve opened it and either been dusted too or they escaped outside in the snaps panic,2018-07-23

then add in kamala khan and peter parker and you got yourself a really awesome young avengers roster,2018-07-07
he won’t be iron lad but we can have him once the fox deal is settled,2018-07-07
i thought theyd already cast tom holland for that,2018-07-08
every time an avengers movie comes out i wish for more and more hawkguy he really needs a solo movie or split it between him and natasha or even a miniseries ,2018-07-11

hes gonna go through a time vortex avengers 4 most likely involves time travel and janet mentioned the vortex being something to stay away from,2018-07-06
"if he did he probably would have used it

he might have been careless in thinking nothing would go wrong and theyd bring him back no problem

scott is certainly in a pickle",2018-07-06
i was speculating that it might not work that way with the new regulator,2018-07-08
happened before though with avengers 1 and the giant flying space worms then there was winter soldier with the giant hydra carriers thor 2 with the giant thing over that place in london then with avengers 2 and sokovia i think the world would be desensitized to giant flying things hovering over cities threatening mass death sort of like when isis attacks were popping every few weeks 2 or 3 years ago sure it broke headlines across the world but after a while it just started to become another attack somewhere,2018-10-06
ahhh man that is perfectly fitting just starting to get my 5 year old into the marvel movies i cant wait to see his reaction as morbid as that thought sounds,2018-07-06
friends and i see it s this generations death of optimus prime that really got us back in the day,2018-07-06
this is their optimus prime turns grey moment,2018-07-07
steven universe recently did that really well ,2018-07-09
that’s crazily poignant i’m pretty invested into the mcu but i know i’m watching a story for kids it all feels much much more real,2018-07-13

scoffs thiiiiiis guuuuy,2018-07-06
age of ultron had so many hallmark moments but the movie was just so generic in the end ultron was such an underutilized villain ,2018-07-06
and what of miriam sharpes son hm hmm ,2018-07-06
id assume that the movie prior to the credit scene was prior to iw them not being aware of it during the scene is strange yet not bothersome enough to me to care tbh also the events of iw probably happened pretty quickly after the first attack on earth ,2018-07-06
the postcredit scene was after some time had elapsed after getting pfeiffer back probably on the order of at least weeksmonths they just happened to be sending scott back in at the same time that thanos was doing this thing and also id imagine not a whole lot of people knew what was happening in wakanda which is where the majority of the big stuff in iw happened on earth ,2018-07-06
"well were not sure how long it would have been between the end of this film and its mid credits scene days months

also if you look at just what happened on earth theres not much that did go on that would have concerned any of the pym crew a big alien ship shows up and iron man chases it away almost as quickly as it arrives the whole rounding up of everyone to fight in wakanda was pretty hasty and they didnt have much time to find the rest of the team thats my guess though ill have to rewatch iw",2018-07-06
i believe iw was 4 years after civil war and this movie was 2 years after cw so that’s why it wasn’t addressed until the end credits,2018-07-06
i know i want to see thanos beaten to a pulp bonus points for a moronic human getting beaten up for rooting for thanos as a take that to the rthanosdidnothingwrong types,2018-07-10
whatever scott’s role is in avengers 4 probably works better without any of the three “experienced” characters with the pym tech and i assume the van plays a role with the reference to the time vortexes too ,2018-07-06
well 4 of the remaining 5 from the snap,2018-07-06
 it looked like the entire wakanda battlefield was getting dusted i was thinking these numbers dont add up surely there was a wakanda department store where no one got dusted to even it out right,2018-07-07
and it was shown in a trailer too,2018-07-06
what was it could you describe it i missed it too ,2018-07-19
and that should have a top gun feel to it vs the good old timeyness of captain america,2018-07-07
just as all things should be ,2018-07-06
im only gonna give it two bags,2018-07-10
i thought so too based on the sf setting but dude would be so old right now i know marvel has a  for deaging actors but still,2018-07-08
cut it out,2018-10-04
the quantum realm is based on the microverse from the comics essentially a whole new pocket universe with its own worlds and everything that can only be reached by shrinking incredibly small or magic it’s very possible that she stumbled across a society there the healing particles mentioned in the mid credit scene is able to keep her from dying while still aging,2018-07-07
what college is it,2018-07-18
oh okay  i saw the fishermans wharf sign and i assumed they filmed scenes here in san francisco,2018-07-06
i’d like to point out all the car chases as well it was awesome to see all the shrinking tech work in a sequence like that,2018-07-07
spidermanantman movies confirmed every other year i wish guardians 3 is close enough and in 2020 though,2018-07-06

hey man however long they need im all for it i want avengers 4 to take me to a hotel and show me an amazing time ,2018-07-08
 when you line them all up like that it’s been a really  good year when the weakest movie on the list is guardians 2 thats saying a whole lot ,2018-07-09

the kitchen one was an 810 for me but i really wish they kept doing funny things with the items in the kitchen wasp utilizes them but that salt shaker becoming huge made me audibly burst out a laugh it’s just so absurd,2018-07-06
i think the physics or lack there of that ant man’s and ghost’s powers use makes for some of the most creative fight scenes in the mcu,2018-07-07
hope running along the knife was so sick but ghosts power set and visuals are incredible i could watch her walk around with that effect all day,2018-07-10
i kinda disagree i thought the way they used ghosts powers was just super arbitrary  if the can phase more or less at will how do they connect on any punches at all,2018-07-06
or vaulting through the suv to get to the motorcycle ,2018-07-06

also kind of like hydra shield has many different parts and not all of them know what the others are doing ,2018-07-06
because they were actually hydra ,2018-07-07
hyrda also was half of shield in secret ,2018-07-10
shield was hydra during all of those events anyway,2018-07-13
i definitely got the impression that it was the hydra part,2018-07-06
"eh i think excusing these things because of hydra infiltration iswrong

shield exists to protect if that means having a  spy that makes sense

i think pretending that shield is all sunshine and happiness is kinda the wrong way to go about it there are undoubtedly some dark corners in there and they aren’t all going to be hydras fault ",2018-07-08

just someone whos afraid to die ,2018-07-06
"shes not a villain but more so just an antagonist shes not doing anything out of malice but out of pure survival it just so happens that the key to her survival is the death of a character the heroes desperately want back

i actually like the way they did villains this time its nice to be able to have a villain you can actually symphatise with who isnt inherently doing something evil you can easily see ghost not doing these things if there was another better way ",2018-07-06
the term “antivillain” is applicable here you can use that,2018-07-06
antagonist,2018-07-07
antagonist ,2018-07-06
i think jeremy jahns made a good point when he referred to them as obstacles rather than villains,2018-07-07

antman and the wasp fight over a building and the life of one or two individuals",2018-07-07

they didnt mention the buyer but its someone bad who you dont tell no to i suspect goggins will be back in order to set up whomever that was later on,2018-07-07
yeah but how the  would she know she needs to talk things out in her mind shes dead in two weeks i would think most people in that situation would panic and try to find any way possible to save themselves,2018-07-06
that was what made her great though it emphasized just how much pain shes been in for years,2018-07-06
"she did try to talk things out though there was an entire scene of that

the only thing was for her initial plan to work theyd have to sacrifice janet so the diplomacy failed",2018-07-08

incorrect the events of agents of shield were pivotal to age of ultron  both the hydra raid in the beginning and the helicarrier rescue at the end were directly set up in agents of shield and nick fury gives a cryptic shoutout to that crew in the film,2018-07-08
im aware but they serve the very exact purpose ,2018-07-07
"doubt it they directly referenced thanos the avengers nick fury maria hill and agent sif have appeared 

but i guess the movies literally never reference the shows so you might be on to something ",2018-07-07
not that unfortunate scarlet witch and quicksilver have been retconned like 5 million times in the comics to be different things additionally they havent always been magnetos kids either so this doesnt cause any problems,2018-07-06
slight correction they are referred to as enhanced but yeah the explanation for their powers is from the mind stone,2018-07-07
also i can see part of it being them siding with captain america for the events of civil war thats probably the type of thing that split the country in the mcu,2018-07-08

the only simpler word i can think of to replace embellished is fancy,2018-07-08
im hoping its intentional ,2018-07-07
well part of antman is the generational aspect gotg added that in the second movie and there are some lateral transfers in others like bucky or falcon for ca if mcu lasts for 20 years i could easily see that they take a generational evolution,2018-07-06
also widow cap and bucky have used a baseball cap and sunglasses as a disguise specifically  lots of meta jokes in this one,2018-07-07
people are conveniently forgetting the scene where fishbourne’s character literally says janet is a genius and might be able to save her and she’s having none of it she wasn’t going to change her mind via a conversation with strangers especially strangers that hated her dad ,2018-07-06
i like the thing you pointed out it made me understand the character a bit more thanks ,2018-07-08
haven’t you heard nitpicking a movie to death is more fun than enjoying them for what they are these days ,2018-07-13
yea but why wouldnt ghost and bill foster just go right to hank pym in the first place   if ghost was so dead set on killing hank pym in the first place why didnt she just do that in the van when she stole the mcguffin  ,2018-07-06
"this is late but i barely saw the movie today

anyone who hasnt dealt with chronic pain wont understand what it must have been like for ghost there comes a point where all you want is to make it stop you forget what it wasile to not wake up hurting ghost was extremely relatable ",2018-07-24
not really though because as far as anyone knew before michelle pfeiffer came back and used her magic hands ghost had to actually harvest pfeiffers energy to save herself,2018-07-06
how so there was no guarantee they could find a cure in a matter of weeks she was desperate as  and wouldn’t listen to anyone,2018-07-06
"so true

i fine it fun he said he would be a horrible parent if he let herhey is there a parent in the movie that lets his child be a superhero might that have been a small  hank",2018-07-08
"i feel like his arc this movie was trying to find the balance between being a father to cassie and being a hero the first half of the movie he was desperate to get back home and avoid going to jail but after talking with cassie i think he realized in addition to needing a partner he could be a hero and her father and do his best to help all the people in his life it was the difference between him doing what was safe not violating house arrest so he could be there for cassie and doing what he felt was right helping the pyms and stopping ghosttech dealer even at the risk of violating his house arrest 

it was a little sloppily communicated especially with the emphasis on him needing a partner  but overall i thought it was a good continuation of his arc to be a good father from the first film besides being a little more comedy driven than the other marvel movies i think the big message behind the antman movies has been promoting a strong message of family and the lengths that people will go through to protect them that and scott has been one of the few heroes who has had to truly battle with the concept of great power and great responsibility between being a father to cassie and being antman",2018-07-07
"i agree i feel like there were too many small plot holes in the flow so i guess everyone is now in the van and now everyone is away and safe from danger i thought they would play on the slight of hand stuff stronger and there were dozens on adrd lines and quips that didnt need to be

not a bad movie but i can safely say my main interest was the tie to avengers",2018-07-07

hawkeye and widow are hands down two of the most pointless characters in the mcu which is irrelevant in this conversation i do think however that if they were introduced as villains the turn would have caused some controversy the second point pretty much sums up why she would make a terrible superhero i feel like being selfserving is kind of the opposite of the fundamental ideology and the fact you bring up captain america shows you know that isnt the way he should act,2018-08-07
for the record she said she assassinated people for shield so likely for hydra,2018-08-11
luis he’s the key,2018-07-06
it was not  presumably it was foreshadowing for justice league part ii but after the reception to bvs wb decided to just make one justice league movie  but they left the foreshadowing in,2018-07-07

"at one point i had the idea that maybe the quantum realm might be somehow connected to the inside of the soul stone and maybe even wed see some of the dead avengers in there along with janet of course i later realized the timelines didnt align

"killmonger was really  lame as a villain

it would be amazing if we got that scene with the entire main mcu cast,2018-07-09
"no it means that ranking aspects of a film is subjective 

her motives are probably one of the most normal things in the film

how can you tell me without jumping through hoops that that statement has more to do with writing than how we judge the film

if i say thanos probably knew what he was doing was wrong does that knock infinity war down a few pegs

or maybe harvey dent probably couldnt live without rachel in the the dark knight does that make it a lesser movie due to not having a definite statement

 leaving things to speculation is realistic 

but anyways as i was saying her motives were normal she wanted to survive people have done far worse to guarantee their survival

go back to reviewing  man",2018-12-08
obviously its just  but if you want a  explanation then its clearly because when theyre downsized their kicks are still strong which means pym particles conserve force and force means energy which means if youre 1 zillion times smaller than normal in quantum realm you still have the same energy stored inside your body as a normal adult but you spend that energy at a rate 1 zillion times less so it lasts 1 zillion times more which is why she didnt need to eat same thing with oxygen if she had 3 minutes of oxygen left in normal size she would have 3 zillion minutes left in quantum size so its enough oxygen for 30 years,2018-10-25
they dont give an explanation so it was either pym particles or the speed force ,2018-07-07

yeah it didn’t stop me from enjoying that fight i can’t wait to see what avengers 4 is saving for us ,2018-07-23

i never got into comic books i guess because i couldnt suspend my disbelief,2018-07-24
but its been popularized to western audiences recently because of john wick,2018-07-07
i would of thought so too if it was just the reference of baba yaga but laurence fishburne was in john wick ii and this film as well so i thought it was supposed to be an indirect john wick reference,2018-07-07
"also cut was “she seemsmore intense”
honestly the trailers lead me to believe this was gonna be a worse movie with cringier dialogue than it actually was

also luis had a monologue about ghost in the trailer that wasn’t in the movie either ",2018-07-09
yeah and they used a different take of hopes response ,2018-07-09
my actual gripe is that the first one should be in the movie proper i assume it will be recapped in the next avengers ,2018-07-11
didnt seem worth it to me i can assume the civil defences were activated after the snap actually my real gripe is that the first stinger belongs in the movie unless its recapped in the next avengers film ,2018-07-11

"upon seeing his car apparently disappear he says the 60s were fun but im paying for it now implying that he assumes hes having an lsd flashback from where he did drugs in the 60s

the meta aspect of this is the longheld implication or maybe hes confirmed it that stan and other writersartists were doing drugs back then and thats what inspired some of the trippier comics and imagery most notably dr strange",2018-07-06
he said something like the 60s sure were fun but im paying for it now implying he thought his shrinking car was an lsd flashback,2018-07-06
yes thank you that was itching my mind for a while,2018-07-11
i took the second stinger to mean the snap got luis too cause him and scott were roommates and the place was empty,2018-07-07
i like this idea,2018-07-07
we had to leave before the second stinger can you tell me what happened,2018-07-07
nah i think the point is to tell interesting end entertaining stories when you the shared universe aspect the main point you end up with messes like iron man 2 and age of ultron and on a bigger scale bvs amazing spiderman 2 and the mummy continuity is there to serve the story not the other way around,2018-10-12
"new technology and worldbuilding is plot not story  

the movie did plenty to continue the story of scott and hope and hank  ",2018-10-11
thats something oddly specific to fault the movie for  is this a shonen anime  do the heroes need new powers and costumes each time around to keep the story fun and easy to merchandise,2018-10-24
yeah that’s true too they definitely could’ve done a lot more with the quantum realm ,2018-10-10
"given that burch was an antagonist in the movie you detesting him makes sense but yeah as an empathetic character that we can get behind foster is way higher than burch 

the chase sequence towards the end of the film was mostly burchs doing as was michael penas interrogation scene and as both those scenes were highlights of the film i wouldnt want walton goggins burch to go anywhere on my second viewing i was able to appreciate burch better so maybe a second viewing will do it for you too ",2018-07-20
"i tend to agree w uwillie9 ghost is a character you can reuse again in the future mcu movies while the goggins bad guy character did give us the whole truth serum scene he didnt they really add anything else besides generic bad guy i tend to like when other characters pop up in other movies they have done with the heroes so it would cool to maybe have some of the villains cross pollinate as well

as far as ghost motivation hank was a cranky recluse while fost fishburne was a university professor and thus much more easily accessible fost obvious dislikedistrust of pym would easily rub off on ghost who already feels betrayed by pym tech and the system even once pym finds out ghosts trouble he basically tells her he isnt going to do anything to help her until after the request his wife ",2018-07-17
"if we assume that they built the new quantum tunnel in the van as a matter of urgency to help ghost and they started building it the day after janet returned and scott was released from house arrest then yeah it may not have been long at all after the events of the movie but scott would have been available in that time to fight thanos 

the explanation that after the whole accords situation hawkeye and scott took a deal because it was too tough on their families and theyre now under house arrest explains why they havent been around much lately but it doesnt explain why they couldnt be called on at the last minute to help defend their planet even if the avengers thought scott was still under house arrest hes been busted out of prison for less and hed happily go to battle if there was a 5050 chance cassie could die

so it is a problem but there are two possible ways around it

possibility one few people on earth including scott have any idea how serious the problem is until its too late  

infinity war codirector joe russo and writer stephen mcfeely said infinity war took place over two days at most adding that

nobody gets to rest in this film they literally get strange tony banner and wong get about two minutes of exposition out before the story comes to them and now they’re in motion inciting incidents happened and the characters are in motion

maws spaceship hovers over manhattan and a lot of bad stuff goes down  which scott would definitely have seen on the news later that night  but then tony stark peter parker and doctor strange fight them and the spaceship leaves which may look like a problem solved to most people maybe no one knows whats happening up there and how close the universe is to serious peril 

later in the movie just after thanos clicks his fingers nick fury and maria hill know somethings up but they dont know what they havent heard from stark and dont know where he is  edit pepper potts knows tony is in space but she lost contact with him and maria hill observes that theyre monitoring all available satellites but have had no luck finding him that suggests few people on earth have a good understanding of whats happening up there they appear perplexed by multiple bogies over wakanda and theyre as surprised as everyone else when people start vanishing 

possibility two antman the wasp et al do know the universe is in serious peril and entering the tunnel to harvest quantum energy has something to do with their efforts to help",2018-10-02
"this is my problem too iw happens in like a day a really bad day this means that they saw giant ringlike spaceships in new york around lunch time wong and strange were getting lunch when banner crashes in and decided that would be the best time for a science experiment my guess is that ghost couldnt wait any longer  


food for thought though how much time has passed on earth the snap happens with daylight in both san francisco and wakanda if we assume its noon in ny at the start then the sun is over the middle of south america  
new york noon 

  
this is 20 hours later fully morning in ca day in africa 20 hours later

this is sunset over africa a full 24 hours later  


which means infinity war happens in the span of about 2024 hours i gotta wonder about scott pym and the van dynes seeing all of that and then deciding aliens was yesterday were all good now

why do you assume that it happened well after the end of the main movie,2018-08-21

"quotations arent only used when quoting a person and a comma is only necessary when a pause is needed like when delineating a list or transitioning between thoughts relevant to the same sentence  

in this case the quotation is needed because you are titling a concept that isnt already established 

for example if referring to the concept of chekovs gun in a sentence like yours you would say 

there is no chekovs gun

but if we were referring to a new concept one that doesnt have an established name or as in your example a storytelling element that doesnt have a distinct agreedupon name but exists as a trope nonetheless i could say something like

this isnt a story of redemption there is no change of heart

putting it in quotations denotes it as a trope i am referring to rather than the individual event 

its even more necessary when your example makes no other grammatical sense you are using she is stuck in the middle as a noun which is appropriate when it is in quotes to show the whole phrase is one thing the storytelling element of a kid whose parents are fighting amidst a divorce rather than a part of the sentence that is different from my change of heart example which can refer to almost the same thing and make grammatical sense without a comma even


and no comma is nessecary because you are referring to she is stuck in the middle as a noun gramatically speaking if you replaced it with something else like there is no banana you wouldnt need a comma because then it becomes there is no banana

to put this in more specific syntactical context this is a usemention quotation one where the quotations gramatically separate the word or phrase as being the object of the rest of the sentence

that is what they mean before batman came out keaton was one of the most derrided and hated castings for any fictional character they assumed he would do it goofy and act like beetlejuice preinternet the fan outrage got that level of significant press coverage fans boycott batman due to beetlecasting once the film came out the song was changed and suddenly he was batman but pleeeeenty of people did not see him that way before release,2018-07-08

no i agree with uddelavega it not only failed to explain why he wasnt involved in the infinity war the postcredits scene actually added plot holes to that notion in iw black widow says he cant be called because hes under house arrest but do you really think  considering the stakes  that lang would give a  about house arrest especially considering how casual his relationship is with agent wu every time theyre at langs house but back to the plot hole im talking about lang was taken off of house arrest in this movie which takes place before iw so explain to me how black widow would have this misinformation about him even if they cared that much to honor his house arrest,2018-07-16
"i havent seen any dc movies but ive seen lots of different analysis on them and it seems that they went super dark like with bvs to maybe try to give their franchise more purchase but when that didnt work they tried to furiously bail themselves out with jl which seemed a lot lighter and had a lot less weight behind itthe characters

on the other hand marvel movies deal with those selfseriousgrimdark subject matters but they dont let that weigh down the movies sometimes that does reflect on the overall tone like with a darker film like iw where its more appropriate but they can also turn it around and make the tone slightly lighter and less heavy to balance it out the idea and the tone like with the guardians films

and the quipping thing  yeah its a pretty sharp juxtaposition to you know half the universe dying which probably isnt always the best choice tonally but its how the characters react and cope to new environments and new situations so while the quipping doesnt work everywhere i think we sometimes have to see the situation from the characters pov where the world is ending and these superpowered strangers are suddenly dropping out of the sky and really the only option for them is to turn to their defensive default which is jokingquipping to cope and make themselves feel better and to show their colors",2018-07-08
i think people mostly only remember the last like five or ten minutes of infinity war and get that confused with the rest of the movie thanos  gamora scenes not withstanding,2018-07-11
i think we got a white antagonist actually although a grey suit might look cooler,2018-07-11
"yeah marvel has departed from the normalized idea of a big baddie and have had some more indepth villains for the past few movies killmonger actually had a point he just had terrible execution and thanos dont get me wrong hes a terrible guy had a pretty compelling backstory and if what i heard was correct hes actually the main character of iw which is an interesting take on the normal villain formula ghost was a little more iffy yes she did have a hashedout motive to her actions but apart from looking a little creepy she never felt truly dangerous even though janets life was on the line with ghosts plan it always felt like they would find some way around it which they did so while ghost didnt carry a ton of weight as a villain i can see her returning on the other side as another stealthy black widowtype as her phasing power is gone

and i like that this movie didnt involve the cliched save the world trope it felt very personal and after the massive ordeal that was iw it was nice to see a smaller scale closetohome movie like this where characters werent racing to save the world but to save themselves andor someone they loved",2018-07-08
a lot of the iron man movies were pretty funny i think its mostly the avengers movies that get the serious tone,2018-07-08

the bulk of it everything before the postcredits scene has gotta be at least a few weeks before given that hank and janet had enough time to go hang out on that beach and then build a miniaturized quantum portal thing  ,2018-07-09
while i think its safe to assume that the movie and ending scene happened at most a few days apart it could just as well have been a week or more,2018-07-09
i did but that seemed like it was a while after the events of the movie,2018-07-09
"would you say that she was an antagonist


thank you",2018-07-07
oh that makes sense i was imagining the device thing they used to be more like a portal where once they were on the other side they were automatically in the quantum realm ,2018-07-08

sucks that she got dusted would have loved to see antman and wasp work with the rest of the surviving characters throughout the whole movie ,2018-07-09

indeed he has become somewhat of a whipping boy for never being able to drop back issue baggage which really sucks for interesting character development  i was however more referencing his actions of projecting a snarky immodest façade to cover his insecurities over being a hero not to mention his numerous actual mental issues  while he generally does the right thing and is a good guy and stalwart friend to have on your side when in need his dialogue is often purely youre not wrong youre just an   sort of a reverse reed richardshulk hogan who says all the right things but many of their actions are suspect when viewed with outside universe knowledge,2018-07-06
to be fair matt was in the process of being possessed by the beast so not all his choices were his those other ones though that’s all on the hero’s also i agree that people need to move past the slap for hank he’s done a lot since then to make up for it he’s honestly probably my favorite founding avenger ,2018-07-06
ugh i was certain that i heard that he was to be in once upon a time in hollywood but imdb says otherwise his next few gigs all nonterantino are here sorry for the late night brain ,2018-07-08
thanos i have come to bargain,2018-07-09
or visit a reality where the snap never happened and he can enlist the avengers to help save the dusted avengers,2018-07-10
true but the attack on ny was a very brief one after the ship left what could anyone who is not an avenger do it would look like an isolated event that was already being handled to the rest of the world it would look like another brief attack similar to the one in thor 2 but less destructive the attack in scotland was only directed at individual members of the avengers doubtful anyone in the public was even aware of it scotts not an avenger and not only are the pyms not avengers hank wants nothing to do with them and actively hates shield or whatevers left of shield as scott would say the got their own fish to fry and cant get wrapped up in avenger business,2018-07-18
thats what i thought,2018-07-23

i dont know none of the people i saw it with expected a second iw tie in scene because the next avengers movie isnt for a while and we already got one tie in mid credits scene we figured it would be the one scene serious one scene funny thing they sometimes do like in thor ragnarok

 the gotg one was great because it introduced a new character and a new aspect to the universe

what new character and what new aspect wed already seen the collector throughout the movie and cosmo and howard the duck arent exactly relevant to the universe other than a funny cameo",2018-07-09
possible spoilers because rumorsleaked set pics but its been rumored a lot that there will be time travel involved and set pictures have shown scott as antman next to cap in his classic outfit and janet offhandedly mentions time vortexes in the quantum realm during the midcredits scene,2018-07-09
also a perpetual supply of eye shadow,2018-07-10
im aware of that in fact whenever the characters arent engaged in combat not wearing the helmet works really well in these films and the tony close ups work great to show us more emotion due to the solid helmet and i dont mind ant man taking his helmet off in that case but the plothole of him taking it off when he size shifted is what bothered me a bit a solution to show emotion when a character is wearing a helmet or mask is to focus on the eyes wich this film ant man 1 and captain america civil war did and it worked just fine,2018-07-13
well it seems like time passes as quickly in the quantum realm as it does in the real world even though they said that all concepts of time and space as we understand it cease to exist in there im thinking back to the first antman movie where scott goes in and out of the quantum realm and the same amount of time seems to have passed in real life so that explains why janet still aged,2018-07-09
true i just wanted to clarify what mutant means when people talk about it in relation to the xmen and stuff like that janet definitely isnt a mutant,2018-07-08
id much prefer the product placement rubbed in my face than have the company and movie pretend that it isnt product placement disclosure is a good thing movie studios should be held to the same if not higher standard than internet creators who are required by law to disclose sponsorships studios dont have the same responsibility but they should so its nice to see them be upfront about it for once,2018-07-11
"uh not at all why do you think antman never appeared in any of the avengers movies because hank doesnt want to help them he hates the stark family and he doesnt want anyone to know about the pym particles i guess everyone just kinda forgot about that after antman showed up in civil war huh this movie literally touched on how mad hank was

also there is nothing that indicates scott having any of the avengers contact caps team was all in hiding so its not really possible to contact them in civil war it was falconhawkeye that contacted him rather than the other way around

furthermore the events in infinity war happened quite quickly even nick fury didnt know what was going on before he got dusted so why would you think scott  others would know they probably spent the whole day doing experiments and didnt watch the news 

your biggest problem is that you arent considering the perspective of the characters youre thinking from the audiences perspective if i know this and this then why dont the characters know",2018-07-17
remember what happened the last time scott went off to help cap,2018-07-17
that and antman  the wasp was 3 months before the events in infinity war besides midcredits scene ,2018-07-17
"not sure what they could have done scotts still on probation even after the house arrest is over they would see the new york thing on tv or whatever which ends quickly they are in san fran must have thought tony saved the day

then as they are busy getting ready for the experiment maybe they hear some vague news about disturbances in africa that doesnt seem worth breaking the accords over",2018-07-18
why could you think governmants could reveal that info to the public that asking for a panic population making things worse also  we saw it at the post credit scene in infinity wars everyone was busy in their normal lifes except for nick fury and maria hill,2018-07-19
to dont know the sheer size and number of those ships landing on the battlefield including the wheeled buzz saw things would have been very noticeable to militaries and news agencies across the planet plus dont forget wakanda had since come out  after the events of the black panther movie and was engaged in various trade and welfare programs across the african continent if not the whole world,2018-07-18
hank fits the definition of crazy prepared between the tank chain the car selection and the lab building he definitely had the time and the means to make the beach house work,2018-07-06
quantum toilets man,2018-07-07
i believe its because they switched off their regulators which caused them to shrink to the size they needed to be to damage the stuff but then kept shrinking to subatomic ,2018-07-06
exactly this,2018-07-07
it was the emergency broadcast system they dont have it as much but its the sound that plays on tvs during a major emergency ironically it wasnt done on 911 as far as i can remember,2018-07-07
longer answer yes it is possible and at the very least she wouldnt be speaking fluent english after 30 years of not using it,2018-07-07
helping dr strange or captain marvel,2018-07-08
it could happen,2018-07-08
okay maybe not this precise reason but scott still should have had control just in case he loses contact or mission control becomes incapacitated in one way or another,2018-07-08
my brain would melt ,2018-07-08
i believe scott got out the first time because he had the disk that made things bigger that he replaced with his broken regulator if hes wearing the new suit there is no regulator so that solution wont work,2018-07-09
i think she was the ioi security lady who goes all terminator on them at the end,2018-07-07

i just assume anything relating to antman will never make sense i mean the whole concept is ridiculous if hes shrinking is he losing mass do the atoms that make up his body shrink all the quantum shrinking stuff is really just a vehicle for the plot and the kickass visuals ,2018-07-07

scotts in another state they probably dont have time but they probably dont even know that his house arrest is done  its not like theyre in constant contact  not to mention hes still on probation for 3 years after,2018-07-09
ive also been thinking about this my best guess is that these timelines run pretty close together and they simply didnt know he was off house arrest yet ,2018-07-09
cap may have been mistaken about the timing of scotts house arrest but that notwithstanding lang supposedly destroyed his suit after germany  and the only guy who could make a new one pym was a fugitive who in the mcu didnt much care for the avengers anyway  with thanos at the doorstep the avengers didnt have time to go down this rabbit hole,2018-07-10
" scott was not under house arrest during infinity war

it doesnt matter perhaps captain america black widow and rhoadey were mistaken about the exact timing 

but conversely the implication is that hes always there him being in the quantum realm can really affect other things depending on how they go with it ",2018-07-10
they wouldnt have to build a new portal just shrink the one they had and probably make some modifications they only built the first one with all the parts they got from burch so they couldnt have gotten all new parts again,2018-07-10
"absolutely first paul rudd is so funny and he seems vey likeable i first saw him in friends and always liked his character although i wanted phoebe to end up with david

"i see

clearly i need to just shut my brain off with ant man it doesnt really make sense like if the atoms were shrunk down to the point where you could still punch someone with the impact of a normal person even though you are small when you become super big you would also have the impact of a normal person so he would be like a big float if he was that huge",2018-07-11
thanos better hope he didn’t snap john wick’s dog,2018-07-06
hank tells scott not to get stuck in a time vortex in the quantum realm  its rumored that major plot points in captain marvel and a4 will revolve around time travel,2018-07-07
hank pym i dont need a failsafe its not like some big purple  is going to collect a bunch of macguffins that lets him snap away half the people in the universe,2018-07-07
cant wait for a4 either way,2018-07-07
that makes a lot of sense would also explain why they were casting an older cassie for avengers 4 his family would assume that scott got dusted but he turns up in the future that would also give stark and the rest of the crew the idea that time travel is possible and they could use pym tech to reverse the snap,2018-07-07
my guess is he goes back in time and uses the quantum healing to help captain marvel seeing scott in the 1980s would be hilarious ,2018-07-07

we already know hank pym and hope dont care for the avengers janet definitely knows little to nothing about them scott realizes he was kind of brought in for extra help and wasnt in contact with anyone that we know of so really the question iswhy should any of them care enough to pay attention to what happened in nyc or mention it if hank or hope saw the same thing on the news that wanda sees during infinity war when shes with vision i feel like they wouldnt really care and see it as just another avengers problem remember that in this world when theres a big problem the avengers solve it and they cause their own problems solving it too scott didnt know tony as anyone but the person who got him locked up none of these people have reason to be concerned until people are turning into dust",2018-07-06
she is that white gold,2018-07-06
maybe it’s maybelline,2018-07-06
the ant was drumming but the emergency broadcast signal going on the in the background is what ties it into the rest of the mcu,2018-07-09
theres important significance of the ant being the only one in the scene and no one else ,2018-07-09
i can imagine but now im curious was antman  the wasp cheaper for you or are you just more interested in antman than the avengers ,2018-07-09
i wondered about time differences too but ultimately just settled with it being cheaper to not rely on cg since it would have been closer to her natural age,2018-07-09
how do you know it wasnt just a bubble,2018-07-09
oh of course i love it awesome thats why it was transparent thank you obvious now that you point it out thank you ,2018-07-09
yeah but why ,2018-07-09
also there are rumors of cassie lang being recast as a teenager  she becomes a superhero like antman after her father died in the comics  maybe cassie survived the snap and antman is sent to the past leaving her all alone in the future,2018-07-10
ahm tiniverse ,2018-07-11
it would also explain stranges cryptic comments about this being the only way to defeat him one key character point of thanos is his extreme hubris and he completely did not appreciate the risk or responsibility of using the time stone when he did  ,2018-07-07
for 3 more days that is ,2018-07-07
i guess i meant more about the casting rumor you just casually dropped,2018-07-07
but then they wouldnt be able to cast michelle plus itd be kinda weird to have a 60 year old pym and a 30 year old janet maybe her outer image aged but shes still young bucking in terms of health,2018-07-13
"scott i destroyed the suit

hank how could you that was my lifes work

later in film

scott what if i told you i had the suit

hank you said you destroyed it

scott how could i it was your lifes work",2018-07-06
no hes in the christmas cinematic universe the grinch tim allen rudolph and jesus,2018-07-06
santa claus is one of the most powerful mutants in the world,2018-07-08
if any of them are rewatchable  i would say its infinity war best set pieces and great villain everything is on the line in it and it shows it just needs a resolution ,2018-07-06
probably because this is the 3rd mcu movie to come out this year why rewatch when you can see a new one,2018-07-06
didnt we see hank shrink even further after seeing them,2018-07-07
like quantumwaterbears yep i am just going to put quantum in front of everything,2018-07-07
ant man and the wasp are in san fransisco while most of the attacks in a3 is in new york and takes place over a couple of hours they could have been busy all day prepping for the expirement and havent been paying attention to the news,2018-07-08
shes not a one off villain who somehow dies at the end of one film so thats progress i guess,2018-07-09
i agree but i thought she was great  she wasnt meant to be the main villain anyway,2018-07-10
do you count the car chase gunfight and the blasters,2018-07-16
i thought about that too tbh if they already did know it wouldve been soooooooo easy for them to write scott in a line before he goes in the mini tunnel that said something like we should make this quick i need to find out whats going on in ny after this one line like that would make it so iw is confirmed as happening and it would make scotts imprisonment in the quantum realmspoiler that more intense    ,2018-07-10
i mean they didnt call hawkeye because otherwise it would have been way to easy defeating thanos,2018-07-10
i’m sorry but it was clearly an attempt to tie in these characters for seemingly no reason just change the timeline and exclude them in a neater way i don’t buy that scott or hawkeye would object to saving the world knowing what’s at risk just because they’re on house arrest i mean christ they’ve already set the precedent that they’re willing to go above the law to do what’s right or necessary ,2018-07-10
if iw did actually take place over a day i can get why they didnt have the time to get either scott or hawkeye out from house arrest however it seems like a major stretch to have that short of a timeline sure having the 3 concurrent plotlines in iw would make it literally a long movie but just based off the events of a single timeline they try and do way too much to pass it off for one day on the timeline ,2018-07-10
yup a large chunk of infinity war took place off world other than early battle in new york over quick and the invasion of wakanda which would be slow in making the us news i imagine and happened right before thanos made his snap the snap would be the first moment anyone really knew something was wrong ,2018-07-07
im guessing shed be at her moms place seeing as how she wouldnt be left alone at scotts ,2018-07-07
"we have no data on his daughter there is no way she was at his house while he was off doing an experiment with pym shes too young to be left unsupervised i mean she could probably handle it but legally its frowned upon for kids below certain ages to be unsupervised in a house for more than a very short period of time setup for that experiment alone probably took an hour or two 

as far as i can tell theres no official minimum age for babysitting in california and thus for being home alone but in most places in the us most people seem to think 12 is a good age for a few hours some families go younger but someone who had any exposure to the child welfare system like say a police officer whose stepdaughters dad is an ex con would err on the side of caution 

if you really think about it the only person who might have been there at that time was luis do you think hed be babysitting her i doooooooubt it 

i think scott left the tv on as a theft deterrent to entertain the ant ",2018-07-07
they reportedly cast someone to play his daughter but older in the next avengers film but im not sure if that means shes been snapped and its just if they go to the future or if she actually survived as time passes,2018-07-08
wow so the hulk did spend time there and even had a love interest i’d love to see hulk and scott end up there in a team up movie,2018-07-09
"according to wikipedia which granted is not the end all be all of sources…micronauts is part of a marvellike shared universe hasbro is trying to create i suppose marvel could license them but if hasbro is serious about this shared universe i doubt its going to happen

what id like to know if theyre unable to put them in who else could it be theres clearly some backstory to janet van dyne what franchise will they tie it to janet mentioned something about evolution im not wellversed in obscure marvel history anyone have any ideas",2018-07-09
holy  the guy inquiring about bitcoin may well as be an older investor friend i know ,2018-07-10
spider survived the snap eh lucky boy,2018-07-13
what about people mentioning stinger and thank you very much for the info bummer that all the geniuses are gone ,2018-07-13
oh  there was also a postcredits scene,2018-07-13
theres a lot of photos of paul rudd with the remaining avengers shot on the streets of atlanta they are all wearing some funky device on their wrists that general consensus is some sort of quantum realm timetravel device ,2018-07-14
"ny was only briefly attacked by one ship which then left taking iron man and spiderman by that point there wasnt anything anyone could do the skirmish in scotland only involved visionwanda and the two aliens before they were driven off by cap and friends and the public was largely in the dark on it wakanda is hidden from the world at large so its likely the main attack there was unknown to the rest of the world and even then it began only minutes before the snap hank pym wants nothing to do with the avengers and its not likely they would ever call on him no matter what and both are on the run from the government and highly unlikely either would respond scott has been under house arrest for two years and having convinced everyone feds and avengers alike he destroyed the suit the avengers would not waste their time calling on an powerless civilian by the time we get to the first post credit scene with the miniaturized quantum tunnel they the ant family were still engaged in a rescue mission to collect enough healing particles to continue treating ghost and that clearly was where their priorities lay than with paying attention to the news of spurious alien appearances that seemed to be getting handled by the avengers at least until the snap but by then it was too late   

sorry for the long reply but i felt the movie did dovetail rather nicely with iw at this point in the mcu the ant man isnt really a part of the avengers team and the wasp isnt even known to them",2018-07-13
yeah this was the one thing about the movie that bothered me but i thought about it new york was a pretty quick event ship came ship left no more bad guys hank probably wouldn’t care if tony went missing has happened before iron man 3 scotland was an isolated incident and  like that happens all the time in the works now every solo avenger film basically wakanda was happening right before the snap so maybe news agencies and governments weren’t aware until it was too late wasn’t the best scene though i agreed,2018-07-13
" he characters are all happy without a care in the world 

after the opening the characters could not be less carefree 

hope  hank are in the final frenzied push to build their quantum tunnel and drag scott into it hes stressed that just as he is about to be out of house arrest he could go away for 20 everyone even the guys at xcon have big problems to sort out 

so by the time the short attack on new york happens they have their own  to deal with and cant be surfing the tv or internet scotland was a private showdown and what happens in wakanda stays in wakanda plus the battle of wakanda happens away from news cameras and in the last hours before the snap 

even maria hill and nick fury were only vaguely aware that something was going on in wakanda in the moments before they got dusted ",2018-07-14
maybe but theres a lot of room to move  for example theres no reason to assume they hadnt heard about an attack on new york being repelled by the avengers and just shrugged and went about their work  it sort of looked to the outside eye like they wouldnt be needed ,2018-07-13
youre talking about her motive i was thinking more about a villain who lives amongst us and goes up against the protagonist on the streets and inside buildings just like we could read in most superhero comics in the old days as opposed to a dozen different superheroes that goes against a dozen other superheroes or gods fighting other gods and demons in other realms and so on they are all entertaining but its good to have some variation now and then and if you have read a lot of superheroes comics growing up you know that villains can have other reasons for their actions than just a wish to world domination or because they are evil,2018-07-18
its one of the things janet tells him to watch out for right before he goes into the quantum realm during the post credits scene,2018-07-06
"hank worked for shield and had different interests i dont see him as the type to be working for the fbi 

i think since they hated each other and couldnt work with each other to the point where bill was either fired or left so they couldnt work together sad that two egotistic men couldnt get over the past which risked the lives of ones  wife the the others daughter figure",2018-07-21
the machine didnt just replicate scotts shrinkage it was designed to locate janet in the quantum realm then navigate it to retrieve her  of course physics down there operates differently but most of what the machine was built for doesnt seem achievable with just the antman suit,2018-07-08
it didnt happen with no effort it almost obliterated him he basically got lucky the first time,2018-07-08
sounds like 2 band names,2018-07-11
"the ant was playing the drums when hank went to check to see if the fbi were at scotts house  it was on a phone and shot from above the ant

the shot they used in the trailer of the ant playing drums was directly from the end credits though so youre not wrong",2018-07-06
when hank says what are you fifteen while viewing the ant on cctv,2018-07-11
yes,2018-07-06
no it’s a teenyverse any rick and morty fans here,2018-07-07
wouldnt it have actually been hydra doing the training instead of shield,2018-07-14
"oh right that one

where the ebs is going off on the tv and theres panic and smoke outside honestly i completely forgot about that one seeing as how many times we see stewart copelant playing on the drums ",2018-07-15
people downvote what they dont like  so yeah if youre in the minority you get punished with downvotes  if you stop posting because of that then youre completely silenced and people assume there arent any dissenting opinions because they only see the majority opinion,2018-07-06

i didn’t say it was awful fine fun forgettable is what i’d call it,2018-07-06
i think you said this well here  to bounce off your styles of hunmor a little more drax is funny because he is clueless when is comes to social norms  thor can socially interact with people but is completely clueless when it comes to cultural norms hes essentially wonder woman in a way  ,2018-07-06
how is it a great way to catch up with friends you sit in the dark for 2 hours not talking to each other,2018-07-12

apparently anyone who dislikes mainstream marvel blockbusters and comes into a discussion thread to contribute their negative opinion is miserable  ,2018-07-06
hes a mod for a sub devoted to hating marvel thats why ,2018-07-06
no he just sounds like a miserable person by the tone of his comment,2018-07-06
maybe dont mod a hatesub for the topic youre talking about and we wont think youre being a scummy little troll,2018-07-06
where did i say i dont care i guess its easier to dismiss people who disagree with you rather than actually respond to their points fair enough ,2018-07-06
dudes a mode for a marvel hate sub downvote and move on,2018-07-06
rmovies is dedicated to hating on the dceu so i see no problem with there being a sub for voicing negative opinions about the mcu without being downvoted to oblivion his comment was pretty well thought out he didnt just come in here and say lol this movie sucks ,2018-07-06
"you want to know why i am because theres no place to discuss the negative aspects of the mcu without having your opinion drowned in downvotes by the majority look at this thread i presented a pretty detailed comment about the film but because its negative people are resorting to ad hominem  to invalidate my comment its lazy and immature 

why the  are comic book movie fans both dc and marvel so incapable of understanding that there are valid reasons to dislike their movies the defense is always oh this guys is a hater or this guy is a dcmarvel fanboy but there are plenty of people who dislike these movies for reasons that have nothing to do with petty fanboy   is a sub for that type of discussion being a part of that sub doesnt invalidate the points i raised about the film but nice try ",2018-07-06
haha i knew it hes going out of his way to  on the whole mcu he needs to get a life,2018-07-06
mature ,2018-07-08
you went on a tirade about the mcu as a whole its obvious you have an axe to grind your message is tainted btw people in rmarvelstudios criticize the movies and shows and have arguments and discussions about that you obviously go way beyond that youre toxic,2018-07-06
"thanks funnily enough thats pretty much why i mod on that subreddit the amount of times id see users write a comment that was critical of the mcu only to be dismissed belittled downvotedit was frustrating 

it doesnt matter how well i validated my opinion because it goes against the popular opinion thats why i like the idea of a sub like  where likeminded people can discuss why they dislike these movies without being blasted for it ",2018-07-06
"this guy who dedicates much of his time online to hating marvel is definitely acting in good faith

 a  ",2018-07-06
"id be cool if marvel continued the trend with this years line up

they had a good superhero film at the start of the year that played with some gravitas

they had an excellent one in the spring which had real implications for the universe and had loads of emotion and aweinspiring moments

then in the summer they release a fun one to lighten the mood and dazzle us with cool effects 

actually  it i looked back and saw 2017 had 3 marvel movies as well i like the 3 movie line up much better than the 2 that way you get a varied experience each year ",2018-07-07
i really wished i found antman and the wasp as funny as every one else seems to have while it did totally have funny parts i found thor ragnarok had better comedic timing and comedy over all maybe its because i was looking for more than just an action flick that at the end of the day is just kind of forgettable after all the big marvel movies that had long standing consequences in the mcu this movie comes a long and just felt like nothing really mattered by the end of it  smaller scale and all  ,2018-07-07
most marvel movies  actually most movies don’t so this comment makes zero sense ,2018-07-06
agreed i just found it refreshing in bp i really enjoyed this movie but it wasnt too far from the typical cgi action flick,2018-07-06
thats a great point about the timing they definitely would have had to tell scott to meet him at the facility which he obviously couldnt do randall parks character cant remember his name at the moment did mention that there was three years of probation attached to his sentence at a point ,2018-07-06
yeah i was trying to say it was a really nice house for someone that doesnt have a high income job,2018-07-07
maybe the suit lets her break the rules because its quantum or whatever ,2018-07-07
"yes but half the cast would also be gone and they wouldnt be fixing the problem that will be left to the top team

agents of shield does best when they do their own thing and not tied down to the movies",2018-07-07
"i think the biggest offender of this is when ghost and scott finish their last battle scott is called to help our with something and so he of course does so there is nothing to indicate exactly how he got by ghost or why she let him go or anything 



is this the scene where ghost is chasing scott if so she didnt let scott go she left because they were getting away with the lab
",2018-07-08
also no one really knew what was going on in wakanda the scene where fury and hill disappear theres a newscast on the radio about energy readings or something in wakanda doubt anyone outside of the avengers knew there was even a battle going on ,2018-07-17

they went through  and high water jumped through hoops and destroyed property and vehicles all for the goal of saving janet  then poof janet and her rescuers are gone anyway  ,2018-07-07
but the ant survived thanos so thats what is important,2018-07-09
yeah pym says something about a new design thats working out some kinks  thats why it malfunctions throughout the movie and the design was specifically to get rid of the regulator that was seen as a weakness,2018-07-10
im hoping that will get him outon the other side of the snappening to rescue all those who got ashed,2018-07-10
"i hope they take some risks because avengers 4 is going to be the culmination of everything marvel sure they might continue with newer actors or something but this could be the greatest conclusion in the history of franchises or we could potentially have a mass effect 3 type of ending were everyone is angry and dissapointed 

no matter what im excited to see how they decide to end this story 10 years baby",2018-07-12
nah,2018-07-07
was it nice to know antman wasnt the first,2018-07-07
right so i will just close my eyes and cover my ears for 8 trailers they play before every movie great advice,2018-07-07
see also homecoming,2018-07-07
true,2018-07-07
i agree evas motivations made sense which is part of whats frustrating  they could have rewritten hank and bill to be much more reasonable without losing any of the plot  just have eva break with bill sooner and throw in a few we want to help you lines of dialogue from hank and hope that eva can ignore in her monomaniacal attempt to cure herself  maybe add a billeva scene right after hank visits bill at the college where bill tries to persuade eva that hank will help and she wont listen,2018-07-08
there was also the issue of scott needing to return home before agent wu showed up to end his house arrest most of what youre describing especially on pyms end is tunnel vision,2018-07-08
yes season 1 but it has been around in flash comics forever,2018-07-06
thanks yours is pretty cool too,2018-07-06
shenanigans,2018-07-09
true but he is in san fran the ny battle ended after a few minutes no one knew what was happening in wakanda even fury and hill was unaware of it it doesnt make sense for him to travel 67 hours to nyc when the event is already over  plus he is already trouble  for being antman and would get caught because the travel logs would show he went to nyc he would get arrested all over again  plus he isnt a member of the avengers officially he helped cap who is also a fugitive ,2018-07-07
"my only explanation is that scott never updated them on his current house arrest situation 

i feel a good amount of time passed in the main movie itself and far too long for infinity war to take place during it hank and janet had time to go on a beach vacation and come back

",2018-07-09
wait a secondits possible if its morning ish in san francisco and evening ish in africa its a 9 hour difference ,2018-07-09
oh  you broke the mcu ,2018-07-09
yeah but we really don’t know if infinity war was actually happening at the same time as the film just the postcredits i doubt even if there were aliens in new york that they would freak out in california because it’s happened multiple times before and the avengers dealt with it ,2018-07-09
however as i stated scott and the gang were definitely going through a couple things themselves to keep them busy annnnd even when loki and ultron was here doesnt seem like they cared much at that time so why would they care about another spaceship in ny,2018-07-09
iirc all the news crew saw was that a big alien ship landed for like 10 mins and then took off again they didnt see squidward and the big guy fight against doctor strange wong and iron man it was all over too quickly we know what happened because we saw the movie all ant man knew was that some alien ship landed for a bit  and that iron man is missing thats hardly super out of the ordinary in their universe,2018-07-10
"well for one imho vis and scarlet seeing that  in a random  tv in scotland is what i call a plot device and two the news footage they saw was already the aftermath and theyre in a different timezone 

and scott and hope wouldnt gear up for that remember they well scott and hank at least are not particularly fond of stark anyways plus that ship was on earth for a total of what 1015 minutes tops theyre in san fran by the time they even got there thered be no one to help mind you the news footage caught was the ship already leaving not while it was actually here i just dont think there was enough time edit also they didnt call scott either to let him know whats going on he was cut off from them because he took the deal just like clint

furthermore the rest of the battle is in wakanda doubt they know much about it

in my head unbeknownst to scott and co the battle in wakanda is going down and thats exactly when the mid credit scene is occurring anything they could have helped with is already done and over with ",2018-07-09
pretty sure they just shrunk it no ther s consistently 2 years in between civil war and iw even mentioned it in iw timeframe matches up it took hank and hope two years to build that yes but that’s because the resources were gone now they don’t need them especially to build a mini one it’s unclear really,2018-07-09
thing is focusing on killing half of life is reasonable everything dies so just making it happen even on a massive scale is doable what does making more resources even mean like more water more plants animals more resources for who he would have to know what each race on each planet would need and bring enough space as well which would then fill up with more people and just bring back the problem he was trying to solve anyway,2018-07-10
can you imagine the sick chains and jewelry these rappers would have if he doubled the amount of resources gold and diamonds prices would drop overnight and everyone would be rocking infinity gauntlets,2018-07-10
what to just go and reshape reality like that youd need something with infinite power,2018-07-09
yeah i was basically expecting two things to happen when they got down to the quantum realm first thought was pretty much exactly what happened second was that she had been stuck down there for a short amount of time in her mind but when she possessed scott and was talking about the quantum realm as if she explored every inch of it i knew it was going to be the latter,2018-07-09
i dont care and i love the movie i just think its funny that the movie says time works differently in the quantum realm but then show that it works pretty much exactly the same as the real world,2018-07-09
i swear i saw a city too ,2018-07-09
then show it it made really no sense,2018-07-09

agree,2018-07-06
it would be cool if she accessed other realms gained powers and went on adventures then she used her new knowledge to calculate the best time to return to the quantum realm to go back home   im assuming she had a husband and maybe even another kid in some other universe who eventually follows mother back to earth to be the villain in ant man 3  janets dirty little secret ,2018-07-09

there was plenty of character development hope starts to show some next level badassery as the wasp yet continues to allow herself to be vulnerable with those she cares about hanks misunderstood genius develops into more of a selfish manipulator over a motive everyone can relate to love maggie and jim show a numerous bondful embrace over scotts new direction as an unofficial avenger kurt dave and luis are now using their strengths as actual strengths by going clean whereas in the first one they still wanted to live a criminal life the seeds are planted for cassie to be a hero maybe a villain as antman 1 hinted at between hank and hope bill and ghost are introduced as intriguing 5050 characters who are more than likely due for return soon then theres scott scott expressed early on that he had no regrets getting involved incivil war despite it costing his relationship with hope in the first he felt the need to be a robin hood for the people now he feels the need to make this world the best and safest world for his daughter and for hope its shown that he cares for someone else other than cassie hes also much more confident in himself so yes there was a ton of character development ,2018-07-07

"that was 

all the action sequences in the first ant man film

1scott lang stealing the suit

2scott lang testing the suit for the first time

3scott lang training to become ant man

4scott lang stealing the suit 

5scott lang vs yellow jacket in the room of cassie with the thomas the tank engine toy clashing in the middle of the sequence

all that stuff was develop design by edgar wright that is why when you see ant man and the wasp you clearly can feel a difference

marvel did cut if i understand right 4 key sequences

old hank pym and the wasp againts fidel castro this intro action sequence was mean to explain how the wasp die while trying to stop the missile 

scott and his friends using the suit to steal a bunch of  to steal money to steal from a casino to steal jewels

ant man vs cross fire in one point of the movie scott needed to steal something from cross so hank sends scott vs cross fire so i guess they replace his fight with the one he had with falcon in the movie

hank vs scott it was say that in one of the early drafts scott become crazy thanks to the use of the pym particles and this let to him fighting againts hank who then needed to put again the suit

so yes the one big key change they did was to give hope a bigger role in the movie and they also erased cross fire from the script and give darren cross a bigger role they also stop scott from becoming crazy thanks to the pym particles the main reason why hank really didnt wanted hope to use the suit because then she could have become crazy like scott

parts of this remain in the movie but they clearly though it was too hard to show that hank was manipulating scott and using him and thanks to what he did scott becomes crazy and he has to stop him",2018-07-11
i think that comes from a previous scene when they were talking about ghost when kurt mentions baba yaga i believe it was scott who mentions that “she went through walls like a ghost”,2018-07-06
"marvel just keep making the same tired film with the same tired plot most of the time its well made but a lot of these solo stories have been bang average

not that this is important but before it says antman and the wasp will return it shows the same sentence with a period and then it animates into the question mark just a small detail,2018-07-06

"that’s a really good way of putting it  suspending disbelief

i am also a huge fan of all the marvel movies my fiancée and i watched ant man this weekend and were both so excited by the beginning of this movie  they’re gonna find hope’s mom  but we were both so disappointed by everything that happened after the first 2030 minutes aside from the crazy logic of this film ghost’s suit helps her control her powers what it was also just kinda slow as well and the characters didn’t feel like they grew at all like they did in the first ant man

anyway ignore the downvote party it’s their loss for not even trying to appreciate your honest criticism of the film no movie is perfect and we don’t need to act like it is just because it’s marvel 

btw despite the problems i thought this was still better than most action movies or any dc movie  but i thought it just wasn’t quite up to marvel’s usual standard considering how good their movies have been recently",2018-07-09
that would actually be really cool also andy serkis looked jacked in black panther,2018-07-07

yeah only a few jokes landed with me like thor poking the paper going loki but the characters shouting devils  over and over was complete garbage in contrast i thought almost all the jokes in antman  wasp were handled much much better and it had an emotional core to support the humor rather than just tiredly telling me asgards a people over and over like sorry i just really hate that 2 hour snl sketch ",2018-07-12

why didnt anyone call lang no one knew his house arrest has ended 

essentially the attack on new york passed as typical hero  until thanos used the full gauntlet there was no ongoing state of emergency ",2018-07-06

id like to assume cap wanted to respect scott and clints decision to be with their families by accepting the house arrest arrangement cap falcon nat and rhodey knew they were going against the accords once they ignored ross warning might be the reason why nat had to mention scott and clints situation the very next scene to imply that they wont bother calling for their help",2018-07-06

marvel made iw for the fans that have followed the stories the characters the motives the plots not for people jumping on the bandwagon because its what every one else is doing iw shouldnt need to pack in the entire backstory of the infinity stones and of every single character that appears in it because marvel has already done the heavy lifting iw is the payoff of ten years of hard work its the ultimatum for the people that care about what this franchise has put massive pains into building not just another movie to watch because nothing else looks good",2018-07-08

"ross and the un probably got dusted if not they probably have more pressing emergencies to deal with at home  almost all countries will probably deal with missing leaders key officials and vital personnel law enforcement and the military will be swamped  as they would essentially lose at least half or more of their manpower and people will be flooding them with missing persons accidents and disaster reports what happens when key personnel manning 24hour vital infrastructures such as nuclear grids suddenly get dusted in the middle of work  hospitals suddenly losing multiple surgeons doctors and nurses

"captain marvel is said to flat out be the kreeskrull war is in the 90s and sets up shield learning about aliens as well as superheroes ontop of that it also has to explain where captain marvel has been for the last couple decades

so there are a ton of things that marvel could do in this film to setup a secret wars in the future or just flat out do the full secret war story in this one film and basically have it be done and dealt with were suppose to see how fury loses his eye and safe to say its probably from a skrull copy 

but personally i think that marvel wont pull a oh they were a skrull the whole time i feel more that well see that during the chaos of the snap and whatever happens in a4 the remaining skrulls that are left from the warcaptain marvel take advantage of it to replace main characters and it will be a story finishing in avengers 5 where well get a secret wars storyline assuming the fox deal goes through they can also setup multiple universes with xmen and a lot more before that too ",2018-07-15

depends on the size of the populated universe in the marvel comics it seems pretty large to me i suppose on a smaller scale all you need is more than 50 to be slain for it to become imbalanced what if 70 of a race is killed but only 12 of another ,2018-07-06
"the thing about true randomness is that these things that might seem like patterns to us do happen and it’s entirely possible for randomness to hit a “hot streak” and produce the same results over and over there’s a good radiolab on stochasticity describing this one part of it describes flipping coins and how it’s very easy to identify 100 true coin flips from 100 coin flips you ask someone to make up the true coin flips will have things like tails repeated many many times and generally we as humans don’t think thats random enough which is why we never incorporate it into a made up list of coin flips 

increase the scale to the population of the universe and it’s very possible one planet becomes entirely or almost entirely annihilated

heres the link to the radiolab if youre interested


edit obviously not everyone wants to listen to one hour although i do recommend it the relevant coin flipping section starts at 855 and ends at around 15 minutes",2018-07-06

"we hear birds chirping songs and the faint laughter of kids 

the unmistakable whirring calm of a sprinkler amidst it all 

fade in

ext clint’s house  day

an extreme closeup of a target in the foreground angled just flatly enough to be recognized sharply enough to allow the blur of clint’s house in the background 

this is our entire oneshot

the target has an arrow splintered inside another one in the bullseye 

clint’s kids are two small blurry figures are playing in the sprinklers in the background they’re laughing it’s going to be a great summer 

another blurry undoubtedly an adult female emerges from the house appearing to bring two drinks with her 

thump

another arrow splits the two in the foreground 

laura keeps walking closer to us 

clint walks up to the bullseye and begins pulling out arrow by arrow we are only at midtorso level we are staying here 

laura mockingly like a narrator

 hawkeye sarcastically even retired still doesn’t know where the avenger ends and clint barton begins 

clint playfully

 you know i hate it when you call me those names right 

clint removes the second arrow 

laura arrives at clint with two glasses of iced tea 

we still just see the torsos of a man and woman in focus conversing 

kids still in the background playing their laughter challenging the bird songs and sprinkler spurts for the title of soundtrack for the intro to summer 

laura

 and that’s why i say it babe even you could use some iced tea 

clint

 i’m retired not a retiree 

laura mildly chuckling

 yeah ok whatever you say hon more serious just as long as you remember that when you’re here you’re here here you go

laura holds a glass for him and it comes into focus clint is focused on something else he doesn’t grab it not yet 

clint’s body leans into the background we hear a kiss os he retreats back to the bullseye body facing us 

clint 

 hold on just let me 

a bare toned arm enters the foreground to twist the final arrow out 

the birds stop chirping 

laughter is dead silent 

cont’d has 

 get this last arrow out and voice fading suspicious i’ll join you guy —

laura is just black ashes in air behind him 

the two glasses drop heavily into what sounds like lush grass 

we quickly tilt up and around to cu on clint’s face the camera spinning around him as his world is spinning 

the face of a heart ripped out mind gone 

a panicked face as hawkeye’s eyes scan everywhere on our cu shot of his face 

fade to black

all we continue to hear are sprinklers no sounds of life anywhere

"oh those three piles of dust were pym his wife and hope shouldve specified sorry 

and on the contrary they did address civil war in this moviequite a bit that was the entire reason that scott was on house arrest because he went to germany and fought against iron man hope keeps arguing with him about it and thats why he has to keep rushing home to evade the fbi so he doesnt go to jail for twenty years 

as for infinity war id say they addressed it quite strikingly this movie happened at the same time as iw since they were turned to dust in the end credits scene no doubt there will be fallout from iw all throughout phase 4 of marvels plan you cant really fault this movie for not addressing infinity war since while it came out after iw it still took place during it",2018-07-13

"oh  thats def whats gonna happen now i was wondering why they were focusing on the quantum tunnel even after the plot was already resolved time traveling avengers confirmed

the events after the sokovia did affect the where the whole world think about the avenger but yeah i dont remember anything good about ultron,2018-07-06
at least they’ve stopped killing villains at the end for the most part so that they can come back and evolve in more movies ,2018-07-06
the age of ultron lasted about 2 days,2018-07-08
"because whedon he makes all of his characters very likable and down to earth but also quirky with their own  combine wordsy california surfer dude lingo he follows a  pretty standard pattern with everything he does though

the wise cracking leader guy  starkmalcolmbuffy

second in command leader rival with more charisma better liked by everyone than leader  captain america  kaylee  xander

the this is a bad ideawe are gonna die character  hawkeye jayne spike

then he has his wise cracking villains or big bad of each season in this case not season but movie  ultron

ultron shouldnt have been as likable or relateable the problem is he tried to make him both and failed nothing was scary  or foreboding about him ultrons lack of relating  to other characters was what caused him to want to  everything the problem i think was we as the audience didnt relate either to him either ",2018-07-06
"age of ultron did not do comic ultron justice based on what i hear from people who read the comics also its the weakest avernger movie but its still a great movie and one of the mcus best

i like it more than iron man 2 hulk both antman movies thor 2 captain america 1 iron man 2 probably black panther and spiderman homecoming i like all those movies though avengers 2 to me was the avengers in action movie you had 1 where they team up for the first time and its insane cause thats never happened then 2 was mostly just a self contained story line of them being the  avengers and 3 was the end game or the start of it at least like when you watch a buddy cop movie in the middle they are getting along and kicking  it also did a great job setting up future  especially retroactively knowing the future  it definitely had issues one major one being an aformentioned setup when thor  off to a magic pool and decides to make vision but still i liked that movie a lot 

also ultron could easily still be around and realistically should be he the ultra ai connected to the internet would have made sure to store himself away somewhere send a copy of himself off somewhere that can handle it then fry the internet connection there ",2018-07-10
fury and hill weren’t aware of it until thanos snapped so i doubt that antman and wasp were either ,2018-07-06
the stuff in new york was a small incident once they had strange the spaceship left there was a small bit in scotland but at night so no witnesses then it was just wakanda which no one can get into or see anyway literally one small section of the film was visible to the public eye and i guess as just treated as business as usual for the avengers as the threats left earth in probably an hour,2018-07-06
yeah you nailed my question exactly it’s not something that takes away from the movie perhaps i’m just too used to having an explanation for everything ,2018-07-06
it cant be weeks or monthes because they mention house arrest in infinity war they most likely happen close to simultaneously,2018-07-07
that’s fine but even then by the mid credits scene the snap has already happened so thanos had been doing everything he did in iw while team amw were figuring out how to make the quantum tunnel smaller ,2018-07-06
that cant be right because the reason for antman and hawkeye not helping is them being under house arrest still,2018-07-07
the huge ant playing the drums,2018-07-19
"while thats entirely possible its still something i wish they had acknowledged in the movie somehow it was bothering me the entire time since the start of the movie and everyone was acting as if it was a non issue 

it ended up being this giant elephant in the room for me that no one wanted to talk about heck they could have even lampshaded it as a joke and id have been fine or she could have insinuated such a thing when she was controlling ant man the fact that the movie doesnt establish anything at all about the quantum realm just feels like shoddy writing and a missed opportunity at something that would been really cool to see explained even slightly",2018-07-07

"they literally explain that she phases in and out of “existence” sometimes she’s there sometimes she isn’t therefore some punches will connect and some will not

did you miss her entire origin story",2018-07-07
they show fishburne getting her to try a few times to successfully  take the book from him i figured she can do it at will but her default state is phased and she has to concentrate on it ,2018-07-09
exactly i was a bit thrown that her being able to connect or not connect was a bit “rule of cool”,2018-07-06
i just figured that hydra probably turned her into an assassin for their gain,2018-07-06
also some of those parts literally were hydra until winter soldier,2018-07-06

plus if he goes to the same prison as justin hammer who knows what shenanigans they could get into,2018-07-07
plus shes been in horrible pain her whole life and trained to be a killer by shield shes probably not super mentally stable ,2018-07-06
"and better cinematically considering all the long takes of motioncontrolled camerawork

however the virus twins instantly became a joke and i cared about ghost i just wish they took longer to show her backstory without needing that huge scene full of expository dialogue the one that they chose to undercut for laughs with a ringing phone this is arguably your most interesting new character that your introducing in this film and you decide to make a joke while we find out the reason she’s so f’d up come on mayn",2018-07-09
i guess because the quantum energy “mutated” her but i guess by that logic any superhero would be one too lol,2018-07-09

"wouldnt hopes suit use the same exact regulator why is this suit incomplete they showed it broken but they never managed to fix it its the piece that prevents him from going into sub space that isnt a priority 

whyd scott choose to use an incomplete malfunctioning suit over a functioning suit once he had both ",2018-07-06
the whole plot of the first antman is because hank didnt want hope to be a superhero so probably not,2018-07-08
that’s true i never even thought of that probably a little knock on him,2018-07-08
also i think they wanted to focus a bit on hope too since she is technically a titular character her arc wasnt quite as defined as i wanted but i was really pulling for her and hank to get janet back family seems to be really important to the antman movies and theyve clearly portrayed that well,2018-07-07
"seriously i loved the movie better than i was expecting i enjoyed it more than winter soldier ragnarok iron man and doctor strange

i know you probably checked out at winter soldier but lol",2018-07-06
"id say so his direction at the very least is always interesting i always loved the look of his movies he just cant write a script or plot for the life of his movies 

give him a simple plot like 300 or zombies and he excels give him something of thematic heft and he goes in too deep and overthinks a lot of things hes ambitiously limited but i cant help but admire the scope that he was shooting for ",2018-07-06

hes made some great movies and even in his bad movies there are lots of great individual scenes imo he just needs much better scripts and someone to help with the editing",2018-07-08

imo wonder woman was just ok best in the dceu but that is not saying a lot same thing wrong with every dc movie which is a blurry cgi  of a final fight where everyone is flying around at supersonic speeds and the whole movie just looks dark as  except for when they were on the island which they did not spend too much time on i also seem to remember way excessive use of slow motion felt like there was a minimum runtime requirement and its the movie equivalent of making the periods 2 font sizes larger on a paper the banter and dialog was good at least and the plot was cohesive and flowed well but marvel has managed to do that with just about every single one of their 20 movies,2018-10-06
i disagree they were bad characters  goggins character is just a goon which was all the story needed  ghost is a tragic villian  comparing them to thanos in iw is just silly  this movie is an actioncomedy with much lower stakes,2018-07-07
youre only projecting how you feel about yourself,2018-07-20
matches their nihilistic angsty teenaged worldview,2018-07-20
maybe i could see that argument with walton goggins but if you try to say that with ghost i’m to believe you’re clearly biased against an objective truth,2018-07-07

hope so maybe he can get inside thanos and then explode him by growing back to full size while still inside him woah wait maybe the entire thing could hinge on the fact that ant man gets stuck in the quantum realm because of the snap and that was one of the things dr strange saw that needed to happen,2018-08-05

ill give you the interrogation scene as one of the best of the movie i thought the chase went on way too long though and burchs part of it made him seem more like wile e coyote than an actual criminal mastermind whod be concerned about things like drawing too much attention or running afoul of fbi pursuit of their shared target",2018-07-20
what you say about having the villains cross pollinate is i think the mcus biggest failure so far instead of killing the villain almost every time have them reoccur just like the heroes showing up to trouble other characters on occasion or working for bigger and badder villains etc ,2018-07-23

yeah scott celebrates the end of his house arrest  then scott goes to work and luis shares the news of getting the big account then hank and janet first had to relocate their house then the redesigning the quantum lab thing to  have a field test done in the back of a van,2018-07-09
oh i was under the impression that it was close after since janet was giving scott instructions as if it were his first time going into the quantum realm to get energy to help heal ghost had a lot of time lapsed then it would have been a more regular routine and scott wouldnt have needed instructions ,2018-07-09

"because a shill would be posting a review 3 days late and hardly seen by anyone visiting this thread and its perfectly in line with every one elses opinion of the films how is he shilling if hes saying a good movie is a good movie

"oh absolutely i was just saying theyd probably know about new york

its unclear whether the scotland attack would be newsworthy but there was definitely considerable collateral damage so people probably know something happened and i mean someone probably saw them from a window or something surely",2018-07-18
"do you guys just put the word quantum in front of everything
",2018-07-07
"im hoping they start to steer more and more away from the comics myself which it kinda feels like theyre starting to do with infinity war not just for the reason you mentioned but also because they keep trying to cram these major comic book events with sometimes hundreds of super heroes involved into 2 hour films with 6 super heroes involved civil war probably being one of the biggest ones they tried scaling down a massive story and i think it just didnt work because of it

in any case i think doing their own thing is for the better because then people dont feel like theyre spoiling themselves by getting into the comics and comic book readers arent watching the movie already knowing whats going down

guardians is a great example the movies are so far removed from the actual comics yet still manages to be faithful and its own thing ",2018-07-07
that makes sense i thought that was too weird of a throwaway line for pfeiffer to mention,2018-07-09
thats tardigrade ,2018-07-10
you mean when the eye slots in the mask magically change shape to show expression yeah that was stated option 1 and unless they have a grounded reason thats at least somewhat believable mechanical eye slots like spiderman it usually comes across as extremely cheesy which can be used for comic effect but not so much for seriousdramatic scenes ,2018-07-15
"are you serious like are you 100 serious here the audience is very dense  homie really be comparing the audience of v for vendetta to the audience of ant man and the wasp like theyre the same

its almost like marvel doesnt make movies for a way wider younger audience its the complete opposite of movies like v for vendetta kids wont be able to grasp 30 of the movie if it was anywhere close to v for vendetta filmwise",2018-07-13

"amateur astronomers would be able to observe it  people on the  street could one of them just touched down in new york

except wakanda is actively shielded from the outside world to the rest of the world its appears to be nothing more than jungle you would have to be inside wakanda to see the attack a military satellite might pick up the ships in space before the attack or during their descent but then they would disappear near the surface again highly doubtful members of the public were aware of their impending doom,2018-07-18

"yeah not going to happen 

i’m sure he realizes that it would completely ruin the entire mcu ",2018-07-09
"scott wasnt in possession of a stone vision and the doc were  which made them more priority targets peter happened to join in because it was in nyc the team needed to get to vision before considering scott 

so this would leave scott only flights to take or a car do you think theyd let air traffic flow freely with a giant spaceship in new york i think theyd ground all flights so now scotts limited to car train or bus hes at best case scenario 43 hours by car or 3 days by bus and train to get to new york ",2018-07-10
yeah youre right,2018-07-06
"pym particle

question anything based on science answer pym particle",2018-07-11
yea it definitely isnt consistent and doesnt make much sense  i read somewhere on reddit that in one of the ant man comics pym acknowledges this sort of and states that even he doesnt really understand how it works fully but is just using it as best he can,2018-07-11

"ragnarok was a really good movie but its my least favorite of 2017

guardians 2 had more emotional  and upped the humor and lots of stuff

although homecoming is the most relateable film ive ever seen i like the other ones more for one reason or another i dont know today

edit ragnarok was my least favorite mcu movie of 2017",2018-07-07

plus some of what the posted were just in after credit scenes ",2018-07-09
"id chalk thanos in that group not aided and not a hero but we see in guardians that thanos is manipulating events to get the stone he tasks ronan with finding the artifact but he doesnt want him to find out its the power stone  

and ultimately in infinity war id argue thanos was the main character we start and end the whole thing on him not including post credits obviously he has a huge bearing on the plot it really follows his quest to get the stones as much as it follows any group of heroes maybe even more so ",2018-07-10
the first guardians had thanos after thanos had been introduced in the avengers,2018-07-09

youre saying what else is new like this is your grandma offering you cookies when you visit her this is an alien invasion such an event would still be a big thing even if it happened 10 times,2018-07-06
people really hated that end credit scene to me it was the ant still going on its programmed daily scott routine except no one is there to say get out of my way or for hank to call it back home which is sad ,2018-07-09
okay i noticed that didn’t really know what was going on there must have disregarded it going to have to wait until it gets it’s digital release to see it at this point though thanks,2018-07-09
did half the ants get killed,2018-07-09
"well usually the avengers movies are longer and a little more serious and no one who can drove that lives with me wants to see it but my mom liked the first one and i figured she’d like this one too

i also missed deadpool 2 so far

but it is cheaper to see it not 3d but i prefer 3d to not with these kinds of movies if i can it’s more immersive this way and i think the graphics are more believable in 3d",2018-07-09

yes his shrinking process got momentarily delayed at microscopic levels while he was shrinking down to the quantum realm,2018-07-07
that was my point i remembered that as well,2018-07-07
" havent been paying attention to the news

this could explain why those 3 kids in the coffee shop were glued to their laptops rather than watch ant man outside stop the truck he rode on",2018-07-08

i dunno what the blasters were firing but someone got hit with one of those and seemed more stunned than injured,2018-07-17
i assumed they were trying to be vague about the time line so the ash reveal would stick if we knew the battle was going on when he jumped into the tunnel wed have guessed the outcome real quick,2018-07-10
not that they objected but they didnt know,2018-07-10
but what is really really scary is that as far as i can tell nobody should know that thanos did it for all the world knows there was a big alien invasion in wakanda and suddenly half of the world disappeared that is way more terrifying than knowing that thanos was responsible,2018-07-07
what if the mom and other guy faded away bruh that must be scary for the girl,2018-07-07
the tv was on because the ant was programmed to follow scotts routine which includes 5 hours of watching tv each day,2018-07-08
"even if the micronaughts franchise is not used marvel still owns the mircoverse which predates the micronaughts as well as a decent handful of shared denizens apart from the micronaughts so it would be fairly trivial to have a tiny dome city and some comic inspiredmcu original characters there to work with

will definitely be interesting to see how captain marvel and antman tie into avengers 4 as from everything ive heard they are major factors particularly the later in solving the thanossnap issue

im kinda thinking that a doctor strangeantmanwasp movie running around the microverse would be a really fun unexpected crossover setup  with what ive heard posta4 mcu will be a bit less structured than the leadup to thanos so hoping for more whacky adventures and unexpected team ups",2018-07-09
by stinger you mean cassie and if you do didnt she become stature the first time antman died,2018-07-13

"i dont think he even needed to work with the fbi anyways can the government even do that either way us having to discuss the main tension of the movie seems to be a big missed point of the movie

but bill later tied him up to get his help anyways so it seems like they still needed each other",2018-07-21
when i really dont think the drums being played by the ant happened until the after credits scene ,2018-07-06
haha,2018-07-07
not everyone was evil in shield there was a chance probably but it was likely a non hydra program or else shed maybe be activated for the baddies during the fall and walton wouldve alluded to it  ,2018-07-15
yeah but think about that poor ant its been programmed to emulate scotts behaviour which it now has to do for the rest of its life because noone is left to tell it to stop the world has pretty much ended around it but it still has to bang the drums and lounge on the sofa for about 8 hours a day,2018-07-17
exactly biased reactionary downvoting creates the circle  i dont think anybody is afraid to post their criticism but at the same time they all know their criticism well be ignored at best and mass downvoted the majority of the time i also dont think people just assume these movies are universally loved either ,2018-07-06
lol no it isnt ,2018-07-06
smart distinction yeah i dont have a problem with people saying how they dont like every character is funny but they should give marvel credit for doing at least a passable job of crafting distinct humor styles instead of just saying everyone is a stark clone,2018-07-06
i dont  about it with my friends for that exact reason i actually normally tell them i enjoyed it because i dont want to bring the vibe down,2018-07-06
" do you criticize the movie in front of your friends

definitely not i just save my ramblings for the internet ",2018-07-06
im just annoyed at how  the most of the phase 3 films are after avengers 4 the sad thing is literally all of the films will be like this,2018-07-07

"i was invited to mod a sub and accepted i liked the idea of a place where we could discuss the negative aspects of the movie without being drowned in downvotes and i liked the idea of doing it in a sub with likeminded people because the tribalism in the main subs is tiring 

modding that sub doesnt make me a troll my comment delved into both the positive and the negative but all im getting in response is bitterness from people who cant fathom anyone disliking this movie ",2018-07-06
" and we wont think youre being a scummy little troll

or maybe you should grow up and attack the argument and not the person troll",2018-07-06
you mod for a sub that hates marvel im not discussing the movie further bc you wont argue in good faith not hard to figure out if you cant figure out whats so amazing about marvel movies i cant help you man,2018-07-06
true you didn’t say that i just don’t see why someone would put the time to type a wall of text about something they didn’t care for  i barely want to do that about stuff i do like ,2018-07-06

your tone is extremely problematic ,2018-07-06
ehh while rmovies is a circlejerk and echo chamber in one direction going to a place like  is just going into a circlejerkecho chamber in a different direction because almost no one with positive feelings about marvel are gonna go there to discuss the movie,2018-07-06
because i accepted an invitation to moderate a sub my opinion is invalid jesus my initial comment isnt even trolling its a legitimate comment that actually conveys what i liked and disliked about the movie but because im a mod on a sub you dont like ill go  myself got it ,2018-07-06
nope much of my time online is not dedicated to hating on marvel ,2018-07-06
i feel like you cant please anyone these days if what they were doing had worldaltering events people would be complaining about how theyre always saving the world and why didnt they call the other heroes etc why cant they just have a small selfcontained story where the stakes arent worldaltering why cant it be characterdriven and focus on the comedy instead of trying to make it the biggest movie possible,2018-07-09
i wouldnt know  both characters simply decided to show up in their next scenes without resolving the first one,2018-07-08
yeah probably not with how secluded they still are,2018-07-17

so nuhydra has it  thanks for clarity,2018-07-06
yeah we all die like in infinity war we know these characters aren’t done yet it’s about how their deaths affect those spared thanos’ culling and ultimately inspire them to mount a comeback against thanos ,2018-07-07
yes ,2018-07-09
"hm

well can’t scott still put the pym discs in the belt slot it still seems to control what size gets to as hope used it to fix his size a few times during the movie",2018-07-10
"yeah but i guess while they have to end some stories now they have it in a way a bit easier than mass effect 3 did because this is not gonna be a definitive end just some stories get closures but overall story will just continue on but if this had to be an epic finale with no more marvel movies after this welp then it would be another level of huge and scary and exciting now it is more like season finale of some big show maybe got but it is not the end yet so while some things might be weaker there is still hope another will improve but now take got again and imagine the finale they have to create now with its last season well thats gonna be much harder thing to do than finales so far

but cant believe its been 10 years already and how huge marvel movies are nowadays crazy crazy crazy i still remember how there was just three people in cinema on ironman 1 and five on ironman 2 and now lol cant compare at all even popculture changed and this things are considered cool while then it was still just another geekycomicbookkiddoweirdogetlife kind of a movie heh",2018-07-12
homecoming was the only real troll one breaking the 4th wall and everything,2018-07-08
"pretty much this hes not really friends with any of them and caps team are all fugitives they worked one mission together where scott apparently didnt even know what exactly was going on and just wanted to hang with captain america and then they got split

the last they probably heard was that he was on house arrest and wouldnt be available so they didnt try and bring him in on anything i doubt they were counting down the days until they bring antman back into the fold they may have also wanted to respect his commitment to his daughter and not put that in jeopardy

as for scotts side of things the mcu is full of dangerous and strange things happening all around the world on a fairly frequent basis i dont think its too surprising that every superhero doesnt go to every event the fight in ny was pretty far from him and was over within minutes the fight in wakanda was probably completely off the worlds radar except for all but the most advanced organizations so its not surprising scotthope wouldnt just show up out of nowhere

also even if scotthope somehow knew what was going on how was he going to get there hank pym has some pretty good resources saved up but i dont think an ant is gonna fly across the ocean in just a few minutes and they dont exactly have their own jet to take

its seriously starting to bug me how so many people can accept a man talking to giant ants and shrinking to another dimension but apparently lack the imagination to figure out how a person might not be available to travel across the planet at the drop of a hat",2018-07-09
"nah 11 hours if wakanda is in east africa like were led to believe

still theoretically possible if it was like 6am in sf and early evening in wakanda",2018-07-10
"thats missing the point of what they saidinfinity war has to be happening at the same time as the post credits in iw many of the avengers themselves visionscarlet witch at least are notified via the news

so while ironman vanishes on big alien spaceship the avengers assemble in wakanda and everyone ant man fought withfor in cw is gearing up to fight scott and hope are preparing for a lighthearted dive into the quantum realm 

like if youre antman  and ironman goes missing via spaceship wouldnt you maybe put your days plans on hold to figure out whats up",2018-07-09
"i mean scott lang was in prison during both of those encounters and hadnt met hank or seen the suit yet
",2018-07-09
"well yeah its a plot device antman not being aware of whats happening in iw is itself a massive plot device lining him up for involvement in the next movie im not arguing that im just saying it seems particularly weak for marvel

like sure  antman doesnt like ironman maybe he and hope missed the news report of an alien ship maybe they also missed any sort of push alert social media post text from childrenfamily whod reach out to him etc

sure theres also a world where he and hope just ignore it  but i dont think that makes up for the tone  which is really what bothers me hes like cracking jokes as he jumps into the quantum realm theyre all having a good time 

antmans whole shtick is that he always wants to help and loves his daughter more than anything the two worlds keep colliding and he realizes that the avengers and being antman can keep him away from his daughter 

but like  very caring concerned father sees an alien ship appear in his country and sees ironman vanish even if he hates the dude hes gotta know that means trouble and then he just doesnt care 

i acknowledge im way overthinking this now  and as i wrote earlier your first post is probably right on the nose of what they intended i just think its a bit weak and out of character either way you spin it

aww ,2018-07-07
maybe not but in my opinion it was a major detriment to the movie when every character in a movie is static it makes the story uninteresting like nothing that happens in the movie really matters at least for me,2018-07-06
not necessarily but when else are you going to develop the characters besides their solo movies lest all the characters morph into a single shapeless quip machine void of any substance ,2018-07-07

i agree better than other films but that doesnt give it a free pass to be mediocre in marvels slew of movies i think an overlooked issue is the characters and lack of a good arc for scott as well the characters and plot try to push him towards being the hero and helping hank and hope get their mother back even his daughter tries to convince him to go help them and risk fbi arrest again but hope and pym kidnapped scott and forced him to help and he did his job later in the film and shouldnt be mad at him for wanting to go home so the fbi doesnt catch him again he needs to be there for his daughter and its straight up irresponsible for him to risk imprisonment again he is pushed towards making a decision that goes against pym and hopes own goal they want janet back and dont want her gone forever but by aiding them scott risks being gone from his daughter forever,2018-07-09

i take it you dont have too many friends do ya buddy  are you ok do you need to talk to someone cuz im pretty sure theres a subreddit where you can talk about your feelings  its unhealthy to bottle it up  next thing ya know youll be picking fights with random  people on the internet and acting better than everyone oh wait,2018-07-09

"plot was straight forward

i liked the movie but im a bit surprised to see this in the comments this is one of the most convoluted plots in the mcu imo the story followed five to six separate groups with separate interests three of whom could be considered antagonists all colliding unpredictably and influencing each others stories

 antman
 the wasp and pym
 ghost and foster
 luiss group
 black market guy
 fbi

one of the later sequences was especially wild in this respect rudd tells luis where the building is black market guy interrogates  him to find out ghost was hiding there too antman leaves his group the fbi gets the building wasp and dad get arrested a traitor steals the building for the black market guy ghost steals it from him the fbi checks out rudd at his house

obviously it wasnt a crazily twisted plot but i wouldnt call it straightforward either to me a straightforward superhero plot is like the first antman bad guy do bad thing good guy beat bad guy this movie wasnt that",2018-07-20
acting was mediocre paul rudd was the only real saving grace of this movie and i agree it had some funny parts but as the movie goes the writing was just so boring and formulaic the editing was crazy the effects were really sloppy which does have an impact on the movie overall it was just bad it wasn’t the worst movie i’ve ever seen but i’ll likely never watch this movie again ,2018-07-18

i do think the date night and beach house happened right after but i’m curious how longer after that did iw happen regardless as far as bw knows he was on house arrest i’m sure she didn’t know the date that was gonna end ,2018-07-06
" edit oof just saw someone said that maybe they need to keep taking this energy to keep ghost alive

yeah they mentioned they were going back in to get the energy for their new ghost friend ",2018-07-06
well wasn’ at first just an attack on ny and they didn’t really know the stakes yet after a while maybe they just kind of forgot about antman and wanted to focus on the threat ,2018-07-06

i knew exactly what i was getting into when i posted a negative opinion in a mcu thread lol ",2018-07-13
blind fans downvoted them op must be wrong what even ,2018-07-15
yeah thats true they dont have any concrete evidence so theres not much they can do ,2018-07-07
does it though because he was talking throughout that entire ordeal near dock and near the ferry and it didnt sound any different from how he normally sounds same thing in civil war ,2018-07-07
"they could have looked at security cameras and social media posts about what just happened to see if there was any point of evidence that it was him as they mentioned at the beginning of the movie it was a joint agreement between the german government and the fbi so even the chance that he violated his house arrest should have been investigated further internally and not just a ah scott you got us this time you dog

maybe i should suspend my disbelief a bit more since were talking about antman",2018-07-08
for example when they showed it on the phone but the exact clip you can tell by the framing which was shown in the trailer is the same one at the end its just lame,2018-07-13

"i wasnt too hyped about wonder woman but in general im not a big fan of dc anyway it was an alright movie but the ending fell a bit flat for me ancient greek gods having a little english nobility mustache made me laugh a bit

anyway i understand that the wasp is an og avenger and that its the first titular woman for a marvel movie but are we just going to pretend like because the movie isnt named after them the other female characters are just not there black widow has been in the mcu for ages including the avengers its hard to argue shes not a main character considering shes part of the avengers in the avengers movie we also have side characters which in my opinion are more like main characters bar a few like valkyrie gamora jane foster although i wont hold it against anyone for not wanting to remember this bit scarlet witch peggy carter etc

theyre no less important than any of the male characters even if their name isnt on the title is vision not a main member of the avengers just because he hasnt got a solo movie hawkeye too nick fury this isnt some movie with a main lead and everyone else is just a small character and thats it were working with a bunch of movies which tell different stories with hundreds of characters ",2018-07-06
"what are you actually talking about anymore dude seriously

"like inflating the deficit  how about lying everyday when it comes to the economy crime science immigration or the numerious investugations into his inner circle or just acting like a 13 year old   how about encouraging violence against reporters and people who don’t say nice things about him  or hurting our relationships with allies and damaging our trade relationships  or profiteering of the presidency and using it for his and his buddies’ personal enrichment  or using the office of the presidency as a bully pulpit against companies who can’t do their business because of his policies

maybe when you guys have a basic grasp of reality and use evidence instead of your feelings and you’ll get the idea but heynot counting on red states to lead the pack in anything unless it’s obesity domestic violence or just anything related to violence really lack of education poverty etc

"i loved ultron it was neat they made him have a lot of stark in him cause stark was the main mind behind him he is starks baby also idk how hes not menacing hes essentially an omnipresent being they also made him a bit conflicted in the same way as the robots in irobot save humanity is the goal but the only way to do that is  em or most of em he was kinda bratty like kylo ren 

never read the comics and i get if he did not do them justice but i enjoyed the character and also expect they can bring him back with minimal effort if needed ",2018-07-10
i have high hopes for ultron returning they mentioned in infinity war how vision’s brain came from a combination of different sources including ultron to me that shouted setup for his return i see them bringing back vision in the future using the download shuri created but that vision has an imbalance in the parts of the mind or whatever and the ultron part ends up taking over i don’t really know i just feel like they have to bring him back and do him justice because he’s like one of marvel’s biggest villains and he’s notorious for always coming back using backups or whatever to only use him in the one mediocre movie would be a shame,2018-07-12
i doubt the avengers were keeping up with scott that much they probably just didnt know when his house arrest ended,2018-07-08

what could they do from san francisco new york was over within minutes so unless captain calls him for help there’s nothing they could do except be ready when they’re called,2018-07-06

"also they did try to talk it out 

all the ants were tied up and talking them out of sacrificing janet to save ava saying that janet could possibly be instrumental in helping her

i felt that her dad killed himself with the risks i dont think hank was the reason i think ghost and bill just conflates the two i am surprised she didnt just ask hank for help herself or go to the news hank doesnt have any qualm with ghost and probably could have helped her the last 20 years ghost girl in chronic pain on news headlines also would surely gain a lot of exposure and motivate quantum scientists to help her for fame ,2018-07-09

"ah okay thank you

yeah thats the problem it is trapped inside itself you need this because audience expects it but it did not do any good to the movie and honestly it would be better without random timers to create tension and then random seller to be hunting down the building and another random phasing enemy who wants to heal itself by random killing the very person they want to rescue from the quantum realm it is just so so so artificial might work better if theyd cut down the amount of this people and conflict or at least make it less artificial and more believable especially with that ghost girl

and honestly it oculd really work well without all of that and be it a rescue mission for the wife which now reminds me that even jurassic world fallen kingdom had similar or even the same problem

sometimes you just dont need to push the conflict this hard but as to real solution i guess i have none since i dont even know how would people react to this kind of a movie with less actual conflict

but i still think there was just too much of it and too unnecessary ",2018-07-11

he also couldnt even contact hank and hope without risking their capture  he only did it through a burner phone in an emergency  it would have been next to impossible for him to contact captain america  as for why they didnt contact him it could also be because they didnt want to risk him being sent to prison for 20 years  black widow has a soft spot for family as seen in age of ultron with hawkeyes family  she wouldnt want to risk or be blamed for breaking up ant mans family,2018-07-16
theyre probably all trapped in the soul stone maybe halfway through the movie we get a scene with them once the people left alive realize theres a chance would be interesting to see pym and strange try to find a way out,2018-07-08

yeah dude dont know how youve avoided spoilers for iw this long so im not gonna be the one to tell you butyou really should see it asap its a phenomenal film and it will explain what happened in the post credits sequences,2018-07-09

why is it weak hes not an avenger and he has his own life to live its like why captain america wasnt in iron man 3  they have their own stuff going on,2018-07-08
yeah but since iw came out first we already know they should already know about the battle i guess they couldve left if purposefully vague but that seems like a really weak excuse even vague offhand references to ny or wakanda wouldve been good  they already used the news as a plot device why not a quick snippet again the end still can be an emotionally gripping cliffhanger because whether or not the ant family knows about whats going on they dont know thanos was about to snap everyone out of existence there was no way they couldve prepared against it regardless of if they knew anything about the aliens scott would still be trapped in both scenarios  wouldnt it be worse to know theres a full on war going on and youre suddenly helplessly trapped somewhere and the only people who know anything about that place are now ashspoiler    ,2018-07-10
i get what you’re saying i just feel like this is a narrative constructed after these characters were cut from infinity war part 1 ,2018-07-10
going to be awkward when thor breaks the news or cap i guess,2018-07-07
that works too theres no shortage of compelling reasons for that tv to be on that dont involve a human watching it ,2018-07-08
i think people are confusing stinger postcredits scene with stature cassies superhero name,2018-07-14
theres also time that passed between the attack and the snap  ,2018-07-13
true but i’m saying compared to when it was invaded by an alien army and destroyed an alien ship touching down and a fight happening then taking off well it’s kind of minor especially considering things like this are happening constantly in the mcu world now ,2018-07-13
"actually nick fury knew everything that was going on in wakanda

have you actually seen the endcredits sequence from iw its very clear that hill and fury just know that alien craft are in wakanda thats it

"i think you can have those things but i think this movie fails at making you care about everything thats happening if you are going to make a movie like that the char develoent and building has to be on point and the motivations have to be strong both internally and to the viewer i personally feel they dropped the ball on what should be a strong hook with finding janet they also dropped the ball on the villians since they felt like they were being conflicting simply for the sake of the story that becomes a problem because the fun movie becomes a boring going through the motions movie while having good action and special effects if i just wanted that id go and watch transformers or some  

i personally like being invested in my characters and while they dont have to save the world id still would like to care a lot about their struggles i felt a movie like spiderman homecoming did pretty well with this aspect 

the gist of this rant is that looking for a char the audience barely knows doesnt make for a good story in my book if they had a ten minute preamble where they had pym  try to get janet but failed and they switched bodies or something and we had to save pym from the quantum zone while learning about janet it would have made for a much better movie as we already know who pym is and we get to now learn about this new char in this movie its a funnysilly idea but i hope it helps describe what i felt was missing",2018-07-09

i think youre assuming a lot of other stuff isnt happening just because its not being brought up screen time is precious its a waste to show them giving social media a crawl for 3 minutes to finally to welp weve confirmed the person at the pier was definitely a person of indiscriminate gender in an antman suit and keep in mind this investigative team is split between hank and scott theyre on the far side of san francisco hot on the trail almost definitely chasing down hank pym or his associates when the team thinks scott has something to do with it they find him still chilling there not having violated his house arrest while hank pym the real fugitive has a hot trail quickly going cold do you think theyre going to spend the extra man power trying to get one on the guy that is probably not caught up in things and if he is hes such a minor player as hes under watch cooperating and has nothing to do with the technology side or are they going to go back as quickly as possible to the actual man behind the curtain who is still on the run and whose trail is quickly getting cold ,2018-07-08

and yes all those characters are avengers however none have gotten films if it were black widow scarlett johansson would be getting the same exact questions dude same as if falcon got a movie before black panther about being the first african american hero to be a titular character you are undermining the real point but claiming all the other female heroes are forgotten and stuff they’re not they’re still there and respected it’s just the wasp got that titular credit first yeah it could’ve been any other female hero like bw or even sw but it what tw a lot of ws either way i think you’re a little more upset than you should be at this is all

this is by far he dumbest aspect of his plan he in his own words said he half’s indiscriminately which in terms of balancing the universe is the the dumbest way to go about it instead of say doing it proportionately and scaled up to population size reproduction rate and resource consumption",2018-07-08

"first appearance of vision

vision lifting thor’s hammer

“language”

that opening fight scene was bad 

",2018-07-06
disagree quicksilver and scarlet witch were cool the mind  by her tailored to each avengers fear was cool ultron himself was cool and could easily be written back vision becoming a thing was cool seeing all of them together alone was cool it had already happened with avengers but it was not the norm to have so many in the same movie also andy serkis character was cool cap and tony starting to not see eye to eye etc,2018-07-10
maybe one day they’ll full on embrace comic book logic and have him back with no explanation i need more andy serkis,2018-07-06

yeah id have loved if they embraced him being ai more not emotional or illogical no primary body and rapidly growing smarter and stronger theyd have to beat him through intellect rather than just smashing a bunch of tin foil drones,2018-07-10
"i get your opinion im glad you liked the movie i couldnt get into it but yeah i see the irobot thing i think the whole undeveloped plot was ultron being immature  only a few days old and emotional kind of a rehash of the original blade runner movie in that the replicants were like 5 or 6 years old so they didnt know how to do the feelings thing it was done before ya know

i dont think ultron was trying to save humanity he was trying to replace it world of metal making a new vibranium body that thanos later plucked apart that was kind of the thing though to me the destroy the world felt too cliche and forced

also the typical whedon references were too much for me let me take the time to explain my evil plan annoyingly self aware smug writing was okay in 1998 not in 2015 

the best part of the movie i think was the setup for civil war and thor ragnarok
and seriously the maximoff twins accents coulda very much done without those 

to me it like the best part of the movie was the transition 
captain america getting upset at stark for making ultron starks character development for trying to make a shield around the earth and adding to his personal failure plot
the government getting upset because the avengers caused a huge international tragedy with the accords hulkbanner leaving because he lost control 

the best part of the movie was what was setup to be in the next movies 

tldr 
didnt like it because it was too cliche

i agree with what you said my initial was they should have just left the black market guy in the scene with ghost introduction and not drug him through the rest of the movie and they could have cut down with the fbi stuff too that cuts out alot of filler conflict and they could have used that time to further development ghost and brought back janet earlier in the movie and gave her a little more background ,2018-07-11

"they do it with the smaller movies but thenafter the first avengers they try and do the big story lines from the comics with what feels like spare parts civil warmovie is a didnt feel like its own story it felt like they were trying to construct the comic book without having access to all the same materials same with trying to tell an ultron story and both movies suffered greatly from it lets not pretend age of ultron was some greatly praised movie in the series and more and more people are seeing the flaws of civil war once the hype of spiderman being in the film died down

infinity war is really the only one in my opinion that has gotten things right and thats largely because they focused on the character of thanos and only really stole the infinity gauntlet from the comics and using it to bring together all the mcu stories instead of trying to force the infinity gauntlet story into the mcu 

but even then i think they need to start doing more of their own thing including not trying to name the movies after major comic events just let the mcu be the mcu

i can entertain that scott and the crew in san fran could see ironman go missing and see the spaceship leave and go about their normal lives but it feels a bit weak and out of character 

like scotts whole shtick imho is that he cares too much and always gets involved his movies revolve around that urge jeopardizing his relationship with his daughter he only thing he cares about even more

so like incredibly caring father who always wants to help out sees an alien ship appear vanish with ironman after a massive beatdown in nyc and then goes on to have witty joking banter with the ant man crew  ",2018-07-09
i feel like there are several ways the story could have been more engaging and still lead into the next avengers movie maybe scott learns a lesson that aids him in the fight against thanos for example maybe at the beginning of the movie scott could be done with superheroing and kind of apathetic about fighting the villains like thats none of my business  but then someone he loves his daughter probably gets hurt somehow and he learns that his apathy is enabling bad people so then by the next avengers hes more eager to participate i dont know just spitballing,2018-07-06

"im not upset in the slightest as i said in my main comment im bored of it im bored of the press ignoring the fact that yes there are other women in the mcu the comments that ive seen havent been anything to do with her being the titular character but some people still dont get that women can be powerful too and be powerful characters

this to me is forgetting the rest of the women in the mcu and is pretty gross honestly it wouldnt be the same with falcon being the first african american hero because theres been other female characters already she isnt the first character shes the first titular one

also black panther was the first african american mcu superhero to get a titular film i dont recall seeing many questions focused on that honestly 

the entire press run for this movie has consisted mostly at least from the articles ive seen as the male characters have been complaining about their costumes silly men being uncomfortable women can be powerful superheroes too ignoring that i dont think many people interested in the mcu think otherwise and stuff about the main poster with the male and female stereotyped poses being reversed

bar the idea of women being superheroes im not sure what any of this has to do with the actual film itself why is the focus on this movie more to do with things surrounding the movie rather than the movie itself 

and what press am i supposed to be remembering for wonder woman i dont recall anything particularly that stood out to me but i didnt pay much attention to it either i recall patty jenkins being praised for being a women director which is nice but i didnt look at much about it really

im not undermining the main point i believe that the emphasis on titular characters is completely overrated is a comic book less interesting because it has spiderman on the cover rather than black cat even if shes involved heavily in the storyline too i dont believe it is so why is it that female characters are less interesting unless their name is in the title of the movie too is gotg and the avengers both being names of the group not another example of women being in main roles both gamora and black widow and to some extent nebula and scarlet witch are all main characters but because theyre not in the name it doesnt count

if the thing that makes this particularly special is because of the character name being in the title of the film then i think its a bit weak personally

now dont get me wrong im not trying to say that this isnt impressive that its the first titular female character and stuff but at the same time i just dont like the press run for this movie i dont even hold it against both evangeline lilly or the movie itself ive just grown quite bored hearing the same things being repeated in news articles and stuff maybe ive just seen quotes taken out of context or something but im not sure

im more annoyed that apparently my comment makes me a trump supporter lol who knew that a press release could inspire angry  from people",2018-07-06

sounds like something someone who doesnt spend a lot of time in the fandom would say,2018-07-09
its not a bad thing if you tell me right now that antman as a character was the best character in the mcu to date and you arent just jumping on the fact its a marvel movie i dont want to hear yeah he was solid i like paul rudd i want to here holy  paul rudd deserves to be the leader of the new avengers cause he was amazing granted i dont want him to be leader but tell me right now this was an amazing antman movie tell me this was something more than a 6510 not bad not great movie and character,2018-07-09
i think you being bullied would be the better answer which is why you hate seeing strong confident men seeing strong females is less triggering for you because you dont have to see the chads on screen who send you into a ptsd state from when they gave you wedgies,2018-07-09

considering thanos snap is probably definitely going to be undone in a4 its possible disney might let marvel cut loose and actually show how horrifying half the worlds population suddenly vanishing would be its already been hinted at in the postcredits scene of infinity war with helicopters falling out of the sky and cars crashing everywhere,2018-07-09
i like this about doctor who canonically the world is short a billion people compared to ours due to the results of the multiple alien invasions so many kills plus a declining birthrate means that by 2009 the worlds population is around 55 billion,2018-07-11

"im not sure you appreciate how insane the math can get the probability of flipping a coin heads ten times in a row is 00977 low but that will absolutely happen to some groups of ten in the thanossnap situation

the probability of flipping heads ten million times in a row is about 103010300 percent the number of planck spaces smallest fundamental observable size 1035 meters in the universe is 46 x 10185

the set would have to be literally unrealistically large incomprehensibly so",2018-07-17

"the human race was once reduced to around 2000 members and rebounded

it would take a deviation of like 99 to risk extinction

again if each planet has billions of individuals you are going to see almost every planet be a 50 split some will be 51 some will be 49

i dont know why people think randomness can deviate this strongly 

if it was a 1 in 500 chance of being wiped you would have some serious deviation but its not its 1 in 2

with a dichotomous outcome thats perfectly weighted like this you only need a sample of like 1000 to ensure the population will be just about even

yeah i mean technically there is a chance just like technically a poker deck can be perfectly shuffled back to the way it started but the odds are so small that it will never happen in the entirety of the universes lifespan

fun exercise calculate 2 to the power of a billion thats the odds of a whole planet of a billion people being wiped out 

then calculate how many planets there are estimated to be with life 

then go away for wasting so much of my time",2018-07-06

"ill keep this hidden down here so that people can keep their own interpretation but theres another little piece of evidence that points in a certain direction  lindelof has gone on record and said that when they shot the pilot they wanted to film a scene from the babys perspective  his mother disappears the abandoned boys father is there etc essentially confirming noras story as truth  but the director wasnt the most cooperative and said he was tired and done for the day

ultimately i think a somewhat ambiguous ending was the right choice it was a perfect cap to the series and they stuck the landing",2018-07-06
its quite clear they originally intended for her answer to be ambiguous literally the entire plot of that episode was about lying,2018-07-10
"i thought they were surprised by the opposite that as many people didnt think she was lying

its  carrie  she sold it hard",2018-07-22
lindelof said after seeing her act it he believed it might be true,2018-07-11
"yeah that entire episode is framed in a way that heavily implies shes lying its 5050 as to whether or not shes telling the truth

the point is it doesnt matter it doesnt matter if shes telling the truth its about her having moved on and kevin finding a way for them to be together",2018-07-10
this is gonna be a  question but do they still explain where the others disappeared to though i understand that the show is not really about that but the consequences like you explained but i cant help it with this kind of shows i always want to know why it happened,2018-07-06

i would have liked killmonger to have been kept alive  instead of taking his life i would have liked to see him have a more in depth talk with tchalla at the end followed by him being locked up  then in infinity war we get a scene where tchalla frees killmonger to help him in the wakanda battle  killmonger has had some time to think while in prison and while he still stands by his ideologies hes done expressing them in such an extreme manner ,2018-10-22

"if you dont mind me asking what was wrong with civil war ive heard a lot of people didnt think it was that great so im wondering if i just have rose colored glasses when i think about it 

onto your thoughts i think them making their own story runs the same risk honestly look at all the spiderman movies for example adapting or taking ideas from the comics isnt a thing thats holding the mcu down it all depends on how they take these ideas and use them some times they dont do it too well and you get age of ultron sometimes things really work out well and you get infinity wars iron man 1 took a lot of license from the comics and adapted it to our time and launched the series in a big way film makers just need to keep looking at what does and doesnt work 

ant man and the wasp didnt work for me honestly and i think i finally figured out why its a relatively low stakes story and has what feels to me a relatively week villian ghost wasnt really a villian in my eyes just an antagonist so when i say villian i really mean that guy in the suit
the enemies were more akin to factions rather than true villians with the stakes being so low though i honestly cared very little about the outcome of the movie the movie tried to get me to care about old wasp but i ended up caring more about if ant man was going to survive house arrest or not  that was the largest thing at stake for me in this movie which in thought just becomes laughably silly in a good way 

the problem for me was this movie was definitely a comedy but a lot of the jokes fell flat for me if i had been laughing more i could totally see my self getting over the weaker plot hooks it was a fun watch but i could have honestly seen that mid credit scene and just skipped the movie completely",2018-07-08

"its just one of those things youve gotta suspend your disbelief for regarding superhero stories like how big cities are death traps that are constant warzones being partially destroyed and attacked by crazy  daily yet the citizens still try to live normal lives

but its fun to come up with some  in universe explanations for it so ill try a few 

a mankind is just kinda used to the occasional alien invasion so they dont all stop their lives suddenly

b from the average citizens perspective the invasion didnt last long they see a giant ship come from a portal in the sky a few streets get wrecked and it leaves along with the disappearance of tony stark the only people who know whats really happening are the avengers and the folks in wakanda

",2018-07-08
by the world yes of course it would be a big event and on the news but my original comment was about how scott and the gang would react to the events not the rest of the world we might be getting into semantics with words like major and minor my point is that it’s not like aliens invaded and took over nyc and were destroying the world they came some small parts of the city got beat up and destroyed nothing like avengers 1 and the ship left all within roughly 30min1hour tops  we know that hank doesn’t want to get involved with stark or anyone for that matter and scott is still trying to keep things under wraps because of the accords i’m just saying the event in ny wouldn’t be enough for them to stop whatever they are doing and become involved especially if the threat was gone them continuing their research into the quantum realm isn’t that much of a stretch again just my opinion and definitely not trying to start a huge debate about fictional characters in a fictional world but i do enjoy discussing it,2018-07-14

definitely and now you see that it was just 4 movies how time passes 

 lthough i didnt read any comics its just not a huge thing over here and never was and it was hard to impossible to come around one of these

me either we had 1 comic book store were i bought some aliens comics but thats it the only one that i read was the infinity gauntlet because i wanted to see how the original story went down so it was pretty great thats something that i been dying to watch in the movies something with real consequences ",2018-07-12
"i mean what do you expect him to do then im sure if he had the opportunity to help he would but there was no call or anything for scott hawkeye didnt show up to take him away like in civil war none of the other avengers called him for help he doesnt know anything about the battle in wakanda and wouldnt even have transportation to get there if he did 

if your biggest issue is that they were joking around in the end i would think that not joking around would be out of character for scott he loves his daughter and will get involved if he had to but a spaceship came and gone and there are no other imminent threats that ant man is aware of in ant mans eyes there is nothing for him to get involved with ",2018-07-09

"i dont think much of the point stands with spiderman movies the raimi trilogy is an example of pure love letters to the character and are still regarded as some of the best super hero movies with a third in the trilogy that goes to show what happens when a film studio with no clue what its doing tries to heavily shove its hand into the  of gold the garfield movies were like the third raimi film but to the max they were movies made more from what the studio thought would make money rather than adhering to the comics the character or decent storytelling and homecoming at least in my opinion was an example of a perfect mcu movie or at least darn close to itstill wish there wasnt so much iron man in the first solo movie and it did exactly what i said took elements of spidermanparker and adapted it into the mcu instead of trying to do something like make spider island happen in the movies

as for civil war at least for me personally id gladly go into detail about what i thought made it so strong i honestly felt it was kind of weak from the get go and went downhill from there starting with the inciting incident which just felt anticlimactic for heroes used to working on grand scales of saving large cities and even the world and what puts them in legal trouble with the un is the destruction of a single floor of a building with relatively minor casualties

them they tried to tie in all the movies but had to heavily retcon the movies by ignoring whole facts about them the accords were all about making sure there was oversight for the avengers the major events being avengers winter soldier and avengers 2and i think thor 2 which is a moot point either way because it was a fight of gods that the un has no jurisdiction nor control over without avengers 1 the world would have seen its end and the avengers did have oversight by people who just wanted to nuke all of nyc to solve the problem which would have been a way worse outcome assuming it even solved the problemand if anyone should be speaking up on this its tony who risked his life averting the nuke winter soldier happened exactly because they had oversight and it was easily corrupted from the inside and is an example of the exact opposite that the avengers work best without oversight ultron is literally 100 tonys fault if age of ultron proves anything its that tony thinks hes a  and needs oversightespecially since hes literally passing the buck by being on the side that thinks its the fault of the avengers as a whole

a lot of character motivations seem murky at best the worst of which being hawkeye and antman both of whom have established in their previous movies that family is more important than super herocriminalin scotts case life yet they both show up and completely disregard this and just kind of roll with cap because reasons

then you had tony who really didnt stick to his convictions every other second he was going behind the back of the un to do stuffinclude kidnap a 16 year old kid across international waters but hes rich so laws dont apply to him anyway i guess including at the end where he can just never forgive cap again then releases cap and friends from prisonagain ignoring the oversight he so desperately claimed the avengers needed

the tone was way too jovial at times and didnt take itself seriously when it needed to you had friends fighting friends in heated battles yet still found time to quip way too much like nothing was wrong it makes sense quipping at enemies which happens often in comic books because theres nothing personal it feels off when its haha fun time between two sets of friendscompanions that are at each others throats ill give it to spidey though as he didnt really know anyone on a personal level and just seemed to be along for the ride 

pretty much all of the scenes felt like their entire purpose was too build to the next action scene it didnt feel like there were any scenes designed for character building or anything else just what can move us towards the next action beat even the stuff with buckytonys parents felt like it was there to build towards the end action sequence when tony finds out the truth which is not necessarily wrong scenes should help move along the story to get to where things need to get to but there needs to be scenes that involve character development help us understand the characters better build the world etc and if a scene does multiple of these then all the better a scene can be 

and at the end of the movie personally the whole thing felt like it was a setup for future movies like there was some checklist for future movies get cap into wakanda check introduce spiderman and get him close to iron man check spread the avengers out a bit check etc

with antman and the wasp perhaps the stakes take different forms for those familiar with the comics for hank theres usually no greater stake than janet although the stakes of a story are a hard thing with marvel movies if you have high stakes it seems half of people get upset about it and if you have low stakes than the other half get upset at it not sure theres exactly a winning move here ",2018-07-09

19000000000000000000000 thats a 1 and then 22 zeroes thats how many independent chances you have for an entire population to be wiped out do you see how its nowhere near the odds of it happening

"yeah rewatch that episode it looks like nora is about to cry out just before the liquid covers her head like shes just about to shout stop but she could also just be taking one last gasping breath

then the rest of the episode its about knowingly lying and living with your sins for example remember she confronts the nun over sleeping with that guy and she knows the nun is lying she caught her redhanded but the nun knowingly lies plus the themes of that episode iirc is about how knowingly lying iirc the doves represent wishes or something or hopes and nora is the one who collects the doves after and she talks about how its all just nonsense but remember the bride and groom speak to them and basically relay a message about how its good to make these wishes and being free of sins or secrets or something

im tired but basically tldr the entire episode is about letting go and lying plus noras story doesnt completely add up for example why would she just leave her kids and then come back she does give you a justification but if you notice you never see anything in this other world she said she traveled to you just take her on her word

but at the same time theres equal evidence that shes telling the truth the way the scene is shot when she tell the story is exactly the same as a different character who told a true story a few episodes before

i think the biggest problem with the stakes being small was that i wasnt invested enough in the characters to feel the stakes the way they felt them like getting someones mother wife back should be like a big thing in a personal family way that should be really powerful stuff 

i feel like the movie really failed at getting me to care about janet though like i barely know this person so i have no passion for them while on the other hand scotts story was super fun and engrossing everything that had to do with scott was pretty awesome in this movie and its mostly because of everything that had been established with him even with out seeing ant man one though you can really see the loving family he has how much they love him and how much he loves them even if he is divorced from the mother of his child

the show has more to do with how a person handles their core beliefs coming into question for some this is the birth of a new religion others lose faith the phenomenon is only ever explained to give closure to the audience through the eyes of one of the characters the search for meaning in this show is more important than the answer",2018-07-07

so basically itd be made up from the moment we last see nora that part where it seems like shes about to cry out just before the liquid covers her head she cries out stop and they stop the machine and she leaves and runs away to australia

her story isnt her halucinating its her knowingly lying telling a story that she knows isnt true but the point is this is how she copes this is the story she tells to show that shes moved on from her family kevin knows this thats why he tells her he believes her it doesnt matter if its true all that matters is that shes moved on and this is her way of telling kevin that and kevins telling her that he just wants to be with her

then again she does say she never told him this because she was worried that he wouldnt believe her and thats when he tells her he believes her her story is sort of implausible but theres pretty much equal evidence either way its 5050",2018-07-10

random is just a word people can mean different things when they use it and youre completely ignoring the second point which is that we dont know whether the dice roll metrics happen for each individual life form or if the scale is greater than that the statement half of all life will be killed at random can hold true under many different systems for example assuming a galaxy with two planets with equal population destroying one and leaving the other would still balance the universe in the same way as destroying half on each planet obviously we know each snap roll doesnt occur on a oneperplanet basis but that doesnt mean it occurs on an individual basis either there could be something in between or some other metric we dont even know about yet ,2018-08-21

"the probability of any individual getting snapped is 50 but the probability of getting a sequence of people changes depending on the size of each snap please just to you use your brain man im begging you

the number of rolls required to snap 5 people affects the odds of 5 people in a sequence being snapped if it takes 1 roll to snap a group of 5 people then the odds are much higher that 5 people in a group will be snapped than if it takes 5 rolls because you only need one snap roll in the first example whereas you need five snap rolls in a row in the second  you just did the freaking math above so i know you know how this works in theory
