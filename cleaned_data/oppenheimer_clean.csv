strauss and oppenheimer both being served career implosions at the same exact time to represent mutually assured destruction was genius,2023-07-22 04:27:58

some guy in front of me went for a bathroom break with 15 minutes left he sat there for 2h45m but just couldn’t make it brutal timing lol,2023-07-21 05:14:33
"my brother said that gary oldman just needs to play stalin now and  have played all three world leaders who were at potsdam 

nolan seriously pulled every string possible for casting in this it’s amazing how he knew how all of the people he’s worked with before in their secondary roles would be able to fit together into the puzzle but that’s part of what makes his films enjoyable david krumholtz’s physical transformation caught me off guard and rami malek having no lines until the verbal bomb drops at the end was outstanding",2023-07-21 16:09:38
"casey affleck was terrifying in the small screen time we saw him

got sociopathic cia vibes from his character",2023-07-21 04:29:05
“don’t let that crybaby back in” holy  truman was an  he was on screen for less than 5 minutes and was somehow the worst person in the movie,2023-07-21 05:13:40
my man gödel talking about the structure of trees while everybodys trying to blow the world up was my favourite part of the film,2023-07-21 17:24:25
the ending scene tying back into the raindrops hit me so  hard good job nolan you are the man never stop making movies,2023-07-21 03:48:38

i liked kitty’s line of “you don’t get to sin and make everyone feel sorry for you” after he found out tatlock died,2023-07-21 04:24:13
the scene after the bomb goes off and he’s addressing the crowd will haunt me for some time i can’t remember feeling so uncomfortable in a theatre i can’t wait to see it again absolutely incredible spectacle from start to finish,2023-07-21 08:09:44
florence pugh showed up and got  then killed herself that scene where oppie’s wife is imagining pugh just riding her husband that was something i never thought i’d see in a nolan film it was almost ari aster like,2023-07-21 05:23:06
"i believe we did

those final shots just made my heart sink even knowing the history i wasnt prepared to be so emotionally drained after this",2023-07-21 02:20:40
i love the use of ripples on water to represent nuclear bombings like how they have drawn the blast radiuses on the map in the end during einstein and oppenheimers encounter it was drizzling and endless ripples formed on the lake,2023-07-21 16:20:57
emily blunt’s character answering questions from roger robb and not falling for any of his  was a great scene,2023-07-21 03:10:55
"“do you want them to tar and feather you in the hopes they’ll forgive you for what you’ve done”

emily blunt delivering the most scathing condemnation of oppenheimer’s character and actions was so  powerful mix that in with her portrayal of postpartum depression a mother and wife resigned to be nothing but a caretaker in the shadow of an ego driven neurotic anxiety filled genius and then a powerhouse fighter in the hearing i think she was a real highlight for me 

the film was way more humanising of oppenheimer then i was thinking it’d be but also so much more damning of him than i’d ever thought it would be",2023-07-21 04:13:54
“maybe they weren’t talking about you at all… maybe something more important” leading up to the final scene was a great line the wince from downey as the door opens and he’ with the sound of the reporters waiting to tear him down further,2023-07-21 22:39:18
the feeling in my theater was palpable after the trinity test was successful and everyone on the ground was cheering its success i don’t know how to describe it but it was kind of out of body to see almost a time capsule of people from 80 years ago celebrating the creation of something that could be the death of myself or my children in the future really chilling scene,2023-07-21 11:31:22
"ends with american prometheus realizing the full scope of what still may come to pass

this movie was fantastic rdj gave one  of a  performance in the final act of the movie as did everyone regardless of their screen time throughout cillian murphy conveyed so much through his role id be surprised if he didnt win best actor emily blunt gave one  of a performance and the shot of her reliving her husbands infidelity during the clearance interview was artistically beautiful a great show dont tell moment

the fact that the pace starts and never really never lets up but has moments of built tension that doesnt release and moves on to save for later makes it feel like it also never speeds up either its a marathon but its paced so well its like you were trained for that marathon my body felt the three hour run time but my mind didnt 

the ending was also beautiful shot from almost every aspect rdj slowly making his way towards oppenheimer and einstein to the content of that teased conversation to the way it ended",2023-07-21 08:56:51
why did nolan tease jfk like the joker card from batman begins,2023-07-21 02:45:50
haven’t seen anyone talk about matt damon yet…i think he did an incredible job,2023-07-21 03:05:43
the last scene with oppenheimer and einstein made my stomach launch into my throat,2023-07-21 04:06:41
for a 3 hour heavy dialogue film to have this type of speed to it is incredible honestly it was hard to distinguish where scenes began and ended with its editing and pacing it just did not stop and i loved it it cuts to a single shot for a split second then back to the scene then forward to another then backwards again while in colour for a first person perspective then to a black and white objective perspective with the music swelling along while all being coherent,2023-07-21 09:58:00
emily blunts character where it looks like shes starting to break down and the sudden 180 during the questioning was amazing standing her ground and not falling for bait questions,2023-07-21 06:04:20
the scene where strauss is told something along the lines of maybe they were talking about more important things had me grinning ear to ear oh my ,2023-07-21 09:08:35
like many people the ending to this movie is absolutely incredible ending with einstein  oppenheimer was genius and it gave me literal chills nolan’s best in years,2023-07-21 02:46:35
"question about the scene where  a character drowns themselves in a bathtub was there certain shots in this sequence that showed another pair of hands drowning them  ie implying it could’ve been    

anyway enjoyed the film reminded me a lot of oliver stones ‘nixon’ that i love it’s missing stones sense of paranoia though",2023-07-21 02:48:47
didnt know josh peck was going to be in it that was a funny and pleasant surprise,2023-07-21 03:24:22
i believe we did ,2023-07-21 02:09:50
that scene after the bombs have been dropped and oppenheimer is addressing that classroom of people was one of the most haunting things i’ve seen the way the background shook and the flash burned the audience mixed with the silence was something else,2023-07-21 02:28:46
i was genuinely surprised when i saw rami malek didnt know he was here,2023-07-21 14:11:05
ludwig göransson might be approaching a hans zimmer level of film composer the way he orchestrated the score adds so much to the tension and anxiety of the movie hopefully he picks up the oscar,2023-07-21 06:48:39
"the biggest thing for me was just how impactful the first explosion was to the people that were there doing the testing

they weren’t just creating another bomb but something terrifying world ending stuff 

nolan really gets that across to the audience impactful stuff

but the size of the explosion threw me off because you see stuff like this and the close up shots of the buildings being destroyed like this


but to realize a nuclear explosion is just this when viewed from afar i can now totally see the scale nolan was going for it never really occurred to me just how almost simple the explosion could be portrayed i never put a lot of thought into it but it’s still so horrifying in its destructiveness",2023-07-21 04:00:04
for the physics folks here feynman and his repeated scenes with the bongos cracked me up jokes aside nolan outdid himself and it lived up to the hype for me,2023-07-21 14:49:44
it’s hilarious that the  scene that everybody made so much out of even included the destroyer of worlds bhagavad gita quote,2023-07-21 02:41:14
anyone else catch the black gloved hand in the corner of the frame during the tatlock “suicide” scene in the birdsherwon book there is a suggestion that she was murdered i thought this was an interesting way of visualizing the ambiguous circumstances of her death,2023-07-21 03:46:03
"one thing i think i missed during the movie was in the beginning when they brought the titles for
1 fission
2 fusion

i thought this would come back and it didn’t anyone have an understand of what that meant does it have to do something with the color vs black and white could have missed something really basic",2023-07-22 02:38:19
"no one talking about him

but jason clarke as roger robb in the interrogation scenes was genuinely brilliant just such an amazing performance all round from the whole cast",2023-07-22 20:22:06
i loved how that constant stomping noise is used to make you feel terror you’re afraid anytime you hear it and then it’s revealed that the terrifying sound is a crowd of people cheering for oppenheimer it makes it even more scary,2023-07-22 22:51:49
the dead silence in the theater during the trinity explosion something i’ll never forget experiencing in a full theater,2023-07-21 02:17:10
our 70mm showing stopped working 25 hours into the film a light bulb or something broke we had a little 10 min intermission and got free tickets bc of it overall one of nolans best films,2023-07-21 13:35:06
"rami maleks character hill was basically the opposite of strauss strauss is met with two minor slights by oppenheimer one imagined and makes it his mission to ruin his life 

hill was genuinely dismissed maybe even bullied by oppenheimer multiple times but years later decides to essentially exonerate him in front of a congressional hearing",2023-07-23 18:40:58
they played the trailer to the exorcist believer before this movie ,2023-07-21 02:12:07
christopher nolan has perfectly encapsulated what anxiety can feel like claustrophobic loud and unrelenting,2023-07-21 02:12:17
did anyone else notice that when strauss is retelling the story of oppenheimer embarrassing him he laughs along with everyone else but later in the movie when they show it he’s completely stonefaced,2023-07-22 23:13:30
no strauss you’re not important enough to be discussed by oppenheimer and einstein,2023-07-21 16:45:54
he always answered because there was no caller id back then,2023-07-21 02:27:56
cillian murphys haunting look at several key points of the film is just amazing that final conversation with einstein his stare is immense and powerful,2023-07-21 09:21:39
"seen it twice now already trinity test scene was remarkable and what most people will see the film for but there are so many other great scenes some of my favorite

 can you hear the music robert the scene where oppenheimer is told to leave cambridge and we seem him abroad looking at art thinking of the quantum world all while the beautiful score is played such a beautiful montage it happens early so its somewhat over shadowed by the later scenes but make no mistake i think its one of the best in the film

 the dinner with strauss where they are discussing whether or not there was a spy at los alamos and if the soviets have an hbomb i love this sequence i love the way the music swells the back and forth between strauss and oppenheimer and how the scene ends with oppenheimer says something to the effect of there was no spy and strauss holds up the data sheet and says robert rdj delivery of that line was like music i love how everything was played during that scene and how it all culminates with rdjs delivery of that line 

 im taking kyoto off the list due to its cultural significance to the japanese people also my wife and i honeymooned there fantastic and harrowing scene where they discuss how and where to effectively use the bomb james remar is particularly great 

 the gymnasium scene after they learned of the horishima bombing this was nolan directing a horror film first of all i loved the use of a wide open aperture during this scene as it gave the scene a very shallow depth of field resulting in a dream likenightmare like appearance this might be cillians best scene in the film watching oppenheimer dissociate from the jubilation of the crowd as the reality around him begins to break down as the destruction and death he was responsible for begins to truly sink in i love how flat his rahrah speech is and the use of sound here is tremendous the stamping of the feet the sound of the crowd going out the sound of a woman screaming the crowd noise slamming back in like a bomb itself 

 the whole last hour is great but the sequence where roger robb is realllyyy starting to grill oppenheimer and the blinding light begins to fill the room acting and editing here was just unreal 

 the scene with pash casey afflecks line delivery is so soft spoken yet unsettling really tense scene

 you can use a shovel for atomic energy in fact you do i loved that this film used a rashomon style narrative where we see the same scene over and over again from different perspectives and subjectivity one of my favorites was the scene where oppenheimer humiliates strauss in public over the isotopes i love when we first see this scene strauss appears to take oppenheimers jabs with good humor smiling and shrugging it off but when the true nature of strauss is revealed near the end of the film we see this sequence again and strauss looks so angry and humiliated also cillians line delivery during these moments were so good i just love how he says in fact you do



 the final scene where we learn what oppenheimer and einstein really said to each other that day nolan understands set up and pay off so well you watch the film waiting for the reveal and it does not disappoint the final moment with the vision of the nuclear holocaust is incredibly bleak but much of what einstein says to oppenheimer during before this is so sad and  poignant watching oppenheimer as an old man receive a hollow award and receive handshakes and pats on the back from some of the men that stabbed him in the back or attempted to the way einstein sums up the burden of genius but also the way you will be taken for granted as you age",2023-07-22 04:02:02
he was so meandismissive to rami’s character and yet he was the one who supported and back him up,2023-07-22 07:03:58
"i knew nothing of the history between oppenheimer and rdj’s real life counterpart he was playing so when in the 3rd act it’s revealed he’s the one orchestrating the campaign to ruin cillian murphy i was stunned

legit the best twist i seen since la confidential",2023-07-21 03:51:17
they made a avengers assemble movie for all the scientists but didn’t give them each solo movies to flesh out their characters also that einstein guy seems like some bait for a prequel movie,2023-07-21 05:04:54
a film that feels like an enormous pop culture event while simultaneously being a 3 hour dialogue heavy character study that extensively uses black and white photography watching such a film on a massive screen with a sold out crowd is honestly quite unbelievable in this day in age we almost exclusively expect this for comic book movies and not much else that thought alone genuinely brought me to the verge of tears multiple times we just don’t get moments like this very often thankfully oppenheimer is worthy of the moment,2023-07-21 02:31:31
"im just gonna say that the bowls on the table filling up with marbles might be lowkey one of my favorite plot devices 

most films would give some  exposition try and explain something really  complex like bending a piece of paper and poking a hole through it or something 

not this film nolan just shows marbles filling in some bowls and keeps the film focused on what  matters brilliant",2023-07-21 02:56:47
the last 30 minutes could be its own movie lol oppenheimer getting slammed from everyone,2023-07-21 02:28:22
that little mention of jfk voting against strauss got a good chuckle out of me,2023-07-21 02:51:17
the way my sphincter exploded like the bomb when the audio cuts back in during the gymnasium applause,2023-07-21 02:08:47
"i love how nolan played with the differences between the speed of light and sound during the trinity test to convey an aweinspiring visual spectacle only to be engulfed by the forcesound of it 

the atomic bomb was a marvelous scientific achievement but then the magnitude of this creation and the harm it will cause literally hits you like a freight train 

my whole theater was completely silent it was awesome to be a part of",2023-07-21 02:17:13
the soundwave after the detonation was a genuine jump scare in my screening last night if felt like my packed theater was all together in wonder at the explosion visuals that the blast sound shocked everyone back to reality,2023-07-21 14:42:29
it’s funny to think that the whole barbenheimmer trend is going to convince more than one casual film goer to see a three hour dialogue heavy biopic it’s very good cillian murphy is phenomenal rdj kinda hijacks in the third act but that’s alright i like him too love gary oldman’s new schtick of “i’m going to cover myself in some much rubber that even my mama won’t recognize me”,2023-07-21 02:12:32
"i  loved this movie so much tragedy in this movie love emily blunts line that went something like just because you sin dont expect the world to feel sorry for you of course all the conversations with einstein were great 
loved rdj in the third act
pacing and editing is so great
i held my  the whole time
cillian murphy and emily blunt need oscar nods imo
nolan did it again",2023-07-21 03:00:55
"everyone praising murphy and rdj

yall 

damon was excellent",2023-07-22 05:37:20
i don’t think it can be understated how powerful that last scene between einstein and oppenheimer was i was already blown away by the film but that scene will haunt me for the rest of my life 1010,2023-07-21 02:16:23
had to cancel my tickets for barbie after this was intense,2023-07-21 02:27:08
"here are my main takeaways
 there were a lot of generationally smart people on earth at the same time several names i recognized from textbooks that i didn’t realize knew each other and worked together it could be because i’m not actively studying scientific journals but it seems like we don’t have as many einsteins bohrs and oppenheimers these days 
 the movie had way more political undertones than i was expecting really highlighted that some of the madness we see in politics has existed for centuries",2023-07-21 04:00:06
the 5 minutes leading up to the bomb going off had my heart racing,2023-07-21 23:02:22
"the thing that makes this movie incredible is i dont even know where to start with it albert einstein is in just a few scenes and on film for what 5 minutes and the portrayal is amazing and wonderful and heartwarming theres not a single bad performance in the movie 

oldman as truman is awesome and bold because all nolan does is portray truman as he was if you know history you know truman is a good manpresident and yet he comes off as a total  its remarkable 

downey and murphy are 1010 but so are so many others blunt is superb branaugh is in 2 scenes basically and hes effing incredible 

the question of if we are doomed is so dark but powerful and the way the movie used oppenheimers imagination as surrealism and connects it back to him looking at art iswhew its just an awesome awesome piece of art the movie i mean 

im a history teacher and i try to convey to students how big a deal the bomb is it really is a break with the rest of our history as a species and arguably the most important thing weve ever done it will either destroy us or send us total the stars this movie summed up all my efforts at teaching this subject and then some",2023-07-21 02:25:07

"
this movie has possibly created a world record by having the most number of nobel laureates on screen i counted atleast 10",2023-07-21 13:37:19
"in my personal opinion the part thats meant to shake you is when oppenhiemer gives his speech when the war was announced over and the people were cheering but he also sees the destruction the bomb causes a crazy juxtaposition of the crowd not understanding the reality of the use of the bomb the movie was really trying to show that oppenhiemer truly believed that once the bomb was dropped once the whole world would be horrified and he hoped would be the end of the destruction so when he sees people  on patriotism he realized the chain reaction that would destroy the world was not a chemical reaction that he introduced but the chain reaction of  on power oppenhiemers ego made him feel godlike that he was all knowing and that he could create a peacetime but when truman blew him off and basically said im  oppenhiemer thought the politics and power hungry forces of the world would bring it to its end probably why he seemed relieved that the soviets got the tech so that power in the world would be dichotomas 

why the ending scene with einstein should haunt you is not any moral question of what was already done at that point but the understanding of the inevitably of science progressing and that each one of us has a responsibility of it after its here we are the chain reaction thats when einstein understood that his legacy would be tainted with  the bomb because he started the chain reaction of understanding quantum mechanics so the moral question leaving the theatre should be we need to take this big leaps in science discovery with the care it needs before it runs away makes you think about who you are voting for how much tech you use and how we use ai

the movie was a 1010 but as an engineer that studied nuclear energy i am bit of a fanboy of the scientists involved it was like the art rennisance but for science the implications of discovery are still unraveling today ex quantum computing in the age of ai  i already understood the science and what was happening and it was rewarding to get into the head of oppenhiemer and the politics and moral questions he had as a man maybe the movie rewards you more if you know more heading into the film due to the pace brilliant character study of one of the worlds most interesting people he felt the music he truly felt like a vessel of science and had higher devine purpose",2023-07-22 15:34:32
"everyone acted their  off in this movie but i will continue to think about emily blunt and rdjs performances simply amazing

did anyone catch who played truman i think it was some nobody whos never been in a movie before",2023-07-21 02:18:09
im glad nolan restrained himself from showing hiroshima instead he showed murphys face who is emoting all the dread and remorse pretty well the post hiroshima speech is an alltimer scene,2023-07-21 10:48:53
every single casting choice was on the  point,2023-07-21 08:50:08
" arguably one of nolan’s tightest scripts it felt concise for what it was trying to do and has hardly any filler scenes 

 rdj was incredible i liked how he was kind of tony starkish at first and then he becomes more and more unlikable as it goes on he’s the front runner for supporting actor this year for sure

 matt damon was an unsung highlight he was hilarious and always gave great line deliveries

 gary oldman as truman was a great cameo he was such a  in only 2 minutes of screen time

 the trinity test scene was absolutely breathtaking the tension followed by the silence followed by the sound was thrilling to experience

 holy  that scene with oppenheimer giving the speech in the gym and he hallucinates the bomb going off on the crowd genuinely one of the most haunting scenes i’ve ever seen

 the score was fantastic ludwig deserves a ton of credit for building up the intensity with his score",2023-07-21 03:11:49
3 hours of people just talking and i could have watched another 3 hours what an incredible movie,2023-07-21 09:23:41
i haven’t seen many comments on the score ludwig göransson absolutely killed it love the string motif,2023-07-21 04:07:41
if i’m a hollywood male actor under the age of 80 and i wasn’t in this movie i’m calling my agent first thing tomorrow,2023-07-24 01:07:32
during the scene with the bomb i couldnt help but think how funny it would be if something went wrong and josh peck was forced to push the red button look up with a thousand yard stare and say megan,2023-07-21 02:09:09
for i have become josh peck the destroyer of worlds,2023-07-21 05:49:48
"i watched the movie i felt like this is the best christopher nolan movies in years it felt massive with so many actors in here and yet felt intimate because this movie peeled the layer of oppenheimer that weve never seen before on big screen cillian murphy stepped in to a lead role and he executed that so precisely rdj also gave memorable performance as strauss the antagonist for oppenheimer

i also felt like nolan is firing on all cylinders in here camera works sound designs score script were all top notch",2023-07-21 02:13:56
my favourite part was when einstein showed up from behind a car like master oogway,2023-07-22 10:59:57
i just want to say as a physicist i enjoyed the first half hourish of the movie immensely the jokes about mathematics experimental vs theoretical and oppenheimer staring at a board saying “yep that proves it” really tickled my fancy,2023-07-21 09:34:05
"that truman scene was harrowing

also casey affleck was scary as ",2023-07-21 04:07:41

when they were counting down to the explosion some  shouted allahu akbar when i guess he assumed there would be a loud explosion this was at the imax showing at the sf metreon,2023-07-23 03:06:00
don’t know why but einstein suddenly appearing after the taxi pulled away cracked me up he was like the hype superhero cameo showing up once an act lol,2023-08-01 03:26:51
very excited to watch nolan finally take home all the oscars,2023-07-21 02:12:14
"the trinity  the biggest reverse card nolan played on the audience ever

everybody was excited for the sound of the explosion and it turns out the waiting in anxiety for 30 seconds for the sound to hit was the heaviest experience i ever had in a theatre 300 people dead quiet you see the explosion you stop breathing sweating 30 seconds feel like 5 minutes

i had a mini panic attack waiting for the explosion sound and at that point we did not care if the exposion was loud enough we only cared for those 30 seconds of total silence sweat and anxiety in hearing the detonation",2023-07-21 09:37:51
"my screening is about to start and apparently lots of parents didnt get the memo its an r rated movie and brought their kids i had florence pughs  being shown spoiled for me so this should be interesting will update

update surprisingly not too big a deal tamer than i thought it would be maybe some covered eyes from the parents but not 100 sure since the theater was dark",2023-07-21 21:56:02
"the thing that stands out to me the most is how well the film portrays oppenheimer as a truly complex character that remains sympathetic throughout a really great performance from cillian murphy and an excellent narrative 

i also loved the string theory visuals they felt very real in a way that’s hard to describe even though it’s probably not scientifically accurateknown",2023-07-21 03:08:21
"the last scene of the flashbacks near the lake was just incredible it culminates the entire debate and emotions of nuclear technology used as weapons

first flashback the audience is made to believe einstein is upset at oppenheimer second flashback looks like einstein is upset at strauss final flashback we understand einstein was upset at himself it’s the whole debate of who do we blame for everything surrounding nuclear technology do we blame the theorist einstein the creator oppenheimer or the user strauss we see all three conflicts in 3 flashbacks to that one scene just brilliant",2023-07-28 03:08:58
one of the best parts that’s not directly movie related was the exact start time and no movie previews at least for the imax 70mm shows this should be standard if you watch any plf imax dolby cinema etc as for the movie definitely the front runner for best picture and acting nods for cillian murphy and rdj hope this leads to more lead roles for murphy,2023-07-21 02:15:49

marvel style jfk name drop cracked me up so much  i think ive overconsumed ,2023-07-23 04:18:49
can’t believe that when oppenheimer found his catchphrase he was looking at tiddies that’s crazy,2023-07-24 22:14:07
"i’m a fan of nolan i was so blown away like many i imagine the first time i saw the prestige it changed how i viewed movies i stuck with him through the years and was continued to be blown away 

oppenheimer is a larger than life film certainly seeing it in imax 70mm influenced that feeling but the film truly felt massive the nonlinear storytelling painted a world so complex and big the cinematography not only enlarged the characters on the screen but it amplified the consequences of their actions the score was perfect it never missed a beat and the moments when you were thrown into silence was beautifully garnished by the sound of the projector clicking away over my shoulder 

i know i’m not going to form a fully unbiased opinion on the film 10 minutes after coming out of my first 70mm imax showing in 6 years so maybe i’ll save that for another time but what i do want to say

 the acting was phenomenal everybody just melted into their characters so well rdj was so great he was so  great 
 the story also worked well i liked the everpresent theme of the movie where oppenheimer was making all decisions rationally and the others in his life would be corrupted by selfishness pride or power not to say that’s how it actually was but it worked as a lens to view through the eyes of oppenheimer nolan made a big deal of the fact he wrote this in the first person and it showed 
 i can see why some people preferred the first 23s of the movie and didn’t like the last 3rd as much i still liked the climax and conclusion of the film especially the ending with einstein but that may be something i reconsider when i’m less biased the nonlinear storyline worked but perhaps it could have been better edited differently 

anyway i’m super happy i got to see it in imax 70mm i’m seeing it again that way on saturday and will likely return for all the other filmstrip souvenirs i don’t want analog projections to die and am glad this movie was so good since it makes a great case for it",2023-07-21 02:13:59
"my wife and i really liked the film were asians who were invaded by the japanese during the war and seeing the leadup to the trinity test and the explosion was a very emotional experience for us so much so that my wife wept knowing how much it had actually affected our history both for good and bad  


i also really liked how einstein was like a magical wizard in the movie throwing some sage advice from time to time",2023-07-21 10:32:49
that ending was a real kick in the pants what a line when oppenheimer was like im here to see my gynecologist,2023-07-22 04:15:18
"the speech where he begins to walk around the ashes of the people who were nuked was really  up and the trinity test scene was intense to the point where you could hear a pin drop while everybody was watching the test beginning


the last 10 to 15 minutes are probably some of rdjs best acting ive ever seen absolutely goosebump worthy performances all around",2023-07-21 10:01:39

the fate of kyoto partially laying on the nostalgic hands of henry stinson’s honeymoon,2023-07-22 09:03:23
"i liked how the script incorporated a lot of small things that get passed around as part of legend like how kyoto was crossed off the target list because henry stimson had a honeymoon there the student who dramatically interrupted his haircut to go tell oppenheimer about the successful nuclear fission experiment he read in the paper the poisoned apple the making a bet on total ignition of the atmosphere and so on but i was surprised there wasnt a scene about fermi accurately estimating the yield of the trinity test with just some tiny papers the wind and educated guesses cant include it all i suppose

the way the movie first incorporated the famous i am become death line felt for lack of a better word tacky",2023-07-21 03:54:44
"am i over thinking the scene with jean where they talk about the bhagavadgita

in the scene in which jean florence pugh asks him to read from the bhagavadgita he starts by trying to explain the context that arjuna finds himself but jean says she wants him to read the words so he does i am become death destroyer of worlds

i dont know if any of you have read the bhagavad gita but the context oppenheimer is trying to give is that arjuna doesnt want to commit to war against his kin but lord krishna an incarnation of vishnu convinces arjuna that it is his dharma ie duty to wage war

the fact that jean tells him to stop explaining the broader moral quandary that arjuna finds himself in and just read the words seems similar to the expectations laid on him within the military context it also of course reflects broader ideas around duty

edit i welcome any criticisms of my thoughts from members of the hindu community it has been a long time since i read the bhagavadgita and im going from memory",2023-08-01 05:01:33
"this did not feel like 3 hours at all

"that opening with the prometheus quote is genuinely one of my favorite things ever

just brilliant",2023-07-22 00:16:48
it was made clear that the more terrifying prospect is that oppenheimer genuinely doesnt know how much of what he did was for his own personal ego and his desire to be remembered versus his moral qualms,2023-07-23 09:21:30

edward teller making a paper airplane as oppenheimer is talking with the other scientists is one of the funniest things to happen in the background in such a serious film as this,2023-07-21 02:55:09
the filmmakers knew they only had so much screen time to convey the horrors in opps mind when he thought of the victims and they did it so well shocking and horrific and also refreshing and new considering what an archetype nuclear blast victim is in cinema,2023-07-21 02:21:15

absolutely loved the movie with that said i was a little confused with the 3 timelines and trying to work out characters motivations in the post war scenes like i still don’t understand why rdj character had beef with oppenheimer wish i did a little research before watching the film as i think i would have understood it better,2023-07-21 02:18:30
"the similarity of oppenheimer to the social network is insane to me

 a relatively popular alist cast that is performing at their peek

 a very fastpaced script with little to no breathing room that build up tension as the film progresses

 a bombastic sound mixing that makes your heart hum to the drum

 two key characters that have to deal with the consequences of their brilliances

imagine all of that in 3 hours of epic history what an unforgettable cinematic experience",2023-07-21 02:31:59

"i thought it was alright

good stuff

 great actingcinematographyetc all around
 some of the key scenes were very memorable einstein chitchat postblast panic attack etc
 fantastic soundscore the music as they were raising the bomb into the tower was especially great
 act 1 and 2 were structured really well with the lead up to the trinity test being really fascinating 

less thangoodstuff

 it felt very long not sure how to fix that since so much content was covered with such a huge castbut i did find myself getting bored at times especially near the end once it became a fullon political drama and there was no more question of whether or not the bomb could be built
 there were a lot of continuity errors in the editingpeople turned a certain way or holding something that then changeddisappeareddidntmatchetc in the reverse angle of the same shot i noticed it happen quite a number of timeswith the worst offender being a time when oppenheimer was sipping on a drink in one shot and then in the reverse angle they cut to the drink was nowhere near his face not even visible on screen despite it being held to his lips before the cut the editing errors were quite distracting 

bad stuff

 the practical explosion with no cgi was a mistake it looked goofy and small like a fireball from a barrel of fuel exploding which is basically what it was it had none of the impact that the actual trinity test footage had it didnt showcase any of the awe and power of an actual nukewe didnt even get a proper mushroom cloud it really let down the whole scene and for me the whole film
 the famous bhagavad gita line being a throwaway quote read out during a  scene after oppenheimers fling randomly picks a book off his shelf and randomly opens to the pagepassage containing it was a laughable bad setup for something that should have been one of the most impactful and reflective lines of the film just an unthinkably goofy setup

just wow what a movie im going to go ahead and look more into oppenheimers life now",2023-07-22 21:47:21
"just got out of the theater watched in 70mm the most incredible part of this movie is how its 3 hours with never ending dialogues and literally no action and it keeps you engaged the whole time godly story pacing i did not expect the silence in the trinity test but the amazing part of that was the whole theater was straight up silent too you obviously see them cheering in the movie but for us the audience we know what terrible consequences this bomb development has caused and  forbid potentially may cause

 thought all the actors and actresses did a fantastic job murphy downey damon and blunt love how little cgi was used and it was refreshing to just see amazing cinematography acting and storytelling carry the movie

did anyone else slightly teared up as oppenheimer was making his victory speech in front of the  crowd and he starts to see what can of worms he just opened thought that scene was amazing too will see the movie a second time in a few weeks after a bit of processing",2023-07-23 20:57:35
"the very last scene of the movie makes it clear that strauss’s beef with oppenheimer that he turned einstein against him was based on a misunderstanding

"loved it but its not for everyone it left me with a grave sense of anguish and i would say even trauma but in a good way  
im still baffled at how nolan managed to put so much information in a 3h movie with mostly dialogues and still made it incredibly interesting and actiondriven  
id say that the part i loved the most is the last one with einstein that was alone 1010",2023-09-13 09:39:14

i love nolan’s films but i have tinnitus so i’m trying to decide if i should bring hearing protection",2023-07-21 02:17:35
"really impressed by this movie not just because its so visually stunning or because of all the incredible performances but because this full three hour movie that is mostly made up of people talking or being deposed is gripping the entire time the score and the editing keep this thing pumping and its nothing short of awesome how this movie keeps you invested 

just a very impressive movie top to bottom when it comes to the performances i was stricken by so many like emily blunt is incredible in this movie but shes like the fifth best performance cillian damon pugh rdj safdie theyre all absolutely killing it 

but the heavy lifting oppenheimer does is propelled so much by the score this is a lot of scenes of people just talking but the way its put together and backed by this inyourface pulse pounding score youd think its some sort of action thriller but really its just a movie about chain reactions about cause and effect 

it isnt just a bunch of random scenes that tell the story of oppenheimer its a tower that leads to the end of the world and every brick is built on a moment or relationship that came before it thats what really kept this thing moving is very rarely was i feeling like something was unnecessary or out of context everything in this movie seems to be a direct result of something that happened moments or years before

its such classic nolan to play with the timelines like this to shake them up and reveal things in multiple scenes at the same time but what i really loved about this movie is how timelines would catch up to each other or how we would eventually see or hear about a scene multiple times from multiple points of view by the end of it ending it with that oppenheimereinstein scene felt absolutely perfect because the movie had me wondering what happened there the entire time and alden ehrenreich being quietly one of the best performances in this movie had that absolute banger of a line maybe its possible they were talking about something more important

speaking of that scene i know this isnt going to be an unpopular take but rdj was unreal in this movie not doing his normal thing at all almost unrecognizable yet the third act of this seems him as the surprise antagonist and the way he plays it is so  good that subtle insecurity when we first see oppenheimer mock him in public and the way it obviously had him  seething inside but we dont see how much until later yet it was there in his performance the whole movie absolutely masterful stuff 

yall its an easy 910 i cant wait to see it again on an even bigger screen just letting those speakers raw dog my ears

the mechanics of every scene mimics that of a  chain reaction at the start i was unnerved by the staccato nature of the scenes and the dialogue but by the end you can see that each interaction and consequence is related to the theme of entropy there is also the subjective perspective of personal memory which can be surreal at times juxtaposed with the chaos of objectivity…outlined by both the colour shots and the bw shots you can see the thread from memento inception interstellar and tenet on time entropy thermal dynamics chaos and the human psyche linked to place in it all wonderfully captured by the excellent scene where he throwing crystal glasses destructively into the corner of the room every time we are in the company of a baby we hear screaming,2023-07-21 20:39:08
"the best moments of the film were the moments leading up to the trinity test i felt the tension through my whole body and just wondered what it wouldve been like to have spent years of your life working towards one moment and being able to see how it unfolds in front of your own eyes and all of that followed by the silence when the bomb actually went off until the sound of the the sonic boom hits your ears and you get to see the euforia of the scientists afterwards who had just decided the fate of humankind for decades to follow without knowing it at the time simply outstanding

probably pretty obvious to most but i was struck how the metaphor oppenheimer delivers of the two scorpions in mutually assured destruction also accurately describes himself and strauss,2023-09-04 05:28:34
"so first of all…right off the bat this movie is absolutely  incredible

the pace was perfect the cast was amazing and captured the emotions of the scene at hand almost perfectly josh hartnett is still a heart throb rdj was unrecognizable yet still captivating every second he was on screen and cillian murphy my  lord is he an incredible actor the way this man can turn his face into being composed yet absolutely terrified at the same time his eyes in this movie alone should win its own oscar for best supporting actor

nolan really outdid himself but this man really needs to learn how to better soundmix his movies there are so many times on screen where i wished there were closed captions because you have actors using thick accents trying to talk over the background music which made it incredibly difficult to understand at a few separate points in the movie

but that test scene was absolutely incredible and is up there with one of my favorite scenes to see in a movie theater i’m glad i sat in a dolby theatre",2023-07-21 02:10:35
"when the bomb finally went off i sat there thinking wait theres no audio then i was like well  i guess if theyre 10 miles away and sounds travels at 340ms the observers must have stood there for 3040 seconds before hearing the booooooooom

on a broader note i thought it was interesting that there were scenes out on the ranch in los alamos where i got that same spine tingling feeling that i did watching interstellar it felt very much like a nolan affair

ultimately gotta say that nolan absolutely nailed it on this one extremely glad that i went and saw it in 70mm  this is definitely one to see in the cinemas",2023-07-21 02:30:34

a lot of movies criticism is the third act sucks but with this movie it was the opposite i enjoyed the third act post trinity test the most best part of the movie was seen oppenheimer grapple with his guilt as well as rdj scenes i also especially liked oppenheimer scene with truman gary oldman short apperance in the movie stole the show its funny also how nolan treated kennedy like a marvel teaser when he was mentioned like what he did with robin in dkr,2023-07-23 17:10:01
"it was a good film

i went in with 0 expectations of actually seeing the two nuclear bombs in japan so i wasnt disappointed when that didnt happen

nolans choice of having oppenheimer sit through the presentation of the horrors of the aftermath but not showing us what oppie is seeing was effective in creating dread without showing it",2023-07-23 23:23:48
"heard a lot of chatter about poor representation of women in the film before it’s release but after watching it i honestly don’t think that’s was the case not that i’m any expert on the subject 

florence pugh’s character got very little screen time but her role was impactful and tragic on the other hand emily blunt was fantastic she went from a reserved and quiet character serving as further exposition of oppie’s life who seemingly would have a very small role into an extremely animated character with a lot of gravitas her cold rage grew as she watched oppie cheat throughout the years and while she rightfully let some of it boil over onto him it truly showed its face as she displayed the anger and vindictiveness i expected out of oppie himself during his political crucifixion it seemed that in the aftermath of his political blacklisting that oppie was extremely reserved and almost resigned no doubt in part due to guilt over the pandora’s box he opened and the realization he had no power or platform at all to control its future course on the other hand emily blunt brings a cathartic sense of righteous anger to the whole situation which balanced with oppie’s nearly constant broken stare and acceptance the scene where kitty refuses teller’s handshake is almost as satisfying as when rdj’s character finally gets his comeuppance you could also see the exact moment when the dissenting judge flipped to oppie’s side while listening to kitty’s indignant testimony definitely one of my favorite characters from the film perhaps second only to the man himself and einstein who was awesome",2023-07-24 03:00:13
"minor spoilers follow in as much as one can have spoilers for a historical drama

i have been thinking about this movie for two days after having seen it obviously a good sign during that time i have seen commentary to the effect that the trailer is misleading

i agree

i thought the drama and excitement was going to come from the manhattan project that is what the trailer seemed to be presenting but it didnt it came from the interpersonal drama that is not necessarily a bad thing but it was not what i felt i had been set up to see

interestingly the very few and brief scenes where the project itself is the focus carry a lot of emotional impact the original marbles in a jar scene was an oh my moment the occasional but recurring shots of the implosion core partially surrounded by explosives were appropriately menacing these were great scenes but they were few and far between

as the movie ended i reflected on why there was so much focus on lewis strauss and in the end i decided that nolan probably wanted to give the titular character justice at the climax and given the factual history there werent many ways to do that

my frustrations peaked in the scenes where they described both einstein and oppenheimer as mathematically subpar this is a horrible fiction  particularly in the case of einstein  that seems to be fed to children who arent strong in mathematics to prevent them from feeling discouraged but at this point it has become received wisdom and seems to be accepted generally as a historical fact the national geographic series genius promoted the same egregious fiction amongst its many other rewritings of history but lets not go there no adults ought not still believe in santa claus or the easter bunny either

artistically the film was a technical tour de force but challenging for the first couple of minutes i thought we were being treated with a montage of events to put the audience into the context and then the movie proper would begin but scenes continued to be machinegunned at me right up to the actual trinity explosion at which point everything comes to an abrupt halt and the score was written in the same way artistically i get it its a deliberate choice to make the trinity test an inflection point not just in the plot but in the very construction of the movie i personally felt it sacrificed too much for the eventual effect but i respect the artistic choice

part of what spoiled that punctuated moment for me was the jarringly underwhelming explosion from the test going into the movie i wondered whether they might take historical footage and touch it up the trailer actually does this i expected the initial jellyfishlike fireball so intense and massive that its barely translucent surface looks almost uniform and a sense of scale provided by the shockwave in relation to the surrounding terrain go and watch the original trinity footage to see what i mean if youve never seen it but no what we got was a closeup of a rolling fireball with some sparks the kind movies often produce by setting off a detonator inside a bag of gasoline to make matters worse when the shockwave hit the prone observers it looked like some prop handler just off camera threw half a bucket of dirt into the scene from the left

all that said i still enjoyed the movie for what it was even if i felt misled by the trailer and i did appreciate the artistry of the direction even if it didnt quite work for me personally all of the acting was faultless even though the amazing cast was barely given a chance to act for the first half of the movie because of the brevity of each scene the moment when raimi malek says thank you on being offered a chance to speak after merely 3 brief scenes for this alist actor  during which he was very conspicuously given no lines was a clever and subtle 4th wall breaker and i was chuffed by a few historical easter eggs feynman on his bogo drums for example

an excellent movie despite being unsatisfying",2023-07-24 15:59:16

"not a comment on the film but reactions to people wishing to have seen more of the science in the film my original trajectory in life was to be a physicist and i made it to college with that intent but had to drop before finishing due to illness so seeing the parade of names in this film was incredible to me i originally started that track after being introduced to richard feynmans work as a sophomore in high school 

the reality is theoretical physics cant be reduced into laymans terms in an easily digestible way like many other sciences you either lay the groundwork for understanding or you explain it in a way that is generally wrong i think nolan opted to avoid it in order to prevent having to contort representations of the greatest minds the world had to offer saying things that were flatout incorrect thats why there were only really broad surface statements about a photon is both a particle and a wave or we can cause a cascade once you get beyond that point you have to either go way to far into detail or be wildly inaccurate in your explanations those explanations wouldnt be something that the people in those rooms would require anyway so that would feel weird in itself",2023-08-02 06:07:06

the movie didnt really have much to say for me of course oppenheimer was conflicted about what he created thats a given for anyone who isnt a psychopath

the casting was absolutely wonderful especially gary oldman as truman i wish we could see some of the actors from this movie play the same roles in other movies  we need more scientist biopics",2023-08-15 09:47:05
"watched the movie last afternoon i kinda had to let everything sink in this movie is definitely gonna stay with me for a long time

apart from the fact that every performance is really good the writing is just so tight also the fact that its 3 hours non stop tons of dialogue and somehow it didnt lose me for even a minute it was so fascinating all aspects the science part of it oppenheimers personal life the questioning of oppenheimerstrauss the horror of the bomb legit i got shivers sent down my spine multiple times

when everything came together with the final scene with oppenheimers and einstein at the pond the music getting louder i legit teared up i never quite experienced anything like it its without a doubt the best movie ive seen in years maybe ever 

i didnt think the movie would affect me this strongly

performance wise i think most would agree that murphy blunt and rdj are the mvps but those that also stood out to me where benny safdie alden ehrenreich especial his last line rami malek and the actor who played einstein",2023-09-05 12:45:48
"crazy how people can react so differently to the same movie this was imo easily nolans best work and more then anything his most emotional the genius of it is that he gets you to feel not for the characters sake but for our own 

every day we ignore the elephant in the room who at any time could destroy us all more then anything this flick makes you take a second to see the elephant for what it is and why it was created in the 1st place and its probably the heaviest horror movie of all time because of it 

hes always trying to use the visual and audio components to tell the real story and that never worked so well as it did for this flick it helps to see it on the big screen or on a good at home atmos setup for instance given what he tried to achieve here  

to make a movie like this where no matter your opinion on atomic bombs going in you get to see every angle justification and reason for why he did what he did was remarkable the audience is pushed to change its pov like oppenheimer did himself to see the logic of his choices and eventually deal with the weight of those choices much like he had to",2023-12-03 11:24:35

"been trying to think of a way to sum up my feelings on this movie which i thought was really really good but not quite great 

almost everything that i thought detracted from the film involved putting so much emphasis on strauss some of this is that i just found that story of his failed appointment kinda low stakes compared to everything else the story was talking about some of it is that i personally am not a big fan of rdjs acting although he did a good job here just playing a character i wanted to see less of from a story perspective either way i couldnt help this nagging feeling anytime we were in strausss blackandwhite scenes that id rather be seeing what oppenheimers up to 

comes down to it i think i would have preferred if the story were more linear and stuck with oppenheimers point of view  still keeping in how angering strauss led to strauss orchestrating oppenheimers shamtrial denial of his security clearance its too big of a part of oppenheimers life story to not include it i just didnt feel like they needed to frame so much of the tale as coming from strausss perspective framed from his motivations as a character hes just not that interesting to me id rather have either cut that and made a slimmer film or used that time to deeper explore oppenheimers postbomb regrets and disillusionment of the era of the peaceful scientistking 

or something that i felt was missing explore oppenheimers sense of empathy or whatever it was that led him to feel connected to leftwing causes to support the spanish republicans to attend unionization meetings etc this film sets up the nonrenewal of his qclearance as the dramatic crescendo not the bomb and the nonrenewal happened because of his close connections to communists and communism but were given scant connection between him and those beliefs people yes but not the ideologies 

i loved nearly everything else about it not a single low point for any acting in any role i actually thought the practical work for shooting trinity was great especially their use of color those deep magenta streaking glows after the flash gave a danteesque hellish vibe that i thought really fit what they were going for ive heard the  scenes described as superfluous but from my perspective those and the constant referrals in exposition back to his affairs and cheating told an important part of oppenheimers story  he was a insatiable horndog whose hornyness got him into trouble usually in ways he thought he could just im a smart sensitive lad look at me his way out of 

the “you dont get to commit the sin and get us to feel sorry for you because it has consequences line is so good and the delivery of it was excellent i really thought that was the theme of the whole film his interaction with truman is just an echo of that same line from kitty  you knew you were building a bomb did you forget those  people you dont get to build a super weapon and then cry when it gets used or you can but if you do everyone is going to call you a crybaby and a hypocrite you dont get to cheat on your wife and still need her to console you when your mentally unstable mistress kills herself or you can but if you do shes going to call you out on it 

the only thing holding it back was the need to have some chunk of the story come from strausss perspective it feels weird to say i wish this was more of a straightforward biopic considering its christopher nolan but i kinda wish this was more of a straightforward biopic",2024-01-14 18:09:49

"a few themes and patterns that i noticed in the movie which may be open to interpretation but ill give my own maybe these have been discussed in this forum before or have different ways of looking at them but i wanna give my thoughts

x200b

1 fusion and fission the first scene starts with fusion black and white and fission color my first question was how are the colors related to fission and fusion 

my theory 

fission is splitting of atoms or division of one thing into smaller things the color scenes in the movie are the scenes from oppis perspective this represents how he like prometheus is distributing himself to the world metaphorically speaking this happens from different perspectives scientific political and even in his humanitarian efforts later on he just wanted to give more of himself to the world just like splitting an atom gives a huge amount of energy his contribution did the same

fusion on the other hand is like forcibly pushing two particles together the black and white scenes in the movie are the facts in the movie or shall i say how the world perceived and reacted to oppenheimer this represents the opposite both in the scientific phenomena and in the movie with oppi the world constantly tries to push him with his duality in his nature constantly being pushed together its most clear after the bomb when the feeling of relief in the success of the bomb is juxtaposed with the horrific nature of the tragedy oppi constantly feels fused by various elements and to some degree his own work in fission and fusion another play they did in the movie

i dont know how much of this was intended but in any case they really paid attention to the details for this

x200b

2 lack of glamour this has been addressed earlier by other people and my take on the fact that people feel that there were no grand explosions or deep exploration of relationships in some cases or the movie being longboring is this

are you watching closely

the prestige a movie where he laid some of the foundations of what he wants to do in his movies includes his very important line he wants you to pay attention to every single detail of course this is difficult and sometimes even more so due to sound mixing issues but there are advantages to this

first its a great repeat experience and second if you understand his philosophies the movies become a 100 times more rewarding

in the case of oppi nolan set the stage and the tone of the movie that this is not a movie about a hero or a villain its not a fictional tale nolans choice of basing the event on reality includes a very important point perspective he does not want you to show you the perspective you want but the perspective that existed 

regardless of how underwhelming it is that was reality 

the emotional relationships especially with women was at that time much less important with the fear of death and war at your doorstep 

the explosions were not heard or seen but felt no one saw what happened in japan we are privileged to see them in 2023 so we think ah it could be better if i could see the horror and feel it but the true horror is in the reactions the celebrations the paradoxes and what follows after

the bomb was not the climax of the movie the courtroom drama was in my humble opinion the whole movie was building up to how traumatic this experience is as an individual and how ruthless society is  just like a bomb is

x200b

he showed the implications of the bomb by making you feel the implications of the bomb rather than show it he showed what it meant to be in the new world

x200b

and just like the great robert downey jrs character failed to understand so did many people that this movie is about more than the selfimportance of individuals its more than the selfimportance of explosions and crucially more that the selfimportance of oppenheimer  


thats all please let me know what you think",2023-07-31 17:29:58

"70mm imax blew me away the speakers under the seats really made a massive difference 

the scene in the deposition that had the slow build of the music and the stomping was absolutely incredible i got  into it

one criticism is the score playing throughout the entire movie there were two scenes without score that i noticed one being the trinity test i guess it gave it more impact

and a nitpick  hollywood stuff like who were the holdouts some young senator from massachusettskennedy john f kennedy this is in 1959 right kennedy would be running for president the next year lol he was a star by then kinda felt like cutesy forrest gump way to shoehorn in a reference that kennedy voted to deny strauss i admit i rolled my eyes 

i still loved the movie despite goofy little nitpick",2023-08-13 01:45:10

"after sitting with it i agree its long and slow at times but i think that’s okay since it wasn’t a painful watch

i do think its a great film a great cautionary tale of science arrogance and a critique of how cruel governments are 

my big criticism against the movie is how poor the female characters are  which sadly is the nolan mo with underwritten female characters glad to see olvia thrilby again florence kind of came off a  and emily blunt’s character felt like an entire missing arc  she is introduced as a crazy  when its postpartum and then the film kind of doesn’t develop her or why stayed with oppenheimer with the constant cheating and being absent her monologue in the end would have hit harder knowing more about her character and i would have loved to see more scenes of her and her performance",2023-08-15 04:27:06

"finally got to seeing this before it ended its theatrical run holy capola 20k comments

completely different film from what i was expectingnot necessarily in any negative way

primarily right off the bat the pacing seems peculiarly fast particularly with his love interests their exchanges come off as these quick backandforth quips like its a dress rehearsal or something but i was able to get on board with the overall cadence expecting it to be an intentional build up to the climax

on that point you go into this movie expecting to be wowed by the sight of an atomic bomb but in the end you find yourself much more blown away by the sound design than any of the visuals interestingly enough the explosion of the trinity test was a bit disappointing i have to say but i couldnt help but admire the manipulation of senses and making us disappointed with the visuals of it playing out muted to follow up and shock us with the sudden return blast of soundof course emulating the real life experience of being in the presence of the explosion there were a handful of moments other than that that they used a sudden jolt of volume so strikingly it could  near be considered a jump scare the intercuts to the visualizations of the science behind the bomb were also just as effective with the sfx in terms of establishing the eerie cosmic anxietyfilled atmosphere lastly the score and sound design contributed such a great deal to making a 3 hour feature consisting mostly of dialogue not have a single dull moment

its not a perfect film by any means with its flaws honestly ranging from amusing to laughable to comparable to the most mainstream generic popcorn flicks the fetishization of oppenheimer learning sanskrit and jean tatlock randomly happening to point out the i am become death part of the book for him to read aloud was pretty ridiculous the camerawork with jean  him in that small room where the hearing took place when kitty was forced to hear his confession was way more gratuitous than artful robert downey jrs character being revealed as the evil mastermind behind things in the third act was rather melodramatic nolan has never really been known for his womenwife characters and while shes probably his most unique so far kitty felt like such a bizarre alcoholic plot device presence except for maybe her highlight scene being interrogated in the hearing etc japan has a whole subgenre of atomic bomb literature a bit of which ive read so i guess was pretty nitpicky about the effects of the bomb depictions they did the molten skin on the girl kind of just seemed like simple tape makeupthe peeling of very superficial layers and the charred corpse he stepped on had a long crack on it like a vase when i feel like something to that degree would just disintegrate i dont know felt like it couldve been more viscerally grotesque to show the true nature of its effects

the ensemble cast has been talked about for so long before the movie even came out that i was surprised to both see who actually had important roles beyond a couple of lines and who i ended up liking a lot was not expecting matt damon to be depicted as oppenheimers biggest broperhaps other than izzy and ol albert lolkind of doubt it was that way in real life though since he was spending every day with his fellow scientists and only meeting with groves every so often we jokingly referred to lawrence as the captain america of the scientist avengers since he was such an allamerican chap lol didnt really buy casey affleck as a cutthroat colonel or russian dane dehaan played an annoying little  well even now reading the wikipedia article im surprised to find out about the actors i didnt recognize that was my girl olivia thirlby from dredd in her first movie role in 4 years

the editing alongside the sound design is another unexpected element that carries this film and definitely something worth marveling upon rewatch one subtle thing i really liked was whenever a particularly minorhard to remember characters name was mentioned they did this just the perfect amount of short cutflashback to a scene of theirs just so we could catch a glimpse of their visage and hopefully be reminded who they were

for whatever reason i assumed albert einstein was going to be limited to just onescene cameo my friend and i turned him into a running gag joke of being this hannibal lectergodlike being too largerthanlife to be directly involved in mortal affairs that oppenheimer could only go to for vague worldly advice the scene where theyre outside at night the car drives out of frame and einstein appears out of nowhere like some homeless raccoon had us laughing our  off

the last scene involving einstein was killer though wrapped up the entire film just short of masterfully i actually had been spoiled about that line of dialogue is it possible they didnt talk about you at all is it possible they talked about something more important beforehand but it still hit hard

8910 for me upon first watch understanding like 75 of the dialogue without subtitles lol",2023-08-30 07:49:01
"loved it 

strictly talking about secondary characters i was mostly impressed with somone not mentioned that much in this movies discourse that being casey affleck as boris pash he was terrifying only had two scenes but with how nolan cut groves talking about him and the actual meeting with him i had shivers down my entire spine

jason clarke as roger robb was incredibly electric he was infuriating portraying the perfect  public prosecutor and he brought in some of that nuclear energy they used for  man and little boy

benny safdie was fantastic as well hes never been sweatier but he was incredible edward teller was definitely the standout in that whole pack of scientists

i found it interesting how they didnt bother to make josh hartnetts lawrence any older than just a bit of grey on his perfect hair you had there horribly old oppie kitty frank rabi and then good ole hartnett made me chuckle 

josh peck and devon bostik i felt were really underutilized i can understand why and maybe they simply had no big role in the true story but them two were particularly hyped actors for this film and did little to nothing i was surprised to see that the two that flew under the radar in terms of casting but that delivered one  of a performance were alden ehrenreich and dane dehaan

on a sidenote i dont understand how nobody recognized gary oldman as truman he looked way more like oldman than he did in darkest hour for example just a bit fatter with whiter hair but that face was pretty much oldman 

all this said the true star of the film is the combination of nolans directing van hoytemas cinematography and göranssons original score each one of these elements elevated the other and vice versa making for one of the most immersive and impressive cinematic experiences in my memory",2023-08-30 17:00:54
"just watched it in imax and thought the movie was briliant the cast was fantastic and everyone played their role in an amazing fashion 


the only criticism i have about the movie is the pacing of the first half  twothirds of the movie up to the interrogations becoming more the focal point the editing was too fast in my opinion it felt like i was watching a stretchedout movie trailer with a big amount of very short snippets of multiple conversations being thrown at the viewer they couldve reduced the tempo a little bit on that regard but i did feel like they rectified that in the later parts of the movie",2023-08-30 22:03:37

"controversial opinion there is no reason to go out of your way to see this in imax 

im certain the few scenes like the trinity test and the synesthesia dont really know what else to call it from the beginning are way more impressive in imax but those are about 5 minutes in a 3 hour movie  

noncontroversial opinion this is the most invested ive been in a dialoguefocused film since margin call  nolan did an amazing job at creating suspense action and horror through just a bunch of people talking  

i will absolutely be going to see this again before it leaves theaters",2023-07-21 02:24:25
best shot for me was oppenheimer being lifted up in front of the american flag after the successful trinity test and everyone applauding him only for the next hour of the film to be spent shaming him and outing him as a threat to his own country,2023-07-21 18:53:14
"i just find it infuriating that christopher nolan makes it so incredibly obvious that the movie is about oppenheimers personal feelings and guilt about making the atomic bomb and explicitly makes it clear he is not the hero despite being the main protagonist and yet twitter goes 

“this movie has zero japanese or indigenous people and is about the man who made the atomic bomb so it’s glorifying violence and pro atomic bombing”

like how braindead do you have to be to get that take from it",2023-07-23 14:36:34
i feel like the whole movie got summed up really well when blunt’s character tells oppenheimer “you can’t commit sins and then have the rest of us feel bad for you when there are consequences” i’m paraphrasing but i think a lot of people wanted a more spoonfed interpretation of his moral conundrum when that’s it nolan did a great job of depicting oppenheimer as someone who did dubious things for what he thought were the right reasons but was tortured by the fact his ends may not have justified his means,2023-07-31 19:40:22
i would say read a bit about the mans life before you watch the film really helps out since it such a  dialogue heavy movie,2023-07-21 21:03:20
i dont understand the complaints here about the film focusing so much on strausss petty grudge against oppenheimer not only is oppenheimers political downfall an important part of his story and it really highlights the underlying dread of the situation   that these are men who hold control over these weapons they can be petty vindictive and flawed like strauss and yet they still hold the power to end the world the technology is frightening by itself but putting into the hands of fallible men is where the true horror lies,2023-07-22 16:08:32
not enough people are talking about josh hartnett i thought he was  incredible in this film,2023-08-01 20:21:29
"
underwhelming but i kinda expected that from nolan christ christopher can you shoot an actual wide shot somebody needs to teach this man to use a lens that is wider than 50mm

acting was top notch but some of the dialogue was ropey nobody talks like that in real life nothing more apparent than that than florence’s first introduction 

there’s no heart to this movie it feels very cold and clinical like all nolan movies there’s no punch at the end it really didn’t feel like it said anything even if i did enjoy watching the 3 hours of it some beautiful shots but once again nothing that really sears into my mind the tremendous weight of it all

what i got out of the film is that oppenheimer is a flawed man who reveled in being a genius he seemed to struggle with the tension between being a great inventor and the morality of escalation of arms i think you could tell that story with far more economy than this film did

first two hours flew by last hour bit of a slog partly because the stakes werent particularly clear why exactly was strauss out to get oppenheimer what were the stakes of the this is not a trial was it just because einstein blanked strauss one time it just felt very teenage girls having a spat that didnt fit in with this great minds changingdestroying the world,2023-07-23 13:10:59
"after watching this i realize just how long its been since ive seen a piece of cinema carried by its acting story and storyboardingcinematography so much instead of a product thats simply on a much larger screen i was on the edge of my seat during simple conversations and felt emotional thrills just seeing some characters come into a frame or from seeing  expressions change shoutout alden ehrenreich there was this level of tension i felt from the very beginning that waxed and waned but never actually left until i was walking out the door

the movie was truly fascinating in so many different kinds of ways",2023-07-23 21:51:24

"good movie had great pace not easy to do for a literal 3 hour film but even though the movie was in parts tense and had good pacing  i never felt a sense of emergency pressure the race against the nazis never felt like a looming threat in the film it was stated but never pressured onto the story imo and therefore lacked additional thrill  which i was expecting the courtroom drama was pretty mundane in comparison to the trinity test blew a lot of steam going in to the 3rd act and its kind of hard to top a nuclear explosion  


good music and a much better sound mix for the subject matter as mentioned by others",2023-07-29 21:05:42
the scene where oppenheimer is giving the triumphant speech after the bombing seems like it intentionally imitates ’s speeches with the ecstatic and bloodthirsty crowd especially when he says “i wish we could have used it on germany”,2023-07-30 16:09:22

one thing that really amazed me was the intensity of the score as the detonation grew more and more imminent followed by the use of silence we’re just left to see this culmination of his work resulting horror moral implications and an agonizing wait for the sound to return just brilliant execution there,2023-08-05 01:17:31
watched it for the second time and got to analyze more scenes pickup more things gotta say the explosion was pretty underwhelming to look at visually the sound design and the music delivered but not the explosion it was cheated to look larger than it was and also had a short zoomed in clip of the actual trinity test but it just looked way to small for my liking watch the actual trinity test footage for reference otherwise the movie is still 55 for me,2023-08-05 05:09:05

oppenheimer definitely lived up to the hype for me still feels weird seeing josh peck in this kinda movie though hard not to see him as the dorky brother from drake and josh,2023-08-17 13:08:15
i loved old school practical effects in the movie not in pretentious i hate cgi way but because they felt different i could tell that oppies visions were some glitter particles filmed close up or that burning earth was unrealistic and barely adding together but it created the unique retro vibe combined with unusual surrealism they were also very modest minimalist,2023-08-21 20:14:41
"the gymspeech scene was so flawlessly executed i can give some personal insight to this as well and why this scene was portrayed the way it is a few months ago i took a little too much shrooms and ended up going through drug induced psychosis which involves high levels of anxiety paranoia and hallucinations when the background started to shake behind him i knew what was about to happen because that’s how it felt to me  near had a panic attack in the theater because it took me back to that horrible experience and made me relive those memories this scene was incredibly accurate and portrayed perfectly what extreme paranoia and schizophreniahallucinations are like

everything from the confused feeling to hearing sounds like the screaming misinterpreting faces and other people’s emotions like the woman crying or straight up hallucinating visuals like the couple making out or the guy throwing up which is basically how you feel on the inside but projected outward by your brain into the environment was horrifically accurate props to nolan for conveying this feelingexperience so well—not sure how he did it unless he went on a trip himself lol

apologies if this doesn’t make much sense i tried to put my thoughts into words as best as i could i wish i could use the excuse that i’m not a native english speaker but i am haha can’t wait for nolan’s next project ",2023-08-25 05:08:53
"finally saw oppenheimer today and really enjoyed it i noticed some symbolism which i havent seen mentioned in any other online forums and im curious what you all think of this theory

are the horses in the movie especially the white horse a metaphor for death

when oppenheimer rides to los alamos desert with lawrence and his brother before the manhattan project they bring four horses each of the three people ride dark horses and openheimer also leads a white riderless horse along after them shortly after there is a nighttime scene in which camera is framed so that the white horse appears as a blurry spectre immediately behind oppenheimer almost like his own shadow or spirit 

the four horses of the apocalypse is a classic biblical symbol especially when there are three dark horses and one white horse ie the pale horse of death it doesnt seem like this could be a coincidence since the plot gives no reason why the three riders would go through the trouble of bringing a fourth riderless horse way out into the desert with them  the only reason to include the riderless fourth white horse is for the symbolism of openheimer leading death to this site

horses are also associated with death in other scenes like when oppenheimer dreams he is feeding his horse an apple causing him to suddenly wake up to take back the poisoned apple he left on his professors desk 

horses are also a part of the scene where he goes out in the wilderness alone after learning about jeans suicide the camera shows us the horses first before we see him sleeping behind a boulder

im sure there are also scenes with horses that arent associated with death like when he has a romantic ride with kitty shortly after they first met but the overall metaphor seems strong and clear to me despite those exceptions if i watch it again ill have to pay more attention to the color of the horse in each seen to see if it was consistently the white horse associated with death and also if there are any scenes in which someone rides the white horse or if its always riderless and being led around by openheimer",2023-08-28 06:57:53
finally saw it yesterday while it was a great docudrama i think i overhyped it in my mind maybe it was the lack of epic sceneries  and scores that i hoped to experience still i read all about him and some of the other characters in wikipedia because it was all very intriguing interstellar is still my top favorite nolan film though,2023-08-28 17:18:41

for me after watching the movie for the first time i was confused by parts of the plot and timeline i understood the main events that took place but got lost in the smaller moments i then read the book american prometheus and went back to watch it a second time this time i had a clear understanding of the timeline and all of the events that were unfolding which made it an even more fascinating experience,2023-09-22 13:45:03

i knew going in oppenheimer was head of the manhattan project that created the atomic bomb

what i wish i had known was he was accused of spying for the russians and discredited if id known that from the start the flash forwards would have made more sense had trouble at first working out the relevance of the black and white sections and the appeal panel section but it all fell into place by the end

are we supposed to know who this strauss character was and his relevance from the beginning im not american so not sure if he is well known

loved the final couple of scenes the not important  you to strauss just as he was about to face the press and the conversation with einstein at the lake that last line gave me chills",2023-11-11 22:43:41
"just watched the movie very enjoyable first and foremost the movile is not about action it is a drama so one shouldnt compare this with interstellar or batman

even though it is 3 hours long the pacing of the film never bores you

i had no problem with the lack of science in the film after all the film is about oppenheimer not the atomic bomb

while straus is revealed as the antagonist in the film he is really a minor character and almost irrelevant to the story other than as a plot device for the hearings which lets us into oppenheimers story",2023-12-05 13:05:34

"as i was watching oppenheimer try to argue for his security clearance all i could think was why is he doing this to himself even as someone who read american prometheus 

then as the film went on all i could think was this man is trying in some way to atone for what he did and what he birthed hes letting his name be dragged through the mud because he feels he deserves it 

then kitty delivers that line

seeing rami malek tear apart strauss in the hearing was so satisfying to watch him trying to look calm and composed as his lifes ambition is left in bloody tatters in front of his face was incredible equally him thinking that oppenheimer wanted it all to be about him only to see that its actually him thinking its all about him was great too

honestly to me this is nolans best film its a spectacle without being a spectacle not seen enough love for ludwig göranssons score either which made me feel like i was watching an opera which suited it perfectly

will be very surprised if cillian murphy and robert downey jnr arent at least nominated for the academy award i think dicaprio and deniro will both give them a run for their money after killers of the flower moon but they have a very good chance of winning here 

would love to see nolan win for best director too but i fear scorsese may just have this one",2023-07-24 16:11:47

"there are some japanese people flew to the us just to watch the movie because it is not released in japan

do you think anyone in hiroshima or nagasaki gives a  who built the bomb

japanese people do truly care about who built the bomb

einstein once recounted his distress at japanese people asking him why he built the nuclear bomb and he had to repeatedly tell them and anyone else who asked that all he did was write a letter to fdr urging him to research nuclear weapons since the nazis were doing the same",2023-10-17 14:20:43
i loved the movie in imax i get people seeing a three hour trailer but nearly 40 years of a guys life with some thematic liberties is a tough pitch for even three hours nolan pulls it off the acting is great but the music is the most amazing thing about the movie the bomb explosion i have to admit looked lackluster on a first view but then in my research of the explosion i found that my perception of atomic bomb blasts is that they are all massive they are all big but not all massive,2024-02-20 19:11:29
"not sure how exactly to put it into words but the movie does a fantastic job of showing the inertia for lack of a better word of making the bomb no one person is responsible as much as the film shows oppenheimer to be the man in charge of its creation its clear the government was going to do it regardless of which scientists came on board once the breakthrough was known it was going to become a bomb one way or another it ties so well to the scene in the lab with the scientists realizing that it was theoretically possible to do and how they began with pure childlike excitement and then quickly realized what it meant it really brings home the fact that mankind can be so selfdestructive we use our collective brainpower to invent exciting new technologies and then use those new technologies to 

just think about the absurdity of the thought process the nazis are probably going to create this bomb that could blow up the whole world so we better hurry up and create one first it would be funny if it wasnt so real and dark

it reminded me of an older podcast i listened to may have been radiolab they are interviewing a team that had worked on the stuff that has led to modern day deepfake videos voiceover fakes and  manipulation and the likes stuff that was exciting tech but really a solution to small issues she gave an example of instead of an actor having to fly in to do reshoots now they can use the tech and do it all in the editing booth which fine yeah thats great but the interviewer says surely you can foresee the nefarious uses for this tech this was a few years before the explosion of deep fakes you can tell that they thought about it but they just said something like its their job to create the tech once its clear that its possible to do",2024-03-14 13:00:10

"oppenheimer is even better on a 2nd watch i went in with a better grasp and understanding of the story this time so i didnt feel overwhelmed with the amount of information nolan feeds you the narrative thread was clearer to me which made the whole film even more emotionally impactful especially that crucial scene between oppenheimer and einstein at the lake tying up the black and white version at the beginning with the color one at the end worked in a tragically epic fashion one of the best film endings ive ever seen


its so impressive to me that nolan managed to make an 180min film that is filled to the brim with dialogue and exposition scenes feel like a 90 min action film the pacing and the editing were off the charts imo i never felt the full runtime of this film it reminded me of zodiac and jfk two of my favorite films when it comes to pacing storytelling and editing",2023-07-31 23:14:39

"biopic is my least favorite genre and i didnt like nolans last few films like at all so i was seriously considering passing on this film but my thought was changed after finally watching it in the theater i liked it much more than i expected it might be my new favortie film of nolan

i really liked nolans approach here he made the biopic almost like a political thriller i think it was the right choice to choose a story structure where the past and present intersect constantly it was a bit jarring until i got used to it but once it clicked i was immediately immersed in the movie if the story had progressed chronologically the hearing scenes might have been very anticlimactic

thematically i loved oppenheimers internal conflict about the nuclear bomb he was proud of what he and coworkers had achieved but he felt deeply guilty about what the nuclear bomb brought to the human races it was out of his hands once it was made but he couldnt be free from responsibility since he contributed to its creation i found the irony of the fact that an invention that could bring about the end of humanity to be the only solution to end a terrible war very interesting its a weapon of mass destruction for sure but if he hadnt built the nuclear bomb someone else surely had done im not saying he didnt have a choice but who could blame his choice after all what would you have done if you were in his position i dont think there was a right or wrong answer here",2023-09-01 06:17:21

"i love the film overall but my biggest complaint is the nonlinear storytelling 


i felt like it took away from the urgency and drive to get the bomb completed when the film keeps cutting to after the success of it in the trial scenes given that the big drawing scene of the film is the trinity test i would have liked the entire film up to that point to revolve around it and i would have liked a scene or two to show the pressure of the nazis or japanese enemies to further drive it home cuz this is ww2 dammit the constant timejumps also made it hard for me to keep track of the manymany characters in this film

im a sucker for soundaudio and watching this in this format confirmed for me that sound is the most important quality in making a film my only complaint about it is that the dialogue was tough to hear throughout the film background music being played for like 90 of the film is an interesting choice although i guess thats nolans thing

as for the film at least for me it feels like it requires multiple viewings 99 dialogue tons of characters i lost focus a few times during the first 15 hours but the third act picks up that ending though with the soundtrack accompanying it sheesh",2023-08-04 05:24:39

i finally get to see it in imax and three people on my right were talking full volume laughing and joking for the final 45 minutes they kept dropping their stuff and laughing at it and would stand up way too much they took a photo with the flash on and used their phones flashlights to look for random things they dropped on the ground one played a random youtube video then someone else’s ringer went off at a pivotal moment

 i got nothing from the last 3rd of the movie because of them plus my friend chose seats in the far back for some reason i wish i had the balls to confront the people but i have no backbone i’m surprised no one in the audience did anything",2023-08-08 07:20:07
i wanted to make a thread asking if any englishspeaking japanese people here had seen the film and what their thoughts on it are but automoderator refuses to let me post it because apparently a monthold general discussion thread is better than a new thread for a specific separate question and discussion,2023-08-10 14:51:27

"going to go against the flow im seeing here and say i thought the opening had more issues than the ending the first cut to rdj was so jarring it felt we were watching a dvd and someone hit the next scene button on accident

first 1520 mins i was questioning if i was going to even like the film at all then enjoyed the rest far from nolans best work though",2023-07-23 14:00:52
"there is a scene where oppenheimer gives a lecture in the netherlands but he speaks german instead of dutch and afterwards it’s confirmed it should have been dutch anyone noticed this aswell 

i’m from the netherlands btw so i know that it doesn’t sound dutch at all",2023-07-24 11:07:50
"this is definitely gonna require a rewatch or two more but i think this was definitely one of nolan’s best films in years and maybe his best work from his filmography yet


the cast including supporting actors and even actors that just literally showed up for a scene were fantastic and firing on all cylinders i was amazed by the amount of faces i saw that i didn’t know were involved casey affleck who was terrifying in his brief appearance as a understated sociopathic intelligence officer alex wolff and certainly not gary oldman all phenomenal

the two leading standouts though are obviously cillian murphy and robert downey jr i’ve been waiting for murphy to have a leading role for awhile now and this was an absolutely stellar debut

i did some reading on oppenheimer while in high school and murphy managed to convey quite a bit of who oppenheimer was from the brilliance to the ideological  political indecisiveness to the womanizing etc

robert downey jr was great as lewis strauss and i’ll have to think about it for awhile but maybe one of my favorite performances from him incredibly cunning and sinister but also weirdly petty and paranoid

this movie had an incredible building sense of dread but i think my favorite scene from the movie was when oppenheimer was given the speech in the little church like building and the celebration progressively got more crazed and animalistic and then the lone scream broke out the whole sequence had a very uncanny eerie atmosphere think this was great both as just a genuinely unsettling horror scene and an insight into america’s gross indifference at the bombing

the only one downsidecritique i have would be the trinity test bombing i know nolan is fanatic of practical effects and filming everything in camera but some smartly and minimally used cgi would have made the scene better i think i’ve viewed some nuclear bomb footage and unfortunately at least for the time being there’s no way to accurately depict it using only practical effects

overall truly enjoyed this more so than a lot of nolan’s recent stuff the runtime breezed by for me cast was great and the score was amazing",2023-07-24 16:53:55
this movie made me immediately buy the biography it was based on american prometheus by kai bird and martin j sherwin where i found that both kitty and teller’s testimonies at the “hearings” were essentially verbatim from the true story,2023-07-24 17:10:06

"i like how he subverted my expectations for the trinity test by keeping it near silent before exploding with sound 

my favorite parts were when reality was kind of bent with hallucinations of another blast people sick from radiation florence appearing during the questioning etc

the only thing that took me out of immersion were the constant cuts in some parts like in rapid fire conversation cuts every time the speaker changes which was a lot

also there were so many great actors in small roles that i recognized from various places but it didn’t distract me much they fit",2023-07-26 20:59:21
fantastic film but the final act of the interview scenes was 15 minutes too long and it felt agonising after such a fast paced narrative and shooting style there wasnt enough weight on oppy losing his security clearance for me to care long enough to be invested in the final act until the brilliant closing 5 minutes,2023-07-27 22:17:05

incredible movie any time i watch a christopher nolan movie i avoid all trailers and hype and wait till the day i see the movie to leave all expectations out cillian murphy is the perfect man for the role and the supporting cast delivered i will definitely plan to see it again right now i’m debating if this is the best movie nolan ever made i don’t know but it feels like it,2023-09-11 14:51:00
"one of the best films of the year probably will be top 3 of the year for me

 cillian murphy gives an absolutely amazing performance easily the frontrunner for best actor right now
 florence pugh was in like 6 scenes but was the standout making her death ambiguous suicide or  with quick cuts was a great editing choice
 direction score and cinematography are 1010
	 the trinity scene is heart palpitating and expertly direct by christopher nolan
	 ludwig goransson using strings and classical music is phenomenal
	 hoyte van hoytema with trinity scene and speech with the stomping was perfect 
 writing wise this is nolans best work the nonlinear structure with black and white scenes is a interesting narrative choice 
 the setups in first 2 acts to deliver the twists in the 3rd act was honestly mindblowing i see why the script was likened to the social network
 supporting actors david krumholtz josh hartnett benny safdie rami malek olivia thirbly alden herenreich etc all had their moments jack quaid with the tiny drums was a fan favorite
 rdj and emily blunt killed it in the 3rd act 

cinematically oppenheimer will be remembered as best films of the decade will deservedly dominate in award shows next year",2023-07-21 02:26:42

something more important than you   

what an absolutely brilliantly written film then beyond that it was expertly acted beautifully shot and with the most haunting use of music ive heard in a long time throughout the entire thing im not even that into historical films or biopics but this is a masterpiece",2023-07-22 00:49:58
anyone else feel like they couldve done a better job of showing the scale of the trinity test detonation i know theres some optical illusion camera work being done for a smaller sized explosion since nolan refuses to use cgi but he could have done slightly more to show just how tall the explosion was like maybe some more prolonged shots of the environment around the bomb site kinda like what he did with many scenes of interstellar i couldnt grasp the size and was kinda disappointed since its literally the point of the movie unless i missed something,2023-07-22 19:11:25
"i really enjoyed the movie the only thing i wanted to see more of was the actual science the movie was about his life for the most part and the politics of the bomb but i feel very little was focused on the bomb itself it barely explained why a hydrogen bomb was a much bigger deal than the atomic bomb having focused on it so much it didn’t explain the differences between the trinity bomb  man and little boy or even explain how many bombs they could make until they shipped the two actually used out of the facility 

for having such focus on the setting up of the los alamos lab and the recruitment of the scientists it never explained what they were working on or figuring out why did it take 3 years and 2 billion dollars were they just waiting to have enough plutonium for 3 years the only thing the movie showed as far as i can remember was them testing different ignition devices maybe it really wasn’t that exciting in reality i don’t know but i was expecting this movie to help me learn more about it

i spent time last week researching how the bomb actually works at a high surface level and thank  i did or i would of been even more lost as i don’t think i learned anything new in that regard",2023-07-23 23:24:21

"saw it last night liked it overall but not without faults that i noticed while watching the movie

 i felt like an old man during the opening scenes i struggled to hear what the  they were saying due to the music drowning out the dialogue 

 the trinity test scene was cool i loved the tense buildup and then silence going completely against what most people were expecting 

 that scene where einstein just emerged from the darkness on the lawn made me laugh i thought it was ridiculous and he felt very shoehorned in to that moment 

 oppenheimer mentions the bhagavad gita while having  and i thought “christ here we go” and then he said it and my eyes nearly rolled out of my head 

 lots of fun moments like the cut aways to small physical reactions a who’s who of all the scientists involved benny safdie as teller was really good and that sublime whale song of a score are all the standouts to me",2023-09-04 12:40:38

"i noticed it here and in tenet too  the editing is so jumpy and rushed  theres no pauses or silence in dialogue and it even feels like nolan sped up the dialogue too not that he did  i think he has gotten into a bad habit of trying to cram too much into one movie  

watch a scene from interstellar or inception and compare it to tenet or oppenheimer  the pace of conversation is so jittery and rushed",2024-01-02 03:17:14
"saw it 4 hours ago 

i am distinctly underwhelmed by it as a whole 

positives 
i very well acted everyone in it played their roles exceptionally 

ii some moments of it were genuinely captivating cinema the trinity test being one of those all time cinema scenes 

iii it was very nice to leave a movie that was loaded with so much dialogue 

iv it absolutely does hold your attention 

v sets clothing locations etc are incredibly on point fully immersive and at no point are you watching going this doesnt look right 

negatives 
i this movie is essentially about egos and moral dilemmas but very little actual weight is given to either however a lot of time is given to said egos and dilemmas i really dont think any of it is fleshed out beyond a scene or two at the end 

honestly after 3 hours of hating a few people the pay off of seeing a mans ego shattered is not worth the 3 hours it took to have it done in in 3 minutes of scenes 

ii this movie wants you to know about the subject matter going in which means it is really rather pleasant to not be spoonfed for once however and i appreciate this sounds like im impossible to please if you do know about the subject matter its actually a bit enraging 

he tried to  someone was a bit of a  nothing is given to this other than 1 scene and a scene of him cheating on partners both of which are just brushed off in a few lines of dialogue 

the actual manhattan project beyond his role the race against time the reason its used against japan potsdam conference the sheer technical accomplishment the raging antisemitism hidden as anticommunism of the era the rise of the military industrial complex any explanation of why the usukwest distrusts the ussr so much that the bombs did indeed end ww2 without any allies soldier having to fight on the japanese mainland the reason behind the red scare and a host of other things you might know about the era are blasted over in 1 remark or not at all 

it leaves you feeling like youve either been left wanting  the film to explore those in more depth not a huge amount but some or if you had no idea of the subject matter i imagine a bit clueless about why he is being removed from his role of influence beyond he knew some universitystudent level communists who still developed the bomb when asked 

iii character arcs the lack thereof 
honestly only matt damons lt gen leslie groves jr is allowed to have anything approaching character development everyone else seemingly has maybe 1 tweak in what they end up doing rather than any change in them i appreciate its a mostly biographical movie but it still requires some level of story telling in my opinion and it lacks something important for it 
honestly at the end of it its very hard to rationalise that anyone had won their war they had ended war as it was yes they now had the ability to end all life but major powers could not go on as they had which means no more world wars you just dont care enough about anyone based on development to care about them yes its a historical film which is absolutely up my alley but its still a film and needs to entertain and catch you more 

iv pacing or more so dedicating too much time at points for very little pay off 

again the issues around his hearing without any context given just drag on especially as most seemingly seem to be there ultimately to wrap up an easter egg comment from earlier in the film they wrap them up neatly and i enjoyed some of the call backs aka oppenheimer is essentially an einstein  aka the best of his era but his era rapidly passed  but they take so long with actors giving it their all to drag weak scenes to be captivating but ultimately incredibly inessential in the context of things 

v if this is supposed to be somewhat of a biopic or at least the telling of his story oppenheimer as a film gives you very little of the man himself i feel like nolan intentionally kept him an enigma to let the viewer put themselves in his place but ultimately i feel the end product isnt the tale of an exceptional person in the exact right place at the exact right time to book his place in history rather instead leaves him appearing as an annoyed project manager who is unhappy and a bit of a  i just think he wanted the audience to make up their own mind commendable so much that he neglected to give them enough to make their mind up either way 

vi the soundtrack  brilliant in big scenes weak af the rest of the time it just makes you feel dread but not a paced one rather just 3 hours of being on edge whilst it goes on the silence is used brilliantly but its made more impactful by the fact its the only time in the film i felt like i was not being forced to stay engaged by the soundtrack rather than what was on the screen 

vii being a history bore things were left out but not wrong the exception imo is the portrayal of truman was very harsh he had arguably the hardest role in the world going on from fdr taking the oval office in a war from a man who kept the entire manhattan project from him knowing he was playing out both the end of the european arena needing to end the asian arena and to set down a marker to his friend by convenience only in the ussr for the end of the war knowing the iron curtain was coming demobilisation of possibly the largest force in history all on an unelected presidency to give him 1 line about how it was him who has to live with giving the order to  120k people then leaving him as some slack jawed yokel with no compassion for the only other man who also shared a similar level of personal guilt felt like a kick in the jaw 

in contrast to oppenheimers constant approval of fdr and the films little wink to jfk at the end left it feeling very hamfisted around the political side of things 

 i wrote a lot there good not great feel it did have the bones of a great film but didnt meet it which was a shame very low down the rewatchable scale for me as well",2023-08-10 01:55:05
"i loved this movie i won’t reiterate the thousands of reasons others have here it’s all the same stuff 

i do have one problem that’s a personal thing and wasn’t enough to take away from the overall spectacle of the movie but was noticeable 

in nolan’s interviews he has a very well rehearsed line about why he doesn’t use cgi describing it as “anodyne” or “a bit safe” or that “it’s difficult to convey threat”

i think unfortunately the trinity test scene seems to suffer from this philosophy a bit personally i did not find the close up fireball shots to be as impactful to me as even watching the raw real footage from the test if there was one place to use cgi in the movie i think this would have been it",2023-07-21 13:19:46

"beautifully shot fantastic performances and nolans direction just might be the best its ever been i have some relatively minor issues but all in all more than worth a watch and if youre on the fence or thinking youll wait for it to hit vod just go to your theather  it actually makes a difference

ive always though nolans movies are needlessly convoluted and complicated almost just for the sake of it  my favorite of his is probably dunkirk but even there it feels like the nonlinear narrative kind of unravels at a couple of points in oppenheimer though not only does it work but it works  near perfectly funnily enough i randomly felt the urge to rewatch the social neteork yesterday and i cant help but feel like this is the same movie but with nukes instead of facebook for a good chunk of its runtime its a very dialoguerich movie that transcends everything nolan has written before thanks to careerbest performances from just about evertone involved

robert downey jr is fantastic and im so glad hes coming back to real acting murphy is a true revelation and just plain excels in the portrayal of a very complicated very conflicted figure you know how people say theres character actors stuck in leading mens bodies murphy is the opposite of that and he should absolutely get more leading roles after this florence pugh and emily blunt are very underused sadly but thats just because the script doesnt give them a whole lot to work with when they are on screen though theyre as good as theyve ever been

and that last point sort of brings me to the only real issue i had with the movie theres just so much stuff going on all the time it feels like someone triee to condense band of brothers or chernobyl into three hours a new character is introduced every five minutes only to come back again an hour and a half later or at the end of the movie theres some pacing issues as well with nolan introducing a new little diversion on their way to the bomb but then thats resolved two minutes later while the next issue they run into takes them 15 to get through a lot of the comments im seeing here say they had issues with the last act but it was the opposite for me there were some parts leading up to trinity that felt really messy and undercooked but once the test was done and we got to oppenheimers kangaroo court and strauss confirmstion hearing i was all in it was a good twist for those unfamiliar with that part of oppenheimers life and the stakes feel higher than they did during the building of an actual atomic bomb",2023-07-21 22:22:40
"that ending though holy  couldn’t have been wrapped up better the anticipation to seeing what oppy and einstein were talking about thinking it’s about strauss only to find out that it’s the true message of the film

we are all  and this was inevitable",2023-07-22 02:02:22

so i saw this movie on imax i assume digital and i went in blind only seeing the trailer and was aware on surface who oppenheimer was and it was the first nolan film ive seen but i really liked the film and 3 hours went by breeze sometimes jumping from scene to scene was a bit meh but otherwise i was really pleased and i liked it,2023-07-23 16:23:53

"the build up around the middle of the film from when theyre discussing potential targets with the minister of war to the actual trinity test was some of the most haunting cinema ive ever seen despite knowing exactly what happens i was on the edge of my seat palms sweaty with nerves 

best film ive seen in a while although i can completely understand why people wanted more oppenheimer with their viewing of oppenheimer",2023-07-24 09:16:18
when i first saw it i thought the third act was great albeit a dramatic drop in intensity but as ive reflected on the ending ive realised its about how the western state apparatus chews you up and spits you out once you dissent and that political actors care only for the assertion of their power regardless of consequence strauss was obsessed with a graph and what people thought of him oppenheimer was obsessed with his own hypocrisy in the adulation of creating a device that could destroy the world the film actually doesnt work without it,2023-07-24 21:34:33
"i loved this movie i understand some people frustrations with it though 

it requires 110 of your attention it’s 2 hours and 59 minutes of dialogue the nuke scene isn’t really the climax i get how some people are let down by that however it’s so much more than that it’s a massively important story about americanworld history and a character study of all the big players involved 

the way the timelines all interplayed with one another i thought was masterful totally get how some view it as chaotic though it’s not a linear a to b but if you keep attentive through the whole thing you will be rewarded when it all clicks 

it’s a case of “a tremendous movie i can’t really recommend to most people” i think you really have to be a fan of films and the art to like it however i wouldn’t tell anyone not to see it because of that just understand this isn’t a typical ww2 movie nor is it a typical biopic it’s done in the artists style",2023-07-27 04:45:53

"i thought it was a great film that really might take a few viewings to properly digest  overall i felt it was mostly about how science is hijacked by political agendas rather than about the moral position of oppenheimer himself  it shows how he was really through his empathy note the exchange with truman manipulated by cultural hegemony  i dont think they mentioned antonio gramsci in the dialogue of the film i wouldnt have the capacity to clock it honestly but i came away thinking about this quote   
“the old world is dying and the new world struggles to be born now is the time of monsters”   
― antonio gramsci antonio gramsci prison letters",2023-08-02 09:22:36
"i really like the distinction between oppenheimers motivation for going through the motions of being discredited and strauss assumptions about his motivation

oppenheimer felt he had a reckoning coming invariably to the extent that even a kangaroo court repudiation still held some ethical validity strauss thought he only cared about being attached to the heroic element of the manhattan project the purely antinazi necessity of the trinity test and not the utter soullessness of abombing thousands of civilians but succeeding at framing himself heroically to the worldhistory is the last thing oppenheimer would want

also really enjoyed the inversion of the pacing where the classroom and political scenes are edited fast as  and you barely get a sense of the physical space before the scenes over it only slows down during momentous conversations meeting groves talking with einstein the trinity test countdown sexasfatalisticdebate and the most significant testimonies in the farce trial

however the ending didnt quite hit me because i couldnt figure out why einstein would pretend to be nicenot hate strauss until that conversation it seemed like he basically just chilled out and tried to avoid being used as a  by politicians after fleeing germany sowhy would he bother in any case it was like the movie got so wrapped up in framing the ending with strauss selfcentered thinking making him make a mistake that it forgot einstein wouldnt have really cared to put on a nice face before that point either",2023-08-05 01:23:43
"i’m sure it was a combination of very well done makeup and sparing use of cgi possibly but the aging and deaging was phenomenal 

young cillian murphy looked absolutely real 99 of the time even when it’s well done i feel our brain can tell something is off but with this movie it straight up looks like an actual young cillian murphy 

and rdj looking old was just perfect yeah he’s not a super young guy but the thinning hair and age spots again looked absolutely 100 real you just could not tell there was any makeup or effects used but they were idk if that’s enough to get best makeup but it’s pretty much the best i’ve ever seen especially with how detailed and close up nolan likes to shoot it was just crazy good",2023-08-07 12:21:18
"awesome movie watched it on imax today

only thing i dont get is the part where oppenheimer went to leiden netherlands to give a university talk in dutch he actually talked german

"didn’t the opening of the movie it say 1fission like it was going to have set chapters and then those didn’t appear the rest of the movie

edit i guess fission is the first track in göransson’s soundtrack so maybe a mistake",2023-07-23 22:36:09
the last few shots of the movie was some sombre   for the times we live in,2023-07-24 06:43:24
i’m all for people doing the barbenheimer doublewatch thing but when there’s a group of teenagers in your theatre who clearly aren’t interested in watching a 3hour historical drama and are instead flicking through snapchat and instagram half the time you start to wonder what was even the point,2023-07-24 19:40:50
has any other big name actress spent a higher percentage of her screen time  than florence pugh in this movie,2023-07-24 21:29:42
"im still in awe at the decision to use just a lone scream in the theater scene i feel like it would have been an easy choice to include a cacophony of screams but just having one makes it so much more poignant somehow 

amazing film",2023-07-25 06:09:12
oppenheimer more like rizzenheimer my dude had serious game with the ladies,2023-07-25 06:24:16

its mad that the reasons to drop the bomb show it to the world and drop the second to show its not a one time thing is actualy insane and crazy but actualy makes sense,2023-07-25 22:13:08
"that was depressing gotta watch something funny to help my mood

rdj could get an oscar for this film i think",2023-07-27 03:13:05
"i liked the movie but i think the intercutting of timelines is a gimmick and a crutch for nolan 

eg it was unclear what year the soviets had the bomb test the giant dinner table meeting w downeys character and all the scientists

x200b

and in some cases the intercutting breaks some of the tension other cases it adds",2023-07-28 00:02:09
not perfect but deeply depressing primarily through its central narrative over the downey jar character who essentially was quite prepared to attempt to destroy oppenheimer over some minor perceived slight even though he ended up destroying himself in the process and was still going down lashing out at anybody he could a scientific endeavour handing immense destructive power to mere humans with all there human faults,2023-07-30 10:07:29
"anyone else intrigued by the flip of color and bw compared to most films here it was surprising to me that nolan used bw for the more modern scenes and color for the older ones was this to represent the world postbomb or more practical in not wanting the bomb sequences to be in bw

overall liked the movie but agree with many commenters it was far from flawless also i loved benny safdie in good time but found his accent a little cringe here",2023-08-05 21:38:53
"finally saw this film last night and id describe it in this one sentence

how they blew up the man who blew up the world",2023-08-11 16:47:30
"910 for me

murphy was unreal as opponehimer e",2023-08-14 09:00:55
i went in with somewhat middling expectations and was delightfully surprised it’s a three hour movie that feels like six but i enjoyed every moment of it feels like there’s a sizable amount of negativity around the fact that people think nolan is putting on airs but the movie and narrative comes neatly together and getting flustered over imagery included for effect misses the forest for the trees i think it was a beautifully told story if it wasn’t for nolan at the helm those same people would be singing its praises,2023-08-14 18:09:13
finally watched it in 70mm imax my first ever imax experience and it was  brilliant for a very dialogue heavy movie it was very engaging,2023-08-29 23:50:52
"just watched the movie on blu ray so my initial impressions are

1 this film is packed with information its back to back scenes of nonfluff dialogue from beginning to end you really have to pay attention to understand what theyre talking about anyone that says otherwise did not pay attention watching with subtitles is absolutely 100 required on first time watch second time maybe not but still feels necessary

2 the cinematics musical score setting production and all technical aspects in this film are pretty close to flawless though some of those earlier parts didnt need so much audible contrast at least the dialogue was clear and understandable versus tenet

3 the story was pretty gripping in my opinion i can see why some people found the third act to be dragging but i found it to be a good conclusion on why oppenheimer was being deposed in the first place it framed his life and work for the plot

4 as for the moral dilemmas  ill save that for another time for now i would say this is easily one of the best movies of 2023 the nature of the film doesnt really seem to justify watching in imax though overall id give it a 9510",2023-11-11 04:20:46
"maybe im not smart enough to get but the strauss plot just seemed unnecessary i couldnt tell what oppenheimer was thinking when half the time he is advocating for the bomb and the other half he is the voice of morality

mostly its just too long",2024-03-29 21:04:22
"6pm showing in 70mm film it’s top tier nolan somehow extremely gripping with pure scenes of dialog which only he can do if you go in expecting a lot of explosions be forewarned this is like jfk and other courtroom dramas expertly done 

but it is long at 25 hrs checking watch and it feels it no clapping at the end of my screening i think general audiences will struggle with it 

2 things

1 if i hear roger robb ask another question i will scream maybe that’s the point 

2 and i want einstein to pop up randomly in all future movies 

910",2023-07-21 02:21:03
for people going into a three hour biopic about a scientist and the surrounding politics complaining about it being a three hour biopic about scientists and politicians talking what exactly did you expect the entirety of the movie to just be atomic bombs going off and gory after images,2023-07-21 10:06:52
"best movie ive watched in a long while they name dropped john f kennedy at the end like a marvel cameo

a nolan movie about the moon landing would be incredible",2023-07-26 12:50:42
so i wasn’t able to understand what cillian murphy was saying when he humiliated rdj… can someone let me know what the judge asked and what oppenheimer responded with,2023-07-21 18:11:01
"i really enjoyed it and it had me riveted despite being a fairly talky 3 hour movie cilian murphy gave a tremendous performance and i hope he gets an oscar nom for it the nearly continuous music score was a wonder to listen to as well i think its a movie that ill only watch once though not really much replay value for me

for whatever reason i was thinking that nolan would show us an on the ground perspective from hiroshima or nagasaki when the atomic bomb detonated",2023-07-22 01:58:14
i haven’t seen anyone mention this yet i think the reason nolan had a character go out of their way to mention jfk was because he cited oliver stone’s movie “jfk” as a huge influence on this movie especially those scenes,2023-07-22 06:07:35
"everyone talking about best actors and nobody mentioning jason clarke the man behind roger robb 

most hated character since jofferey 

i wanted to jump across that hearing table and strangle him when he was yelling at oppenheimer 

amazing acting",2023-07-23 03:01:45
all the performances were great murphy damon rdj blunt pugh malek etc but i think the one that really stood out to me as surprisingly phenomenal was jason clarke man you really hate his character but he was so good in that role,2023-07-23 03:13:00
robert downey jr should always be in every nolan movie moving forward,2023-07-23 03:48:13
"obviously its a movie about oppenheimer and not the bombings themselves but im glad they showed glimpses of the effects of the bombs in the gym scene

having recently been to both of japans bomb site memorials and seeing the very real legacy of nuclear warfare there the gym scene was especially heavy for me

using parallels of people crying for joy and holding each other while thousands across the world are crying in anguish and holding each other in their last moments right after the skin melting and charred corpse scene was a masterful work of filmography imo",2023-07-23 03:56:53
i think rdj did a great job however i’d really love to see a cut of the movie that didn’t rely on him as a framing and exposition device i think you could still find a way to use that character in moderation that would make the film feel less bloated the last 45minutes i found myself wondering “…and it’s over right” the film doesn’t need an antagonist throughout the story is compelling enough that it works on the merits of trying to tell a story about the man behind the atom bomb alone,2023-07-23 05:13:51
anyone else laugh their  off when matt damon delivered the line this is the most  important thing in the  world,2023-07-23 07:13:02
i can’t remember the last time i was in a packed cinema and the whole audience was so locked in especially considering it is basically a 3 hour talkie   no one was fidgeting looking at phones or leaning in to talk to their partners even,2023-07-23 14:01:35
the theatre didnt have subtitles which i kind of need and the audio mixing with music happening a lot of time did not help,2023-07-23 14:21:28
"the one thing i was a bit hazy on in retrospect was the impetus for strauss animosity toward oppenheimer 

i think the film was suggesting that strauss initially wanted to collect oppenheimer in his institute as a sort of feather in his own cap but soured on oppenheimer when he turned out to be an independent thinker scientifically and politically coupled with his own insecurity  his insistence that oppenheimer turned einstein against him and the isotope joke that really stuck with him  i read it as an egotistical man who wanted oppenheimer as an achievement but ended up viewing him as an opponent

but was it really that petty and what was the context for the joke that clearly rubbed him so much the wrong way i wasnt quite sure what the setting for that exchange was looked like another hearing of sorts",2023-07-23 14:30:07
did anyone else notice the lump cyst on the right hand side of cillian murphys neck,2023-07-23 18:08:39
the sound design was the best part of the movie for me absolutely classic nolan score out of göransson as well some moments brought me almost to tears without anything traditionally dramatic happening,2023-07-24 02:06:53
"ive been describing oppenheimer as a classic straightforward biopic wearing a christopher nolan costume some of the most tense and nervewracking moments were just cillian murphy pouring every ounce of emotion he could into his eyes while the score went bananas not intense action scenes i left satisfied that i had seen a solid christopher nolan movie and was surprised that i had highly enjoyed and remained engaged with a 3 hour biopic  i was expecting it to drag a little it did but still held my attention while it slowed down

heres a fun fact from lpotl during the trinity test one of the scientists described the initial flash of light as an allconsuming brightness that overpowered him until he was screaming in his brain for it to stop he said it felt like eternityit was 2 seconds i couldnt help but remember that during the many moments of extreme unbearable music that went on just long enough and would not be shocked to learn that it was a conscious choice to mimic that sensation",2023-07-24 23:32:53
anyone else immediately recognize bernard from the santa clause movies can’t believe how far he’s come he’s now been in an oscarworthy cinematic masterpieceand oppenheimer lol jk fantastic movie,2023-07-25 04:31:22
this movie perfectly encapsulates anxiety 1010,2023-07-25 09:13:42
"can someone please tell me how rami maliks character just knows everything about rdj and cillian 

it was a good scene but i didnt understand how he could have known all these things about rdjs characters plans given that he was just there taking notes in 2 scenes the one intro scene where cillian meets him and the other scientist and the second one where they are about to meet the secretary of defense and it looks like he is advising cillian against it",2023-07-25 16:30:30
" even though its 3 hours it kept my attention i didnt feel the need for a break  

 the acting was great made me feel like they were the characters  

 all i knew going into it was that oppenheimer was the head of the project so a lot of the different plotlines were new to me",2023-07-25 22:09:08
there were a ton of famous people in this thing and ton of great performances here but seeing old josh harnett was a real surprise and he was great in this,2023-07-26 05:08:51
man leaving out josh hartnet in the cast list feels wrong never been a big fan but i thought he killed it in this role almost unrecognizable,2023-07-26 16:36:49
"did the soundtrack remind anyone else of there will be blood

parts of it felt very jonny greenwood to me",2023-07-26 18:20:12

also holy  just got home from watching it and totally forgot gary oldman is in this,2023-07-31 04:33:16
i just wanted to add that it was nice to see alden ehrenreich acting again he is a talented actor that really did all he could to make han solo a thing and i hope to see him in more films again,2023-07-31 13:38:42
that little “breath out” that rdjr does mid sentence to let out his frustration when he was arguing with  oppenheimer felt real asf,2023-07-31 18:44:49
amazing cast with great performances all around cilian murphy emily blunt and robert downey jr all killed it cinematography and soundtrack were also amazing and the trinity test and final scenes were both great all in all a masterpiece nolan killed it with this one ,2023-08-02 07:43:56
really great film first time watching any film in imax and phew great experience every actor did justice to their role loved rami malek attacking strauss the delay in audio and the focus on oppenheimer’s breathing as the bomb detonated was sick and a great experience nonetheless,2023-08-02 14:58:59
"here is the context of the “mermaid” quote from dr rabi in the kangaroo court hearing taken from the reallife transcript

mr marks “dr rabi mr robb asked you whether you had spoken to chairman strauss on behalf of dr oppenheimer did you mean to suggest in your reply  in your reply to him you said you did among other things  did you mean to suggest that you had done that to dr oppenheimers instigation”

dr rabi “no i had no communication from dr oppenheimer before these charges were filed or since except that i called him once to just say that i believed in him with no further discussion another time i called on him and his attorney at the suggastion of mr strauss i never hid my opinion from mr strauss that i thought that this whole proceeding was a most unfortunate one”

dr evans “what was that”

dr rabi “that the suspension of the clearance
of dr oppenheimer was a very unfortunate thing and should not have been done in other words there he was he is a consultant and if you dont want to consult the guy you dont consult him period why you have to then proceed to suspend clearance and go through all this sort of thing he is only there when called and that is all there was to it so it didnt seem to me the sort of thing that called for this kind of proceeding at all against a man who had accomplished what dr oppenheimer has accomplished there is a real positive record the way i expressed it to a friend of mine we have an abomb and a whole series of it and we have a whole series of super bombs and what more do you want mermaids this is just a tremendous achievement if the end of that road is this kind of hearing which cant help but be humiliating i thought it was a pretty bad show i still think so”",2023-08-05 01:11:03
fantastic direction and brilliant acting by cillian murphy its worth watching,2023-08-09 20:36:49
"managed to get the very last imax showing in my local theater for my first and presumably only theater watch of this magnificent film

i knew plenty going in through memes and even spoilers like strauss being behind everything and the final conversation but i was still blown away by all of it",2023-08-30 23:22:13
the soundtrack album tho,2023-09-20 08:49:03
also its kinda weird how his mistress was assassinated for being a communist and it only served as a plot device that  was ,2023-12-08 15:55:32
amazing movie i mostly have one big issue and its how mostly for the first hour it is loaded with fast paced dialogue so many character introductions that when these names come up later in the final act you have to do these mental gymnastics focusing on who are they talking about obviously it concerns only some of them but still the movie does not let itself breathe for like half of its runtime on the other hand i understand that they had to condense these events because if not there goes the 4 hour movie other than that i really enjoyed it wasnt underwhelmed by the bomb test lots of great scenes performances and a powerful ending and i think it was nice to see how nolan pulled off this more of a personal complex story especially after his last underwhelming for his standard conceptual attempt of tenet,2023-12-23 01:18:01
just give chrostopher nolan the oscar give him all the  oscars what a film absolutely monumental in scope and scale,2023-07-21 03:50:47
"the editing in this movie is top notch the 3 hours felt hypnotic and i couldn’t turn my head even for a second 

the pacing was so snappy and the dialogues were being delivered like bullets it was so fast 

the build up to trinity test scene was just insane my heart literally raced 

i did not expect to see casey affleck and gary oldman in this that was truly a great surprise",2023-07-21 16:44:20
i cant wait until einstein popping up in random places becomes a meme,2023-07-21 20:13:09
i felt there were a couple of scenes where i lost track of the conversationnot as bad as some other nolan films but still kind of frustrating,2023-07-22 02:38:25
"the trinity test the scene of oppenheimers anxiety in the gym and his final scene with einstein are what stood out the most in this movie absolute perfection in each case

definitely would recommend anyone to watch this",2023-07-22 06:03:35
saw it last night  no imax sadly  have to say i’m a little let down i’m a massive nolan fan but it felt too long with too many grey haired dudes whose names i couldn’t keep track of talking a lot the moments where nolan got to really flex his muscles when oppy was trippin out were unbelievably intense and awesome bit disappointed by the explosion scene too  sorta was hoping for something more but not exactly sure what visually stunning but an hour too long for the story it told,2023-07-27 01:51:58
"•	3 hours of almost pure dialogue and you don’t get bored fastpaced and intense

•	cilian nails the contortedtwisted and mysterious nature of oppenheimer very well was difficult to get a read on him sometimes

•	damon was amazing tbh he always is it’s difficult to separate him as a person from him on the screen more than other actors but he was great thought he was very funny and produced laugh out loud moments my favourites being his deadpan “right build him a town” and “we will have him killed”

•	score was amazing but that’s almost to be expected now with nolan films

•	blunt has a habit of stealing the limelight whenever she’s in a scene best one was where she wasn’t falling for the interrogator’s  and stood up for herselfoppy

•	scene with cilian  on the interrogation chair with the woman staring at blunt was pretty shocking not seen something like that in a nolan before

•	bomb scene emotions  why is there no sound  this is eerie as  holy  there’s the sound – i need new pants whole cinema was packed but completely silent for this which added to it 

•	nolan knows the importance of the movie ending and this last scene was one of the better ones puts einstein in colour then cilian drops the bombshell at the end

•	didn’t know much about oppy so had no idea where the movie would go after hiroshima but the downey jnr storylinetwist was very good

•	gary oldman cameo was great

•	random thing i learned the experiment lecturer in the room next to oppy at the start josh hartnett turned down nolan’s offer of being batman 

•	enjoyed the marbles filling up in the bowl imagery of the bomb being ready

•	harrowing scene where he gave the speech after the bombs were dropped in the raucous crowd one of the best ones",2023-07-27 10:06:59
"i loved a lot and disliked a lot

pros 
it was acted brilliantly cillian looking completely defeated as someone can’t remember who walked out of the interview room was great 

the test’s buildup the choice to delay the explosion 30 seconds was a brilliant one

the scenes with truman the army deciding where to drop the bomb and cillian giving a speech were all magnificent

cons

the test was really visually underwhelming it looked like they’d blown up a little bit of dynamite not an atomic blast should’ve gone cgi

non linear nature of the film was hard to keep up with and i found it unnecessary 

also found the political and security clearance element of the film to be a bit flat not enough weight was put on oppenheimer not getting cleared for the audience to care 

the strauss storyline and his motivations were not made clear enough to the average viewer

710 would recommend if you liked ww2 american politics and nolan",2023-07-28 00:10:42
probably one of the greatest final lines for a movie in my recent memory,2023-07-30 23:23:20

 heisenberg

"this was the first movie i ever had to walk away and think about how i felt about it

my immediate reaction was to wonder why there wasnt much shown or mentioned in terms of the japanese people and what it did to them but after sleeping on it it kind of all hit me

every significant character in this film is only viewing the events as they pertain to and affect themselves obviously this culminates with the mutually assured destruction motif of strauss  oppenheimers careers going up in smoke if anything had been added such as an in memoriam or some other nod to the dead it would have been  it would have seemed like insult to injury

the only consideration is can we build this and can we beat the soviets never what does this do to the world

even oppenheimer believes in the false dichotomy  a peace the world has never seen

again  it bothered me that something wasnt said but now i understand why it wasnt  because it just actually wasnt ever said or thought of at the time and thats that the peace oppenheimer is describing is not actually peace its paxamericana paxamericana is not peace its managed peace under the threat of imperialistic violence the conditions for war are still there but now theres a man with a big stick who wont let you fight it thats not peace no one says this because no one was even thinking it at the time which is the entire point of the film everyone including the us sees themselves at the center only viewing every event through the lens of how it affects me personally and what my place in history will be 

other than that i just didnt get the  but great film",2023-08-05 17:34:57
"from hibakusha 

my husband and two children were lost in the atomic bombing
i am shige hiratsuka who was exposed to the atomic bomb in hiroshimaas a live witness to the misery and anger i would like to speak outmy family consisted of my husband myself and two children… a family of four
on august 6 showa 20 1945 just after 8 am we had just finished breakfast as my husband was reading the morning paper and i was cleaning up the breakfast dishes our two children played nearby
suddenly what seemed like a streak of lightning lit the sky followed by a thunderous noise the house collapsed around us and we were trapped

as my husband and i were trying with all our might to escape we heard help me help me our next door neighbors wife was calling for help i called out to her as soon as we get free we will come to help you

when we finally escaped from our fallen house the first thing we saw was the total destruction of the city of hiroshima no houses or other buildings were visible they had all disappeared fires were evident here and there in my shock and fear my only thought was escape and in my fear and rush to escape i forgot the promise to help our neighbors wife my thoughts swirled around finding our children

where are our children
as we called out our childrens names we heard help me mother help me mother coming from a distance of about 2 or 3 meters away i rushed in that direction it was my own 6 year old daughter kazuko i began calling for my husband who was at that time barely able to move come quickly i screamed
at that time my husband was bleeding from the shoulder and was badly injured he was so weak that he was barely able to walk
our daughter was screaming out mother my legs hurt my legs hurt my legs are trapped help me to get them free
i struggled to free her but no matter how hard i pulled her legs remained trapped she was covered from the chest down by debris from the walls of the house and by dirt it was impossible to free her

as i continued to pull on her the fires were fast approaching i could see and hear and smell the fires i was hot and unable to breathe and could no longer continue my struggle at that moment i knew that if i stayed i would die dying was not a choice i was willing to make i could not imagine being burned to death

i said a prayer for my children
kazuchan i am sorry i am a bad mother please forgive me kazuchan i know you dont want to die either but your mother does not have courage to face the fire kazuchan forgive me forgive me i said as i turned and walked toward the area that was free of fire i took my husbands hand to help him escape with me but as we moved away our hearts were left behind with our daughter

as we escaped we didnt realize that we were stepping and falling over dead bodies as i stumbled and fell on those bodies i was not affected by a feeling of creepiness i just felt a deep sadness as we continued our escape we realized that we had made it to the riverside of yokokawa",2023-08-12 03:36:06
"got to see this in 70mm imax and jesus christ it was one of the most beautiful things ive ever seen id forgotten how great it is just to see closeups of faces projected on the biggest screen possible 

some of the courtroomhearing scenes looked as if they were filmed in the mid 70s absolutely gorgeous to look at

and the sound was just unbelievable i got a jolt through my entire body everytime an explosion went off and to build up to trinity and then drop us into complete silence gave me chills

the scene afterwards where oppenheimer tries to give a rousing speech and is haunted by hiroshima was one of the most disturbing and powerful scenes i can remember truly like being in a nightmare especially the way screams bled and bombs began bleeding into the soundtrack truly haunting

i thought all the cast was great murphys never been better it was great to see downey jr given a meaty acting role for once damon has settled into the gruff old man phase of his career blunt really stole the last hour and i loved all the brief cameos from big stars

only downsides the first hour was a bit shapeless and dragged at times pugh was very good but her character felt like she needed one or two more scenes to really land some of the dialogue is very heavy handed they get away with it because its so fast and often technical but a lot of this film is verbal exposition 

but they are small issues in an incredible 3 hour film that i could have easily sat and watched for another hour at least excellent excellent film",2023-08-12 10:27:37

"oppenheimer made me want to go back to school to get a phd in physics and write equations in my room for 4 years straight while ludwigs soundtrack plays on repeat 

ludwig goransson’s track played nearly the entire movie and had me sweating the entire time with its sheer intensity his testosteronefueled aggressive tracks mixed traditional orchestra with synths while quieter orchestral motifs enhanced the emotional connections ludwig was so committed that he started writing 3 months before filming began and continued throughout production in can you hear the music ludwig changes the tempo 21 times so drastically and aggressively that the track was deemed unplayable the musicians in the full orchestra required a click played in their headphones before every tempo change and it took 3 days until the entire song was finally recorded in one take 

the editing matched ludwigs level of intensity and focus nolan kept slamming scene after scene without giving us a second to breathe this was phenomenal focused nonlinear editing the entire movie was composed of thematic clusters of linked montages and vignettes which flowed naturally and felt like a dream the brief cuts to particles vibrating atoms splitting bombs exploding and stars collapsing were incredible visuals to complement the physics concepts discussed the feverish pace was complemented by the music perfectly",2023-08-21 19:44:16

writing just to get some thoughts out i didnt like it i think my expectations are partially to blame to be fair i thought this was going to be about los alamos  and the creation of the bomb that ended up being a relatively small part of the movie the only part i really enjoyed i thought the editing in the beginning was really odd it felt like one long transitional montage the dialog was hard to hear there was music playing the entire movie i usually love nolan movie scores but this was just weird there would be a scene with two people talking quietly in a room and theres loud dramatic ominous tones playing the entire time over it it was distracting and confusing the drama of the communism accusations never really grabbed me i think they did a good job of portraying a haunted man but it wasnt riveting at any point for me when you were expecting a dope atomic bomb movie and instead you get a weird artsy movie about a tormented guy for over 3 hours i dont know pretty disappointed im surprised it was so unanimously praised,2023-12-10 16:04:25

can anyone explain the significance of the bw scenes i know it’s jumping around in the timeline of how things happen but i can’t figure out what the turning point of when in the timeline it switches to black and white towards the beginning of the movie i thought everything in bw was posttrinity test but the color footage also extends into the board interrogation scenes which is well past trinity as well,2023-07-22 03:43:49

"this isnt the type of movie i would normally see especially not in theaters but with so much hype and talent behind it i had to go 

i didnt even realize how stacked and massive the cast was but  did they nail it the make up team also needs credit because i didnt realize that was rdj until he spoke

aside from a couple slow parts and a little confusion from the jumping around in time periods i very much enjoyed the movie and would recommend it",2023-07-23 16:01:51

more i think about it the can you hear the music robert sequence might be my favorite scene in the whole film and one of my favorites in nolans filmography its nolan going full tonepoem watching oppenheimer study abroad intercut with shots from the quantum world as this ethereal and dreamlike score plays ludwig göransson score during this montage is his best of the entire film i love the tempo of the scene the way it seems to pulsate as oppenheimer shatters glasses in the corner of his room its such a moody scene theres this kind of romanticism to it the abstract portrait oppenheimer stares at seemingly a reflection of himself  its somehow very much like nolan yet almost completely different than any of the other scenes hes directed i love it so much,2023-07-23 20:28:00

"the real story and the viewers pov is that of robert downey jrs

i felt like the essential question of the film was determining whether oppenheimer was truly against the development of nuclear bombs and the hydrogen bomb because of their destructive capabilities or whether he was against it because he was jealous that he didnt come up with the idea for the hydrogen bomb

the entire movie is moreso about the judgment of his character rather than his achievement 

did he really care to see the world burn or did he just want to see it done by his own hands

that was what the movie was about imo and we come to that essential question via the last couple scenes in the movie with downey jrs character determining oppies motivation and oppies last scene with einstein that nolan made up",2023-07-24 12:29:23
"it feels like florence pugh is in everything atm

"movie really didnt work for me and that isnt a surprise as i couldnt finish tenet 

the editing was frantic most of the time and needlessly so the story being told primarily out of chronological order was an odd choice given the type of story they are telling it feels like at least an hour or more of the movie could have been removed without it having much impact 

the confirmation of rdjs character wasnt necessary and watching them put oppenheimer on trial for keeping his security clearance didnt feel as climatic as it likely intended to it also didnt need to be as remotely long as it was

choosing not to show any of the aftermath of the bomb drops was a bad choice in my opinion having them simply talked about in some throwaway lines really didnt do it justice 

also the only two performances that stood out were rdj and matt damon not that anyone else was bad just a bit one note that seems especially true for murphy given how much praise he received i expected a bit more

i think this could have been a great movie if nolan stopped being nolan a bit while filming it",2023-07-25 14:05:54
"before watching oppenheimer i feel like there was just as many articles about the florence pugh  scenes as there were reviews of the movie itself

so i was really surprised that the only nudity is florence pughs  all these articles made it out to be like there would be some fullfrontal graphic  scenes

also the only actual sexpenetration only lasts for like 5 seconds total

im really surprised this movie has an r rating it got an r rating solely for showing  i feel like in europe with its more liberal stance towards  and nudity this movie easily could be rated pg

even the womans face peeling off the only gore in the movie  if you can even call it that only lasted for like 2 seconds tops and that wasnt even gory even someone with a bad sunburn and their skin peeling off would literally have the same special effects",2023-07-25 23:24:55

i was a bit confused about lewis strauss’ aide at the end did his attitude toward strauss shift towards hatreddistrustdisappointment after realizing strauss was a thinskinned conniving snake that’s what it felt like and it seemed fairly clear to me given his feigned ignorance to the way congress was leaning and providing false info to strauss but i just wasn’t sure given that strauss was his boss and all also did he personally take any action into getting hill to testify in the manner in which he did or was hill always going to slander strauss from the start,2023-07-30 01:15:50

"watched the movie yesterday not a fan of hollywood modern movies and pretty much watched it to spend a night away from home well oun intended i was blown away

perfectly written with enough suspenceand clever placement of present and flashback scenes since as someone who doesnt really know the whole story just the basics like project manhattan or the los alamos i found it gripping wondering who is the good and who is the bad character 

and this is what i loved the most all characters are kinda on the bad side even oppenheimer most dialogue was important no fillers giving us a perspective of each ones motivation way of thinking and the reason behind decisions made the movie felt like a 90s00s thriller with fewer action and the whole action was on the way the characters interacted of course the acting was really great and the visuals where on point 

bottom line i loved the movie the way morality is a sidekick up until the end and the tension was obvious without having loud altercations between the characters or over the top action i will watch again soon and i will sure notice more interesting things and little details only downside was einsteins appearance which felt like he was some balkan fisherman and the scenes he was in were not so interesting",2023-09-05 11:06:57
"very very good movie i was worried to fall asleep because nowdays i have problem with two hour movie but it went by in a flash i was shocked it was already over then i watch the phone and it was 1230

the acting is top notch the pacing is phenomenal the fast cut was confusing at first but then it became really organic

i think its just so nice to have filmmaker like nolan who never miss you go to see one of his movies and you know its gonna be a good experience

"finally saw it

i dont know if it was the sound mixing or the quality of sound at the theatre i went to but there were parts i had no idea what was going on because i couldnt hear their dialogue

i think i was in my seat the whole time because i was trying to figure out what was going on and i think most of the things i picked up because what i know from history eg the manhattan project but i dont know that much about it

it was so interesting how being associated with commies was such a terrifying thing and something i guess i dont quite understand as a nonamerican",2024-03-11 04:29:48
is it just me but i felt like the focus of the movie was completely wrong like the personal quarrel of strauss is a far far less interesting conflict than anything relating to the building of atomic bomb yet the movie was exclusively focusing on it i would have liked to see more of the science more moral dilemma more about how the bomb was built and what it took the strauss character and his beef with oppenheimer felt like a cstory that nolan focused far too much on would have liked to see more scenes with scientists and teller the movie had way too many supporting characters who only appear for a scene or two the more abstract scenes and the internal struggle part fel more interesting than seeing the same board room meeting again nolan always had an exposition problem but now he turned his entire movie into exposition and i dont feel like that solved anything,2023-07-24 17:59:45
"the comments make me think that a lot of people paid to watch a three hour movie and all they wanted to see was a bomb go off 

i thought it was 910 amazing performances score visuals i don’t mind long movies so no issue there the intro scene with the prometheus quote and the finale were gripping as well as the test scene i thought the sanskrit  scene was silly i also didn’t like the fast edits and cuts it was faster paced than a typical nolan film but i understand why it had to be otherwise it would’ve been five hours long",2023-07-25 19:56:52
this is one of nolan’s movies that i think was hurt by the nonlinearity of the story felt forced in just because nolan feels obligated to do so,2023-08-07 16:14:20

"completely blown away by the movie avoided all the traps i thought itd fall into and went way further than i thought

i recently went through both the making of the atomic bomb american prometheus and some feynman books for good measure and holy wow did they get so much right so much dialogue is taken exactly out of actual quotes and any artistic liberties  events shuffled around more or less still capture the history eg it wasnt kitty that refused to shake tellers hand but robert christy at some other event even got feynman and his friggin bongos i almost feel like youre missing out if you havent gotten more background with the books before going into the movie like being to able to point out individual scientists and other characters and what role they played in making the bomb and the hearings",2023-07-21 05:47:41
"aside from a slight dip of momentum at perhaps the 70 mark a bit after the test the film felt overall wellpaced thoroughly enjoyed it 

performances were excellent allaround it was actually matt damon and alden ehrenreich that surprised the most the former being so ubiquitous but he managed to quickly disappear into the role of groves an at times jocular but mostly nobs personality that demonstrates managerial competence the latter making the most of this postsolo opportunity and selling the evolution of his alarmed understanding of strausss actual motivations

movie was also a relatively light r the scenes with jean are few and not that explicit the scene with him reading the quote to her during intimacy is not as absurd as it sounded mainly because he himself is apparently wondering is she really doing this as it starts before cutting to the next scene his imagined effects of the bomb were not very vividly shown either that and an fword iirc from kitty and thats about it for rating purposes

finally the bomb sequence was exquisitely presented but was treated as the midpoint of greater political machinations and hbombs that came before and after looking forward to seeing it again",2023-07-22 23:57:02

"another absolute stunner from christopher nolan the only annoying thing was the fact that some dialogues are so difficult to hear i watched it yesterday and found certain parts challenging to comprehend  not just the discussions about neutrons and protons

sound effects and soundtrack were beautiful and amazing but i always feel a bit slightly disregarded when i cant clearly hear the dialogue in a film 

its a masterpiece and a 910 but i just ask for clearer audio on dialogues on nolans movies hahah",2023-07-23 16:22:28

does anyone have any thoughts on how oppenheimer was brought down by his own countrymen after such an achievement felt to me as if nolan was hammering home how the american government dont want there to be any real superstars out there and that at the end of the day the government are always the top dogs,2023-07-26 22:02:20
"i saw it in imax and was mostly able to make out the dialogue

the one scene i couldnt get that i really wanted to was when oppenheimer and the more menschy jewish guy i think met heisenberg

did heisenberg say or insinuate something sinister it felt like he did this being germany shortly before the  takeover but i couldnt make it out

i just got that oppenheimer was homesick and wanted to go back to new mexico",2023-07-26 22:31:43

"the movie was gorgeous in 70mm imax but im pretty sure it gave me hearing loss i finished it 4h ago and im still nursing a headache way too loud in my theater and yet at the same time half of the dialogue was unintelligible for a lot of the movie i only got the vibe of the oppenheimer hearings and scenes with strauss but hardly had any idea what they were actually talking about

it also felt like a very nolan film the man really hates to tell a story in sequence most of the characters are exposition vessels but the imagery the depiction of anxiety the scenes with einstein oppenheimers inner conflict are all very well rendered",2023-08-02 22:33:14
lucky enough to live a short drive from one of the handful of places showing it in 70mm and managed to go yesterday morning it was my first time seeing the film so i dont know how it actually compares to a standard showing but when i think about other filmgoing experiences ive had i really think seeing it in a massive format added something to the experience at least for me yeah its a lot of people sitting around rooms talking but i was completely taken in it grabbed my attention long before los alamos and i was so thoroughly enthralled that by the time it ended i honestly wasnt expecting it to be over and was amazed that three hours had gone by the fact that the movie jumps around a lot and seemingly has a nearconstant score probably helps keep the sense of momentum on this front its been a day and so much of it still sticks with me,2023-08-03 01:18:16
was i an idiot for thinking that the oppenheimer private questioning and strauss public conference thing was happening at the same time completely missed that the strauss stuff happened in subsequent years until i read these comments,2023-08-06 05:18:52
"going into this i knew about the security clearance hearings but not about stross towards the end i was really worried stross had gotten away with leading that witchhunt 

so happy that he didnt was also happy to read on wikipedia that what he did to oppenheimer followed him and teller for the rest of their careers and stross in particular remained bitter about it until the day he died",2023-08-07 04:29:06

one of the best films ive ever seen have watched it twice and cant wait to see it again on bluraydigital,2023-08-18 12:03:11
"so the good top notch acting great dialogue and the themes of creating the bomb and the fallout after that also the complex character study of oppenheimer himself

the bad still sound mixing issues and dialogue was difficult to hear over the music at times trinity test was massively underwhelming i think im no longer a fan of nolans nonlinear stroy gimmick it was more frustrating to me than adding to the movie

overall id give it an 810",2023-09-10 13:29:40
"the ending not only leaves you with a profound sense of wonder at what the filmmakers achieved with the narrative and technical aspects but also with a concern that the trauma oppenheimer experienced in view of the impact of the work he pioneered can be much much worse with each passing day now that there thousands of nuclear weapons in existence

x200b

apart from that i think the really tragic thing in this movie was the way einsteins predicition came to pass in the end  and murphy staring at the pond after his talk with him suggests that somehwere at the back of his mind he always knew that what his colleague said was true 

never felt like going for a break while watching it which for a 3hour movie feels strange others might say that the film works despite majority of it being people sitting around in small rooms talking but i say i came here precisely for that it was like watching a faithful adaptation of asimovs foundation 

for me a 910",2023-11-17 21:38:19
"ive been meaning to post a comment on here for a while but  what a movie

almost everything about it was great especially in the cinematography music and acting departments the quality in those three aspects was off the charts

i really liked that they took a more personal approach delving into oppenheimers life and the toll these events took on him and those around them it really put me in their shoes and allowed me to really understand their perspectives it also made the actual bombings feel almost more impactful since simply just hearing about it would be how most people around the world learned of them

as for criticismsissues i have they are very few  
 i wouldve liked to see the characters a bit more fleshed out since i couldnt really connect with some of them

 i think towards the end there are a few points that felt a bit slow but even then i dont really take much of an issue with that since i completely understand why they were slower and couldnt have been paced any faster

 my biggest criticism is definitely the actual test explosion or at least how it looked visually i get nolan isnt a huge fan of cgi but i feel like using it here wouldve made the scene better because the actual explosion felt kinda underwhelming and with it being part of one of the movies most pivotal moments it sort of detracts from the movie a bit imo everything else about the test sequence scenes was great though

those are basically all of my notable critiques

overall oppenheimer is a  fine piece of cinema and one of my favourite movies of the year 910",2023-12-07 00:17:29
saw this right after barbie and it was just amazing the scene after the bomb was dropped on hiroshima when oppenheimer is succumb to the enormous guilt and thoughts of the lives taken by the bomb is just astounding the mix of cheering and hollow screams as he finds the words to share with these people that adore him for something so horrible,2023-07-21 12:16:29
i still cant get over how good downey was certainly was critical of his tony stark schtick by the end of the mcu run but eating crow big time he played such a great role in this movie,2023-07-21 14:22:26
i hear everyone saying they were bored after the trinity explosion but some of the best acting in the film occured after that oppenheimers life was very complex and he was extremely vilified after trinity so there was no real way to sugarcoat that entire aspect of his life he pretty much spent his entire life after trinity trying to absolve himself from what happened so im not sure what people were expecting after the blast happened in the movie,2023-07-21 20:12:50
cant stand how omnipresent the score is in this as it is in most nolan films i guess its a great score but man turn it down during some dialogue ,2023-07-22 13:03:26
"this movie is a testament to the importance of and artistry behind sound design

i don’t think a scene in a drama has ever made me feel as disgusted as the people cheering and celebrating after learning a bomb they helped create murdered so so many innocent people i’ve seen comments of people upset that the japanese people affected by the atrocities weren’t featured but i think it’s almost more powerful to show that the only way oppenheimer was made to feel remorse was to imagine the impact he had in hiroshima and nagasaki on his own people oppenheimer never saw the direct consequences of his actions in japan to my knowledge he never even visited hiroshima or nagasaki 

also to see that would have been too much even for a movie like this 

i do agree that there could have been a place in the movie for the local hispano populations of new mexico and the devastation the testing in los alamos caused

overall i was a huge fan of the cinematography which felt especially refreshing for me after watching the recent mission impossible visual effects sound design and soundtrack 

the ending felt poignant and the movie was as horrifying and unsettling as a movie like this needs to be",2023-07-22 15:07:55
i’m not sure how a movie can be so thrilling and boring at the same time but here we are i kept wanting to look at my watch after the trinity test,2023-07-22 17:34:57
gonna be honest their where so many big actors playing tiny parts that everytime i saw them it took me out of the movie like anyone could’ve been cast to play half of the scientists and it wouldn’t of made me go “oh look it rami malek and josh from drake and josh”,2023-07-22 21:49:40
simultaneously a cinematic masterpiece and a depressing introspection of mankinds propensity for destruction i need a drink,2023-07-22 22:01:45
"im always a little hesitant to contribute to huge movie threads like this one that already has 8k comments but might as well add my two cents for posterity

this film is an absolute technical masterpiece but strangely i dont feel it quite lived up to the hype at least the hype i had built up in my own mind nolan is obviously a master and made sure that everyone involved with his film is the absolute best at what they do along with the direction it had fantastic acting from everyone shoutout to benny safdie oscarworthy cinematography from hoyte another great score from ludwig solid vfx and almost perfect editing 

like many other modern movies i felt it was a touch too long the third act felt more like an epilogue and it started to drag when the kangaroo court and strauss confirmation hearing was being wrapped up if the run time was condensed to around 230 or even 240 i think it wouldve made a world of difference 

i think nolan did a great job of balancing who oppenheimer was as a person with the significance of what he was called to do i also really liked how he constantly kept asking the moral questions behind the manhattan project without lecturing the audience at least until the very end and even then only a bit i personally wouldve liked to hear more of the science and the technical struggles that went on as an analogue i really liked the scenes in hidden figures and first man when we saw about how challenges presented themselves and how the team overcame them

regardless of my mostly minor gripes this movie delivered in almost every way and left me very satisfied  id put this nolan entry squarely in the middle of the pack of his oeuvre   810",2023-07-22 22:51:54

well my barbenheimer weekend is complete and holy  oppenheimer i’ve never had a 3 hour movie fly by like that the pacing and underscoring were incredible just so so good,2023-07-23 22:22:33
"for such a long film with almost zero breathing room when it comes to a constant barrage of narrative information i left the theatre baffled by how little information there is when it comes to character motivation

why did teller turn on oppenheimer when it was oppenheimer who stood up for him in front of the other scientists repeatedly why did borden accept the role in producing that accusatory letter when he himself wasnt shown being involved with the whole affair previously whats in it for him is strauss motivation and hence the whole third act really just a result of that single radioisotope event strauss even went as far as recruiting oppenheimer initially so clearly he admired him

this is all from just viewing the film itself im sure you could get better understanding from actually reading up the history but — that defeats the point of a biopic no",2023-07-24 00:52:44
"this movie was just a little too long for me considering how ridiculously uncomfortable the imax theater seats were holy  like leaning against metal the whole time

everything was awesome but i was a bit disappointed in the actual nuclear test there were quite  a few scenes that looked very good but almost all the shots used looked like completely different blasts there was a wide shot where it was clear it was a very small explosion and another where the fireball was really weird and skinny i dont know the whole editing showcase of that scene felt really off and i personally think that cgi would have been a better alternative it simply didnt look like the trinity test at all and its not like it would have been impossible to recreate considering the nature of that nuclear explosion

other than that and some really strange  scenes it was awesome",2023-07-25 00:53:36
"did anyone not like it   


i personally did not like the nonlinear structure of the film  the way that nolan tried to spin strausss betrayal as suspense was lackluster and offputting  firstly the structure really just made the trial lack buildup practically the last ten minutes or so is where things unfold haphazardly almost trying to piece together a copout climactic surprise villain ending then thematic suspense  is just offputting for what it was trying to do create a complex view of oppenheimer by the end he was just doing spielbergs school of heroes vs villain strauss very bad man oppenheimer complex but mostly good its too simplified for comfort the use of time could have been more effective in showing the change that the film aims to show with oppenheimers view of the bomb to be honest 

it had more success in telling the pretrial oppenheimer i think its much more successful in creating the enigma of oppenheimer you could see him weak uncompromising a bit psychotic and just a tad bit hypocritical i felt that some portion can be edited down clearly especially the communist period or the prealamo days which was while important in the trial does not really hold any weight once told verbally it is what it is people he had knew the relationship between his wife and him could have been the better choice to focus on  the three hours is not entirely necessary for the film to be honest   


otherwise the  film is marvelous and wellcrafted i think cillian emily blunt matt damon and safdie were noteworthy in the film the story could definitely had be tweaked 35",2023-07-25 06:13:39
"overall so good

my fav parts

 score was fantastic and did an amazing job building up and creating the feeling of anxiety and dread that this movie succeeded at instilling me with
 the lewis strauss reveal

my least fav parts

 small nitpick but was oppy his reallife nickname something about it throws me off so bad every time i hear it
 the bhagavad gita quote this disappointed me because i didnt expect to be said while he was literally boinking and only for the now i am become death the destroyer of worlds i was expecting the full excerpt to be said and done in a moment of reflection rather than a pseudoserious  scene my naive brain thought they mightve actually shown the real video but that probably wouldnt happen nonetheless the bhagavad gita scene was a bit tasteless for my preference

910 film for me maybe even 95 maybe even 10",2023-07-26 02:57:28
"after seeing it again im more frustrated with people saying it should have explored more of the impact on japan and the people this was an oppenheimer biopic not a ww2 movie 

the whole point was not the consequences of the nuclear bomb that went off in japan but the consequences of nuclear bombs just existing and i think they explored that perfectly incredible ending and its still 55 for me",2023-07-28 20:50:47

the trinity test scene is what film was made for,2023-07-31 00:21:31
"i just watched it something like two hours ago
one of the best movies ive watched 
and i watched a lot of movies  i left the theatre stunned everything was perfect the casting the writing the filming itself the script
im really glad i went to see this movie",2023-08-01 22:27:12
"fantastic movie though a bit long and the audio mixing between the dialog and everything else was kinda off in a few moments as i was having trouble understanding what they were saying it was a suprise to see raimi malek in the movie as well as shiv thomas paranoid schizophrenic i was hoping they would incorporate oppenheimers i am become death speech and the first time they used it was interesting

but  that ending is haunting",2023-08-04 01:21:48
yo guys what did oppenheimer say to kitty when they first meet because he had cooked up the most unforgettable physics rizz i have ever heard,2023-08-04 11:33:08
"i didnt look at the cast beforehand so i had a blast recognizing some of my favorite actors

it was crazy to me how benny safdie nailed that role so well with the accent and all i was thinking theres no way it could be him but then i thought who tf else looks like that no one

i didnt even recognize robert downey jr when i saw strauss so that is pretty crazy loved matt damons performance emily blunt killed it too but really everyones acting was perfect",2023-08-05 01:38:03
maybe its just me but did some people find the dialogue hard to hear at points especially with the music in the background,2023-08-08 06:26:47
"saw this last night and loved it im neither a fan or hater of nolan but i do like his movies so i knew i would at least like this one but it really hit all the right buttons for me i was honestly surprised at how much i loved it i went in thinking okay incredibly stacked cast but its three hours long and from what i hear lots of talking im prepared to be impressed but bored and by the time it was over i was thinking that was incredible and i cant wait to watch it again i went on cheap night at my local theatre it was packed lots of weird energy people fidgeting being really loud for the first 1520 minutes but within a half hour the whole theatre was silent and i didnt see one person walk out or even go to the washroom on the way out everyone was talking about now much they loved it just overhearing those conversations is one of the things i love about going to the movies sharing those moments with strangers  

performances were all top notch cillian was incredible shoe in for at least a best actor nomination still too early to call that and it was so nice to see robert downey jr doing interesting work again not knocking the mcu but it feels like hes been iron man for the last decade or so and he really nailed his role benny safdie was a nice surprise too loved him in good time emily blunt was really great too no weak links in the cast in my opinion  

still wrapping my head around it all and reading reviews from more eloquent folks and even some very valid criticism any film that starts discussion is good in my books",2023-08-10 02:00:52
saw it in 70mm imax in indy today theatre was absolutely full what a delight,2023-08-18 00:15:11
just rewatched it in imax 70mm and wow what an experience it was on that massive screen still great enjoyed it my second viewing although i definitely am looking forward to it going on digital for captions,2023-09-01 02:15:14
 man the old make up at the end was ,2023-11-10 15:28:10
im glad i didnt watch this in imax it was a decent enough movie in my opinion but i was honestly disappointed by the bomb scene the actors were great it was just a pretty muddled story,2023-11-23 23:15:39
i gotta say i was bored to  but somehow also stressed because of the unrelenting tense music score  i can see that it is very well done but i just simply cannot enjoy a movie this dialogue heavy   i would have preferred to watch a historical documentary  imagining people who enjoy barbie trying to watch this right after is hilarious to me,2023-12-07 13:57:25
"for the trinity test i was getting ready to hear possibly the loudest sound i have ever heard

and it was the exact opposite and i was not disappointed",2023-07-21 04:50:17
it was so silent in my theatre when the bomb went off you could’ve heard a mouse  on cotton,2023-07-21 08:22:08
the scene where the prosecutor was yelling and asking about his “morals” and he responded with something about each side continuing to build atom bombs and that somehow didn’t apply to hydrogen bombs i was not following that scene at all can someone explain it please,2023-07-21 19:12:42

"i went to an 11pm screening last night 

its not often a film finishes and i sit there as the credits roll with nothing to say its nearly 12 hours later and im still not sure what to say about it

i do know that this may have been the most engaged and invested in a film i have been for a long time i know the oppenheimer story i know the bomb works but i was still sat there on edge waiting to see if it worked or not

the performance from all the actors was top notch i knew cillian murphy would be amazing but he surpassed my already high expectations

i am already planning to watch it again soon to hopefully appreciate the story more",2023-07-22 08:29:50

i liked it it could have been 30 minutes shorter and it did have some dialog issues that most nolan films have i thought the acting standout was easily emily blunt shes not in it a lot but when she is she steals the scenes,2023-07-22 13:04:00

barbenheimer absolutely murdered me watched barbie first and loved it but the movie alone already gave me that feeling oppenheimer just amplified it the movie was absolutely brilliant and intense and i couldn’t tell you which part i loved the most really don’t think i’m going to the theatre anytime soon i may just hold out till dead reckoning part 2,2023-07-23 03:20:02
“you don’t get to commit the sin then make everyone feel sorry for you when you suffer the consequences” is such an awesome and relevant through line,2023-07-23 03:27:14
got inglorious basterds vibes when casey affleck came on screen told cillian to  when he started prodding more,2023-07-23 03:46:46
as a physicist well biophysicist but still this movie felt like nolans love letter to science so many little details about scientists in there showing their fragile egos their tribalistic nature their petty squabbles yet ability to band together loved it loved all the cameos bethe feynman godel alvarez szilard and so on but i do wonder for someone not super into science history or not a scientist how much of any these would you catch feels very specific lol,2023-07-23 04:17:04
my theory is oppenheimer is the main villain in the story even though strauss has personal vendetta against oppenheimer i believe it was tried to be portrayed as true when he says oppenheimer would build the bomb without thinking again knowing everything to be the most important man oppenheimer feels guilty but does the guilt overtakes his desire to be the center of attention nolan doesn’t make it clear maybe intentionally,2023-07-23 07:55:37
ik the movie has split opinions but i simply cant get get the movie out of my head and the main reason i keep coming back to this thread is how engaged i was throughout the runtime plus its interesting to see the different views,2023-07-23 12:32:26
someone in my viewing giggled at the “stripes were embedded in their skin from their clothing” i’m paraphrasing i thought it was a disgusting thing to laugh at and makes me wish that they showed the after effects of the bombs in japan i’m glad they didn’t have a scene of the bombing itself but it would be interesting to have more of the after effects shown to truly portray the horror of the bomb and to shut up those who laugh at it,2023-07-23 13:09:59
loved the movie please can someone explain why the last 3rd of film was important ie the trial that wasnt a trial to  oppenheimer of his security clearance was it losing that security clearance really so terribly devastating to oppenheimer  more devastating than witnessing the horror he had unleashed i really struggle to understand the directors intention did it give our emotions a bit of a pause before the anguish of the final scene with einstein so may lives ruined by mcarthyism that oppenheimer losing his clearance was not exceptional,2023-07-23 16:22:08
sorry if this has been discussed and i just missed it but the part during the break in the security hearing where oppenheimer and rabi are in the hall and oppenheimer is eating the orange what happened in the interaction with ernest lawrence i didn’t understand that,2023-07-23 16:54:50
what im learning is that alden ehrenreich thrives in 1950s period pieces about mccarthyism and the red scare,2023-07-23 17:04:42
alden ehrenreich was great in this i still think its scummy how lord and miller threw him under the bus by blaming their dysfunctional solo set on his acting at least through the press,2023-07-23 20:03:56
"i have to rewatch it i enjoyed it but i feel like i missed a lot the constant cutting back and forth between time periods plethora of actors accents characters…it was really hard to follow for me plus the dialogue was hard to hear sometimes the background was so loud

good movie though",2023-07-23 22:34:11
there’s something funny about the fact to me that josh nichols set off the bomb,2023-07-24 04:45:23
"i find it really interesting how oppenheimer was probably inspired in his work by art with the scene of the picasso painting probably under the desire that his work would be seen or compared to art

only to realise that throughout the film his work was used for destruction and death",2023-07-24 07:23:55
rarely have i seen a movie where i’m still thinking about it incessantly the next day  the amount of research i’ve done on oppenheimer nuclear weapons and the decision making surrounding dropping them it’s crazy to think the bombs were built to drop on the nazis but japan just held out longer i’ve seen criticisms here about how the film rushed through scenes and didn’t provide enough exposition but i love how nolan had enough faith in his audience to not walk them through basic ww2 history and provide a detailed account on one of the most important events in history the guy that made it happen and the morality layers surrounding it both a beautiful cinematic experience and an important history lesson,2023-07-24 13:49:33
"overall i thought the movie was excellent and powerful the ending where it’s revealed what was said between einstein and oppenheimer was chilling my nitpicks would be that i thought the film should have shown less of the strauss hearings and more of the manhattan project in a movie with so much dialogue i’m surprised they didn’t show the demon core incident that occurred during the manhattan project it was a frightening event that cost the lives of multiple scientists 

i thought the sound design was excellent and most of the actors nailed their roles the one other nitpick is the trinity bomb test  i thought it was a little underwhelming  i even thought the bomb in indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull looked better in some aspects even though there isn’t much footage of the original trinity explosion there is still so much other existing footage of nuclear tests preserved in great quality in fact there is excellent footage of the first soviet nuclear explosion which was of a similar design and yield to the trinity bomb 

i appreciate they achieved the trinity test without cgi but maybe they could’ve touched it up with a little cgi and made it something special plus i don’t remember seeing a shockwave which is an identifiable part of a nuclear blast in general i thought there should’ve been more shots and angles of the testmaybe an aerial view 

anyway i really liked the movie it’s not an especially fun movie but it’s an important movie that is still relevant to this very day the threat of nuclear war has never gone away so it’s something we still and will likely always live with 

my rating 910",2023-07-24 21:20:53
i sat through that whole movie not knowing that oppies best friend was josh hartnett like when did he become a middle aged man with pushed back hair and not a 90s teen with pushed forward hair,2023-07-25 03:46:09
it’s was a great film honestly but honestly the intimate scene caught me off guard  i was sitting next to my grandma and trying to look away the film shows a lot of seriousness but has to nice tenderness in it,2023-07-25 17:27:56
who knew oppenheimer had so much rizz,2023-07-25 19:22:27
"i havent been able to stop thinking of this movie since seeing it yesterday nolan has always been very hit or miss with me but i liked this a lot i look forward to seeing it again when it gets released for streaming hello subtitles 

comes up a tad short of great but man very very good",2023-07-25 19:39:18
"i am a fan of great acting 

therefore i loved this movie",2023-07-25 19:42:17
"saw it for a second time tonight this time in 35mm at my local indie theater first time i saw it was on xenon imax on a screen like 8 times larger but vastly preferred the 35mm print the colors especially in the explosions was so much more vibrant and on the whole seemed sharper

 it was pretty cool that the projectionist came down and introduced herself to everyone and talked a bit about how they had to modify the projection room to accept the 1 hour reels compared to the normal 20 minute reels they usually get and the fun fact that we got the very last 35mm print made of the film

shout out to the roxy in missoula grateful to have a theater thats committed to keeping analog projectors going and training inhouse projectionists",2023-07-26 07:17:08
why did they have two words pop up on screen wary on like 01 fission but then never again seemed odd,2023-07-26 15:25:38
anyone else get a there will be blood vibe from the mahatten project scenes thats why im kind of baffled at the complaints about this film its a specific type of movie thats been made before its unique to nolans work sure but not cinema in general,2023-07-27 15:15:05
"some of the scenes like the speech in the auditorium picking which cities to bomb the truman scene they still make me feel like im about to be sick thinking back to them 

i was familiar with oppenheimers life roughly to the extent the movie presents it so nothing was a surprise i have strong opinions regarding the subject matter but the way the movie captures the gravity of the story had me reflect on it on a much deeper level

yes theres bizarre technical and editing decisions but overall i think everything works not sure if i can properly judge it yet maybe in about a couple of days maybe never if a movies job is to make you feel things you havent yet its done its job and maybe thats enough 

should not be seen on the same day as barbie for anyone still wondering if they should honor the meme both movies deserve to be seen on their own days bring earplugs to oppenheimer just in case the dialogue is way too harsh at times in imax but the batman and dune werent much better for me so im giving nolan a pass for once",2023-07-27 15:55:34
for how loud the movie is it’s amazing that i couldn’t hear some of the dialogue throughout the movie need some subtitles for this movie for sure,2023-07-27 21:32:30
"can anyone explain they managed to have 2 more atomic bombs that they dropped on japan made so soon after the trinity test

they made a point with bowls and marbles how hard and long of a process it is to get enough enriched uranium and plutonium to make a single bomb for trinity test they have been gathering materials for that one for years

mistake or did i miss something thanks",2023-07-28 05:41:42
"i saw this movie last night loved it and i’m currently bedbound with fever nausea fatigue and loss of appetite

the obvious conclusion is that seeing this movie in imax has given me radiation sickness

nolan is a genius are there any lengths he won’t go to for cinematic immersion",2023-07-28 18:25:20
"i was actually entranced with the movie for the most part and it was visually and emotionaly stimulating

i think the first 13 of the movie had me trying to keep pace it was a little overwhelming trying to keep track of the many characters we were bouncing to and fro the timeline was a bit of a struggle but it got better at the end

i think my lack of knowledge had me confused for specific aspects of the film i didnt really know about the hydrogen bomb and the robert downey jr trial aspect or couldnt keep up with it this film definitely made me interested to read up more and the moral complications of the subject at hand was fascinating",2023-07-31 15:18:45
"walked out of the theater a few hours ago and cant stop thinking about it my perspective may be a bit affected by having finished the book just last week overall i thought it was an extraordinary capturing of an indescribably complicated brilliant person he was a mountain of contradictions  loyal to a fault to his friends and devoted to his wife but chronically unfaithful ethically driven yet morally ambivalent passionate when advocating for anything or anyone but himself expressing an intensely shy demeanor combined with remarkable charisma that inspired others sophisticated in his thinking and then profoundly naive sometimes downright inexplicable in his actions  there is only so much a movie can portray of such a remarkable life even so i believe it did an excellent job of not only showing the person how context and politics and values informed decisions that were made and the rapid evolution of physics during those times

i will definitely see it again im certain there is a lot i missed due to how deftly some of the critical moments were portrayed such as the one with colonel pash i do think more could have been done with the personal aftermath of the security clearance hearings i also think the focus on his offon relationship with jean tatlock while relevant to his alleged communist ties and his unfaithful nature ultimately sacrificed too much screen time when we could have learned the same things and more by understanding his relationship with kitty who also had strong communist ties and with whom he spent 27 years",2023-08-03 00:44:38
question how did david hill know that it was lewis strauss who was reason behind oppie not getting his security clearance and how was his testimony enough for us senate to not to appoint him as the secretary of commerce,2023-08-05 21:04:15
just watched the movie andits alright not the best from nolan and not one of the best movies made but it shows a decent view into manhattan project and whole political view from oppenheimer perspective now onto the subject where the movie lacked the most and what i expected to see the bomb only once do we see the detonation of atomic bomb and it was during the experiment the hiroshima bomb detonation from someones perspective never happened and that is a big miss not even the plane view or public perspective im not talking about something like terminator 2 nuclear apocalypse but something in that direction would have had more devastating effect on audience to actually see and realize the horror that happened its a movie and the fact that we only heard about it on radio and later on we see few perspectives from people celebrating to people puking from the effect of what the bomb did just did not feel enough in my opinion from that point on it went into political views and to be real with you i didnt care much about it,2023-11-22 19:37:01
"i’m not really a fan of nolan because of his sound design and editing but if there was a film that the style worked it is this one this is easily one of his top 3 films for me along with memento and the prestige

best picture winner over all the other nominees i’m not sure there were great performances throughout and the pacing and dialogue didn’t really suffer till the last hour after the clear climax being the trinity test and the bombs being dropped in japan

great lines at the end “maybe they were talking about something more important” and “i believe we did”",2024-03-17 17:28:26
"strauss main motivation being revenge for oppenheimer humiliating him made their whole conflict seem trivialthe humiliation should have been the final straw that pushed strauss over the edge not basically his whole motivation

oppenheimers rejection of judaismmarrying a gentilehinduism his narcissism and self importance awful conduct in his personal life all these would have greatly enhanced his conflict with strauss 

theyre were plenty of other ways nolan could have taken it and he went for the weakest one

also that kennedy john f kennedy line was corny as ",2023-07-21 18:10:16
"it was decent certainly not the worst thing ive seen but not terribly memorable to be honest it felt like one of those generic biopicww2 thrillers we get every couple years like the imitation game or the darkest hour the academy loves these movies

i think it was a mistake to give so much screen time to the strausshearing stuff especially so early on it just felt like it was weighing down what could have been a tight sharp story about oppenheimers early life and the manhattan project maybe have one scene where we see his clearance has been revoked to make the point about how america chews up and spits out people to serve its own ends its a good point to make but you dont need sooo many scenes about it it just makes the movie feel flabby

theres a really solid 40 mins or so right in the middle where the film gets focused and linear as they lead up to the trinity test thats when the film is strongest but the rest is edited so quickly that you dont get to know or care about any of these people and the nonlinear editing just feels like a gimmick to make people think the movie is really dynamic and exciting 

the score is great but jesus it just keeps going it just goes and goes and goes over every scene and every line of dialogue that combined with the fast editing makes the whole movie feel like a long movie trailer every bit of tension in this movie is created by the music

i dont know i just didnt feel like i took anything special away from this movie james cameron scared the absolute  out of us with that nuke scene in terminator 2 that still haunts my thoughts to this day i didnt think this movie even came close to that kind of dread so then whats the point to highlight mccarthyism i dont know",2023-07-24 23:35:41
"movie was great technically but i feel like the story didnt benefit from being told out of order at all the whole strauss plotline isnt really related to the main conflict of oppenheimers opposition to the further development of the hydrogen bomb and his antagonistic intention is some childish teenage vendetta which undercuts the heavy subject matter

teller wouldve been a far better primary antagonist and theres no need to do the whole twist reveal at the end teller was portrayed to have always been interested in pushing the technology to its limits and that he was opposed with oppenheimer in their views",2023-07-30 12:18:12
"i think this has to be in the top 3 for nolan films for me

for a 3 hour dialogue heavy film where the majority of the scenes are men in rooms just talking it did not feel like a slog whatsoever

oppenheimers visions and then anxietyptsd was incredibly well done as well as the audio to go with them",2023-08-04 14:55:54
the way they used jean tatlock to eroticize the krishna line really grossed me out completely made up and it just made me cringe to think of the writer using a reallife woman to play out some kind of fantasy to make that line sexier,2023-08-28 08:55:03
gary oldman is the king of making me not realize hes in a movie until someone else points it out what an actor,2023-11-10 05:56:51
nolan thinking cgi is a dirty trick used by commoners really let down the test scene they really should have either not shown the explosion just the reaction lights and shock wave or used cgi because jesus that was distracting everyone knows what a mushroom cloud looks like,2023-11-13 09:03:21

"the first time we hear the line now i am become death the destroyer of worlds is when cillian murphy and florence pugh take a break from 

oh nolan",2023-07-21 12:55:54
"truly a masterpiece contrary to what some people say i believe the film was quite fastpaced a bit too fastpaced as i found it hard to keep up with things in the story everything came nicely together in the end though 

the cast was absolutely perfect and i loved every performance cillian murphy and rdj deserve an oscar nomination their performances were masterful benny safdie matt damon and emily blunt also performed amazingly 

the buildup to the trinity test was literally breathtaking and the nuke itself was also really well done but the last two minutes impacted me the most seeing oppenheimer’s vision of the future and the fact that we are closer to nuclear war than ever before just terrified me and the way it was shot together with ludwig’s music and cillian’s traumatized eyes made it even scarier the film also serves as a warning for what could happen let’s hope oppenheimer’s vision won’t come true any time soon",2023-08-15 18:30:07
"i didnt hate it but parts of the movie felt like a montage and others like reading a transcript biopics fall into this trap of becoming lifeaction wikipedia pages and oppenheimer did that a little though not entirely the trinity test was the docking scene of the film though and it was great seeing it in the theater and most of it was actually audible though during one scene someone in the theater did ask what did she say because emily blunt whispered something in her british accent

also it was cool to see senator pat leahy who cameod in almost every liveaction batman movie and was the longestserving democrat in the senate when he retired earlier this year get special thanks in the credits i wonder if he helped with the senate scenes

edit correction about leahy",2023-07-21 02:27:11
"just watched it some thoughts

1 im glad i watched it at home and didnt go to imax

2 i dont find anything particularly rememberable from the movie apart from the soundtrack

3 i dont know the point of the movie i dont think it added any value to film

4 it was well made as can be expected from nolan but it wasnt for me

edit 24 hours later i reached this conclusion

nolan and others may have found oppenheimers story a very compelling one but the movie maybe did not capture what he found so compelling i am not able to figure out what his motivation for making this movie was i feel the movie was straightforward like dunkirk and unlike other films like inception or tenet but like dunkirk i found it to be a film with high production quality but low entertainment value for a casual watcher",2024-02-17 15:40:09
seeing it in 70mm was  insane,2023-07-21 03:50:57
"honestly i personally felt the pacing was a bit too quick for the first half hour or so the last half hour does a good job looking back and does help give more context to the scenes but the entire first act kind of felt like a prologue that never ends with how quick it moves

jean especially was just funny to me a minute talk  sanskrit dirty talk she had 5 minutes of screen time and half of it had her  out

i love the film overall though that opening pace aside einstein was amazing",2023-07-21 20:12:04
"excellent all around i read surely youre joking mr feynman over the past week in anticipation of seeing this movie and im glad i did the inclusion of  turning down the sunglasses because the cars windshield blocking the uv was a nice easter egg 

something i noticed but was surprised with was how much background soundmusic there was the silence really felt silent because there wasnt much of it very happy that the sound mixing was good though i did not struggle to hear the characters at all",2023-07-21 23:43:34

"its a great movie but ill definitely rewatch this once it hits digital

i have 0 knowledge on who oppenheimer was before the movie and i wasnt fully able to understand whats going on  during the 1st hour of the movie i had a hard time understanding what the characters were saying

i only understood it right after the 1st successful testing",2023-07-22 14:18:10
man that dude with the bongos at los alamos seemed like a super cool dude that probably could have explained some of the physics for us in a simple and relatable way oh maybe  he could have had some comic relief scenes or something about the whole security thing going on like maybe it turned out he liked to pick all the locks for fun or something and oppey and matt damon are like whos the spy but it was bongo guy the whole time classic bongo guy,2023-07-22 23:18:03
"feel like this is far and away nolans best written work 

i think its last third or soin which strauss machinations are revealed is the strongest",2023-07-23 03:05:59
"some of the most intense editing i have ever encountered

i watched in a regular theatre i dont think i would have survived the imax version

dont get me wrong it was fantastic i hope oppenheimer wins multiple awards for both sound and visual fx but i have never felt so attacked by a movie its not a feast for the senses its a war

i love the layered story telling aspect in theory stacking the three eras on top of each other and cutting between them letting them do cool things like the interview x  scene where we see the pov shot from the sofa of oppenheimer  in his chair being straddled while answering questions but it did feel a bit jarring at first to be snapping between them even with the bw filter to distinguish strauss scenes

the trinity detonation itself was a superb use of suspense as everyone holds thier breath to wait to enter the atomic age i felt nolan did a fantastic job of showing the holy  factor of what an atomic test never mind the first one would have been like to experience

810 movie gave me a 1000 yard stare",2023-07-23 09:06:39

the last hour of the movie was the best part,2023-07-24 07:38:54
i dont think people realize how important the casting of strauss and kitty had to be and without rdj and emily blunt with those magnificent performance the trial drama would simply not have worked with the trinity test and bombing of japan being the secondary plot to the whole story its absolutely incredible how nolan managed to make the hearing the main part of the whole film and even more incredible how it worked out brilliant,2023-07-24 08:39:10
"there were several places where i was actually thinking during the movie this would be better if there was silence in the background if the music is too much that it takes you out of the movie experience and youre actually thinking about the way the movie was made and audio of the movie  its a problem 

loved the movie but there were times like that where i was just taken out of the experience because of the music it didnt add to it it took away from it i was expecting silence but i got the music their dialog was minimized the impact was minimized not everything needs to have a musical background 

thats less about the movie and more of a christopher nolan movie making complaint the movie itself was very excellent ive read a lot in the past about the subject im probably on some list somewhere and this movie was just the bees knees like a 3 hour long great book to movie loved the political stuff loved the science stuff even though it was minimal loved the characters 

my two complaints arent about the story or the movie itself its the audio and the cast it felt more like a nolan im so big i can get anyone i want in my movies bs big head thing instead of a these people are the best to play this role many of those people didnt need to be there they did well i disagree with some that say damon wasnt good playing groves i thought he did well just no reason for it to be them playing the role their expertise their master skill brought nothing to the role almost like making your star playing the tree in the school play just a waste of a resource they did excellent in their roles but the roles werent there to really showcase what they can do they were there only because he wanted it to be a filled with all the big names movie thats what it felt like to me anyway he could have just had a lot of people come to him and ask to be in it i dont know 

the  scene for the famous quote though come on nolan that was very weak and felt immature really minimized the impact of it all and any background context i rolled my eyes at that scene",2023-07-24 16:25:49

"i just watched it on imax the regular one not 70mm i’ve heard some people complaining about the story being hard to follow and some dialogue being inaudible so naturally i prepared myself a bit by reading stuff on wiki about oppenheimer to familiarize myself

for context english is my second language and currently i am in taiwan so the theatre only have chinese my third language sub available mind you my english is better than my chinese so i decided to just watch it and pretend the sub is not there

anyways here is my take this movie is a nightmare to follow if you are watching it without subtitle this is partially my fault should’ve expected it i am ashamed to say i only know 1 person by their name strauss i am excluding famous scientists like bohr heisenberg etc for the others i just call them as matt damon florence pugh etc i also made up some names like the hydrogen guy the combination of overlapping music quick transitions the sheer amount of characters and the pacing are all just too overwhelming for me

i will have to watch this again with subtitle in order to give a true rating as for now it is 710 for me",2023-07-27 21:14:24
might be making a big deal about it but strauss held a grudge against oppie for having humiliated him and went to these insane lengths to try to destroy his reputation then there was dr hill who i thought oppie was treating very lowly throughout the movie in the scenes with them in it and yet for no reason at all he decided to do the right thing and testify against strauss and help oppenheimer thought that says something about the 2 characters,2023-07-27 21:17:33
there were 10 nobel prize winners in this movie characters of course,2023-07-29 03:24:53
i really liked it and want to learn more about oppenheimer the wwii race for the bomb and the book this movie was inspired by but while watching i found myself missing nolan doing action movies i feel like thats where he shines,2023-07-30 00:08:37
"saw in imax 70mm imax 2nd largest imax screen in america i believe very good but yeah dialogue was a bit difficult to understand at multiple times im also assuming imax audio is a bit bombastic to begin with so that could exaggerate the issues but thats what nolan masters the audio for ideally right since hes such an imax enthiuast

nolan is one of the best filmmakers of all time but how did nolan manage to invent an issue that never existed in cinematic history inaudible dialogue  luckily its no where near as bad as tenet",2023-07-31 00:38:20
the dialogue in the grand turismo trailer before the movie sounded like a dhar mann video with a budget,2023-07-31 18:07:41
at first i was confused why they didn’t show either hiroshima or nagasaki we get oppenheimer’s terrible visions of destruction during his speech after only hearing truman on the radio but if you think about it oppenheimer wouldn’t have needed to see any footage of the bombings he made the bombs he already knew the second he heard about it the level of destruction it caused,2023-08-03 02:37:15
now that ive seen it for myself i am desperate to know how the movie was shot particularly how oppenheimers visualisations of physics were achieved incamera has there been anything about this already,2023-08-05 22:21:40

just saw it for national cinema day and i was struck by the oneliners and comic relief i couldn’t help think i would love to see a comedy directed by nolan just to see what he would do,2023-08-28 17:03:20
"was reminiscing  hearing the can you hear the music track in the cinema for the first time hope i never forget that memory

2023 was special in film",2024-03-13 20:10:48
"just back from seeing this i thought i was going to love it im a big fan of welldone historical realism competence  is my favourite type of film it was ticking all my cinema boxes

but i left feeling underwhelmed given it was 3hrs long there was so much i wanted to have seen that they didnt cover i surprisingly wasnt very invested in any of it i was confused particularly by all the timejumping all over the place i dont know why nolan felt the need to tell the story that way

but the weirdest thing was they didnt show them doing any of the brainy stuff all these scientists the greatest minds of the day doing things no one has ever done before and they didnt show any of it the imitation game was much better hidden figures though obviously tonally different was better when they all cheered after the trinity test worked it fell a bit flat because i had no idea how much work theyd put in because they didnt show it

and i didnt have any sense of the war going on at the same time and the drive to get the bomb made to end the war plus no sense of the discussions that must have happened when  killed himself and germany surrendered before they finished it that must have been a huge shift in momentum but it was glossed over 

it just felt like a 3hr film shouldnt need to gloss over huge issues like this honestly it felt like it even glossed over oppenheimers realisation of how bad the bomb was the speech scene was really well done but that was it and the speech would have been right after the successful bombing he wouldnt have known the effects it would have on people at that point its such a crucial part of the oppenheimer story and yet i didnt get any sense of it only his communist contacts and how they revoked his clearance it felt a really odd place to put the focus of the film 

and for a story that turned out to be more about oppenheimers career path than his scientific brilliance what happened after he lost his clearance why was he given a medal in the end when did he die how did he feel about the arms race when he died not even a bit of text at the end to tell us this stuff",2023-07-23 21:28:35
ill be honest i was a little disappointed but honestly not suprized the movie was less about the actual development of the abob and more about oppenheimer defending himself against communist accusations i would have been more intrigued if we saw more detailed of them coming up with how to build the thing over the years but really its a bunch of talking and next thing we know they are sealing up the gaget and its ready to fire,2023-07-21 04:14:16
one scene that really struck me with its artistic choice was when they were asking oppenheimer about his affair with jean and all of a sudden we see him sitting in the room  what a powerful visual for how he felt in that moment his private life being put out there for all to see and judge him,2023-07-28 16:14:33
"i loved it but i didnt really understand what was going on with the strauss character hes not in the timeline before the trinity test and then afterwards is unhappy because oppenheimer humiliated him in a hearing then does something complicated to cause oppenheimer to be examined in that table hearing then gets found out because another character we havent seen much of reveals his plan in the black and white hearing but without providing evidence

i dont understand what was going on with that i got up to  once and assume i must have missed something i also had a few annoying people around me in the theater which took me out of the movie on occasion because i didnt understand that plot thread the last third of the film dragged for me can anyone explain what the  was going on with the character i know it was to establish whether oppenheimer was a communist sympathizer and whether he should keep his clearance but who was strauss what exactly did he do to cause the hearings and what was the significance of the large black and white hearing where strauss was being questioned",2023-07-21 17:06:25
did anyone else feel the non linear narrative was at times excessive and slightly jarring and detracted from what was essentially a good movie,2023-07-22 09:28:11
"one thing that i really liked about oppenheimer that i think deserves more praise is the usage of the abomb in the film 

entering into the movie youd think that youd see a cinematic reliving of the hiroshima or nagisaki bombings and its effects on japanese citizens naturally doing so would help the audience realize the severity of the bombs creation however not for a split second of film was there any such thing sure the bombings and the damage it had done were briefly mentioned but never did we truly see the bomb actually being used all we saw was the bomb go off during the trinity test 

it being a test which is means it is not at the expense of human life creates a sense of assurance within the audience the previous concerns with the bomb setting off a continuous reaction that could ignite the atmosphere and destroy the world are completely mitigated as people in the current where the bomb clearly did not lead to the end of the world this concern carries deadweight for us the movie also made sure to demonstrate all the safety precautions and preparations made for to the test the culmination of all these factors were meant to create a bomb that the audience could characterize as safe dare i say harmless 

then the bomb goes off a shroom cloud of fire and smoke tremendous and visually stunning the delayed sound of the explosion which whether anticipated or not resonated through all in the theater it was epic to say the least and whether you stared in awe or fear you were shocked speechless and completely stiff i could not only hear but feel the silence of the audience

in the entirety of oppenheimer we only saw one bomb this bomb did not level any buildings this bomb did not destroy a city this bomb did not take any human life this bomb did not leave behind burnt bodies or the shadows of disintegrated humans this bomb did not harm a single soul and yet we all left the theater understanding the impact and catastrophic severity of this bombs creation

thats just insane

everything else the movie did well others have already acknowledged from the cast to the soundtrack to the visuals etc but one thing i felt needed more recognition was the usage of the bomb itself in the movie",2023-07-23 06:14:57
i personally found the movie very relatable as i too would throw it all away for florence pugh,2023-07-23 21:44:59
think quite a lot of people dont realise what a historical drama is a good chunk of my viewing walked out some well before the bomb scene it certainly could do with some trimming but the core concepts are done fantastically well,2023-07-24 23:10:55
"this movie was amazing in every way as someone who works in stem academia it was wildly fascinating seeing the moral quandaries faced by opps young academics physicists it brought a tear to my eye actually 

i only wish it focused more on moral questions he faced as oppenheimer reminds me that history repeats itself i think about fritz haber the jewish chemist who created a nitrogen chemical process to cure famine germany ended up being like “hey he’s a genius let’s ask him to create chlorine gas in ww1 to  american enemies” and he did 

fast forward to ww2 where  ended up using haber’s creation to kills millions of jews in gas chambers haber’s wife ended up killing herself as a result and he never forgave himself 

these moral and ethical questions in science with government involvement is so fascinating to me because i think scientists einstein opps haber etc fell victim to their own genius  how far can i go how far can i discover innovate and by then it’s too late",2023-07-30 00:52:26
that ending is continuing to ring in my head a day after watching the movie,2023-08-01 22:37:30
"review by director oliver stone

saturday i sat through 3 hours of oppenheimer gripped by chris nolan’s narrative his screenplay is layered  fascinating familiar with the book by kai bird  martin j sherwin i once turned the project down because i couldn’t find my way to its essence nolan has found it

his direction is mindboggling  eyepopping as he takes reams of incident and cycles it into an exciting torrent of action inside all the talk each actor is a surprise to me especially cillian murphy whose exaggerated eyes here feel normal playing a genius like oppenheimer


oppenheimer is a classic which i never believed could be made in this climate bravothe movie packs in the essence of the tragedy of oppenheimer a man historically in the middle of an impossible situation though one as nolan shows partly of his own making",2023-08-01 23:45:12
christopher nolan finally learned how to deliver exposition without it sounding out of place and forced mostly  all the complicated conversations felt much more natural then many of the exchanges that happened in tenet,2023-08-05 02:09:37
"the pacing and frequency of cuts started to become confusing very quickly especially cutting randomly between many different time periods i think it would have benefitted from more simple nested framing 

ie   strauss hearing recounting the story of how he set up  oppenheimers hearing recounting the story of oppenheimers life and the manhattan project

x200b

i though many good scenes were cut back to and from too rapidly which diminished them  like many scenes with oppie recruiting scientists planning out the project etc 

x200b

also i couldnt help but feel the trinity test was underwhelming i understand his desire to not use cgi but maybe a little enhancement could have been helpful to showcase the worldchanging scale of the bomb as shown it didnt seem that much bigger than a conventional explosion",2023-08-06 19:44:58
"unlike it’s subject matter this film fizzled out way too bloated with filler material the whole girlfriendmistress dynamic is dull and drags the film the explosion viewed in imax was spectacular though and is the films high point and climax everything else is anti climactic after this and the film loses steam partly due to ‘thrill fatigue’ setting in movie tried too hard to be epic otherwise and just leaves something to be desired but due to stellar effects and the gravity of the subject matter this movie gets somewhat redeemed and i give it a 7310 

overall it seems over rated as fan boys gloss over some of the glaring weaknesses of the film i suspect it will be nominated for many oscars though",2023-08-07 04:28:22
"saw it in 70mm imax and i thought that the build up and tension of the trinity test along with the gymnasium scene and the speech  that whole 2030ish minutes was brilliant from a pacing and audiovisual perspective

i cant help but think if the einstein convo and end shot was right after that how much more impactful that would have been

the strauss thing and the hearings ultimately felt a little too bloated and i think the audience needs to shift themselves tonally into something more of a different genre in the vein of a political thriller for like an hour or something to me that was less compelling at that point in the movie

imagine holding on to the feeling of horror and existential dread and have it crescendo into the credits good movie but there were definitely elements that dragged it",2023-08-08 19:11:26
well you definitely get your moneys worth seeing it on 4 national cinema day lol it does feel long dont really see the need to shell out the imax money for this one though i didnt like nolans last two movies but this one was solid so i guess i got one foot back on the nolan train murphy will probably get his oscar but i didnt really need to see his balls or know how pugh was convinced to go  for it but anyway it did feel almost like two movies between the first 23s and the whole hearing thing in the last act was a bit melodramatic considering it was all about getting security clearance renewed,2023-08-27 20:10:11
"oppenheimer eats a fried egg sandwich the music says oh my  the pathos of life oppenheimer walks down a street the music says behold the majesty of creation oppenheimer wipes his  the music says oh the sweet bitterness of love

"three hours felt like 130 very well directed the premise was not so much to be amazed by the visuals but rather understand the role each person played in this project 

it felt like reading a book 

also rdj did such a great job i was amazed at his difference in acting along with his accent",2023-07-21 21:20:32
"the movie was quite good but i cant say anything blew me away maybe i expected a bit stronger anti war message i think the part that had to do with the bomb was greatly executed but the rest was just decent

feels like there was some weird editing with a tonne of jump cuts like im watching a music video i guess thats the only way to make those endless hearings entertaining

talking about dialogues i feel like nolan just doesnt write great dialogue the lines just sound a bit robotic

movie couldve been shortened by half an hour at least imo

id give it something like 7510 with some more efficient editing it couldve been a 8510",2023-07-21 22:52:51
"the silence as the bomb went off was an exceptional choice 

masterful movie all around rdj truly shines",2023-07-21 23:52:45
"just saw it in imax 1570 my thoughts

positives
 its probably christopher nolans best film but not his most entertaining i would say thats inception objectively its a great piece of filmmaking 
 cillian murphy carries the whole thing and his performance is awesome some of his american accent sounded like robin williams but that just might be me 
 its really welledited and tight if that makes sense nicely paced some of panning shots of new mexico were beautiful 

negatives
 the relationship with emily blunts character kitty was a little halfbaked heres this guy as a known womanizer as the film puts it and all of a sudden he decides to marry a woman he meets at a party for reasons unknown and to top it off she sticks with him through multiple affairs for again unknown reasons and even supports him 
 the actual explosion was a big let down a lot of marketing implied it was spectacular blah blah blah well for being something so terrifying that carried through the entire film it looked a fourth of july demo gone wrong if you watch 4k slow motion videos of the actual trinity test on yt its really scary i didnt feel that in the movie 
 it wasnt necessarily clear who some of the supporting scientists were or what they were working on specifically probably not relevant since the film is about oppenheimer but still some weird choices richard feynman delegated to playing the bongos and nothing more lol

neither positive nor negative
 the image went out 3 times for about 30 seconds to a minute super annoying im guessing my theater used a xenon projector and the current heat in ca caused it to shut off as a failsafe
 sound design nolan strikes again with muffled dialogue some of the stuff i could barely understand what was being said although i never really had an issue with it in his prior films 
 it looks great in 1570 imax but before seeing the film i thought i had to absolutely see it in 1570 leaving the film i dont think its necessary youll probably get the same experience in regular digital movie theater formatting 

overall a 8710",2023-07-22 02:31:04
the movie was much funnier than i wouldve expected the scene where oppenheimer says birth control in not under my jurisdiction or something like that then the camera pans to his pregnant wife was hilarious,2023-07-22 05:37:23
"few problems i had

1 the pacing despite the 3 hour runtime feels very rushed this isnt a film for the usual action audience of nolan anyways so he couldve given certain scenes more time

2 the explosion scene isnt as good visually as hyped and the film doesnt need imax viewing as marketed the soundtrack is incredible so viewing it in any theatre with a good sound system will provide the optimum experience

otherwise its definitely one of nolans best films acting is phenomenal people should definitely go with some knowledge about the story especially if youre not american some clowns sitting next to me didnt understand anything and were talking continuously

overall 8510",2023-07-22 10:45:13
"i enjoyed it but i didn’t think it was the momentous piece of filmmaking that some critics were hailing it as

•the editing was great and made the 3 hour runtime fly by for the most part the last 35 minutes dragged a bit

•great acting performances all around

•sound drowned out a significant chunk of dialogue

•explosion was a bit of a let down and i know nolan is a practical effects purist but a little cgi would’ve definitely helped him out here

the good certainly outweighs the bad though the man took a 3 hour historical biopic with no action and turned it into a blockbuster that’s a testament to his skills as a filmmaker",2023-07-22 13:20:23
i really appreciated how ballsy the film was for one its a major blockbuster where the majority of the movie is people talking in rooms secondly there was so much hype about the bomb and when it finally is detonated after an incredibly tense buildup its absolute silence i found that to be really impactful i also loved how ambiguous oppenheimers character is throughout the movie i can see people hating that half the movie is dedicated to the trials but i felt that it was a great lens to explore the various contradictions of oppenheimer without ever providing an answer the suspicions leveled by the govt are under unfair circumstances and they are fueled by manic mccarthyism but it was fascinating to imagine all the different motives he may have had his communist agenda which is never really confirmed or denied in history or in the film and why he created the weapon in the first place then stood firmly opposed after the inevitable was realized also the scene of him accepting his medal years in the future was profoundly sad loved it,2023-07-22 15:44:42
just when we thought we had reached armistice oppenheimer set off a chain reaction of guys buying fedoras because they think they’re as cool as cilian murphy,2023-07-22 19:23:34
albert einstein magically appears seemingly out of thin air no less than two times in this film,2023-07-23 00:12:09
the opening scene with the prometheus anecdote sets up the whole point of this movie  i went in thinking it would be a  historical epic on the manhattan project  using oppenheimers role as the driving force of the narrative  it seems to be more devoted to the human experience of oppenheimer and the demons he carried with him publicly and privately,2023-07-23 00:42:38
i’m gonna go out on a hill and say emily blunt should win best supporting actress,2023-07-23 01:20:55

its still a good movie but it wasnt as horrifying or as visually awesome as i was hoping for",2023-07-23 03:55:16

"so i did indeed see barbie and oppenheimer together and im just saying that theres a scene in oppenheimer where hes pouring his heart out about his guilt to emily blunt and shes pretending to be sympathetic and then loses patience with him that would literally fit in that scene in barbie movie where the kens are pouring out their hearts to the barbies physicist ken


also he literally had jean tetlock be his long distance low commitment casual girlfriend he loves going on random self important tangents and quoting things people call him a dilletante womanizer and insecure neurotic

theres even an early scene in the movie where hes pursuing jean before he became a bigshot physicist and she rejects him and he sulks off

just saying the dude would have fit right in kendom",2023-07-23 09:38:14
"watched in imax i feel like some of the dialogue was muffled like the actors were mumbling would have been nice to have subtitles 

anyone have this or was it just me most of the time it was fine just the odd few times",2023-07-23 10:47:13
"so it was definitely better than tenet for me however time jumps werent that great the movies pacing was unbalanced and uneven as  probably im gonna get down voted because of this but the imitation game was a better ww2 genius races against nazis movie to me the characters felt more real and sincere i felt more for them i was fearful for them etc 

the cast was great even though so many actors were kinda underused even cillian couldve done more than this dialogue was okay at least we could hear them lol but i could not build the connection with the characters that well as everything kinda lost their importance after like 5 minutes 

also the characters were quite one dimensional florences character shes a kommie and she hates flowers thats about it his brother a kommie and had a gf his wife well she had some husbands and she had some problems with him and their children but we are not that interested with these even the man himself wasnt that developed still this is miles better than whatever the tenets characters were supposed to be still 

rdj was great matt damon was fun 

sound design for  sake man im a musician and i found myself in quite the loud places but nothing  my ears as much as this movie did literally there are some scenes that the volume slider is like at 150 percent and the explosion should be like this yeah absolutely but this happens throughout the movie and its  deafening the music was good the explosion was great showing the mans psychological struggle through music was also great but come on chill out a bit 

 that courtroom  scene with florence looking at emilys eyes was weird and unnecessary as  lol

the last old oppenheimer make up looked kinda funky 

ramis character is getting well i guess its just a cameo to well i see was fun but meanwhile lots of other actors got kinda cameoy roles while i was quite excited to see more from them 


i feel like for now its 77510 but i will be rewatching it and maybe some stuff will get better the second time around",2023-07-23 13:16:16
"this movie really highlighted my biggest qualm with nolan which is if 90 of the movie is expositional dialogue why would you have the score so blaringly loud in the mix i couldnt parce together half of what anybody was saying because the score overtook every voice 

if you walked into this movie not knowing a thing about this story i would suspect you left not knowing much more 

the most entertaining part to me was when it turned into a court room drama at the end and i could actually discern what people were saying 

all in all im pretty blown away with the reviews being so praiseful i dont think this is even a top 3 nolan movie",2023-07-23 14:10:31
i had no  idea gary oldman was truman,2023-07-23 17:01:31

"i thought the sound mixing was supposed to be solid for this but i had such a hard time understanding dialogue for most of the movie

also was tough on a first watch when a lot of important dialogue was referring to characters off screen by their name but there are so many characters it is hard to get straight who they are even talking about",2023-07-23 23:45:48
it was impressive that they were able to fit the whole story into 3 hours the los alomos trinity test storyline and oppenheimer communism trial storyline felt like they couldve been two entirely individual movies,2023-07-24 01:27:18

"genuinely how were all these geniuses alive at the same time

and so recently my  it’s incredible",2023-07-24 03:17:17
"something im not seeing many people talk about is the sound design the way the crowds feet rumbling every time oppenheimer begins to doubt the morality of what hes doing long before we actually find out what that sound means for it to transform into probably the most chilling scene of the movie was brilliant its the literal embodiment of a crowd of people cheering over the mass  of the japanese people

there are lots of fantastic sound design elements in the film but that motif was by far the most profound",2023-07-24 03:58:10

i absolutely loved the social network stuff that happened in the 3rd act imo the real bomb scene was in that hearing room,2023-07-24 07:12:52
i loved the part where oppenheimer has to say “and nagasaki” no one ever remembers nagasaki,2023-07-24 14:24:51
"this was a 3 hour movie that sailed along for one reason the score without it the movie would have felt longer and a chore to sit through the music never stopped it ebbed and flowed with the story beats and for the most part drove the story with its direction it isnt overwhelming it doesnt have any overbearing motifs like a score to lord of the rings or star wars  it is simply in the background driving the story and its breathtaking  
  
then theres the sound design the sound effects added to the movie specifically something comes to mind is the stomping of feet on bleachers that occurs repeatedly in soundbites through the film we dont fully understand what the sound is until almost the very end we learn that it is the crowd cheering for oppenheimer after a successful test of the bomb but its shown at odd moments throughout the film before that reveal  and it is open to interpretation i interpret it to be the audio representation of oppenheimers moral dilemma and ptsd of creating a weapon of mass destruction this simple sound bite expands the depth of oppenheimers character in a way that dialogue or anything else simply can not the sound of cheering and stomping bleachers to the idea of killing thousands of people and ending the world is seared into his brain and psyche  to come out at moments of dread  
  
never have i seen a movie incorporate sound in its storytelling better than this its a masterpiece",2023-07-24 17:26:12
"the silent delay before the explosion scared the  out of my theater i also like how they didn’t ham up oppenheimer as this big infallible hero and showed he was a person with flaws 

i saw barbie before this one and they’re both really good i expect to see both films nominated for big awards this coming season",2023-07-24 18:28:00
i love that they kept telling fuchs to keep his head down during explosive lens testing a subtle way to signal he is the spy among them,2023-07-25 00:09:50
"i found it a little unfortunate that a 3 hour movie felt that rushed it seemed like so many of the stories for example his own internal issues and his wifes mental health problems did not get their due time

while i did like that they ended the movie with the einstein conversation the constant time jumps didnt really make it easier to follow the story and contributed to the whole thing feeling rushed",2023-07-25 00:49:55
"am i the only one that had a hard time hearing some critical dialogue because of the weird audio mix in this movie its nowhere near as bad as tenet but especially the scenes with music i couldnt make out  was being said

i couldnt even hear the thing that the whole movie was leading up to what he said to einstein

the people next to me didnt know either maybe it was the imax mix i dont know

amazing movie otherwise the sound design itself was phenomenal",2023-07-25 04:28:08
when there is no cgi in a blockbuster the end credits are crazy fast turns out,2023-07-25 05:00:45
"i was pleasantly surprised by the pacing 3 hours actually felt like a reasonable length of time for this movie and it so often isnt 

emily blunt and rdj were great and it was nice to see matt damon portray a soldiermilitary type who doesnt just say explain it in english to the scientists 

the best part by far was the musical score particularly reusing the feet stomping multiple times to build tension i thought it was soldiers marching at first but then it turned out to be the celebration after the successful test",2023-07-26 05:35:07
i really liked this movie but was anyone else underwhelmed on the supposed big screen experience they said see this on the biggest screen possible and i’m not really sure why after watching it  great movie though,2023-07-26 12:09:52
i think it wouldve been better if the events were shown in chronological order except the last scene i was a bit lost in time or he couldve at least flashed a year number at the start of the security clearance hearing and strauss hearing but still a masterpiece ending gave me chills,2023-07-26 18:47:07
"i really enjoyed this movie im going to get a few downvotes for this but its not perfect and im going to disagree that its his magnum opus nor is this film a masterpiece for me nolans best films are a threeway tie between inception insomnia and the prestige with that said here are my thoughts

pros 

 i absolutely love the acting in this film my personal standouts were cillians subtle performance emily blunt matt damon rdj and his conniving little  as strauss and my personal two favourites from benny safdie and josh harnett quick little shoutout to matthew modine who is great in general 

 the visuals i was lucky to see the film in 70mm and it was breathtaking i loved the raindrops and chain reactions i loved the trinity test explosion i loved the way everything just looked so beautiful for my lack of a better word 

 the trinity test tension this is some spectacular filmmaking here everyone in the theatre was at the edge of their seat 

  the soundtrack im a big ludwig fan and while some think hes a copy of zimmer in these nolan films i think theres a further hint of modernity and balance in his tracks i found it quite well done 


cons 

 female character depth no im not calling nolan a sexist hes had plenty of awesome female characters in the past it was just this film for me i found florence pughs character really lacked in development shes  in 90 of her scenes and it doesnt add to the story kitty oppenheimer in real life was a character she was super interesting and somehow the film managed to make her pretty boring i loved emily blunts performance talking back at jason clarke and being sharp as a tack in that scene yet theres more to be desired when your two main female characters are ones where one is portrayed as a psychological mess who killed herself and was the other woman and the other who was the protagonists wife and portrayed as a messy  these women were interesting despite those things being part of who they were a more honest and nuanced showing of this wouldve been better 

 narrative structure this is a film where nolans nonlinear storytelling is unnecessary it doesnt add anything to the film for the audience id prefer the film to be chronological as its way more accessible to the audience especially in a biopic you can still present the points of view and strauss arc i think can actually be strengthened by doing this part of the pacing issues here are largely to do with this time jumps without being specific about when theyre happening arent respecting your audience to me theyre just annoying to piece together 

 odd cameos while i love most of the cast i actually dislike some of the cameos they take away from the actual character theyre meant to be i didnt see truman i just saw gary oldman while a talented starstudded cast is one thing oh look thats  takes away from being in the film 

 the exposition an unfortunate tired nolanism man the writing is so  good but he forgets to show and not tell and this time it was frustrating and quite distracting 

anyways those are my thoughts and while i was underwhelmed by some of it i still enjoyed my time at the theatre and i really have to commend a filmmaker who is still taking risks putting passion into his projects and doing it in a big way for that alone nolan gets my respect 75810",2023-07-26 21:58:06
"just saw it in 70mm imax and it was great i noticed the aspect ratio kept changing between every scene but the film quality was great

also someone in my theater ripped a huge   at the 1 second mark before the trinity explosion",2023-07-27 01:06:19
i was so immersed into the movie that when they were lifting and arming the bomb at the trinity test site i was unnerved and uncomfortable being that close to something and knowing what its capable of it sent shivers down my spine i can only imagine what it was like for the actual scientists that day,2023-07-27 01:32:36
the complaints in this thread about not seeing the destruction of hiroshima and nagasaki on screen remind me a lot of the complaints first man got about not showing the flag planting,2023-07-27 16:37:13
"what a quick three hours never wish i had captions more for a movie than this one with how quickly the dialogue and scenes cut time to time as well as the background sound being too loud at times sort of like tenet 

gonna need some time to digest this one but really excited to rewatch this incredible movie once it comes out on digital highlights were definitely the bomb test and oppenheimers speech which made me feel so uneasy",2023-07-28 01:37:58
i thought it was good but slightly disappointing pretty different from what i thought it was gonna be with the trailers since it focused so much on strauss’ congressional hearing and oppenheimer’s security clearance hearing etc and less on the actual manhattan project i don’t think nolan does his best work with working on biographicalhistorical material he tries to fit so much into three hours that it starts to lose focus 7510,2023-07-28 06:30:18
reading through the comments it seems many disagree but personally i thought the second half of the movie was much more intense than the first one save for the countdown sequence either way every minute captivated me and every actor pulled of a fantastic performance,2023-07-29 01:19:21
"the issue for me was there was too much to cover 

the movie was too broad


i felt like i didnt also get a sense for the time period kind of wish there were just quiet scences not so much tempo 

soo much happened that it was hard to reflect 

i kinda wanted to be guided more",2023-07-30 11:00:06
one of my favorite parts was when einstein asked oppenheimer who’s notes they were on the possibility of a chain reaction and when oppenheimer said teller einstein just said “so thats where we are” lol teller was really ahead of his time,2023-08-03 16:59:47
nolans back baby,2023-08-04 04:04:58
"just saw this in 70 mm imax its weird because the boom is a minor part of the movie really he probably should have either cgi’d it commissioned 15 kilotons of tnt or just asked the government if he could set off a small abomb 

that being said the imax experience and sound really made this into a thrilling suspenseful experience

at the end there was no clapping no people getting up just complete silence for a minute i’ve never seen that before in a theater i believe it was the contemplation of the magnitude of harnessing the power of atomic physics to create an unstoppable race to make weapons of mass destruction 

i’m glad nolan made this movie but i’m waiting for a updated version of hiroshima to really show what the destructive power of these weapons are",2023-08-06 00:56:21
"great acting great score the point of the bw vs color scenes was not clear to me the explosion in total silence was brilliant and i think the best scene was the speech after the test

shame about the accents though all actors portraying nonnative speakers of english seemed to gone for fantasy or generic foreigner accents one could even have hired eg a danish actor for playing bohr etc",2023-08-06 06:28:46
nothing productive to add besides einstein just strolling around in nature most of the movie and doing his own thing was so comical to me that i almost laughed when he showed up the last timeline wise time seemingly out of nowhere,2023-08-06 17:32:48
is no one hear gonna talk about josh hartnett being a daddy,2023-08-09 02:29:18
it all came together at the end i can see this easily winning best picture this year going to take another viewing for me to get the relationships down but the message at the closing of the film hit me really hard,2023-08-10 08:01:30
christopher nolan really did it again i have not watched a lot of biopics that kept me interested 3 hours in and this was one reminds me of aviator,2023-08-12 07:35:16
i saw it in 70mm imax just now and it looked great visually a very appealing movie overall a great movie with fantastic acting though i felt the movie felt a bit oddly paced after the detonation scene i also wished they talked or even showed more about how the bomb effected japan there was just one scene where they described what happened to the victims and it was fairly short i feel that could have been explored more,2023-08-14 02:21:06
"if anyone is waffling whether to see this in imax or not do it 110 worth it

imax tix were hard to come by around here i had to resort to see an 815am movie

this is a movie that makes you feel very small  this is not a criticism but a testimony to the power of it   i walked out stunned",2023-08-14 19:39:24
casey affleck had like 15 minutes of scream time and left a big impact on me,2023-08-17 13:14:40
"saw it again this week this time on imax 70 mm

mind blowing for sure but the most intense shot was the line of nuclear missiles being revealed in the last scene combined with the music that was bone chilling",2023-09-08 16:34:19
this movie was great until the end when they all looked like johnny knoxville in bad grandpa,2023-11-16 21:03:35
"i didn’t like it… and nolan is slowly moving towards overrated with every film he does fantastic artist with great nuance for visualsound design but this and tenet has moments where he goes too abstract with his direction i celebrate his fearlessness but fearlessness alone doesn’t always culminate into great artistry

the development of the atomic bomb is one of the greatest marvels in science history but oppenheimer’s story isn’t what made the atomic bomb interesting the stars aligning for the us to use it and establish themselves as a global superpower is the more interesting story the us bullying him was the most interesting element of the film but this didn’t have the drama and urgency that warranted this story being told",2023-11-23 04:20:17
incredible film  one gripe i had was that it was a bit hard to capture all of the dialogue especially the albert einstein scenes ill rewatch this again with subtitle when its available for rental,2023-07-21 04:03:09
they need you until they don’t,2023-07-21 07:35:30
what an absolutely incredible movie  one thing i took away from it and specifically from our main character murphy btw  jaw dropping acting is how all jro wanted to do was work and create from  his amazing talents with how he understood the world   like an artist who just needs to paint  he and his mind were above the fray of the world  unfortunately the world dragged him down and ultimately consumed him  an incredible opportunity that he could not pass up ultimately gave him heavy cancerous guilt  one we cannot even imagine   nolan brilliantly keeps every single event including the trinity test just below the most important one  jro,2023-07-21 19:49:21
"just got home from from seeing it i appreciate the scale and the intention of what nolan was trying to do as ever murphy is superb throughout and the explosion scene is one the more memorable cinema experiences in recent memory real on the edge of your seat stuff

not that i really disliked any thing about but it suffers from trying to be too multifaceted for its own good theres three maybe four really good movies you could expand upon throughout but nolans trying to tell them all at once to the point that i was left reeling at times it doesnt spend enough time with its characters to get the gravitas of the moments like the reveal of strauss leaking the documents or florence pughs death and towards the end i was desperate for it to just slow down absolutely worth watching for its peaks and a must to see it in the cinema but it also reiterates the issues that are now recurring in nolans movies",2023-07-21 23:00:05
wow after the first 30 minutes the time flew by for me absolutely incredible my theater was loud and they used that silence in an incredible way and that first scream when things go silent in the auditorium i just had chills,2023-07-21 23:29:48
can’t believe they couldn’t get brad pitt to play that barrier operator guy,2023-07-22 00:08:09
i had to walk home after this one i couldnt do the barbenheimer thing man i should have watched barbie first cillian you are one amazing actor idk how this dude can be tommy shelby and oppenheimer without missing a beat or taking me out of it at all i have to watch this movie again man it was too heavy,2023-07-22 00:44:19
what did he say when he tossed the apple with the poison in it away it sounded like “wormhole”,2023-07-22 00:49:30
if you haven’t seen the movie yet i recommend listening to some podcasts or reading up on some manhattan project history prior to it will really enhance the viewing knowing what’s happening in the background of the main story can help make the main plot less overwhelming,2023-07-22 06:12:23
edgeofyourseat intensity all the way through or at least up until hill dropping bombs on strauss during the hearing  that was the first time i cracked a smile after 2 hours,2023-07-22 06:26:51
i loved it loved everything about it and cannot wait to see it again i think theres going to be a few acting awards for rdj cillian and emily blunt,2023-07-22 15:41:47
im just wanting to point out how incredibly effective ludwig göranssons soundtrack was the trinity test and final interrogation between oppy and robb were so  tense thanks to his score among incredible acting directing etc to think he got his start on the tv show community to producing childish gambinos albums to scoring this incredible soundtrack hes easily one of the best and multitalented individuals in music today,2023-07-22 18:39:16
the film was good and the cast was incredible not a movie for everyone though having a really good understanding of who is being portrayed in the movie and a good grasp of the history of what happened will go a long way you dont go to this movie to turn off your brain i think its easy to overlook the scale and realness of how this changed the world forever because we have a lot of movies now days that arent based in reality this was the most powerful weapon ever built the dilemma of making the choices that led to these events what would happen if they didnt succeed first dropping the bombs makes you take a step back and see how this has impacted humanity,2023-07-22 20:03:24
"i went to see it in one of the only few theaters with a 70mm imax screen only to be disappointed that i booked a 70mm viewing not an imax 70mm viewing well i watched it anyway i agree with the comments that i would have rather seen a glorious cgi atomic explosion during the trinity test and not that fireball im also puzzled by the nolan s best reviews i mean its a great movie not better than inception its one of the best movies this year maybe the best movie this year the complicated topic was handled quite well but it was too political for most of the final hour i was planning on rewatching it next month if i can find an open spot in the imax 70mm screen but having seen it i agree that its not quite rewatchable i did see that on a nonimax screen the trinity test scene was horribly cut off and felt very amputated

to sum it up nolan might be the master of practical effects but there are times when he should have used cgi and the trinity test was one of those moments",2023-07-22 20:27:45
"casting and all the performances are so good everyone stole the screen time  especially the ones that weren’t talked about prior to release  david klumholtz plays isidor rabi as the concerned “father figure” friend benny safdie plays edward teller as the smart  easily bored and already moving on to the next big thing guy  the one scene with us secretary of war not wanting to bomb kyoto because he vacationed there alden next to rdj were some of the best scenes of the movie 

as a lifelong fan of history of science it was fun to see some of the greatest physicists of their time portrayed or mentioned casually like szilard or fermi",2023-07-22 23:23:36
"can someone explain to me how they took so long to get the plutonium and uranium for the trinity test and then seemingly instantly have enough for 2 more bombs for japan  
maybe there was a bigger timeskip than i thought but it seemed so weird to me that they spend over an hour of the movie to make the bomb for the test and then like 10 minutes to make two more bombs in another form factor too",2023-07-23 01:05:28
absolutely brilliant movie i loved the intricacy of the film and complex detailed stotyline but in my opinion the trial drama in the last bit of the movie went on far too long it really felt like christopher was just trying to meet a minimum time requirement it felt like the trial lasted at least a third of the movie itself other than that fantastic film worth my money,2023-07-23 02:03:52
for anyone that knew fuchs was the spy going in did you catch that any time they switched from the dinner scene to los alamos they mentioned fuchs immediately after “fuchs get your head down” was used twice after mentioning a spy in the manhattan project,2023-07-23 02:29:12
did fission have a number  1 like there would be chapters of building the bomb and then did i miss every single chapter after that,2023-07-23 04:33:16
watching the veritasium video is absolutely critical before watching the movie unless you have some knowledge about nuclear energy and weapons development some events in the movie will appear random and disconnected ex a sequence depicting a huge black box in a basement that happens to be the first manmade nuclear reactor but the movie gives absolutely zero hints for the layman even for a nuclear geek the movie pace is simply excruciating,2023-07-23 09:02:55
"i am on the fence on this movie

i think the performances were standout and the technical filmmaking aspects like set design costuming crowd work and visuals are all great

but the delivery at times was quite… i won’t say confusing but i will say jarring it took perhaps a good hour to find its pacing  the first hour had to set up its two points of view but having to go between two sets of character pov’s flash forwards flashbacks etc it was a lot to take in

some strange editing choices especially during dialogue moments  not a lot of room to breathe in some instances i noticed several times characters would talk and the camera would cut to them for no longer than half a second before cutting away  and some dialogue scenes during the first hour felt as though they had been trimmed down so much to bring the film runtime down 

there is a lot to be gained from the film  the message is clear i would say anyone without some knowledge on the topics of oppenheimer’s life and work could find this film a bit hard to follow…though i am glad nolan didn’t dumb down the dialogue no “english please” devices to get the audience informed on what was happening in a more surmised simplistic fashion

definitely a great film but some flaws in my eyes",2023-07-23 10:33:46
i love the bit where oppenheimer gets a “suiting up” sequence,2023-07-23 12:37:15
"rewatched it and its still good once you have an idea exactly what is served you have adjusted expectations which are somewhat met you can also see the flaws better the first half is too unfocused it jumps from scene to scene and doesnt let you fully settle things settle when damon comes in even though the trial at the end is important to oppenheimers story strauss didnt deserve so much screentime second half is when movie magic happens third act goes herovillain mode which could have been trimmed 

not a masterpiece a decent watch still",2023-07-23 12:48:32
"i thought it was brilliant i was extremely hyped by the prospect of seeing this explosion on an imax screen but left feeling a bit grossed out in myself for being that shallow personally i didnt want to see hiroshima or nagasaki  i think that was kind of the point of the film the spectacle drew me in but the story leading up to and following trinity really captured the life of oppenheimer 

wouldnt have minded cgi for the bomb though",2023-07-23 21:08:27
"saw this movie in 70 mm imax and oppenheimer’s
head was a good 100 feet tall he was big enough he could have eaten the greatest son of the atom bomb godzilla",2023-07-23 21:55:46
small thing i loved was when strauss called himself a lowly shoe salesman late in the movie when in the earlier scene with oppenheimer he doesnt use lowly when referring to having been a shoe salesman,2023-07-23 23:02:53
i love the way nolan uses actors not many have the pull he has but using oldman malek  affleck in such minor but vital roles is ingenious he doesn’t need to build up the importance of their character at all wouldn’t have the time we just automatically pay attention to them,2023-07-23 23:54:04
"this movie is a near perfect representation of the book american prometheus which it was meant to be based on

so much of the dialogue was word for word with irl events though from memory niels bohr wouldn’t have been around for the poison apple event right guess a bit of poetic license is aok",2023-07-24 00:10:54
first time we met josh hartnetts character it looked like he had cutsscabs on the side of his head was i seeing things or what was that about,2023-07-24 00:54:29
can we not talk about the face melting scene that whole sequence left me speechless,2023-07-24 01:36:39
awesome cinematography loved watching those great and important moments that still define our present,2023-07-24 03:04:28
alden ehrenreich was pretty fantastic imo,2023-07-24 08:51:45
"i’m shocked michael caine is not in this film

after thinking about this movie i feel like there is a better 2 hour movie hidden in here because the so major storylines involving oppenheimer’s view on nuclear weaponry and oppenheimers politics with the former being far more interesting than the latter i think the latter storyline could have been cut down to make a tighter film 

the use of raindrops was absolutely terrific",2023-07-24 12:47:29
everything was amazing just dissapointed by the trinity test the explosion looked like a really big fire explosion but definitely didnt look like an atomic one,2023-07-24 13:00:17
"ngl i held my breath hard during that trinity test scene and let out a huge sigh of relief when it was done like almost like i was there in person it was so immersive 
that it was definitely worth paying for a imax ticket for that scene alone",2023-07-24 15:36:01
its been nice seeing josh hartnett showing up again he was recently in the new season of black mirror too,2023-07-24 16:21:29
" an amazing movie packed with dialogue and heavy questions about the atom bomb morality the role of science in the advancement and destruction of humanity and political intrigue and persecution

its 3 hours of dudes in suits going at it over this youll love it if thats your thing i know its mine fr the temporality its a bit annoying because it keeps switching between 3 different moments and its all over the place when it does perfect movie to take your dad",2023-07-24 17:58:14
"after a few days im really wondering how much of my enjoyment of the film is supported by all the wikipedia dives ive done on the subject  there were a lot of things i was hoping to see cp1 for instance  i fear that a lot of people with no real idea about the specific history of the project would have a hard time following the story and recognizing certain aspects especially given the pace

the movie is doing quite well so far so credit to nolan for making a tough subject so watchable  my only recommendation for people going into it would be dig into the history  its some really neat stuff and really pays off when watching the movie",2023-07-24 18:19:58
"i just watched oppenheimer yesterday and liked it pretty much i know this is a movie illustrating these events in oppenheimers perspective and i know he felt remorse from it but what do you guys think the message was on the whole bombing hiroshima and nagasaki to me it kind of felt like it was taunting americas arrogance and calling out americas contradictory actions in the scenes where they were planning the bombings with all the military officials the part where henry stimson says lets spare kyoto because it has historical significance and he liked his honeymoon there and the scene where oppenheimer meets truman although it is mentioned in the movie that nuking japan did save more lives than if they were to not have nuked them

im not saying i felt bad or uncomfortable because of this im korean after all and i think the bombings were necessary but i just wanted to know what americans felt about the movie was it portraying japan as a total victim",2023-07-24 20:26:16
"plot question to help me clear up the time line


is the series of events in chronological order bomb testing completed and dropped on japan  strauss invites oppenheimer to princeton  oppenheimer advocates for no nukes  oppenheimer humiliates strauss at a conference the scene where oppenheimer straus and other officials discuss that russia now has nuclear testing the scene with the round table and the flower decoration in the center  oppenheimer loses clearance  strauss is not confirmed to being a cabinet member",2023-07-24 21:55:15
overall decent film  some issues with the movie is that it felt too montagey to me  it jumped to a completely different scene every 30 secondsminute or so in the first 15 of the film  it felt overwhelming i needed some parts to slow down so the film could just breathe and relax but i guess i get it as theyre racing against time to create the bomb first  the score was beautiful but there was too much of it and too loud especially over some parts of dialogue like when oppi and jason clarkes character  it was funny because they were screaming at each other and i still couldnt hear them clearly because of the music  maybe it was just how the imax audio was mixed,2023-07-25 14:11:54
"the movie gets better as it goes on during the making of the test and gives better insight into what kind of situations oppenheimer dealt with while his team of scientists worked on the science of the project i think that at times it was difficult to grasp on certain decisions the characters made like kitty not leaving her husband after facing humiliation in front of hearing committee oppenheimer still wanting to make bomb knowing nazis had stopped and that the bomb could start a nuclear weapons race among the countries as the movie follows real life story of flawed and conflicted characters at the same time it only seemed only way possible to present the facts in the way they happened without trying to provide logic into the decisions characters made

the trinity test in the movie was really accurate don’t know why people have been bashing that just because they expected to be like the hydrogen bomb explosion although the movie was bloated beyond measure it still managed to get all the details of his earlier mid and life during the hearings encapsulated in 3hrs it got confusing at times due to shifts in oppenheimer and staruss’s perspectives being intertwined and exhausting near the end but still it was quite satisfactory 7510",2023-07-25 17:22:37
"
curious to see if it sweeps the awards would love to see a best supporting actor for matt damon",2023-07-25 19:44:51
very powerful movie as it should’ve been i feel like nolan did a great job handling such a heavy and important moment in our history it had its signature nolan timeline bounces and personally i felt like it was a bit much at times but other than that i thought it was great everyone’s performances were fantastic any moment where oppenheimer is experiencing a sort of out of bodyanxiety riddled moment was completely unnerving and riveting the complete silence during the testing explosion honestly filled me with a lot of emotion really raw ,2023-07-26 00:34:42
and holy  that was gary oldman playing truman,2023-07-26 01:57:49
bohr branagh returning was nice i liked him knowing that he wasn’t needed and the team was plenty capable,2023-07-26 14:27:56
what is the significance of the tolmans i know oppenheimer had an affair with her through research i learned she also worked for bush and groves it seems to be an interesting story to develop but she got so little screen time,2023-07-27 04:33:17
if you enjoyed oppenheimer i highly suggest you watch the imitation game asap,2023-07-27 14:39:36
movie was aight about what i expected might go again to rewatch nolan should try to adapt slaughterhouse five tho nolan made the subject matter as entertaining as anyone could with the nonlinear editing i just think he is too creative to limit himself to a biopic felt like the whole ending with straus didn’t have the impact it should have probably the best overall acting i’ve ever seen in a movie great editing score is questionable felt like i heard those same synth noises from tenet,2023-07-28 04:28:20
the jfk reveal had me wondering what prime oliver stone version of oppie would look like wouldve gone so much harder against the mi complex,2023-07-29 08:47:51

after a week i admit theres tons of flaws with the pace making it hard to enjoy the scenes but man i adore this movie i just love the subtlety of how it portrays oppenheimer,2023-07-31 01:35:59
man i cant make up my mind on this movie do i love it do i hate it i  cant stop thinking about it,2023-08-02 19:08:23

anyone else see cillian murphy turn into michael keaton at various points,2023-08-06 16:33:51
i saw this with my mom and asked if the flipping from color to black and white annoyed her she 100 straight faced told me she didn’t realize any of it was in black and white ,2023-08-07 04:49:29
just watched it for the second time and must say it was an enjoyable rewatch,2023-08-07 21:16:47
not enough giraffes in this film,2023-08-19 20:42:25
i booked tickets but on the day my brain was just getting overwhelmed lol lets just say the movie really did not help full on sensory overload very beautiful but i couldnt focus on the story sitting next to people making noises didnt help either i think ill need to watch it on a smaller screen on a better day with subtitles and lower sound amazing cinematography though,2023-08-28 01:59:03
what are some facts or trivia that you should know before watching oppenheimer,2023-08-30 07:49:48
amazing movie wish i saw it in imax,2023-09-27 06:33:53
"nuclear weapon the most cruel weapon used in a human history was not just cruel it is indescribable unordinary form of massacre many took months til they die in unbelievable intense sufferings there are still people who are still suffering today from the lifelong lasting torturing effect it was not instant people do not know anything about how far more sufferings it has caused than just an instant  in vietnam people are still suffering from pesticides that have been causing birth defects today you should really visit hiroshimas nuclear museum and see for yourself

hiding this movie from the japanese audience is very coward and neglectful avoiding critics from the japanese audience

it seems it is extremely insensible that the us makes this movie that could be taken as glorifying the use of the nuclear weapon making light of such events that have such profound and lasting impacts on individuals and communities can cause severe pain and offense to those who have connections to them the producers obviously know this hiding this movie from japan and still want to make this no one has ever glorified the war in the past in such manner

it seems it tries to depict its superiority by contrasting reproducing in infidelity vs killing humans which were also very offensive it feels being harassed being forced to watch a  scene unexpectedly

no war can be justified it is a massive mass brainwash and lies from dictatorships still happening around the world

us knew the pearl harbor and they invited japan to china for a free railroad uk brought  to colonize chinawho armed japan with all the western armors and clothes to begin with when there are indigenous samurai and kimonos with only swords do you think nothing pressured japan to be colonized during 333 years of colonization of asia by the western countries america deceived japan into believing that america will protect japan against the aggression of britain when they received a fake permission to force open and militarize japan a closed country that never been to abroad politicians are assassinated if they oppose militarization russia forcing to draft the indigenous asian people to the war service today us took over russia in wwi what is sponsoring covid facility isis and all the “evil axis” in the back

us create a reason to start a war even when there is nothing us created hollywood to make propaganda battle of china international military tribunal for the far east which were fictional stories where japan attacks china and use it as fake footages of the nanjing massacre us brainwashed chinas honghuzi and kuo ming tang kmt to hate japan and used azuma shiro to falsely testify that japan did a cruel act in china and spread it everywhere us photoshopped the footages in china to overly exaggerate the incident to a significantly larger scale



 do us want to repeat the same ww2 atrocities in the future 

people in the world dont know the enormous atrocities against japan by the allies 

between 1944 and 1945 allied forces massacred more than one million japanese civilians with indiscriminate bombing a clear violation of the laws of war for example the great tokyo air raid on march 10 1945 killed more than 100000 civilians and injured more than one million in a single day in the same month the cities of osaka nagoya and kobe were hit by similar heavy air raidsfrom april to august 1945 thousands of civilians were also killed in violent airstrikes in fukushima kanagawa hiroshima yokohama ibaraki kagoshima hamamatsu fukuoka shizuoka kure nagasaki okayama kumamoto takamatsu tokushima chiba kofu wakayama sendai utsunomiya iwate hokkaido chiba aomori niigata toyama and other local cities

finally atomic bombs were dropped on hiroshima on august 6 1945 and on nagasaki on august 9 1945 incinerating and blowing away hundreds of thousands of people in an instant not enough time to think was given between the 2 bombings hundreds of thousands of people who went to the rescue in hiroshima and nagasaki also died a few months after being exposed to radiation still other survivors also died of cancer and leukemia years later

even in the midst of these atomic bombings thousands of japanese civilians died in heavy us airstrikes in aichi fukuoka iwate yamaguchi saitama gunma and akita",2023-10-20 08:10:17
why does nolan insist on using music for almost every scene,2023-08-11 19:06:04
"i wish i could have watched this movie properly my 70mm imax screening was a complete  right from the beginning the audio was desynced from the video and would cut out for 10 seconds every 30 seconds into the movie

eventually they said they wouldnt be able to fix it for this showing and that they would be lucky to get it fixed for the evening show today and that they were cancelling the screening

im getting a refund and will rebook a few weeks down the line when hopefully theyll have everything figured out but it would have been nice to see this tonight",2023-07-21 02:24:34
what a fantastic movie cillian and crew killed it it felt mementoesque in a way with the story structure and i loved that i only wish i had a better grasp of the historical and political context to appreciate it even more some pretty good moral and ethical questions for the viewer to ponder too can’t wait to see it again,2023-07-21 02:31:59
a small detail i appreciated they accurately depicted the speed of sound i always hated movies where the flash of lightning and its thunder occurred concurrently especially with that classic cartoon lightning sound you know which one im talking about,2023-07-21 22:49:39
the gym scene was truly incredible but the cheering and applause after the trinity test was absolutely haunting,2023-07-21 23:02:51
imo i feel quite conflicted about this film i really liked how the story was sewn together but there were a couple of choices i didn’t quite understand mainly it was the sound i wasn’t watching it at imax but at times the sound effects got so loud it got uncomfortable the extremely loud stomping by the crowd in the basketball court for example i was contemplating leaving the movie midway due to this there was also a constant nonstop background music throughout the film it was to build tension but i started getting fatigued by all the nonstop constant tension build up the dialogue also felt very tamed and it made connection to the characters a little difficult especially by midway of the movie,2023-07-22 02:36:32
"great movie ill give it a 910

the cons

pacing was too fast all highlight no filler really didnt let some moments sink in 

excessive soundtrack i prefer movies where you let silence speak the nuke scene was perfect to me for that reason

 makeup and hair wasnt doing it for me

the pluses

cillian killed the role really had you rooting for him

not an rdj fan but he made it easy to hate his character 

most of the ensemble cast knocked it out of the park

source material is 1010 and the interpretation was perfect loved all the historical namedrops

compelling story that seamlessly wove a handful of threads

cinematography 910

felt short for a 3 hr movie

one of nolans better works curious to see who gets the oscar nods best picture cillian best actor rdj best supporting loved it and would recommend to anyone who can enjoy a dialogue heavy film for 3 hours",2023-07-22 09:24:29
"visceral cerebral emotive and left me and everyone else who shuffled out of the theatre with in a daze with a sense of dread in the pits of our stomachs this is nolans masterpiece 

the whole film just feels like its building and building to something massive and thats helped with the very quick intense and masterful editing between 3 timelines because of course it does its a nolan movie i love how the score is just played throughout like 98 of the film the music is just as much a character as oppenheimer himself is and it sets the tone so clearly its a really beautiful score the cinematography and practical effects are amazing too and it was nice to actually see something that wasnt cgi for once its been so long along with the editing its kind of like actor wackomole throughout the runtime as new actors keep popping in out and of the movie each giving stunning performances even when they only have a few lines one actor in particular who came near the end of the movie i think should be nominated for an oscar and they were really on screen for maybe 2 minutes shout out to josh harnett too glad to see him back and killing it 

cillian murphy is the real star here and fantastic in the title role and i think deserves recognition for his part this is not just a movie about the man who man the atom bomb but also about the guilt the comes there after murphy effortlessly glides through the timelines in this movie and makes each new iteration of oppenheimer feel different  nuanced but the same its subtle but really hard to achieve i think 

the final hour for sure drags ever so slightly after the middle climatic scene but the movie won me back in the end and its there to really showcase that feeling of guilt that so prevalent to the thesis of the film the biggest flaw is how nolan still writes women but there is a v memorable and gnarly scene involving pugh and blunt that i felt was powerful and kind of bad  for nolan to do didnt know he had it in em 

its probably one of the most wellcrafted bio flicks ive ever seen and one thatll be in my mind for a long time the power money and influence that went into the creation of the most devastating weapons in mankind and the deaths that resulted from it is horrifying i really want to give grave of the fireflies a rewatch to see this all from the japanese perspective would be a great double feature i think 

lets enjoy this great time to be a movie lover 

seen in 70mm imax",2023-07-23 00:45:53
"did anyone notice the scene when jean died  in one of the shots someone’s hand is holding her underwater i was wondering if it was a reference to the theory that she was murdered…

this movie was fantastic i’m still reeling",2023-07-23 02:53:28
"oppenheimer i feel like i have blood on my hands 

truman here’s a tissue for your issue",2023-07-23 10:38:50
robert downey jr absolutely blew me away in the last act of the film his  expressions when he realizes what is happening in the court room and then when he breaks down in his office strauss hated oppenheimer and rdj performed that brilliantly i’ll be very sad if he doesn’t get nominated for best supporting actor,2023-07-23 14:30:14
someone’s  phone went off during the trinity test silence at my theater for multiple rings yes i’m  about it,2023-07-24 00:06:08
i missed out on the trinity test cuz i almost  my pants i was trying to hold it in but i started getting the bubble guts thank  for dolby digital bass drowning it out but i felt like as the score got more intense so did the feeling of almost  my pants once josh peck put the key in i had to run from the middle of the aisle to the bathroom i dropped my own bomb and got back in my seat right as benny safdie was smiling at the sky i have to go back and watch it again but everything else i saw was amazing,2023-07-24 01:01:03
i thought this movie was good i liked it this is gonna sound paradoxical but i felt the overall film was too fast and too slow at the same time many other people feel the same as me that there were just too many characters with so much dialogue and such a short introduction then there was the transition between black and white and colour this couldve been easily explained but instead we just saw 1 fission and 2 fusion i loved the development of the bomb testing etc i know theres gonna be people who say this film is a masterpiece and thats fine each to their own just dont come at me for saying i didnt enjoy it,2023-07-24 04:02:06
"the scene of him addressing the crowd was enthralling this was one conflicted individual a deeply conflicted oppenheimer worrying about japan underneath but then outwardly finishing off his speech with if only we couldve done it to the germans or something like that was just moving af

i wouldve liked to have seen some coverage of his early life growing up in the upper west side in a german jewish family this was not your typical early 20th century american jewish upbringing like that of isi rabis was there was a quick reference to that between the two early in the movie and only a brief mention of his father but roberts childhood wouldve influenced the man he ultimately becomes quite a bit and its a bit disappointing that nolan didnt explore a young robert at all overall i liked it tho 910",2023-07-24 05:34:47
"call me dense but i didnt really get the point or message of the movie

was it about the horrors of a nuclear bomb didnt really deliver that home for me

was it about oppenheimers life it jumped around so much and every scene felt like little snippetsanecdotes of his life that i really didnt connect with him at any level just seems like a brilliant scientist with a  personal life

i think the most effective message it delivered to me was how dumb mccarthyism got and the paranoia that was prevalent in the 50s",2023-07-24 09:01:44
"all i could think about was how intense the postproduction must have been 

there was music playing for probably about 2 hours and 45 minutes of the 3 hours and it was cut quicker than any other movie i’d ever seen felt like each scene was only 23 minutes in a 3  hour movie a script like that is a ridiculous achievement 

it felt like the only time i could breath was when the trial bomb went off",2023-07-26 14:14:26
just feeling blessed we got a movie for adults  need more of that,2023-07-27 18:06:10
the countdown to the explosion and the explosion itself was an incredible experience everyone knew whats gonna happen yet everyone seemed totally invested in it my heart was pounding no thriller ever gave me as much thrill as this movie did with its soundtrack and presentation i also think it was generally very mature and on point somehow made a fastpaced 3hour movie that i wished would go on for longer brilliant,2023-07-28 21:00:13
"i loved it especially how breakneck the pace was ive never seen a biopic that felt like such an action suspense thriller

it felt like nolan watched the theory of everything and said  this tripe im gonna do that but as a horror movie",2023-07-30 06:51:08
cillian murphy was sublime,2023-08-06 03:41:40
"i loved the pacing of the movie until the trials
they felt a little dragged out

but the atmosphere was something else it was so intense waiting for the bomb tests etc

we literally sat there holding our ears when waiting for the trinity test lol
it’s one of the movies that i will never watch again at home because it relied so heavily on the audio experience and will never work at home also the music was great",2023-08-09 09:32:19
"im really hesitant to watch this in the movie theater as interstellar and tenet were really hard for me to watch because of the sound

its insanely frustrating for me to know there is important dialog that i cant hear because of the loud music or just the audio volume is really low

if its bad i will wait till its out in some form of streaming service with subtitles instead of being annoyed for 3 hours in the theater",2023-08-11 18:14:26
"just finished a second watching did anyone else notice all the pianos i don’t mean in the score like in the actual movie i counted five

in his classroom in berkeley

in the house where the communist party meeting was when he meets jean

in one of the meeting rooms in los alamos

in the room where dr hill tries to get oppenheimer to sign the petition before he meets the war secretary in washington

in his house at the end when kitty is trying to get him to fight back against the hearing

what’s it all about i’m sure at the time it was common as it still is to have a piano in the house but the other ones are kind of odd apparently oppenheimer didn’t like music much either so it’s all a bit weird any theories",2023-08-16 19:29:16
i watched it yesterday and i found that the storyline with the interrogation was drawn out a bit too much especially at the end but other than that i thought it was a pretty great movie the editing was pretty genius and they gave a neat portrayal of oppenheimer in so far that you get a good idea of the kind of person that he was,2023-08-26 07:43:12
"finally got to see it last night we loved it and were knocked back on our heels by it for a good long while afterwards

one thing we agreed is we’d love to see a kitty oppenheimer movie fascinating individual as portrayed",2023-09-03 14:43:23
"it really didnt do anything for me i think you had to already have known his story very well all the politics etc
i didnt all i knew was that he was a brilliant physicist who led the team that developed the bomb
for me it just would have been better if it ended when they dropped the bombs
all the after it politics not interested 
actually i dont think i ever made it to the end

the first half of it was decentthen it just chopped  changed  went on and on and on for what to me was no great reason i still cant work out why the pollie played by robert downey jnr hated him so much and when he went from offering oppenheimer a great job to hating his guts",2024-02-29 07:36:47
"great movie  made a list of things i loved about it
1 extensive dialogue scenes  you feel like you are in the room with the actors wonderful for history buffs who really want to delve deep into the context of all these amazing figures
2 cut scenes added a layer of complexity to the movie kind of like you had to solve a puzzle with how convoluted some of these were
3 little action its refreshing that this movie didnt have much action or over the top moments its not an action movie at the end of the day its a drama
4 excellent for falling asleep a lot of people are calling this movie boring but i think it has a lot of rewatchability if you are having trouble falling asleep at 2am in the morning",2023-07-21 13:16:20
breaking bad has truly ruined me because when they mentioned heisenberg i could not help but think of walter white,2023-07-22 23:34:22
"the delayed sound of the bomb and the delayed sounds of the crowds cheers being used as a way to represent the delayed consequences of the creation of this technology… 

the crowds stomps being used as a horror theme to score the scenes earlier in the movie and build the tension as we barrel toward this inevitable ending 

just a masterclass from nolan",2023-08-06 22:54:21
"i felt like the conflict with strauss was not as engaging as the movie wanted it to be strausss character was supposedly petty and evil but we werent really allowed to see that pettiness until it was revealed in a clumsy in your face way it was strauss all alonguhhh okay whatand the whole interrogation to remove oppies security clearance took too long i felt like the movie lagged a bit toward the end i enjoyed the scene with truman and i would have liked to feel more of the blowback toward oppie from the whole political apparatus prior to the removal of his clearance this movie didnt feel very balanced also yeah as another commenter said i needed more pugh and i am curious about whether the real life jeans alleged homosexuality was in the book because i think her character was oversimplified here and i would have loved to see a more complex portrayal overall i enjoyed it its hard not to enjoy that streak of genius that is in all of nolans work but i was slightly disappointed

edit ill also add that the oppie pro atom bomb speech was powerful but this movie deserved more of a vision of hiroshima follow one person who was bombed and died in the following days",2023-08-12 15:42:56
"i saw this in fake imax a couple days ago but it filled the whole screen so probably like 169 which is nice we dont have a real imax where i live and the closest one is more than 14 hours drive away i dont think i can watch this movie in 2351 scope scope is such a horrible format this movie looked incredible filling up the whole screen

as to the actual contents of the film ive been thinking about this movie  near constantly since i saw it its just been living in my head this is by far christopher nolans best film and i believe it to be the best film of the decade so far now that ive thought about it everything about this film worked so well for me this movie was the quickest 3 hours ever for me and i honestly wish it went on for more i could have easily watched another hour of that 

i loved how aggressively edited this movie was it expects quite a lot of the viewer and it throws them around like a ragdoll but i was still able to follow along the disturbing perspective pov shots are quite damning to the characters the intense cacophony of noise while oppenheimer is losing his mental stability the way nervousness and anxiety are portrayed with the selective sounds passing through the rumbling and vibrations as his world is depicted as literally vibrating behind him its so good 

i liked the commitment to being very historically accurate some of the dialogue especially during the closed investigation scenes was word for word pulled from transcripts the attention to small pieces of history that no one else knows about like the line  doesnt play with dice that is flippantly thrown out by a character near the beginning of the film that was a whole issue that einstein had with quantum mechanics and caused him to reject it for so long as well as become rejected himself by the leaders of the new sciences general relativity and qm couldnt be reconciled back then i only know of all of this because i grew up watching nova episodes about physics like fabric of the cosmos i loved seeing it referenced in the movie and im wondering how few caught the importance of that line for reference einstein argued that quantum mechanics didnt make any sense because of its inability to be predicted and its trends towards chance another physicist one whose name i have forgotten and who was on the qm side responded to einstein saying something like dont tell  what he can do i like that they included the bits about pile 1 under the stands thats another thing few people know about 

i actually quite liked how it basically turned into a whole different movie for the last hour people minimize the importance of what was happening by saying stuff like it was boring it was just about a  security clearance in reality that security clearance represented both oppenheimers ability to continue influencing the us nuclear programs and having pull as well as representing his reputation the revoking of his clearance was a disaster for him in real life and was an attack on his reputation this is also the part of the movie with the best acting robert downey jr deserves an oscar for his portrayal of strauss his  movements and micro speeches to his aids were incredible his portrayed of a seemingly softer personalitypoliticianspiteful and vindictive and his mix of being soft and also rugged and powerful was one of the best parts of the movie

something else i liked about the film was its peculiar story structure at first i thought it was just a quintessential nolan nonlinear trope but i noticed something about the way the film was structured the way the story about the bomb itself was presented was very reminiscent of religious texts like the bible i know this is a reach but the film references things like the bhagavad gita the fact that so many of the storys main players were jewish and the references to greek mythology i couldnt help but see religious symbolism in the structure of the film the reality of the bomb is almost symbolically prophesied throughout the first hour of the film as characters make references to things that will occur by happenstance later like the very real coincidence that oppenheimer loved the desert southwest and physics and wished he could combine them both he actually did say that the small creepy reminders of the future of the bomb are spread out in the first hour similar to how subversive signs of the messiah are spread throughout the old testament like the ram with its head caught in a thorn bush to be sacrificed in genesis 22 i feel like that had to be intentionally done with the story and dont even start on the blatant water droplet symbolism 

this is not the same christopher nolan as before this is a new version of him that hasnt been seen before his last movie tenet was the most nolany of nolan films it could possibly have been this is completely different this is such a weird film from him with so many elements and approaches he hasnt done before really 

also the ending couldnt have been better the reveal of the actual nature of what oppenheimer said to einstein the haunting visions of fire rows of icbms the new successor of the v2 the earth being consumed it was such haunting ending and it couldnt have been better",2023-08-18 22:33:04
can nolan make a movie that doesnt flash back or flash forwarded every  other scene this style of his becoming  more and more overused by him,2023-11-20 14:28:30
they could’ve done a better job at explaining who was who,2023-07-21 02:37:51
"cilian and rdj were awesome really enjoyed matt damon in it as well wish josh peck or jack quaid had more scenes lol oppenheimer was the social network on crack so many time jumps im a huge science history movie and politics guy but i thought the movie was good not great just didnt scratch the movie itch loved the whole ensemble they got for this film the music was amazing the build up for the testing of the bomb was intense favorite part of the film was definitely the last hour when they are all in the room questioning oppenheimers allegiance to the us

people expecting a war drama with some action are gonna be wildly disappointed cause this was all politics half my theater was asleep but this was during the midnight showing

understood like 80 of the dialogue 10 im bad with accents 10 typical nolan its a lot better than tenet which i only understood like 50 of the dialogue in the theater

florence pugh interesting to say the least in her scenes lol

8510 movie something was missing personally for me that scratch that movie itch",2023-07-21 11:06:05
i see were already at the point of youre just not smart enough to get it type comments in response to people who found this boring,2023-07-21 15:13:18
the only problem i had with the film was how little context i had while watching itnolan should have better explained whos who and why they do what they dothe scene with einstein and oppenheimer is going to stay with me for ages,2023-07-21 14:49:57
i have several things i wanna say but im gonna start by saying its fun seeing alden ehrenreich on the screen lucasfilms did him dirty and he and rdj played so well off each other,2023-07-21 16:27:12
"really superb in so many ways

although as someone who is relatively uneducated on oppenheimer and ww2 history i did struggle to keep track of all the characters and i was a bit confused during the black and white scenes

with that said the cinematography and acting was really something

personal pet peeve but our imax sound was too loud at some points i understand the artistic intent but i literally winced with pain in my ears more than once",2023-07-22 04:31:41
"maybe they spoke about something more important

who would have thought that in a movie about thermonuclear weapons jamie dornan would give the biggest burn

edit i have been told thats not jamie dornan",2023-07-22 04:48:24
"i watched this yesterday and am coming to see what people thought 

but i still can’t get over the sick as intro card i don’t even remember the full quote but as a total casual who didn’t know prometheus or anything having that dark line over the nuclear bomb in the back was a great way to start",2023-07-22 05:37:31
"i think it was a good movie

i agree that they could have gone into the physics part in detail but i get that the average layperson may not understand all the physics behind this so they kept it short and simple

i was actually impressed that they spent a good deal of the runtime on oppenheimer grappling with the guilt of putting his hands on something so catastrophic it was amazing that christopher nolan showed the humane side of oppenheimer and not just a warraging physicist

the ending was also so good i absolutely loved the way he described how the events are going to shape the world we live in today",2023-07-22 21:54:12
not gonna lie if i was oppenheimer i would also go to sleep with crushing guilt every night for the rest of my life for choosing an alcoholic emily blunt over a commie florence pugh,2023-07-22 23:05:00
"i thought this would be a straight biopic a movie in chronological order but christopher nolan being christopher nolan decided to make it a small puzzle box just like dunkirk i kind of struggled on the first few minutes trying to determine the order of the scenes and fortunately i caught the grasp of it although im pretty sure im still wrong with quite a few things

i have enjoyed every minute of it especially the whole los alamos thing the highlight of the movie is definitely the trinity test the buildup the score the sound effects and the suspense it all came beautifully 

i understand now why people say the movie could have ended few minutes after the trinity test i think the movie could have ended on the scene where they carried oppenheimer and celebrating the success of the trinity test freeze the frame there play some dramatic music transition to black screen with texts and images telling the aftermath of the bombs just like how the last episode of chernobyl ended

but honestly im so glad we got 1 more hour and a huge fraction of it is courtroom drama i really love courtroom dramas and i think oppenheimer did it well i understand how some people found the last hour boring after all its hard to top the whole los alamos sequence

overall i really love the movie its my first time watching in an imax theater and im glad my first imax movie is oppenheimer im still lost on some details because i missed some dialogue due to sound mixing and the characters speaking fast i guess ive got to find a copy of american prometheus now just to understand the whole context of the film",2023-07-23 08:57:09
"its undoubtedly a great movie but i do think the hype around it set my expectations too high 

unlike most movies its actually the best right near the end the start of it didnt really hook me i especially thought the opening with the loud music and flashy science particles was a bit tacky the film overall could use some more quieter moments it would have made the impact of the bomb stand out more and have more impact

nonetheless everything else was fantastic acting was amazing oppenheimers character was fascinating to watch especially since the movie doesnt make him into a complete hero but shows him for the incredible but flawed man he was the dialogue was also excellently written 
overall an 810 definitely has a few faults but its positives more than make up for it",2023-07-23 18:42:04
honestly the one problem i had with this film was the footage of the trinity test really didnt look like a nuke after that fantastic buildup sequence and the incredible sound design it just makes me wonder how amazing that scene would have been if it didnt just look like a standard hollywood explosion and actually conveyed the scale horror and destruction that all footage of actual nuclear detonations contain,2023-07-23 22:59:08
one of the most fast paced movies ive ever seen it just felt like it was speed running from scene to scene leaving zero room to breathe,2023-07-24 01:19:32

"finally saw it today  just some thoughts on the visual effects

1 i had been braced for a whole year to watch this movie get the explosionblast completely wrong and have the sound arrive in whatever five seconds after the flash  i am happy to acknowledge that this manifestly did not happen  in fact after they went out of their way to show the audience the sound delay for not one but two explosions prior to trinity i knew they were going to get this right  i was very pleased

2 mostly  see even though the sound arrived after a good half minute or more like a minute—movie time there were were a couple of disappointments regardless  the first was that the countdown to the detonation was classic hollywood seconds  each number counted down at a pace more like two seconds each  ten nine  for a movie that took pains to take itself seriously this unfortunately really stuck out

3 the other problem was the actual visual effect  much brouhaha has been made of the fact that they did not use cgi for this explosion  but nobody is willing to talk about the fact that this ended up thoroughly betraying the explosion as a practical effect  it did not look like an atomic test full stop  the imaginary explosion at the very start of the movie and revealed in the first teaser for that matter was as a result a far better effect  while it is very true that most movie cgi looks fakey because the artists are incapable of matching the believability of practical sets and effects this is one very solid case in point for using cgi when its appropriate  as much as the actual scene in the movie was a triumph the explosion itself was a huge letdown",2023-07-26 00:18:05
"this is the first nolan movie that i watched in english with no subtitles because movie theatre duh

i now totally get all the complaints about nolans inabilityrefusal to properly mix the dialogue sound i kid you not i must have missed about 40 of the dialogue in the movie because i just couldnt hear what the characters were saying

even the final most powerful phrase that oppenheimer said to einstein was  mumbled under his breath it felt like definitely negated the dramatic effect for me",2023-07-26 20:08:48
i also loved the storm before trinity test i only realized it after the movie that its based on reality as well it’s like mother nature trying to stop this horrendous thing from being used,2023-07-26 20:38:38
just saw oppenheimer and im a bit confused on the ending at the end when we flash back to the pond scene with einstein and oppenheimer and he brings up the calculation the one oppenheimer brought to a einstein in the woods didnt the scene where he brought einstein the calculation happen after the scene with the pond i thought oppenheimer hadnt even joined the program yet when he met with einstein at the pond and then much later on was when he brought einstein the calculation or am i just confused in the theater i thought the ending dialogue was a nod at the relativity of time and the way time does not behave the way we expect it to in quantum mechanics but upon googling it im not seeing anyone else discussing this and i feel i may have lost something,2023-08-01 00:55:22

very solid movie in my opinion found the first act a bit boring but the movie became increasingly suspenseful and interesting throughout the rest i personally loved the third act as it shows the disconnect that scientists face against policymakers who dont necessarily understand the science that they legislate definitely worth a watch,2023-08-03 03:09:23

something i noticed and correct me if i’m wrong but towards the start of the movie oppenheimer visualises a lot of the beauty in science and the universe like visualising the atom the stars energy etc but as the movie goes on and he becomes increasingly focused and obsessed about the race to win the war all he can visualise is the bomb,2023-07-23 04:30:46
as a vexillology flag design buff the one thing that really irked me is that in the scene where oppenheimer is giving a speech in front of the flags there are some inaccurate flags for 1945 there,2023-07-23 05:25:29

i’m a history nut and loved it however i went with my brothers who arnt so much one of my brothers was confused at some points so was i but we all agreed it makes sense in the end one thing i didt like was a few times it jumps around to locations and time and ur kinda just expected to know the locations also this movie dosent wait it is fast some parts almost felt like a trailer because it was showing like 310 seconds and then cutting to a different scene however it’s a really good movie it’s not for everyone but i believe most can enjoy it also the audio mixing is not the best with the dialogue in this movie it’s hard to not hear something important or what’s happening in general but the ending 3 mins might be my favorite 3 mins in cinema i had chills during it because it makes u think and just say ………,2023-07-23 15:57:05
ill give my experience i saw it at the amc in nyc times square  it was the subtitled version which helped since the sound mixing could have been better at moments  regardless the theater was full and it was mostly young people like 1630 men and women were 5050 and i even saw some women with pink clothing on so many double dipped so like some people weeks ago may have thought oppenheimer wasnt just a movie for older males young adults male or female went to watch it and it made me happy that it appealed to that type of demographics even after the movie i saw many friends groups discussing whether dropping the atomic bombs was morally correct which was cool,2023-07-23 21:15:04
the thing that  me off at the behind closed doors hearing are the questions on morality as if you can’t change your mind or it’s not as simple as yes and no,2023-07-23 22:38:00
the movie is not even released during the awards season but i think cillian murphy did so good that he will sweep this awards season based on the strong praise and early oscar buzz hes getting for playing an iconic impactful figure the modern oscar buzz pattern also gives cillian the advantage because he doesnt have an oscar yet which gives him the superiority over other oscar winning actors if they get nominated dicapriophoenix theyre gonna have to  themselves or cry on screen just to boost their chances to beat cillian,2023-07-23 23:36:31

i straight up googled can you hear the dialogue in oppenheimer and the reviews were mixed the overall consensus seemed to be that you could hear the dialogue better compared to how bad it was in tenet but it still wasnt perfect

"this was definitely one of those christopher nolans where you wont expect how the movie was directed  edited overall it was a great film that discusses the life of the person but i sort of felt a bit overwhelmed by the dialogue but for every actor that came in and delivered their lines it was very well acted theres enough story to understand how everyone felt about this situation in a timeline where making nuclear weapons could destroy the world very interesting to portray the emotions  reactions of each character

my only gripe about the film was just the timelines and scene jumping i know nolan did this with dunkirk where the 1st half is scattered then its all brought back into one sequential timeline at the end for this movie the blackwhite scenes did help not a complaint but its a unique way to show the cinematography and story together",2023-07-31 03:16:42

"genuinely well done similar to other commenters this has nothing on interstellar but this has to be higher on my nolan films right next to the dark knight the beginning was a rough start since it was going back and forth i can see people getting lost throughout the first half personally as someone whose second language is english it was wellpaced if anything the music sometimes drowned a bit of the dialogue but apart from that it was grappling my attention from beginning to end i scratched off half of my nail polish because of the quick pacing i did jump at a couple of booms

edit a lot of the critiques have been about how christopher nolan shouldve delved more into how compelling oppenheimers personal moral dilemmas affected him if im not mistaken the movie did use american prometheus as a reference and correct me if im wrong it was a biography by 2 federal agents not oppenheimer personally though nolan definitely had to research more on oppenheimer i think that the accuracy of american prometheus is projected correct me if im wrong but i think it was a great summary of the important events in oppenheimers life that led to his justification later in life i wouldve loved to see more about why oppenheimer was at his first school when he changed career focuses more on jean more on kitty and exactly how involved he was with the loyalist at a very dangerous time during los alamos other than that i think the film did great by relating the relevancy of the person who made the atomic weapon in the context of the time with the perspective of his fields reactions and concerns around the war matter 

was it me or was anyone else led on about florence pughs appearance i didnt even know emily blunt was in the film to begin with because i thought florences character was going to have the spotlight which she did in like 5 scenes compared to emily blunt everyone was so great so many familiar faces and unexpected ones made this a cast to remember personally benny safdie is hot

other than that a great solid movie that is definitely oscar nominee worthy compared to barbie disregarding popularity and more about quality",2023-07-31 16:15:16
its a bit too slow in the beginning acts for my tastes but the final act is a brilliant showcase of what nolan is capable of that final cross examination scene just before the security clearance verdict cross cutting with strauss ranting was brilliant brilliant final act and muddy poorly paced opening 2 hours that focused too much on oppenheimers communist affiliations,2023-08-02 11:48:02

"okay one thing im wondering why the mention of kennedy near the end i mean i get that he was one of the senators who swung against strauss but it seems oddly gratuitous

my personal theory is that it ties in with the ending where oppenheimer mentions his worry about nuclear annihilation to einstein after all who was president during the cuban missile crisis i feel like the point that nolan is getting at is that just as it took people going against what eisenhower wanted to deny strauss so to does it fall to people to avoid the nightmare scenario of nuclear war",2023-08-20 01:27:39

"i delayed watching oppenheimer so i had to watch it at home

i enjoyed the movie thoroughly

i walked in expecting a biopic about one of the most important scientific minds in our time and i got it

every scene was important the tension between the characters was real and the reveal of strausss role was a nice turn in the story

i enjoyed how the story of a dying star density begets gravity begets density was connected to the creation of the bomb and the chain reaction

the truman scene was an excellent connection to how oppenheimer became a pariah which played out in the security hearing and then the senate

i wish kitty was fleshed out more but  if blunt didnt own those scenes

and yeah i fan boyed at the introduction of godlevel scientists every 10 minutes

watching murphy skirt the lines around the bureaucrats and the scientists gave oppenheimer such depth and even though it was an unthinkable evil the scene planning the actual bombing gave me a new perspective and made me pause

and then the security hearing a how much i hated jason clark

i could go on

i didnt see it in imax or dolby but it stood up either way",2024-03-24 04:16:06

"personally i came out of this movie a little underwhelmed my main gripes were the dialogue feeling unnatural especially towards the beginning of the film the scene where oppenheimer reads his i have become death quote while in bed with a woman before even starting the manhattan project stood out especially but really almost every conversation didnt feel like a real conversation at all i just kept thinking people dont talk like this to eachother it felt like they started with a long list of everything oppenheimer was known for then thought about ways they could cram each piece of info into the movie 

then there was the visual representations of him having mind blowing revaluations about the universe also causing him great stress its like cinematic version of whoa look at how mindblowingly smart am i the ending where they mixed in this kind of arthouse feeling by showing the hallucinations really felt out of place  really there was quite a bit that just didnt do it for me

what i did enjoy were the performances especially rdj as lewis strauss he really killed it with that part",2023-08-09 00:51:57

before i thought of it as the atomic bomb movie the bomb being the climax the bomb scene being the reason you buy a ticket yes its called oppenheimer but still hard not to focus solely on the spectacle of the bomb given the trailer  summer blockbuster release  imax hype  so much bts talk about how he filmed that scene etc

loved this so much i was thrilled but if i had my previous image in mind this probably wouldve had a different impact because my mind would be elsewhere anticipating something that only comes and goes 2 hours in 

i think thats what happened to many here many are clearly disappointed the spectacle of the bomb itself wasnt the point",2023-07-22 02:03:01
idk if anyone else noticed but it seemed to me that the color scenes represented oppenheimer’s perspective while the black  white represented strauss’,2023-07-22 07:19:47
i’ve been going through this thread and many don’t like how anti climatic the bomb test came off initially i agreed however maybe that wasn’t the climax i think the real climax was when oppenheimer gave his speech to the residents of los alamos after dropping the bomb on japan the residents were clueless to the devastation that just happened cheering and applauding oppenheimer  was going through a life changing understanding picturing every one before him being annihilated by a nuclear bomb from that point on he made concerted efforts against everything he spent his life to achieve maybe my interpretation is wrong but that scene was really emotional for me seeing it in imax definitely added emotion to cillian’s award winning performance,2023-07-22 19:30:42

"a whole lot of people are going to watch this movie for a meme and then realize that three hours is a really long time

the time jumps in this movie are jarring i could usually figure out when most scenes were happening but it took a lot of context clues and a decent familiarity with the history of the period that i think a lot of viewers might overlook sometimes i was several minutes into a scene before they gave me some idea which storyline it was in 

there are scenes in this that make the film the gym scene was amazing the truman scene was hilarious the ending line really worked on the other hand this could have been a half hour shorter if theyd cut a good bit of the last hour the senate hearings and the security clearance hearings went on and on and on and we got the point long ago 

nolan likes reveals too much theres that namedrop of kennedy which doesnt even make sense strauss absolutely would have known who kennedy was at the time that scene takes place and einstein earlier in the movie but he goes so far as to make a big dramatic thing out of revealing what actors are playing what characters the audience is clearly supposed to go  its gary oldman wow its rami malek holy  is that josh from drake and josh the funniest one for me is that they build up a guy for like a full minute before they show his face and its just casey affleck",2023-07-23 08:42:08

this was a very solid two hour movie,2023-07-26 04:08:33
"firstly talbots suicide haunted me the blink and youll miss it shot of the gloved hand drowning her head while she screamed and then leaving the shot was so frightening i know its up in the air whether she actually committed suicide or if she was actually murdered because she was a communist with connections to oppenheimer but those brief images are just haunting the sound design was just nightmarish a lot of this film really did feel like a horror film 

does anyone have any thoughts on the nudity not like those thoughts and it made sense in the  scene 

but when they are sitting across from each other in the room in the chairs 

i thought it was supposed to mean they saw through each other like  truth type of thing like had they been in bed talking would have been one thing but they are just having this conversation spaced far a part completely  in chairs it was tastefully done and not  though pugh was gorgeous but it was just curious to me plus we never see kitty  and she didnt know of all of oppenheimers secrets so i guess that was the point",2023-07-26 08:48:18
i am become confused,2023-07-27 22:57:53
"the oppenheimer superhero costume dress up scene im crying  

overall pretty great have to be honest wasnt entirely on board in the beginning but the second matt damon barged into the room everything somehow clicked",2023-07-28 21:52:20
"i didn’t quite expect to be immersed to that level  rarely felt like i was watching a movie  simply stunning and cannot wait to revisit

i had a chat with a friend and we debated what imax would bring to such a dialogue heavy movie less action  well it elevated the experience having that monstrous screen fill my peripheral

bravo",2023-08-05 20:17:57
some person in my showing clapped during the trinity test thought it was ,2023-08-09 02:53:40
"saw it last night

i would say it was good but not great like most of nolans movies super high production value great performances looks great but something felt missing

i get that the shots were short in order to develop this frenetic pace of the chain reaction of neutrons getting cast off that explode into the long shots but i really dislike short shots so that didnt do much for me

when i heard nolan was making an oppie movie i was worried he was going to miss the most interesting part of his story which to me is everything that happened after the bomb but im glad that was actually the focus of the movie

this has been negative sounding for a movie that i enjoyed and thought was good its just that every time i see a nolan movie i think hes one idea away from making something great and instead just makes good movies  still leagues ahead of the average movie hitting the theater

i thought it was weird people were criticizing asteroid city for like parading the super cast as like a look who it is but oppie definitely had me thinking that in the first 30 minutes also this might be the movie that ends the nolan rightwing stuff",2023-08-09 12:15:23
i really liked the way nolan perfectly integrated oppenheimers private life and his work at the bomb never rhetorical i dont think its a long film but rather everything was essential to the story,2023-08-26 07:34:20
"great movie but there was something missing

maybe i just had incredible expectations for it and it somehow affect the experience but compared to to other cristopher noal films i missed breathtaking images  soundtrack characters 
dont get me wrong i really enjoyed the historical accuracy the science understanding behind the acting the images but there was something missing it didnt make me feel as much as i expected  i will have to rewatch but not in the same league as interstellar ",2023-10-18 20:40:26
finally watched it and it was much less confusing than tenet so i’m back on the nolan train have total faith he could do a bond movie now,2023-11-11 04:34:27
my favorite movie of all time i love the actors especially really really good,2023-11-23 08:25:46
finally watched it good to really good movie that could have been great acting was great for the most part rdj was great for the most part but the end seemed like it was rdj playing rdj playing strauss vs him just playing the roll as he was for the majority of the movie throwing einstein in there for the sake of having that character in it seemed contrived yet again they overstate the fear of igniting the atmosphere just about every other movie does this as well so not that big of a deal that lame thing in the end when theyre asking about the votes and the whole that new guy from mass or whatever it was when everybody knew who jfk was given he was a war hero an obvious frontrunner for the  dem ticket in1960 and joe kennedys son  also it just seemed like they flirted with the point that this was the end of scientists being in the forefront of the political debate as well vs what happened afterwards which is just build it or else and well worry about the politics,2023-12-10 23:13:45
"question in nyc there arent any shows on the 70mm imax with reasonably good seats for an actual  month do you guys think theyll extend the screenings beyond the month they have on schedule now on amc website or should i just  it up and get on the last seat on the edge of the line

im also torn between waiting for it to see it on imax 70mm vs having to go see it in the 70mm theater",2023-07-21 02:22:40
i am so glad i watched videos about world wars and history in general as a hobby as a nonus citizen id never be familiar with names like truman roosevelt or cold warrussia references and i was so happy to understand the movie thoroughly i loved it and it was so emotional,2023-07-21 11:23:57
my favorite scene was oppenheiner snapping his fingers to decimate humanity and then saying i ambecome death the destroyer of worlds,2023-07-21 13:53:55
"honestly i expected to love it but i kind of disliked it performances were stellar it looked great the music was great this is easily nolans best dialogue and oppenheimer is his most fleshed out character

but i really hate the structure of the movie there wasnt any reason to keep cutting between the different time periods and i think it mostly added confusion because its not well established when each one is and what exactly theyre talking about they vaguely mention things that were currently going on in the earlier period but not in any way that felt like it immediately added intrigue it added frustration the movie would have been far better if they had played it in chronological order im very tired of nolans time altering shenanigans at this point it worked in dunkirk because it kept the pace up and eventually paid off with them all intertwining but there is literally no pay off here to it there was also a severe lack of clarity given to the passing of time weirdly they used the glass bowl to show time passing but even then it doesnt give across years are passing by until matt damon says something about it being 4 years of work and the atom bomb is already built

i also found the movie far too fast paced i cant really tell you anything about any of the characters because theyre not at all fleshed out which makes them coming back in act 3 feel weightless and unearned which sucks a lot of the drama out im convinced thats why every character is played by a known actor otherwise there would be nothing for the audience to grab onto with each one besides maybe safdies character i think is called teller i think the only character it worked with was rami malek simply because you think  be the final nail in the coffin for oppenheimer and dont know what side he leans on cut out all of the preprofessor stuff and use that time to slow the movie down and actually let people understand what the other characters roles were this is a biopic yet it has the same ability to explain to the audience whats going on that tenet does this pace would make me annoyed and confused even with a pure action movie

speaking as someone who has never read the book or had much exposure to the project beyond the broad essentials this movie was borderline incomprehensible because of the last two points im sure ill like it better on a rewatch but i think thats more of a criticism since that comes from a place of better understanding of what the movie is trying to do and doing independent research to fill in all the gaps the movie leaves out rather than the rewatch being based on finding new layers and understanding things i couldnt have known until after it was over like prestigememento",2023-07-21 19:08:40
"positives
 performances great across the board mostly cillian and rdj
 intercut effects of opp thoughts seeing stars haunting moral thoughts gym scene was awesome
 tension in first 2 hrs 
 overall sound design

negatives
 pacing issues last hour specifically
 intercutting of 3 different timelines was convoluted and confusing at times
 trinity test itself was kinda underwhelming likely due to lack of any cgi made it feel smaller in scale
  scenes were weird and felt out of place
 unrelenting dialogue which i usually like just felt hard to connect who was who in 3rd hour without prior knowledge 
 dialogue sometimes hard to understand sound mixing sometimes had too much score over dialogue


curious what other’s thought tho",2023-07-21 20:43:36
"just saw it in imax  i loved almost everything about it with a few exceptions

1 i thought more people would be talking about the choppy dialogueediting  it threw off the pacing going into overdrive during conversations  it made it hard to follow and scenes weren’t given enough time to fully develop i wish they slowed down with some scenes especially in the first act this was my main gripe  it’s going to be especially harder to follow for the casual viewer with some of the topics discussed

2  the bomb was a bit of a letdown  the buildup was fantastic but it was obvious that they were using the illusion of zoombig  i appreciate the dedication to practical effects but they really should’ve blended in some cgi there  i trust they could make it look authentic

3 i usually preach about how good the music is in nolan films  here was really good too but sometimes the volume really overshadowed some of the dialogue  

i still would give it a 910  excellent movie",2023-07-22 02:52:18
"nolan every day for the past month theres no cgi in oppenheimer

movie comes out

this entire sub why didnt he show japan get blowed up huhhhhhhh ",2023-07-22 10:09:31
"the only fault of the entire 3 hours is the sound mixing

i am become deaf",2023-07-22 12:09:02
i just wanna give appreciation to the scene when oppy switches from the military uniform to his “iconic” look felt like a superhero putting their suit on for the first time lol,2023-07-22 23:26:15
"this movie is the type of movie where you need to know the context and have a bit of understanding of what is going on in order to enjoy it i saw people leave the theater during the first hour and i cant blame them the film is very fast paced and doesnt shy away from telling you the story the way it happened incorporating a lot of terminology used exclusively within the realm of physics and mentioning a lot of events from ww2 and the red scare these are not things the layman theatergoer will enjoy if they dont know or at the very least arent interested in them

but if like me youre a fan of nuclear physics and its history then youll enjoy it a lot i know i did easily a 910",2023-07-24 03:28:09
"reading the comments here i’m probably far into the minority but i didn’t really like it

the pacing made it difficult to emotionally invest in the outcome of any scene the entire film was a giant montage the story meandered and wasn’t very coherent i know nolan likes to play with time the visual sequences were underwhelming

i did however thoroughly love the cast and acting",2023-07-24 08:35:12
too many characters too much plot and i literally lost track of their names and gave up stellar performances across the board but it stressed me out at the end i felt like i have to take notes pause and replay to understand  is going on im probably a  so may be this isnt for people like me,2023-07-24 22:09:00
reading the comments it seems most people were disappointed nolan didnt use an actual nuke for this movie,2023-07-25 17:50:39
"overall i enjoyed it nolans film making skill is exceptional and its worth seeing in cinemas for that alone 


the build up to the test was gripping the explosion itself didnt live up to the hype but thats a reflection on me as a moviegoer who grew up on terminator movies 


the speechhallucination sequence where openheimer addresses his staff was brilliant it was so powerful that it impacted the rest of the film the stakes in the dual hearings werent high enough to overcome the loss of momentum i just wanted to know what einstein said ffs however the payoff was worth the wait and one the best endings in recent memory",2023-07-27 00:02:36
i had really high expectations going in and i was still blown away by how captivating the dialogue acting and visuals were,2023-07-29 17:27:27
"i really loved this movie but i have to admit my experience was a little tainted by how disrespectful the audience at my showing was 

multiple groups were talking during the bomb scene and tons of people were on their phones throughout i honestly dont think a lot of people have the attention span for 3 hour historical biopics anymore ill probably rewatch it once it gets a streaming release so i can enjoy those moments without the disruptions kind of a shame tbh because this really is a movie made for the big screen",2023-07-30 10:08:13
one thing i havent seen mentioned lots of 50 star flags showing up in 1945,2023-08-01 16:40:13
"so in short i really enjoyed it cillian murphy killed it the cinematography was outstanding but like all nolan films the editing and pacing leave a lot to be desired but as the title suggests i want to talk about the trinity test and how much i loved it and what thoughts i had when seeing it  
  
with the way that scene is shot it brought to mind cosmic horror something right out of the pages of a lovecraft scene seeing the fireball rise higher and higher brought images of an old one awakening from a long slumber a sight so horrible so alien that even thinking of it drives one to insanity it was horrifying throughout the sequence my hands were gripping my hair in anxiety and with the way nolan shoots it its as if the movie is telling me you were not made to witness this",2023-08-01 21:28:06
did anyone else get weirdly emotional i was so embarrassed because i started to cry at the end which is very unlike me  it was very heavy hitting,2023-08-03 18:27:09
"phenomenal film a bit slow in the third act but man there’s so much about everything here that is just incredible 

ludwig with an amazing score probably going to get another oscar

the buildup scene to the test was one of the most intense buildups i’ve ever seen on film 

all acting was superb i mean everyone just nailed their parts 

the horror elements were amazing too from the auditorium speech to the reveal of oppenheimer’s adultery

loved all the macro shots of molecules atoms and strings just pure genius all around by nolan 1010",2023-08-04 12:04:20
just saw it liked it wish it was 30 minutes shorter,2023-08-06 22:05:20
saw this film three times 1st in 70mm imax again in 70mm  lastly in standard with avx enhanced audio each time subsequently better than the last just speechless definitely a new modern masterpiece  cinema classic,2023-08-08 01:29:27

barbie was soo needed to calm me down after this epic",2023-08-10 23:16:31
i have a lot of mixed feelings about this movie its a wellmade movie for sure its also such an important story to tell but i also think it has been overhyped people were talking about how its going to save cinema and change the way we watch movies forever and stuff like that i mean its great but its not like a once in a lifetime cinematic experience great,2023-08-13 01:47:09
just saw it started off great but by the end i was waiting for the credits the constant rapid scene and timeline change for the last 30 minutes was annoying and boring,2023-08-20 00:02:20
"best academic thriller since a beautiful mind 

 but actually though i enjoyed the interstellar swirly space bits in the very beginning

also loved feynmans bongos place throughout the movie

felt like they didnt quite get the gravitas around some of the scientists bohr but thats details for uber dorky science nerds but the scientist cinematic universe was awesome and just fantastic cast in all of the little roles casey affleck was just dripping in lethal poison

heady topic handled really well 1010 would donate to spanish rebels again",2023-08-24 23:40:36
is it me or does anybody think that robert downey jr was looking like grouch marx as strauss later in life in this film  i failed to recognize him for at least 10 minutes into the film,2023-08-31 16:17:53
"the funniest  ever was when strauss and han solo were talking about the senator from massachusetts and han solo nameddropped jfk and people in my theatre gasped like they were teasing the bad guy for oppenheimer 2

edit overall a highly enjoyable movie dont think it cracks the top three nolan for me but it is still fantastic",2023-07-29 04:53:02
no spoilers but i cant wait do we win wwii,2023-07-21 14:19:40
it was a very impressive movie captivating from the beginning until the end and right up my alley sidenote as a dutch person why do hollywood movies always pretend someone is speaking dutch when they’re actually speaking german lol the one scene in leiden,2023-07-21 21:43:57
i think i just watched robert downey jr win an oscar,2023-07-22 05:27:58
"loved the movie but felt like it was edited by mrbeast that was the fastest paced 3hr movie ive ever seen id love to see a list of nolan films and how fast each scene was before it was cut because i watched interstellar before this and the pacing of interstellar was fast too but i feel like the cuts were just like nolan machinegunning the movie to the audience

probably my 3rd or 4th favorite from him which is to say its still really good just not his best",2023-07-22 13:27:12
those were the unsexiest  scenes ive ever scene in the best ways possible,2023-07-22 15:00:44
good movie but not using cgi for the atom bomb explosion was an unnecessary handicap they gave themselves that scene couldve been more larger than life,2023-07-23 01:23:54
i went with a friend who is usually apathetic about movies and only joined because of the hype throughout the movie i thought that he would be bored but after the movie ended he kept repeating how incredible it was i never saw him like that,2023-07-23 08:31:19
havent seen anyone talk about this yet but nolan is always good at sprinkling in small bits of humor throughout his movies and this one still pulls that off even in the most heavy moments definitely some successful dark humor,2023-07-23 16:28:59
was einstein the same guy who fixed bruces back in the pit in tdkr ,2023-07-23 17:40:08
can we give some love to josh hartnett dude had a presence in his scenes that i adored you could feel he was a get your hands dirty i dont believe it until i see it in action guy his relationship with oppenheimer and practicality was a great part of the movie for me,2023-07-23 18:40:02
somehow nolan combined the intensity of dunkirk and the timeline mysteries of prestige with a historical biopic and it worked,2023-07-23 22:14:37
when all the masters of their crafts come together you get a master class movie,2023-07-24 03:08:47
"honestly one of the best theatrical experiences ive experienced i normally scoff at the go to the biggest screen possible shtick as meaningless hype but i put it up there with fury road in terms of bigger the better

i go the imax in reading ma for movies i expect to be good on the big screen and the shaking seats buttkickers really put in some work

the sound design was incredible",2023-07-24 21:55:29
"i watched this movie in imax and im in a conundrum wonderful experience but i have no big rush in seeing it again and i honestly dont think itd work outside of theaters im 100 a go see in theaters kinda guy for movies like this mi avatar atsv something that utilizes the theater format to its absolute limits and this quite easily did on a technical level this film is a genuine 1010 the sound design the editing is impeccable   


but on a personal emotional level idk should i feel less intellectual because i didnt come out of the movie really feeling anything else i loved the movies technical aspects but i just dont really resonate it with it beyond that like i did with movies like everything everywhere all at once i try to not see myself as a snob but i also dont see myself as a complete normie either i loved eeaao but i personally loved top gun maverick over eeaao because it did what oppenheimer did last year give you an experience that can pretty much only be felt be truly appreciated in theaters   


the blast itself also didnt work too well for me i get the tension building i get the intention but i guess i wanted an atomic bomb to feel like itd engulf you like you couldnt outrun it like itd destroy an entire city which it did but i just dont feel like the scale was conveyed nearly as much as i hoped it would

i definitely do not hate nor love the film i feel like its a very solid 810 from me just on the technical feats alone",2023-07-25 08:27:27
"im seeing a lot of people disappointed and underwhelmed with the movie and im not sure if its because of the marketing or what their expectations of it were

personally i felt this movie was a mix of the social network and tàr part courtroom drama part psychologcial drama with classic nolan intercutting between timelines and for what its worth i feel its his best movie yet 

the trinity test really landed for me but i think a lot of people wanted to see the bang but nolan went for the psychological impact of it all with the music cutting out and i am become death right before the shockwave and i respect that and it really worked for me but i can see how that might have underwhelmed someone who was expecting a proper big bang mushroom cloud",2023-07-25 12:35:10
my main thought is this is not a “summer blockbuster”  this feels like a winter oscar movie type release,2023-07-26 01:57:51
"i rewatched the movie last night and i was still left totally baffled im definitely recommending a rewatch because it allows you to enjoy the story more after the shock on the first watch so i just want to write this down somewhere in order to remember this interpretation and try to see other peoples thoughts on it im aware that it might end up too long but no pressure in reading it all its just my interpretation of this absolute masterpiece

well obviously there are 4 of the most disturbing scenes in the movie the trinity testing oppenheimers speech after the hiroshima bombing interrogation of oppenheimer in his hearing and the last scene where he discusses the future with einstein all of those scenes have something in common the same build up music is happening each time we can hear violent violins which absolutely demolished me in imax then we can hear the loud beats
trinity countdown 
speech  people banging their feet 
interrogation  the way they start speaking louder and louder
lake scene  again we hear similar banging as in speech scene representing drops of a bomb arsenal that was shown 
and in the end of each build up there is obviously a large boomrepresenting the explosion and horror of people witnessing it

so then it struck me

1 trinity testing

        we can see oppenheimers experience of it and the way he repeats the phrase now i am become death the destroyer of worlds indicates that he realized what power theyhe unleashed into the world that also represents the start of his guilt and torcher

and then suddenly everything changes from him being the main guy now the military took the bombs away and he needs to wait to see how the military will use them he knows the destructive capabilities of them you can see him being troubled waiting in the night of 6th of august but after the bombing was successful thats just it nobody is in shock or feeling remorse instead people are congratulating him so idk i felt like when he got praise instead of judgement thats where things went wrong for him

2 speech after the hiroshima bombing 

        before the speech scene we can actually hear the violin melody again the same as in the trinity testing again the visuals distort and we can see bright flashes of light symbolizing the explosion we can see oppenheimer saying the things he doesnt feel at the moment like hes been out of his body and then him screaming in the end of the speech and people clapping which represents the explosion once again so in a way even though we and oppie didnt experience the hiroshima bomb little boy he and us gets to feel it at that moment 

even years after oppenheimer obviously still feels guilty we see that first in his meeting with the president where he says i feel like i have blood on my hands second time we see him feeling guilt is in the midst of the unfair hearing which he voluntarily accepts as some kind of a martyr at the moment his wife confronts him with sentences when will you fight back and did you think that if you let them tar and feather you the world would forgive you 


3 the hearing of oppenheimer representing nagasaki bomb

     in the hearing oppenheimer is actually being silent the whole time and refuses to fight back the climax of the hearing is when roger robb i think interrogates oppenheimer himself the scene starts with the violins playing again again the camera distorts and flashes show up during the whole scene they are actually talking about the moral of the atomic bombing and why oppenheimer declined to be involved in the development of hbomb and in the climax of the tensions both of them start screaming at each other representing the same sound from the a bomb explosion so in a way we can actually feel the nagasaki bomb  man or the second real bombing that happened from oppenheimers perspective because he didnt actually get to feel both bombs that he created he only heard of the horrors that they caused 

4 build up representing the possible nuclear war apocalypse

    and now we skip the trials all the way to the ending we can see the ending scene where oppenheimer talks to einstein about the chain reaction that they might have started nolan shows the whole disturbing arsenal of modern atomic weapons earths atmosphere is collapsing and burning we see the horror of what might happen if that happens for the fourth time the violins start building up the tension again in the middle of their convo we can hear loud bangs that represent the a bombs dropping in the climax of it all oppenheimercillian closes his eyes expecting to hear a loud boom but instead the movie ends and leaves us without actually hearing the fourth explosion so the last build up represents the tensions in the world and build up towards the apocalyptic nuclear war and absence of the boom represents the hope that humanity isnt dead and that we wont let that happen

sorry for this being so long its just that nolan created a fking masterpiece and i want to understand it better so feel free to add up something or correct me if you think the interpretation is not correct also the rewatch was amazing and i would recommend it every time 1010 movie for me",2023-07-26 10:10:24
cilian murphy was mesmerizing rdj evolved from tony stark to strauss in the monologue ,2023-07-26 17:14:05
cillian murphy gave one of the best performances ive ever seen very few times ive ever been as stressed about and for a main character than murphy here its fascinating to see oppenheimers charisma in his domain the classroomlab and then a place where hes uncomfortable and helpless the private subcommittee murphy just didnt miss the entire movie imo,2023-07-27 16:02:03
i thought there was something really cool about how this movie used the american desert town as a setpiece  a hastily built town with a lone architect ruling over the whole thing all so that they could extract as much value as they could from it  literally dropping nuclear waste all over it  and then abandoning the ruins and deciding to “return it to the indians”  not a fully formulated thought but it’s yet another layer to this movie i thought was interesting,2023-07-29 03:52:47
i really enjoyed this and will definitely be watching it again but the pacing in the first act was so jarring it honestly felt like i was watching a trailer for oppenheimer and not the movie itself,2023-07-29 23:54:58
"overall i think its a really interesting picture and a solid biopic of the man cillian murphy really does the title role justice and although there is a strong supporting cast i think only a couple manage to stand out  downey jr  and david krumholtz maybe josh hartnett 

i dont think emily blunts character was particularly well developed and there were maybe too many characters overall

the first two thirds are rapid and build a real excitement for the project being undertaken this is certainly the heart of the movie however once the bomb goes off i think the film loses its way a little

very little is done to really show the atrocities of what took place there is one scene where oppenheimer addresses a rabid crowd and it begins to suggest there is a real horror to what has happened but it also feels that a number of opportunities were lost to really do something with that 

also the final third seems more preoccupied with whether he was a communist or not as opposed to what the ramifications of dropping the bomb were obviously it was a key part but not quite what i was looking for in that section of the film and with the black and white segment reaching its conclusion you cant help but draw parallels with memento and the prestige and think nolan couldnt help wrap it in a puzzle with a surprising conclusion but what was the need for the puzzle what did it matter who was behind it all  the entire bw sequence could have been lost and i genuinely think the film would have been no worse off",2023-07-30 20:22:43
visually the film was stunning as per the usual of nolans work after reading some of these comments i find it odd that some people are so negatively receptive to a film that doesnt necessarily follow a linear typical story path the film was completely unpredictable and i loved it also the sound accuracydelay during the explosions was simply impeccable to hear and what a great way to begin and end a film,2023-07-31 08:16:06
just saw it loved it i just wish they kept the book title american prometheus instead,2023-08-02 20:20:03
"first man 2018 was better than oppenheimer cmv

so i just finished chazelles first man 2018 and i have to say all in all i think it was a better movie than oppenheimer while both are incredible pieces of work and both have their flaws if there was one more crash zoom in first man i would have thrown up the reason i compare the two movies is that theyre both about two of the most famous engineerscientists of all time and both take place within two decades of each other both also i believe discuss some of the most important advancements in science of all time and both try to capture visually an experience seen by so few  
  
both have a fabulous score but the silences used in first man really enhance the score overall the pacing in first man felt better also i would say the performances are on par i think whats interesting is i would say in oppenheimer nolan was able to make extremely captivating dialogue scenes and included some great abstract visuals while chazelle favored a more basic faux documentary approach to first mans cinematography at times some of the scenes on earth felt like watching an episode of succession but where first man really wins out i think is in those scenes that capture going to space especially the opening scene and the last act  
  
id be interested to get this subs opinion though",2023-09-02 22:50:07

nolan has created a masterpiece yes the first ten minutes are odd and the first introduction of “i am become death the destroyer of worlds” was certainly unexpected but the visual and auditory depiction of anxiety and the feeling of being overwhelmed was masterful sure maybe it’s not the best ever but of the movies i’ve seen in a cinema this is the best,2023-07-21 06:18:38
the most haunting sound design and score ive ever heard in a film,2023-07-21 08:46:27
"the movie was amazing but… i felt like it was so incredibly fast i saw it in a foreign country so we had subtitles and i tell you reading the subs trying to watch the movie and keep up with the story the different timelines while it all went what felt like 200 mph was exhausting there are a lot of things i didn’t get because of it and i feel like it would have been a much more pleasant watch if it wasn’t so rushed i really felt exhausted after the end from trying to keep up the only time we really had a “pause” is for the trinity test scene 

does anyone feel the same that being said i really enjoyed the movie especially the scene where he gives the speech after the bomb had already went off truly haunting",2023-07-21 09:03:02
did i remember wrong or did devon bostick have no dialogue at all,2023-07-21 10:12:18
don’t tell me if the bomb works,2023-07-21 14:04:51
were we supposed to see that black glove when jean tatlock was drowning herself the book makes it clear that her death was highly suspicious so i don’t know if that was intentional or not,2023-07-21 15:04:26
a very minor detail but i quite enjoyed kurt gödel getting a cameo with einstein in the woods  ill have to rewatch it with subtitles to catch all the deets of the which famous names flash in and out of the movie,2023-07-21 19:32:45
no michael caine in a nolan movie sad day,2023-07-21 20:18:13
would anyone care to elaborate on nolan’s artistic choice of the black and white scenes i feel like i don’t fully understand what he was going for were the black and white scenes just supposed to help signify the different timelines or was there more to it,2023-07-21 20:44:19
big fan of the book its based on i think i wouldve liked more of his early life and before the manhattan project but the movie wouldve have been 4 hrs long its a sense book though so i feel they did a good job adapting it,2023-07-21 20:50:53
seeing josh peck pop up really threw me for a loop my friend and i both went “is that josh from drake and josh”,2023-07-21 23:45:37
the film was beautiful i watched in imax and the scene of oppenheimer hearing screams during his speech was very powerful to the audience almost shed a tear i would definitely watch it again but felt the scenes werent cut properly too much random  and not enough emphasis on the pressure they were facing besides matt damon saying i need a date on top of that almost every scene surprised me seeing some big name side character that distracted me from the story ex why tf is josh peck the one detonating the test bomb what did jack quaid do besides bang the drums,2023-07-22 00:37:35
question about maleks character hill did the movie explain at all why strauss expected him to be supportive and then he unexpectedly attacked,2023-07-22 01:09:08
the casey affleck surprise was nice had no idea he was in this,2023-07-22 03:25:02
"and if someone builds a bigger ̶b̶o̶m̶b̶ blockbuster

as typical nolan delivers and if you love history and science or just a great movie this is it

this better win best picture best directory best screenplay best actor best supporting actor multiple best sound and others it is such a marvel of entertainment and really delivers on matching the book and history pretty well minus some of the soviet spies

they also did truman dirty truman realized the soviet octopus after the iranian crisis of 1946 created the cia in reaction to soviet intel outgunning the fbi continued the work of un created nato and started the truman doctrine russia hates two presidents the most truman and carter truman for the truman doctrinecianato and carter for the carter doctrine

oppenheimer in real life from the archives

robert oppenheimer in 1965 on if the bomb was necessary

atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki  august 6 and 9 1945  where oppenheimer says i am become death destroyer of worlds

oppenheimer interviewed by murrow

cillian murphy nailed his style but the real oppenheimer is so eloquent and thoughtful in his delivery as others mention almost a mr rogers delivery or feynman like so clear and understanding

truman

president truman announces bombing of hiroshima",2023-07-22 04:03:27
what an awesome movie experience the pacing the acting and the perfect use of silence and sound just wow,2023-07-22 04:06:02
well now we know what it’s like when christopher nolan reads a book that he likes,2023-07-22 05:50:32
it has been a long time since a movie ended and i was at a loss for words once the credits hit i was more than content with just sitting in silence for a while recently at work my projects have been based on making new things far more than theyve been about maintaining existing things and these arent dangerous things its just software but this movie should be able to speak to anyone that has been involved in a design and implementation process what makes this movie worth sticking out is the ways that this bomb shapes peoples lives before during and after the explosion and the way that nolan shows this by mixing these points in time throughout the movie the sound design was phenomenal i think the best way to describe parts of it would be weaponized silence its rare to get jump scared by things that you can see coming and somehow in the moment it didnt feel like a cheap move for tension when it happened id say 810 overall but i really want to watch this a second and third time at some point and see if that changes,2023-07-22 07:26:17
jack quaid in all his shots looks absolutely giddy to be there,2023-07-22 07:57:22
after watching oppenheimer its now time to watch the only movie i know is good but i haven’t had the courage to watch for a long time  grave of the fireflies,2023-07-22 09:04:53
"i was wondering how the movie would somehow mentionreference his famous use of i am become death

foreshadowing it during a  scene was not how i thought theyd do it

but i loved how it came back during the detonation scene since thats what the real oppenheimer said was when it came back to him",2023-07-22 13:32:37
i spent so much of the movie trying to remember where i remembered alden ehrenreich strauss’ senate aide from every scene he was in it was all i could think about it wasn’t until the very last scene of his that i remembered solo my brain kept thinking his performance reminded me of dicaprio so i had to keep pushing that obviously incorrect thought out of my head,2023-07-22 15:25:55
"im going to see it next week with my mother a now retired radiologist who taught classes on both chernoybl and the manhattan project and their impact of radiation science 

i was curious without spoiling too much is if they cover slotin and the demon core at all i know those deaths happened after the war but was just curious",2023-07-22 15:58:36
my only teeny tiny gripe with this film is that the dutch did not sound like dutch at all watching it in the netherlands me and my fellow dutchmen in the audience were very confused,2023-07-22 16:56:20
the trinity test scene was movie magic at its best i can’t wait to see this movie again,2023-07-22 18:36:17
it was supposed to be murphys movie but for me rdj stole the thunder he played strauss vindictive self like nobodys business he can be a good villain if he want to be hollywood take note,2023-07-22 20:39:48
"this was a lovely movie

i really liked the explosion scenes sound design when they were talking about distance that the closest observers would be 10 km away i was thinking then the sound should take 30 s to arrive but they might do it instantly so i was very happy when they didnt

i really liked how they portrayed his inner self some of the scenes had me feeling absolutely disgusted

so great movie 8

it did suffer from a common science movie problem though  the sitting in circles around a guy talking thing there is no way he would have given talks or had discussions without a blackboard",2023-07-22 23:16:59
"ive thought about it more i think given nolans intention of relying on things being in camera and using film this was an incredible achievement sure a larger trinity explosion would have looked cooler but i felt like the fire seeing the characters reactions and the actual sound of the explosion helped sell it extremely well


the character drama was pretty well done i basically only have small nitpicks i didnt initially get that oppenheimer was mocking strauss at all i did feel like maybe a little bit extra to sell that plot line or make it a bit clearer would have helped i know people wanted to see hiroshima and i think it would have been an interesting creative choice if during those sequences where oppenheimer was in the plane flying by at night if we had looked out his window and saw the bombing almost as if he was imagining it and he himself was pulling the trigger i think thats what they were going for with those scenes but a bit more to sell it could have been maybe cool but i just think overall it was a great movie glad i got to see it in 70mm hope other people try the format if they are going to rewatch it i might try to make the trek to a 70mm imax theatre if they are showing it in a few weeks since all the seats are sold out",2023-07-22 23:38:50
man as a guy who didn’t know the real history i did not expect rdj’s character to be the real villain bravo to him too but it’s still hard for me to not see tony stark lol,2023-07-23 03:38:02
"just got back  what an incredible triumph of film  its wild how they combined such a dense and thoughtful movie with such an intense sensory experience  just a phenomenal piece of film making

i give it a rocksolid 910 but that point off is subjective for me i totally understand 1010 ratings  my main gripe is the glossing over of the scientific aspects

my sense has always been that developing the bomb was an unreal unreal intellectual achievement akin to ants inventing a shovel but nolan seems more interested in how the ants danced around each other  and i mean i get it you cant make a movie of just chalkboard calculations and lectures  i just found it really hard to be as impressed as ive always been by the scientific success of the project while at the same time being sympathetic for someones security clearance  nolan wrought some really great drama out of a humongous historical event with help from the book of course but in a large way i would have rather seen more well nerd 

still  total crush job  they really dont make em like that do they",2023-07-23 04:15:42
"just got out i thought it was outstanding 

i liked how the story was told how it jumped from year to year i loved the focus on the science community that was developing this idea but i didn’t think there was too much oversaturation on one aspect you could probably make a 3 hour film just on one theory 

the acting was superb it was great seeing so many familiar faces even if they were covered up with makeup this film has its own weight to it but it did give me a great jfkby oliver stone feeling in that just about every scene a very well known actor appears 

just like in many of nolan’s films the use of sound was incredible when to build soundscapes when to use silence i got the chills a few times throughout the movie 

i know the oscars are pretty much baloney these days but this film is definitely the film to beat and i’m positive nolan is going to win best director 

really nice to see an intelligent well written film in the movie theater again",2023-07-23 04:27:48
i have a scene i was confused on the one about norwegian isotopes or something so they were debating if we should sell isotopes to other nations and oppenheimer said it was fine you can use a shovel for atomic energy in fact you do  but why did that  strauss edit also why did strauss hate oppenheimer so much just general mcarthyismred scare,2023-07-23 05:54:06
what was the significance of the black and white coloring during the strauss scenes,2023-07-23 05:55:32
"was hoping they’d included his famous quote in full 

but instead he said it during ",2023-07-23 06:58:16
it was a pretty solid watch for me and i think a lot of people are missing that its supposed to be a biopic and so be aptly focused more on him and his thoughts it had engaging music visuals a good opening scene but some choppy edit choices with the b and w scenes still not all that bad i enjoyed it and hope others did too,2023-07-23 12:49:46
"felt like the focus on the bombings should have been stronger im not into body horror but i felt like the body horror should have been stronger there was maybe one woman with skin peeling off in a dream sequence that could have been more graphic also the moral arguments should have been longer and more in depth i thought tokyo and kyoto werent targets because of the massive bombing campaigns reducing them to rubble already but that wasnt mentioned there was no reference to public opinion on the bombings only brief mention of the japanese no surrender resolve



could have been more effective with its runtime but i did enjoy it glad i saw it on an imax screen dont think id feel the need to watch it again on a tv",2023-07-23 13:15:56
"really enjoyed it and definitely left in impact on me once the credits rolled

the time jumps were tough to follow though


multiple times where i wished i could grab the remote to turn down the music so i could hear dialogue ",2023-07-23 13:45:36
i just came here to gush about my favorite line in the movie “rookies seek the sun…real power remains in the dark” pretty sure is not super original and meaby i’ve heard some version of it before but the way it was phrased and delivered in the movie was justglorious,2023-07-23 14:07:56
"overall it was a good movie but  the first half was so confusing i’m just glad i read the wikipedia of oppenheimer before watching this i’m pretty sure the black and white segments confused a lot of people  

white technically it is a good film there was no need for it to be non linear for the longest time i  didn’t know if the hearing with jason clarke was before or after the black and white stuff 

also wayyyy too many characters in this movie and they’re played by mostly famous people and the people in my theatre were like “hey that’s hughie from the show the boys oh that’s the guy from stranger things”

overall i’d still give it a 75 it did have some emotional moments and the last line was amazingly poignant 

moral of the story though don’t  with commie girls  and also never even reveal your political inclinations to people they are bound to use it against you",2023-07-23 14:17:55
i liked the movie there are so many little moments to think about and gnaw at your conscience oppenheimer ultimately hurt an unthinkable amount of people with this project but there are so many times where you have to wince and almost feel sympathetic for him i had a hard time following the time jumps for the first hour but i slowly got used to it the mixing in my theater was not that great but the acting hit hard and the pacing fit the kind of story it was telling,2023-07-23 16:06:33
"just saw the movie in imax really enjoyed it reading through the comments on people who are more interested in stem after seeing this or are looking forward to seeing the movie a secondthirdfourth time id recommend reading american prometheus the oppenheimer biography the movie is based on 

x200b

the man had a crazy interesting life and the film does a great job of highlighting  his new york childhood and love for new mexico studies abroad and the potential  of jean tatlock are covered very well by the movie but are great covered with greater detail",2023-07-23 21:57:41
just got back from viewing oppenheimer  loved it yet i dont think its nolans best not even close i also felt it was a tad bit too long great visuals acting and cinematography though,2023-07-23 22:04:42
i didn’t see anybody else commenting this so i must be going crazy but did they use real audio recordings from oppenheimer it was very quick just one phrase in between the speech after the testing and one in the questioning later on,2023-07-23 22:05:44
can someone explain chronologically the scene between einstein and oppenheimer strauss is inviting him for the position but this was before the hearing,2023-07-23 23:54:02
can somone explain to me the exporting of isotopes issue,2023-07-24 00:58:29
i cracked up a little bit when the camera quickly cuts to josh peck’s character and he just goes “oh my ” ,2023-07-24 01:41:17
this is the only ww2 film i can think of that has only 1 onscreen death,2023-07-24 01:50:13
looking through the thread and haven’t seen this asked did oppenheimer see the same stars inside the trinity explosion he did in his head when he was laying in bed at the university,2023-07-24 04:35:42
rdjr stole the show for me brilliant performance love to see him in a real movie again finally alden was a pleasant surprise too,2023-07-24 08:20:02
"i want y’all’s opinion of course we’ve heard nolan say theres no cgi shots in this movie
spoilers

so then the sequences in oppy’s head and the world being engulfed in flames at the end were done somewhat practically anyone have any insight as to how they did that i’m hoping for some bts features they’re probably going to be super compelling",2023-07-24 13:50:38
"this was the avengers endgame for ww2 buffs 

rdj is getting the oscar for that dinner scene with aec board",2023-07-24 15:56:34
plot question whats happening in the scene where people were having lunchdinner at a round table and moving vase around can anyone remind me of the agenda of this meeting and relevant parties,2023-07-24 21:34:59
what was the radioactivity detected over russia by the b29 if it wasn’t a nuclear bomb i’m making reference to the scene where the aec are at the table with the massive flower vase being passed around,2023-07-24 23:52:37
"lots to be said about this movie but i feel like theres already many great comment in here 

if anything all ill add to the thread is that after watching this type of nolanesque biopic id genuinely love one to be made about nikola tesla 

from his upbringing to his demise mixing in his love life inventions money issues etc his peticular mind and moral compass would be as interesting as oppenheimers to dissect keeping in mind how the movie was wrote and filmed i cant help but wonder how the exploration of his relationship with edison and the conflict of perspective would have unfold in light of what we saw of the oppenheimerstrauss relationship which was already quite captivating

all in all not nolans best but solid nonetheless",2023-07-25 06:54:35
"like all nolan films this one looked great visually with topnotch cinematography and amazing sound design best scene in the film for me would definitely have to be the trinity test also great acting all around which is to be expected from a stellar cast like this

the only negative i could think of is that sometimes the plot was a bit difficult to keep up with especially for someone such as myself who didnt know much about oppenheimer or the development of the atomic bomb going into the film the very high number of characters that were included in the film didnt help either for a casual film fan who was not well versed in this particular aspect of history

overall oppenheimer 2023 rating 910 a visual and audio feat definitely worth seeing in theaters the 3 hours didnt seem that long considering how much history was included though the plot and characters may be difficult to keep track with for casual film fans not familiar with the history surrounding the main protagonist",2023-07-25 17:02:04
i loved the use of sound in this film like the couple of seconds after the spark of the bomb during the test denotation and similarly during oppenheimer’s hearing as he talks about his moral problems with its development,2023-07-26 06:26:12
josh hartnett i don’t think i’ve seen him in movies in around 15 years…i know he did that penny dreadful show,2023-07-27 12:16:46
i have not been to an imax movie in years and idk if its an imax problem the specific theater i went too problem or just the movie problem but i could barely understand what people where saying half the movie because the back ground music and background noise was so  loud all the dialogue sounded muffled like what was the last line he said to einstein that made him depressed because i legit didnt understand what he said it was just muffled mumble he asked if albert remembered when he brought the papers about destroying the atmosphere and he said yes then oppenheimer said something and albert walked away,2023-07-27 21:46:58
dang i was mainly pumped for feynman and it did not deliver he had like 3 lines,2023-07-28 00:48:09
"very good cinematic work much respect for the achievement and incredible performances but ultimately not something i particularly enjoyed hard to say why as i like character and storydriven movies perhaps just the length and generally static pace it wasnt slow per se but just very long saw it in imax first and it was too dang loud in parts then went back for 70 mm and enjoyed the novelty of the physical film as well

no question nolan has made something great though it deserves the lions share of the praise its getting",2023-07-28 12:25:47
so the trinity testoppenheimers teams findings contributed to the creation of the two a bombs dropped on japan who made these bombs they had enough excess uraniumplutonium to make these two bombs after struggling to get the resources to make one for trinity this is just a historical curiosity has nothing to do with the film,2023-07-30 15:17:16
the  paul giamatti verizon commercial went through my head whenever einstein was on screen,2023-07-31 15:42:54
"what was that implication in the final moments of private trial with oppenheimer supposed to be about h bomb with the martyr stuff 

that he wanted things to go his way cause he wanted the whole thing to be about him so he can be a martyr why wasnt oppenheimer fighting back he wanted his whole life to be stripped apart in public so he could feel better

oppie looked really cornered in that scene but that just could be the burden of what happened making him feel guilty even though thats not what he wanted

also what was the humiliation exactly that oppie did to strauss that he made fun of big executives while coming there with him and was it that bad that it was one of major reasons why he had to go that far against oppie or was it mainly about him not going through with h bomb",2023-08-06 10:00:46
"two questions

for the blackwhite scenes was the white balance changing sometimes it had a very light tint of blue and other times it had a very light tint of green on my imax 70mm film screening at amc at universal

second were there a lot of shots where the focus seemed softoff i couldnt tell if it was on purpose or just it was so shallow it was difficult but many shots seemed slightly out of focus",2023-09-03 19:11:52
great movie great use of soundtrack saw it on my computer screen i guess he learned about what he did wrong in tenet and fixed it with the audio,2023-11-15 20:18:11
sometimes in life you encounter someone who is very attractive for one reason or the other  that person might talk and you might listen fascinated by how they look  but once the conversation is over and youve moved on with your day youll wonder what the  the person had been talking about what point they were trying to make and whether or not anything they said mattered at all,2023-11-17 13:50:06
truman scene was my fav agreed that its intensely attentionrequiring but i suppose thats what you get with a movie on this topic beginning could have been expedited a bit but ending was good lots of characters and dispositions to keep track of,2024-03-26 04:16:23
cillian murphy will win the oscar for this  wouldn’t be surprised if rdj gets a supporting character nod as well,2023-07-21 11:24:14
anyone else get taken out of the moment by the woman with the skin flapping when oppenheimer was having a vision while giving his speech it looked like they half glued a couple pieces of paper mache to her face and turned a fan on i almost audibly laughed in the theater ,2023-07-21 12:56:37
that was possibly the most terrifying film ive ever seen and not just because of oppenheimers final vision either it was because of the way petty grievances unchecked egos and the irony that both oppenheimer and strauss suffered the same fatal flaw  their hubris in the belief that they were the ones who understood the situation and could control everything  is ultimately what would bring the final vision about id love to teach it in my english class if i could,2023-07-21 13:45:19
"was anyone else disappointed with the explosion itself 

genuinely thought the detonation scene could have been a landmark in cinema history the build up to the detonation had my heart racing the ability to convey the inconceivable power and destruction of an atomic bomb detonation without using cgi would have been an enormous achievement but i just thought it looked like any other explosion  which an atomic bomb explosion isn’t 

that’s my only gripe with the movie the rest is incredible",2023-07-21 22:56:12
"i feel like your experience with the movie strongly depends on what you expect from it and who you are
if you expect a hurr durr big bomb go boom actionmovie youll be disappointed if you dont care about history physics or politics this movie wont be for you if you watch the movie mainly because you want to see the big explosion of a nuclear bomb youll certainly be disappointed yes the movie has some great images but its not about those

this movie is an amazing biopic and a dramatic look into the depths of a man who was harrowed by his own invention if you dont care about his story then obviously this wont be your movie 

some scenes didnt feel really organic to me but they were needed for context for people who dont know oppenheimers story 

the movie is not about nuclear bombs its about the insides of the man who invented them and it does an amazing job portraying just that",2023-07-22 07:05:54
nolan really tried to turn einstein into yoda,2023-07-22 11:02:05
"ive read american prometheus and this is an issue i had with it as well the strauss stuffand really the communist stuff in general just isnt that interesting like theres really not much at stake there i understand it must have been a difficult time for oppenheimer personally but why should we care if anything being stripped of his security clearance was great for his legacy as it made him a martyr of the red scare when actually he was out there naming names including implicating his students and colleagues also even having prior knowledge of the subject it was hard for me to follow everyones motivations like who was rami maleks character and how is he suddenly so important

i also dont like the trope of the scientist as some kind of mystic i remember there was one really cheesy line i forget it but the gist was youve seen into the mysteries of the universe how can you navigate the real world now the movie treats studying quantum mechanics as if its some kind of ayahuasca retreat its just math",2023-07-22 13:52:56
frankie boyle american foreign policy is horrendous cause not only will america come to your country and  all your people but whats worse i think is that theyll come back 20 years later and make a movie about how killing your people made their soldiers feel sad,2023-07-22 14:47:19
"i might get downvoted for this but im glad they didnt feature the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki for a couple reasons 

1 it would have felt so exploitative i saw a lot of people before the release talking about going to the movie only because they heard it had practical effects and big explosions and it wouldnt have done justice to the real suffering and tragedy 
2 the movie wasnt about the atomic bomb it was about oppenheimer the way he and the rest of los alamos and the world found out about the bombings was horrifying in itself  the sudden news and slow realization of the aftermath
3 the trinity test already did a great job showing the almost eldritch otherworldly horror of the atomic bomb  it was the first time the scientists who created it really comprehended what they created the cinematography did a great job of showing how destructive the bomb was  even in the middle of a desert it leaves the horror of what such a force could do to a major city uncertain and speculative to both the scientists and the audience at that moment",2023-07-23 07:05:00
i must be the only one who likes the strauss scenes not because the story is particularly intriguing but i just loved seeing the black and white scenes the strauss scenes looked stunning and i enjoyed seeing rdj play a slimy beaurocrat,2023-07-28 02:17:00
"i am not a nolan fanboy but really like a few of his films including inception the dark knight and interstellar  i did not care for tenet at all

i absolutely loved oppenheimer and was riveted throughout it was full of bold choices and i felt it was firing on all cylinders in every aspect possibly my favorite nolan film",2023-07-30 21:41:37
"it was cool and well shot but it felt like it didnt know what it wanted to be i didnt even entirely understand what it was about the bomb apparantely wasnt the climax but the trial was which seemed out of place just felt a little weird felt like several movies in one but poorly connected

also all the romancesex scenes with women should have been cut didnt add anything and just dragged it out",2023-08-01 07:23:47
"i thought the movie was fine and don’t get the hype around it not even close to nolan’s “best” work the editing was such a weird choice there were like 10 cuts per conversation there were so many cuts with a constant score that the movie felt more like a 3 hour long trailer than a 3 hour long movie cilian looks like oppenheimer but his american accent was not good enough for this level of movie it was benedict cumberbatch in the first doctor strange bad 

again it’s a fine movie 710 i don’t get why people are talking like it’s an 1110",2023-08-07 13:23:20
i enjoyed barbie but oppenheimer is on a completely different level and imo is one of nolans best films the trinity scene speech scene and final scene with einstein were extremely well done,2023-08-08 10:25:39
"the trinity  one of the greatest moment and will be remembered in cinema history everyone was so captivated that there was pin drop silence in a fullhouse theatre no munching popcorn no squeaky chairs nothing that truly showcases the beauty of the movie  its might sound generic but literally all aspects were great and work together so well collectively to tell the story beautifully the visuals the music the cinematography best biography ive seen hands downs being historically accurate while also being so much fun and captivating is truly the beauty of nolans direction im not being a fanboy but nolan deserves all the credit here most of the story is about a single person and hes the person of focus most of the time yet nolan manages to keep everyone hooked for every single moment of the 3hours even after the movie ended i just sat there till after the end of credits and not because the movie felt incomplete but rather because its truly complete and youre just sitting there thinking through it knowing what a great time you had and acknowledging thats it the movie has ended

i feel the critique mostly comes from people who lack some basic understanding of the history of the trinity project  the war and some basic concepts of the bomb

would highly recommend to watch veritasiums yt video about oppenheimer which helps a lot",2023-08-09 16:01:15
good film with some fantastic acting though i did think it was a bit overrated  it suffered from the nolan problem of every character having the same voice and i was getting bored at the interrogation scenes between the trinity tests and the end  did definitely pick up at the end again though  it also had the issue with biographical dramas where theres a whole ton of characters and events tossed in that were real and so needed to be there for historical accuracy sake but they hardly get any screentime  too many characters that you never get to know here  also the bomb explosion was kinda underwhelming even if the trinity test scene itself was incredible,2023-08-12 20:23:55
im disappointed by one small fact not one of the japanese casualty were shown  on more than one occasion they gloss over the numbers and the manner in which they died this coudve easily interspersed in the scene where addresses the class after the bombing  yet they only had to show a white woman with her skin peeling and another one crying,2023-08-28 00:28:39
"i think the movie has been out for long enough so i amjust going to say it i dont get the hype on oppenheimer i am not smart enough to put my thoughts into elegant words so i am going to borrow the words of peter griffin that the movie it insists upon itself 

i would not even put oppehemier in nolans top 10",2023-09-22 07:19:28
"yeah this film isnt as good as people hyped it up to be 

the physics part and the bomb construction and cillian murphy is good rdj is good the acting is good

but someone please explain to me why i should care about the communists who dont achieve anything in the film and why its such a huge thing also why should i care about oppenheimers security clearance especially when at the end hes still celebrated for his achievements by all his science buddies 

i think the movie expects you to have deeper knowledge of stuff in comparison to just oh thats the guy who made the nuke

its such a slug to get through with 3 hours that could have been cut down so easily but it isnt

i wish i could see what others see but from a first viewing this just isnt amazing its fine",2023-10-07 23:56:45
"what a mess of a movie i think im officially done with nolan

constant time jumping cant hide the fact that the characters were shallow the dialogue was exposition and not spoken by real humans and this movie tried to explore 3 stories and failed to explore any as a result

i burst out laughing during the third act when its supposed to be this huge twist that strauss is a villain like at that point in the movie who gives a  about strauss

woof",2023-12-25 18:04:57
i just wanna say that the black and white imax sequences were absolutely beautiful looked like an old 4x5 press camera being shot wide open which fits perfectly within the theme and time period of the movie,2023-07-21 17:16:21
"so i just saw the movie and it was pretty fantastic  
christopher nolan is one of the most wellestablished auteurs working today and this might be his biggest monumental achievement  
this is a great character study of the man who made the atomic bomb  
there are so many nuances behind cillian murphys performance as well as the writing of the performance  
all of the other actors played their roles effortlessly and both the editing and score really complement the tone of the film  
my only real complaint is that the sound mixing was a little distracting at times but it definitely wasnt as bad as tenet which was his previous movie  
  
overall im giving this a 9 out of 10",2023-07-21 23:55:08
"i have some mixed feelings about the film overall i enjoyed it but i think the first hour is a little strange and in the end exhausts you a little bit someone else said it but it feels a little bit like a very long trailer i understand it needed to be there otherwise you’re getting thrown straight into los alamos which would be a terrible starting point 

the 2nd act mostly los alamos flows much better but isn’t perfect damon’s introduction as groves seems to streamline the film and as a result makes it more enjoyable cillian also gets a more linear storyline and as a result shines more

the 3rd act i feel is the best rdj should be looking at a supporting actor nod he is absolutely convincing as lewis strauss to the point where i was forgetting it was him playing the character he is vindictive ambitious intelligent and spiteful but he isn’t cartoonishly evil brilliant acting 

cillian murphy as oppenheimer is outstanding he successfully portrays this incredibly complex character and in the end he’s not some paragon of virtue who fought against the establishment but he’s also not a despicable womaniser and coward who gave in at every opportunity he’s both and he’s much more compelling for it 

for the rest of the “side” characters i don’t think anyone put in a bad performance blunt affleck damon clarke malek oldman and whoever else were all brilliant

also i think a reading of american prometheus massively helps in understanding all the different characters oppenheimer chevalier lawrence tatlock kitty fermi einstein strauss feynman rabi tolman szilard groves pash bohr bethe robb serber bush borden etc these are all names that are really hard to remember in the space of a few hours over 600 pages however they’re much easier to follow 

overall i’d say a 7 or 8 out of 10 if it were 25 hours or even 2 hours i think it would be a 1010 but that’s an admittedly hard task for a biopic about robert oppenheimer",2023-07-22 00:42:28
i have not read through all the comments yet but one thing i havent seen is the talk about scorpions oppenheimer compares the us  russia race to scorpions killing themselves and he and strauss ended up doing that they both lost security clearance,2023-07-22 03:39:31
great movie if cillian doesnt get an oscar for this he never will rdj is fantastic even though you know how the story will go its still tense,2023-07-22 04:17:33
"watched it in 35mm  which thankfully meant there was a much needed 10 minute intermission 

i think intermissions should be standard everywhere for movies over 2 hours",2023-07-22 11:02:33
"this movie is loud like very loud

and the best part is the moments leading to the trinity test the music keep getting more intense with the countdown and everyone’s reaction and since there’s a lot “jumpscare” with loud sfx many times before you’re ready for the loudest  the bomb is going to sound

only for it happened and its dead silence truly an experience",2023-07-22 13:17:39
i don’t think nolan was able to convey the motivation of downey jr’s character to ruin oppenheimer nolan showed it in a very casual way and it was early on in the film when it was jumping around timelines quite a bit maybe i just missed it but i didn’t fully grasp it i can read why but the movie should have done it for me especially since the plot depended on it so much with the ending and payoff,2023-07-22 20:50:22
"just left the film and i thought it was tremendous if you ever get a chance visit the atomic museum in vegas they start with a description of the destructive capacity of the atomic bomb to set the stage and then walk through all of the developments up through the modern era placing each step in the context of the original bomb it’s difficult to grapple with 

visiting the bomb dome in hiroshima is also a powerful experience along with the book hiroshima by john hersey 

funny enough i first became interested in learning more about nuclear proliferation because of metal gear solid 

and then when you learn all this stuff remember it next time you assholes find yourself about to vote for trump",2023-07-22 21:19:51
i’m very curious as to how people who have little background knowledge on the topic followed the film between the nonlinear plot which encompasses a decadeplus and an everrevolving door of physicists and military personnel i feel like if i wasn’t a huge dork on the subject i’d have struggled to keep up,2023-07-23 01:58:39
"i’m wondering why nolan made jean so emotionally captivating and not kitty i actually didn’t like kitty at all as a character not that it wasn’t done well but rather not sympathetic to her at all 

the line where she says something like “you don’t get to sin and expect everyone to feel sorry for you having consequences” felt incredibly hypocritical but maybe that was the point kitty appeared to be suffocated by her life with oppenheimer and miserable not just the post partum and that line seemed like it could just as easily be said to her she cheated on her husband with oppenheimer got pregnant and as far as the movie goes the only redeeming scene she had for her character was the interrogation that line just read more as bitter than as truth to me 

jean on the other hand was very likable because of her bad qualities the use of warm colors in her scenes was intentional she felt like “home” and her tossing the flowers in the trash got a laugh from everyone the only times oppenheimer was shown being vulnerable was with her especially when he told her he’d always answer when she calls they were the only scenes oppenheimer showed any emotion other than worry 

so idk i’m wondering why he decided to tell the story that way",2023-07-23 05:50:07
"id be genuinely curious what people rate this in the nolan catalogue for themselves 

to me i can think of 45 at minimum other nolan movies that i would rewatch over this if given the opportunity to do so better movies in his repertoire im not sure maybe a few for me  interstellar prestige etc

does rewatchability factor into how great people consider a movie for example i dont think id ever watch this movie again but i can admit it was good",2023-07-23 23:12:40
so i just want to say it really was a mistake to double feature this with barbie especially as the 2nd film i needed a whiskey on the rocks and a cigarette wow,2023-07-24 03:50:33
"this whole film was perfect in my eyes but one thing that really stood out to me was when they would mention a characters name in passing they would do a quick cut to a scene with that character so you knew who they were talking about they’d say a name and then cut to a quick scene and i’d go “oh that guy ok”

movie was incredible in every aspect the trinity test gave me so much anxiety the industrial horror aspect was so ominous i almost couldn’t handle it lol",2023-07-24 17:21:18
"remarkable movie every single person was on point i loved it that final act and scene were just fantastic 

cillian murphy sounded exactly like robin williams right",2023-07-25 02:44:46
with such a long delay in between the test going off and the actual sound every time i heard the revving up throughout the rest of the movie i was always freaked thered be another explosion jump scare,2023-07-28 06:11:53
was expecting to see more scenes with richard feynman jack quaid odd seeing one of the greatest physicists of all time— considered by many to be grander than even oppenheimer himself— relegated to essentially a background character with one or two speaking lines especially given how much he contributed to the manhattan project,2023-07-28 14:44:11
"the connection between the fear of nuclear warfare and the fear of a near zero chance of lighting the atmosphere on fire

so was poisoning apples like a thing during the first half of the 20th century because the same thing happened to alan turing,2023-08-28 01:28:16
"just watched it on a big screen first impressions are that the first hour of the film felt like it was a big extended trailer for an unseen 20 minute version of the first half way way too much fast editing and over use of music to cram a lot into what should have been a chance to slow character build and ramp up to the second act

the fast paced editing didnt let up for most of the 2nd hour but actually worked to provide a sense of urgency and uncertainty for the project ironically the time between edits do slow down at the trinity test scenes and worked in my opinion

much of the third hour kinda worked but i felt like the bw scenes for strausss nomination felt a little forced like it needed to be there to counteract the oppenheimer hearing scenes

acting was incredible and should have been as even background characters where played by a listers id like to rewatch it to see if my opinion of it gets better over time but atm i feel like the recent crop of nolan films are coasting on his name and by any other director would be seen as good films rather than the genius he is portrayed to be a good 15 hour film in an uncontrollable 3 hour mess",2023-11-17 22:41:27
"i think the movie was told in layers just leading up to the final scene which was incredibly interesting and impactful but i feel it suffered precisely because of it personally i’d have preferred if they told the story linearly and just cut to that moment with einstein at the end this intercutting between timelines and constant music overlapping the dialogue became tiresome in its three hour runtime like this felt like a movie of moments not scenes 

definitely not nolan’s best he continues his alarming soundmixing technique even in this movie it’s a shame he’s such a talented filmmaker but he really needs to hire someone better for editing soundmixing  screenwriting",2023-07-22 16:31:26
funny how the reception is overwhelmingly positive yet most of those comments are negative a reminder why i havent joined this subreddit despite liking reddit and loving movies,2023-07-22 21:37:13
"nolan made a movie about scientists for scientists it was glorious 

einstein bohr heisenberg bush von braun in a quick reference to reference to v2 rockets teller loomis lawrence fermi de broglie feynman and his bongos fuchs 

they mentioned the great american labs  universities that supported the amazing physics works of the mid century
princeton berkeley radiation labs caltech rand corporation oakridge los alamos the berkeley cyclotron which brought us berklium californium and lawrencium  eta not only did they mention the sites but much of the film was shot on location on those sites  it was heartwarming

the american presidents of the midcentury who championed policies based on facts and science for early forty years roosevelt truman eisenhower kennedy johnson

what an undertaking to bring these brilliant men and women out of the dusty pages of history and put them squarely in the context of their time bravo to mr nolan for showing their patriotism sacrifice and a very different kind of war",2023-07-27 05:35:24
" exhausting i say this as a fan of nolan although i think hes 02 recently 

this editing and dialog style is something he used to use tastefully and to good impact but now days it seems like he just wants to do it for a full three hours the movie suffocates and never takes space to breathe its mostly unentertaining",2023-11-18 22:15:31
while the deafening silence of the trinity test explosion was ruined in my theater by an older woman cackling uncontrollably this movie experience was still unbelievable and so tense throughout did anyone else think that the scene where oppenheimer dons his outfit with the hat and pipe felt like a scene in a superhero film when the hero finally puts on his costume probably just me but  did that moment feel special,2023-07-21 03:54:05
"before seeing it in regular 70mm i thought it was really cool that he did the whole film without cgi and fully analog process after the movie i fail to see what he really gained by it sure it’s neat… and for 99 of the film it’s a perfectly valid choice that didn’t come with many major drawbacks but then there’s the actual nuclear explosion and yeah he captured the atmosphere of it but visually it was… underwhelming it would probably have been better to not show it at all honestly just show the light on people’s faces their reactions seeing that bigbuthardlynuclear plume that really didn’t appear much bigger than anything i’ve seen on mythbusters or  last week tonight just took me out of it and made me feel like they spent so much on looking authentic the whole movie only to skimp out on the one big explosion vfx that the whole film was centered around such a weird choice 

i really don’t think anyone at all would have minded seeing a really wellmade carefully crafted cgi nuclear explosion in the distance all the other insert effects shots looked great loved it but that one scene really did need and deserve more",2023-07-21 20:15:33
"i loved seeing all the physicist i have read about played by actors man josh hartnett was a perfect ernest lawrence and i loved benny safdie as edward teller his accent could have been thicker but would have been harder to understand but eyebrows were the best part 

im a huge science nerd who loves physics ive even been to a nuclear test site in nevada faultless 1970 1mt i really wanted to see more of the engineering side they didnt even show the massive factories in oak ridge and hanford even though i know its supposed to be a oppenheimer biopic from an engineering standpoint the manhattan project was one of the biggest success stories

also if he didnt use any cg then how did he set earths atmosphere on fire in the last scene that was cg for sure",2023-07-21 20:30:04
the first 13 of the film where hes in cambridge and learning quantum theory were honestly the most emotionally impactful for me it really felt sublime with the sound and music the nuclear explosion itself in comparison was kinda of lame,2023-07-21 20:43:35

i love the rare occasion i go into a film expecting a lot and leave it even more impressed this was one of those times acting writing sound directing ect it’s all perfect absolutely perfect",2023-07-23 04:01:01

excelent movie but that part kinda made us laugh ngl",2023-07-23 04:07:20
"as someone who knew literally nothing about oppenheimer and very little about the history of manhattan project i thought the movie while slow was alright

the inevitable bombing scene honestly was a disappointment i’ve seen the real bomb test video and the real live footage test video without audio felt much bigger and destructive than what i saw in the movie

the pacing of the movie shifted the moment rdj was revealed to be the “villain” and i was caught off guard since i really didn’t know where the movie was going until that moment from that moment on i had to digest what i was watching for the last two hours and connect what happened with who and i was engaged

on one hand if i had read about oppenheimer’s story and knew about the hearing i would’ve had more contextual knowledge of what was happening at the time of screening i still wasn’t exactly sure what kind of position lewis strauss had and what his responsibilities were

but at the same time if i had known about it that “plot twist”“reveal” that rdj is the antagonist wouldn’t have caught me off guard and be engaged connecting the dots

also i wish nolan played more into the anxiety and fear of the effect the bombs had on the world that crowd scene and the hearing when he was being pressured to explain why he had such morality change was really chilling and wish we had more",2023-07-23 15:34:36
"people going to see this for the loud explosions and anticipated suspense that comes with the trinity test are going to be very disappointed

while i mostly enjoyed the film i was expecting this to be a full story about oppenheimer and trinity test it’s more of a story about strauss rdj and oppenheimer away from trinity than it is about manhattan project

people are going to get on nolan again for making the conversationdialogue while better than batman films difficult to hear at times because the films score is significantly louder than the dialog

now for the imax shots again not the entire movie is shot in imax a lot of it is but you can see times when the screen is full imax and when there’s horizontal bars not imax the cinematography behind this film is amazing really incredible shots and beautiful imagery

matt damon and rdj both do a great job in this as well and emily blunt’s role wasn’t great but she saves it toward the end 

all in all a very good film but could have been so much more  45",2023-07-23 19:35:13

really enjoyed the first two hours of the film however i thought the 3rd act was a little out of place i wasn’t familiar with who strauss was and felt it was hard to follow so oppenheimer made him look silly and in turn he got his security clearance revoked for the aec i still do not know how important this is so strauss gets his comeuppance and fails his hearing to become commerce secretary to me feels reaaaally inconsequential to ushering in the atomic age debating if i should see it a second time as i was really enjoying it until the final hour where i stayed engaged expecting something to match the magnitude of the test but felt a little let down leaving the cinema to be perfectly honest score slaps though 710,2023-07-24 21:16:07
this movie was amazing its made me think about a lot since ive seen it i honestly feel a bit depressed this movie was devastating and extremely important,2023-07-25 02:19:40
"i personally was not disappointment by the test at all  an incredible flash a pillar of fire and an enormous delayed boom is pretty much how it went  but nolans decision to not have any kind of longdistance shot must have been purposeful and im not sure it was the right one

the sense of scale wasnt really communicated visually probably out of a desire to keep the film up close and personal  if thats his reason i get it but i can see how people would be frustrated by the result  i mean just one longdistance shot could have driven home the enormity of it  oh well",2023-07-25 19:20:09
i cant stop thinking about it man,2023-07-26 05:16:14
"i really liked it i’m not a nolan fanboy but i liked the pacing scattered story and visuals 

i didn’t go into it with any expectations or prior knowledge of what it was going to be about other than ‘oppenheimer’ so i didn’t force disappointment on myself by expecting it to be purely about a bomb instead of a biopic about a man and his life like a lot of commenters here seem to have done",2023-07-26 07:35:41
"i didn’t think this was a good movie until i left and started reading other people online completely whiff underatanding the entire film by trying to suss out “here’s what christopher nolan is trying to tell is about the cowardice of neutrality” or “see this is a movie about how evil and self centered those scientists were”

x200b

like i don’t know what iq bracket you have to be in to assume that everything has either a right or wrong “message” to it and if it doesn’’s just because you havent watched enough “oppenheimer ending explained” youtube videos this is a biography that is often directly quoting though sometimes paraphrasing what each of these people said during  these moments in history sometimes people are hypocritical or hold two views that shouldn’t mesh together but do sometimes people have complex thoughts on things that can’t be easily described or put into words as oppenheimer says during the first 20 or so minutes it’s paradoxical… but it’s also true",2023-07-26 12:05:00
"loved the film i think the final third could have been edited slightly better or even shortened

but goodness me when the bomb went off in trinity it felt like the entire theatre just held their breath the feet stomping in the victory speech as well absolutely haunting stuff

oppenheimers final security clearance hearing scene the build up as jason clarkes character keeps grilling oppenheimer it was like oppenheimer was the bomb itself and was about to explode

and not to mention that final scene with einstein i think a lot of people already realize the threat of nuclear weapons but i think that scene emphasises it more that at any time all our lives could be gone just from a single push of a button

ive also seen some people mentioning that the size of the trinity test explosion was small but i dont think that was the point of the scene the point was that oppie and everyone at trinity started the chain reaction that einstein and oppie were talking about that the path to the end of our world has started and may only escalate until our end that that scene was hauntingly beautiful

i do wish that the film focused more on trinity and the bomb but i agree that the security hearings were as important as the bomb

i will watch it again",2023-07-27 23:56:45
i haven’t seen this discussed and not sure what it means but i wanted to point it out in the beginning of the film after he poisons his teacher’s apple he is lying in bed he has a flash of a woman feeding a horse an apple i believe this to be his future wife kitty he then realized what he had done and goes to get rid of the apple when he does so he grabs it and says “worm hole” i feel like nolan is having fun here with time as if he saw a wormhole to his future life which would have never happened if he had ended up poisoning someone,2023-07-29 14:01:21
one of my favorite aspects was how nolan used the abstract visuals to get down to the scale of atoms and make them seem huge might go see it again before the imax run ends,2023-07-29 14:38:02
not sure if i heard it correctly but when kitty asked oppenheimer if it’s beginning already he said “keep the sheets in” right and then when they lost the trial and called kitty he said the same thing right,2023-07-30 13:05:43

oh and she got seats in the middle of the second row quite an experience with this out of the way

the entire trinity test had me speechless just speechless it was possibly the most intense scene ive seen in a theater and then it detonates i was in awe over the entire section of the movie

why is there such a fuss about this particular movie and its 70mm imax format i read and hear everywhere that this format is something special but i thought nolan shot almost all his latest movies batman interstellar dunkirk partially in 70mm so what is so special about oppenheimer is it because the whole movie is 70mm unlike the rest of them,2023-08-11 16:39:31

i found the sound quality of the picture difficult i had to watch it twice  i couldnt make out alot of the time the dialogue often robert oppenheimer was speaking softly or mumbling or there was great deal of noise in the background  i am guessing others might have had the same experienceand i think cillian murphy went overboard on starving himself for this role  his regular slender frame would have sufficedhe was so think he looked cartoonish,2024-03-03 19:28:01

"i’m gonna write out a full in depth review tomorrow but holy  christopher nolan gets a lot of schtick from movie snobs for making movies without subtext for the mainstream but this was legit a movie only he could have pulled off he took quite possibly the greatest and worst event in human history and turned it into a digestible and compelling story that is equal parts personal and grand in scale yeah some directors may have better dialogue or cinematography or nuance but no one but nolan can take something so much bigger than us and make it for us the way he can

side note i love how rdj  after basically making comical amounts money by just walking on set and acting like himself in mcu movies  can just casually drop one of the performances of the year by just being himself still somehow…",2023-07-21 06:48:05
"beyond anything else this move put you in his shoes and made you feel the weight of what was happening how can anyone argue that this was anything less than the most important moment in the history of mankind

smart people in movies often do not feel like real people but everything about this one rang true yea he was kinda a bad guy in his personal life yea he questioned his loyalty to his country who would not under the circumstances it would be irresponsible not to the neutrality with which this film approached the political dynamics at play was really refreshing america is not a shining force for good here there is a hefty dose of reality
like einstein said if this thing can destroy the world you would have to tell the nazis 


and then that chilling final scene yea the world is still here but for how long",2023-07-21 06:55:52
forgive me for forgetting the actual guys name but i love how one of the few people on his side was rami malek’s character who he absolutely  on with each encounter they had ,2023-07-21 07:49:34
nolans finally gonna nab that oscar if not both big ones so will cillian and rdj theyre in the bag especially rdj that was an astonishingly subdued acting job by him its the best roles of both of their careers without question,2023-07-21 08:12:35
the scene where he was giving the speech and having visions of atomic detonation sent chills up my spine,2023-07-21 08:48:12
"i honestly didn’t feel the time usually checking my watch but with this one

the sound after the bomb went off at the test despite knowing it’s coming still made me jump much better than nolan’s last outing visually a stunning picture and great turns by cm  rdj",2023-07-21 14:19:41
im planning on seeing this today  is it worth it to see it in imax 2d,2023-07-21 14:43:50
it’s funny that sean avery is apart of the nolan roster of actors,2023-07-21 14:49:31
"im sort of glad i saw this msnbc documentary first    
   
because the movie itself jumps around too much with    
the locations and chronology of oppies life experiences",2023-07-21 17:10:18
havent seen it yet but i plan to eventually do they show hiroshima and nagasaki get bombed or is it literally just the trinity test thanks,2023-07-21 18:18:33
the jfk namedrop is as hamfisted as the including my son bit from tenet otherwise the dialogue was a pleasant surprise considering its a nolan movie,2023-07-22 00:26:06
how is the explosion as compared to twin peaks,2023-07-22 04:07:36
i couldn’t hear a decent amount of the dialogue other than that amazing experience and i will be checking out one more time in imax,2023-07-22 06:12:51
just watched in 70mm format tonight beautifully made hyped to see it again next week in imax,2023-07-22 06:39:57
"richard never found out

this man is a menace",2023-07-22 07:58:26
as one of the dozens of the wackness fans i was pumped to see josh peck and olivia thirlby in a movie again even though they didnt interact,2023-07-22 09:21:22
what a heavy movie to digest i can’t help but think to the opening scenes of the movie where we see oppenheimer alone having panic attacks at night i would like to think that’s how his living days were after the war and subsequent surveillance on his life having einstein in the movie as his genius contemporary being one of the rare individual of genius in a room full of geniuses who fully understands the dread and living with the burden of not just being one of the greatest minds of our generation but having to deal with the consequences of our inventions despite our personal moral convictions to do what we believe in at the cost eliminating the enemy of your greatest threat  the same people who you helped,2023-07-22 13:37:05
we were a bit late for the movie unfortunately walked in on the scene where oppenheimer is in what looks like a bedroom throwing a ball or glass and breaking it how many minutes had i missed did anything important happen up to then,2023-07-22 15:41:58
the way time was used nonlinearly reminded me of dr manhattan from watchmen and in a lot of ways theres a lot of parallels between the two characters especially in their sense of loneliness in a crowded room,2023-07-22 18:21:04
"can someone please answer this timeline question for me

the ending scene where oppenheimer talks to einstein about the chain reaction calculations — that implies that this was after the trinity test correct because oppie asked him about that back when they were developing the atom bomb 

but what’s confusing to me is that if that’s the case why is this the same scene where rdj meets oppie for the first time",2023-07-22 18:29:18
it was definitely a movie that needed enough information of what actually have happened to understand what was going on if you dont know nearly anything for oppenheimers life  like i did then maybe you will not get too much into the movie maybe you cant expect different  from a biographic move but i had the feeling that considering that was a nolan movie and was highly anticipated it didnt had to go that much into details also most of the dialogues were very fast paced and a little hard to follow for someone who is not american,2023-07-22 20:01:55
id advise people to read a synopsis before watching the movie there are a large number of famous characters with short cameos also a lot a shifting back and forth among several time periods,2023-07-22 20:46:44
sickest burn in cinema history and its not from the a bomb,2023-07-22 21:40:04
anyone else notice how oppenheimer stepped out of his ash “cocoon” after he gave the speech celebrating the bomb being dropped he realized the consequences of his actions in a very visceral way and saw the celebration of those actions and it changed him forever,2023-07-22 22:46:04
"what an experience im a physicist so it was easier for me to follow from the start with all the characters  my wife said it was tricky at the beginning but we both agree it was an amazing time at the cinema

we saw in imax and the sound and the image  wow",2023-07-23 02:17:33
was it the theatre or the actual sound mixing that  up the dialogues in some of the scenes where the music was too loud for a movie that is so dialogue heavy i wish it was better way better than tenet though everyone acted the  out of their roles the last hour couldve been a bit shorter  great visuals as expected from a nolan movie background score was a bit too much at times basically runs for like 90 of the movie i think overall still a solid movie nolan still has that strong pull on the theater audience imax screens in la are mostly booked out for like next 23weeks,2023-07-23 02:25:03
it may not be my personal favorite among nolans catalog of films but this is certainly the most complete film and feels like a culmination of everything nolan has done the timeline structure reminds me of nolans first movie the following the introduction of the lead the event theft vs manhattan project and the interrogationtrial,2023-07-23 02:52:11
"relating to the score did anyone feel like it was referencing einstein on the beach by phillip glass the mixed meter and the swooping strings feel so phillip glass

please someone tell me im not crazy",2023-07-23 02:56:22
im happy jack quaid got to be himself  very excellent movie,2023-07-23 05:59:35
i think this movie is technical masterpiece but i thought the plot dragged towards the end nolan definitely deserves the oscar for directing,2023-07-23 13:20:13
loved the film did anyone notice that many of scenes were out of focus especially the closeups the eyes were out of focus sometimes the ears were in focus or the nose or the watch but no the eyes i would say over a dozen shots at least were like this they would’ve had to notice this while filming or editing so why do it,2023-07-23 14:41:16
all the actors were phenomenal conti played einstein beautifully and i loved the dialogue between him and oppenheimer the whole movie was an experience and i’m just so drained because of the emotional toll seriously i did not think the movie would be so emotional definitely one of the best movies i have seen and it was perfect,2023-07-23 20:52:52
rami malek was kino,2023-07-23 21:27:48
this is the one movie i wish had a more unknown cast outside of the major characters every 5mins pop up an actor i havent seen on screen personally in 1015 years and some ive seen more recently young han solo and all i can focus on is my surprise and how old some of them are now,2023-07-23 22:10:15
i was surprised to see josh hartnett in the film and then i started wondering what bhd would like be if nolan directed it,2023-07-23 22:43:42
while not my favorite nolan film you still get an eyeopening look at the creation of the nuclear bomb the events leading up to it and the person behind it overall the highlight for me had to be the execution of the first explosion  the dead silence as you first see it then the loud booming sound effects coming in all synced to everyones anxious horrified reactions were incredibly powerful the marbles symbolizing both the passage of time by steadily increasing the amount of uranium and plutonium for the bombs was such a great choice and reminded me so much of inception,2023-07-23 23:02:55
"i thought it was pretty good the cinematography and camera work were very impressive i was a little disappointed with the pacing at the start but im glad it buffed out after the trinity test

 as an ir and stem major i could kind of follow along with what was being said but there were things that went over my head definitely worth a watch  notheless the cast did a pretty decent job and the locations were  beautiful 

i give a 9510

edit spelling and grammer",2023-07-24 00:54:38
just here to say the costumes were top notch i loved cillians duster he wears in a few scenes,2023-07-24 06:57:32
"70mm imax was glorious i feel the macro full screen shots of the trinity tests fire and sparks could have plyed for 5 minutes in silence and i would have just lapped it up so beautiful 

amazing set of performances obviously murphy and rdj were amazing but i feel like not enough people are talking about emily blunt 


unfortunately only saw about 25 hrs of the movie 
our projector died just after rdj had finished lying his trap and was walking out of a house telling oppenheimer he cant protect him video cut to black quite exciting at first",2023-07-24 08:30:26
i went in with limited expectations and was very impressed overall  however it went way deeper into the postwar issues with oppenheimer than i thought it would  it really felt like the central conflict was about oppenheimers security clearance led by a corrupt political machine ie mr smith goes to washington which just isnt that interesting if you know the actual story going in  7510,2023-07-24 15:42:47
i liked this a lot its as entertaining as an accurate biopic of anyone can be the strauss twist didnt work for me as i already knew about it it probably hits harder if its a surprise i guess if i were to nitpick id say there should have been more about oppie and his relationship with his brother his early travels in europe especially his exposure to proust his reputation for being a hugely charming man with a physically imposing manner who could convince anyone to do anything i also think that the ending missed a trick in not emphasizing how physically and mentally messed up he was after the interrogations he was put through but thats just nitpicking its hard to get everything onto the screen in 3 hours and make it entertaining this was pretty good i ignored the hype as much as i could and came out happy after watching it the build up to the bomb test was very good but im pretty sure they had the probability of a runaway chain reaction igniting the atmosphere down to a perfect 0 way before the testing began the musical score owes a  of a lot to there will be blood its not a masterpiece but its well put together the acting is fine 710 for anyone who loves this movie and wants more id recommend american prometheus by kai bird and martin j sherwin which is a 2005 book of investigative journalism into oppenheimers life that reads like a thriller and paints a beautiful and sensitive and informative picture of his life and struggles,2023-07-24 15:59:02
"first half of the movie felt incredibly difficult to keep track of especially given how muddled the dialogue was i cant hear without my subtitles but the second half had me encapsulated until the end

rdj continues to prove how phenomenal of an actor he is id like to think hes a shooin for a grammy nom for supporting actor

had no idea there was a political agenda against oppenheimer so the third act of the movie was unexpected but welcome

910",2023-07-24 15:59:38

just wanted to balance my experience with what others are saying",2023-07-25 22:54:52
i went to the bathroom for about two minutes and i need clarity right after the successful test and damon and murphy part ways murphy said something along the lines of keep me informed i went right there and i came back to murphy giving a speech i couldn’t believe i missed the actual bomb going off how did that moment play out,2023-07-26 00:47:40

"this movie was fantastichowever throughout some of the cuts the explosion cuts are like super loud which is finebut  nolan dont make me too deaf im a little mixed on the explosion sounds i love it at times but i was also kinda annoyed by it a little

another thing i wanted to point out that ludwig gorrannson has done an ok score but it felt a bit too similar to tenet he should have gone on a more john williams alan silvestri howard shore route using no electronic music  the violin that his wife did for him was amazing that being said if this film was going to take place somewhere between 1920  1960 probably make the music less electronic and more different i feel like nolan loves that slow brass mass music that david julyan and hans zimmer have given him in the past he just told ludwig to make it like what my composers hans zimmer or david julyan would have done oppenheimers theme was great and all but it was super overused over and over and over

the film was also dialogue heavy and i loved that that being said at times my family who were next to me felt it was hard to understand what the characters were talking about or what the scientists were talking about but that was only for like 35 of the film so i am pretty mixed to positive on that one

overall this was a 1010 movie",2023-07-28 21:44:47
nolan transtioning from dead wives to dead mistess,2023-07-29 08:54:24
enjoyed it not my favourite of nolan and could have benefitted from a trim but feel ill enjoy it more on a repeat viewing sometime interesting in trying to balance oppenheimers political stance his ambition as a scientist and the call of duty against  so to speak without being black and white or reducing things to goodies and baddies too much jason clarkes character seemed a little overzealous in the context of what they were doing but hey maybe the guy was like that in real life,2023-07-30 15:59:38
anybody notice cillian murphy’s irish accent start to come out a bit towards the last quarter of movie apart from that everything else about the movie from the acting to the stylization to the sound design was honestly perfect,2023-07-31 08:09:18
yea yea yea murphy rdj blunt and damon were all great  but lets all agree benny sadfie stole the  show,2023-07-31 14:11:27

"i just saw oppenheimer for the first time last night and am still processing much of it of course with national cinema day 4 tickets cant be passed up

i bought the two tickets for a friend and i on saturday evening and made mental plans to watch some nolan film sunday morning or afternoon i ended up deciding on memento i havent watched this film in several years so it felt very fresh the bold but super innovative choice to tell a story in both chronological and unchronological order and so successfully has not been matched like most prominent directors nolan is a storyteller first and foremost he seems to have a mind that wants to experiment with how to tell a story the possibilities are endless

rewatching memento primed me for oppenheimer my mind was ready and open to receive new information still i was not prepared for the overwhelming cascade of the abrupt new visual audio and waterfall of emotions throughout its only been twelve hours but im still unpacking

 com·part·men·tal·ize 

that word reappears multiple times

i think i remember it being mentioned at least three times but the third time it was used i vaguely recollect that it may have been a joke comic relief its may be negligible but there are apparently more than several moments of comic relief throughout as im learning while reading others discussions rdj had few of course  but wow he played that villain well shoulda seen that shift coming but when it did happen my  modern evil personified",2023-08-28 16:52:02
when does oppenheimer leave theaters,2023-09-04 00:04:05
did the movie make any reference to schrodinger i am trying to remember whether i missed it or not he lived around the same time as oppenheimer and played a big role in quantum mechanics too,2023-09-16 03:45:32
finally got to watch the 70mm on friday it was outstanding an experience that’s enough to make me think i won’t be able to rewatch this again until there’s another 70mm showing,2023-10-16 14:51:41
"i loved it it isn’t the action packed or cgi atomic bomb movie alot of people where expecting but instead it was a great story with great character development

i liked the tone and setting of the movie how depressing the whole process was as soon as the project started the first half makes you feel excited about whats to come and then the second half of the movie kicks you back into reality and shows you how an ‘idea’ can be terrible even for science 

the consequentes will crush your spirit and will make you lose hope in humanity
i thought it captured this all very good

hot take barbie and the whole barbenheimer phenomenon is the only reason this movie has become a critical darling because it is not very good its easily an hour longer than it needs to be choppy rushed overstuffed with quite a lot of pointless material that the viewer just doesnt care about and apart from looking and sounding good its just not a great experience you dont really care about the characters or the events and unlike a show like chernobyl where the dread of the consequences of nuclear power is palpable and nightmarish this is all very detached and cerebral,2024-02-24 03:49:30

"most of the people that ive talked to after the movie didnt like the last hour or so i personally think that the third act after the bombs on japan drooped was brilliant but i feel like people would appreciate it more on second viewing or if they had more historical background mostly because the whole political drama had so many moving parts and characters

and does anyone know how  they made the whole nuclear apocalypse sequence with no cgi",2023-07-21 13:09:30
the people who compared it to the social network hit on the nail the final act is a whole courtroom drama can understand why some people were disappointed with last 45 minutes but man no one is giving the dialogues the credit it deserves here it was like nolan brought out his inner aaron sorkins with this film every performance with their delivery made the movie interesting also reminded of la confidential in the way the script was structured definitely need to watch more times to fully give a score,2023-07-21 14:45:41
the jump scares in this were more effective than any horror movie ive seen in a long time,2023-07-21 17:50:39
im speechless oppenheimer was  insane cillian murphy was so good man what a actor he is and that last scene between oppenheimer and einstein was perfect wow what a experience,2023-07-21 18:41:35
i can’t imagine walking from this into barbie without some significant time to shake off the funk  but it’s nolan’s best in years if not decades imo the first time in a very long time that i felt he cared as much about his lead character as he did about the concept,2023-07-21 19:35:11
i really liked the film the comments ive seen about not caring about the strauss and oppenheimer dynamic dont make sense to me the whole point of the story seems to be the development of godlike destructive power against a backdrop of unjustified human belligerence be it genocidal like germany or petty like strauss strausss grudge was unimportant yet he and other humans like him and like all of us are the ones wielding this important destructive power this is directly pointed out when strauss and others were speculating about what oppenheimer and einstein had discussed,2023-07-22 00:21:49
no way this movie is better than interstellardark knightinception right,2023-07-22 01:50:58

"im sorry but nolan shouldve inserted the actual footage of the trinity atom bomb test with a little bit of cgi trickery  into the test scene portions of the film are in black and white anyway the practical effects detonation in the film looked like a large propane explosion instead of an atomic detonation

edit heres hd footage of the actual trinity test   ",2023-07-22 10:56:52
"couple of thoughts

1 the scene where oppenheimer lectures in dutch was kind of a slap in the face as a native dutch speaker i couldnt understand a word either dont do it or do it better
2 the actual explosion  loved the soundtrack here but i expected a bit more in the visuals i dont feel that it lived up to the hype
3 i see some people discussing the pace of the movie i loved it it really gave that feeling of continuously building up to a certain plot point kind of mimicking the rush to get the project done

otherwise a really great movie",2023-07-22 11:03:31
best part of the movie was when good will hunting solved the equation on the blackboard,2023-07-22 11:06:53
i think this movie stomps on its own message a lot by spending less than 30 seconds discussing the japanese people who were underneath the bomb very on brand for the characters in the movie but raises the question of whether this story needs to be told,2023-07-22 21:08:09
the first half of this movie feels like you started watching 20 minutes in i’m aware they were real people but it feels like i’m watching a sequel or something and i’m supposed to know everything about these people already where’s oppenheimer’s exposition,2023-07-22 21:41:56
"that bomb testing scene was imo one of the greatest scenes in cinematic history the iconic visual the incredible sound design the edge of your seat build there is something special about a filmmaker who can make you nervous about a moment when you already know the outcome 

this movie and specifically that scene was nolan’s magnum opus",2023-07-23 03:03:48
"i just want to say that above all else this film left me with a deep longing to know more a yearning to study these abstract concepts that these brilliant scientists navigated with dexterity and genius

i regretted not taking my education so seriously as i left the theater i wish i had seen this movie when i was 14  it would have set me on a course to study physics and quantum mechanics and things that can change the world

i wonder if any young man or woman is seeing this film and setting a course for magnificent scientific achievement…i hope so",2023-07-23 05:42:45
"interesting that the poll results currently have this with a median rating of 910 yet the majority of comments seem to be from people who didn’t like it at all lot of quiet appreciators i guess

fwiw i scored it 910 thought it was a near flawless biopic that far exceeded what i thought was the ceiling for how much i could enjoy a biopic about a theoretical physicist",2023-07-23 08:24:20
"i feel nolan could have left an hour of this film on the cutting room floor it was just too much in my opinion and i love movies but this was a case of grandiose expectations from the director i didn’t care for the non linearity i’m watching a biopic with a lot of different eras and  ton of characters it would have been nicer to slow it down and let the audience work it out through a normal timeline he could have still shifted the einstein scene at the end to make it more powerful i simply feel the director could have condensed an hour or so of that movie into two 15 minute scenes and made them connect with the plot much better it seemed so excessive i didn’t think matt damon was a great fit for the role of the general something seemed very off about his performance 

overall i think this a 65 out of 10 music was fantastic and perhaps the best part but as per usual for cns work it was mixed so terribly it was hard to hear any dialogue or any other background noise",2023-07-23 14:42:43
"why isnt anyone talking about the scene where oppenheimer convinces everyone that they should still go ahead with the bomb even though germany has been defeated

deeply insidious scene from him",2023-07-23 15:57:03
"just watched for a second time in 70mm  i think its alot better the second watch

id say the biggest weakness of the film is that its hard to know what story its trying to tell on the first watch  and because you go in without that context its easy to be confused by whats going on in some of the early scenes

once you understand the context those early scenes flow well and communicate the message clearly

i think it could have used a title card maybe to explain a few of the basics for first time watchers like who strauss was and some of the time frames for different scenes  it wouldnt really detract from any of the scenes but would help people understand whats going on

very good movie though  its easily my favorite from nolan  knowing what i know about the manhattan project from reading feynmans book it seems mostly pretty accurate

i think the people complaining about not showing hiroshimanagasaki are being   the movie is about how bad nuclear proliferation is and how terrifying nuclear holocaust is you cant make a spectacle of the deaths of a hundred thousand when thats your message

also im personally glad the movie is softer on american communists while portraying the anticommunists much worse  i think its sensible to dislike communists who leaked information to the soviets but as kitty says most communists didnt really support that  i think it more or less portrays the political situation accurately with american communists being questionable by sympathetic and the anticommunists as almost lunatics",2023-07-23 23:17:56
"honestly i’m still trying to take it all in this was an incredibly powerful experience and one i’m thinking about constantly over the last couple of days this is a movie that makes me want to pull out all the cliches when it comes to describing a truly great film tour de force cinematic masterpiece etc etc the writing acting directing pacing music  it all just comes together perfectly 

that scene in the auditorium after hiroshima with oppenheimer addressing the crowd might be the best thing nolan has ever put together the final scene with einstein gave me chills and there’s so many scenes both little and small in between that blew me away can’t wait to watch it again

also for a 3 hour movie this seemed to absolutely fly by i don’t think i’ve ever felt that way in a movie this long before it was that compelling

another thing of note…this is a very raw emotional and human movie in a way that nolan’s films usually aren’t",2023-07-24 05:15:27
"the trinity test scene was something else the absolute silence and eventually the lines from oppenheimer immediately followed by the blast was so powerful and something i’ve never experienced in a cinema

also never experienced such a impressive ending in a movie the buildup with the music and the lines are just amazing",2023-07-24 06:12:57
"i cant believe it was 3 hours it felt like 2 and a half if that i absolutely loved it i suspect i will appreciate it even more on a second viewing

my only main gripe was the test itself i just dont think they managed to convey the immense power of the bomb the scene leading up to it was extremely tense and done so well and then the detonation itself was a step down i know nolan wanted it all practical but i think that scene would have benefitted from some hybrid cgi or something just a little the real test footage looks so much more terrifying",2023-07-24 13:40:44
"spoiler 




i agree with another comment here the lewis strauss storyline was not as engaging the last bit of this film couldve benefited more from the moral dilemma scenes i felt they should have sat in them a bit longer same with the scene where oppenheimer was mourning jean 

the trinity  worth the price of admission alone though howeveri felt that the actual explosionmushroom cloud was lacking i know hes anticgi for this film but i felt it couldve benefited from it even just a touch up still the entire sequence is one of the best movies experiences ive ever had",2023-07-24 20:36:34
"one thing i always expect from christopher nolan movies is the good oldfashioned visual spectacle achieved through practical effects while some may not care about it for me the use of practical effects adds a sense of wonder that cgi often struggles to achieve remember batman flipping a truck in downtown gotham or the gravitydefying fight scene in inception where an old movie trick was utilized

when i heard that nolan would recreate the trinity test using practical effects i couldnt wait to experience the awe and terror of that on the biggest screen available to me the buildup to the detonation scene was fantastic with the initial silent flash followed by the actual explosion it appeared as a good movie explosion but it lacked the uniqueness i was hoping for – resembling more of a common gasoline explosion or a fast fire rather than the aweinspiring footage weve seen of the real trinity test

the snippets shown in the trailer of the fireball expanding and hitting the desert were missing from the actual scene only appearing as brief flashes earlier in the movie trinity being the centerpiece of the film left me feeling somewhat disappointed compared to the impact of real footage i had anticipated a little more movie magic to simulate the sheer power of an atomic bomb",2023-07-24 21:05:03
"unpopular opinion movie was meh so many opportunities to be great but to me was overhyped for what it was 

you have one of the most interesting topics in the history of the world an amazing cast endless budget and we get 3 hours of mostly closeup dialogue

bomb scene was great as was the speech to the frenzied audience wish they had put more effort into the rest of the movie or cut it by an hour seemed like a lazy river of a movie to me 

everyone else seems to like it though so what do i know",2023-07-25 14:06:48
"first i thoroughly enjoy nolan films interstellar is one of my alltime favorites as is dark knight like many people but sometimes he misses like tenet tenet was just okay really nothing wrong with it its just an okay film i think oppenheimer is in that same group

i was really hoping it was going to focus more on the manhattan project and some of the lives lost during the creation of the bomb itself i thought the detonation was a letdown especially when compared to the actual footage of the trinity test the questioning was focused too much on whether oppy was affiliated with the communist party and i think many parts could have been left out or at least shortened up a bit honestly there were moments where i was just plain bored 

all that being said the actors performances were top notch everyone crushed it and it was refreshing to see rdj in a drama again where he can really flex his skills cillian was onpoint that man can say so much with just his face especially his eyes its incredible 

would i recommend this one yes i would never discourage someone from seeing the film watch it and see what you think i think this one just isnt for me like tenet wasnt for me nothing wrong with it maybe a little long but just okay",2023-07-26 03:24:51
"a movie like this this long i have too much to say more than you’re likely willing to read

one of those movies that makes you sit back afterwards and feel humbled that we get to consume entertainment at this level 

nolan’s jumpy storyboard works a lot better for nonfiction recounting than it does for fictional stories particularly with the historical context this was a very nonlinear movie yet i found it very easy to follow given it’s ties to real events i’d like to see nolan go down this path some more 

i have a biology degree with minors in chemistry and physics hearing names like fermi and heisenberg and bohr spark memories for me and part of the reason this film is so great to me is the directorial skill executed on both historically important and scientifically fascinating subject matter with that said i can see 80 of my friends being so lost and confused that they would leave the theater halfway through this was much less approachable than interstellar in that way but i’m thrilled to have seen it nonetheless it felt like a little masterpiece made just for me",2023-07-26 05:44:39
haven’t seen a single comment on it yet but one of the biggest things that stood out to me was the pacing of this movie from the very first second the film starts it seems like a ticking time bomb up to trinity what a spectacle nolan does not miss,2023-07-30 05:30:26
i finally saw this and it might be my favourite film of the last 10 years im seeing it again next week in imax,2023-07-31 01:19:43
"just watched the movie mesmerizing i was glued to the screen from start to finish a mesmerizing performance by cillian murphy the script was tight and the directingcinematography were also mesmerizing

i loved most three elements of the film

first was that they didnt glorify the test atom bomb explosion as could be expected from nolans previous works of elaborate actioneffects it was more depicted as an imperfect wild and untamed force it was a bit  even

the second was the depiction of the disjointed irregular and aimless nature of oppenheimer i just lack the vocabulary to explain it he was given a goal an aim a purpose by general groves before that he was simply highly intelligent strongwilled and highly energetic person whose energies he barely contained even his jewish comrades didnt know who he actually was his whole life was a disjointed mess it felt like at his core he didnt know who he was he lacked purpose i had the impression that the real person oppenheimer was a deeply disturbed and unhappy man throughout his whole life maybe thats false but since this is based on his autobiography which is considered an accurate and important work im inclined to believe so anyone who knows more is welcome to enlighten me

the final element was the depiction of the political side of the whole ordeal a group of people in a room made decisions about how many people to die and where that scene was chilling i was devastated the magic of the movie collapsed and i was back in the real world 

i didnt understand a lot of the political stuff  so many names parties etc i may have to look things up

overall i was left with no words after that brilliant  iconic and beautiful  last shot no words just sat there and looked at the credits and listened to the ominous music with only a burning furnace of all kinds of emotions in me i cannot give less than a 10 to this movie i think that it is nolans best movie and perhaps my favorite of his

edit some nice moments when oppenheimer got the apple from bors mouth worm holes i like how they touched upon the feud not sure about the right word between mathematicians and physicists which i read upon recently as a lay person i found those two funny",2023-08-02 20:39:51
i loved the movie but call me an idiot i really didnt understand the beef between strauss and oppenheimer as well as the reasoning for the us to question oppy so much,2023-08-04 15:12:26
"chiming in after seeing opp last night my history with nolan is mostly positive and slightly complicated his editing choices have often felt too fast and choppy to me but that can sometimes serve the movie well and might not bother me i despised tenet though as it was loud choppy confusing and felt like a mess it was the one that shook my faith that nolan could continue pumping out blockbuster hits now onto opp

i really liked it the score the cinematography the acting are all a1 and i have no complaints seriously the cast is stacked here and it was awesome to see robert downing jr in a role outside of marvel again and a sadfe brother rami malek i was obviously having a blast with the cameos my favorite scenes are the trinity test the security clearance scene where they show him feeling exposed and  and opps speech after the hiroshima bombing 

and while i thought that speech scene was a fantastic way of expressing the duality of the situation youve accomplished a scientific breakthrough but its now been used to extinguish thousands of lives i wanted more of that after that speech the remaining act seems to alienate us from opp choosing to instead go for twisty reveals by withholding information from the audience while i think that fits well in this movie a fastpaced and what seems to be a strict retellingshowcasing of events i still find myself struggling with the fact that we lose that emotional core by moving away from opps internal struggle 

early on in the movie nolan shows opp having visions of dread in some really fascinating ways as he hones in on quantum mechanics and its uncertainty like having him in bed visualizing the atoms spinning at unfathomable speeds and later envisioning stars swallowing themselves infinitely and later after his speech with the background warbling and seeing the audience distort into radioactive aftermath i would have loved to see that visual design carried into the third act more having these visions become more grotesque and surreal as he grapples with his participation in the creation of this frighteningly destructive and otherworldly weapon those visions are still there and i think they work when theyre on screen but what i really wanted from the movie after that trinity scene was to spend more time with opps psyche and less time with senators film could be the best medium to explore that emotional and mental conflict so it feels like a bit of a missed opportunity 

overall i thought this was a great time though and yet another movie from this year i would recommend to almost any avid moviegoer the editing and focus can be strange felt like we were getting barraged with 1 minute vignettes every once in a while but theres still some very impressive filmmaking and composition here that well be thinking about long after seeing it 

355 ",2023-08-05 12:08:49
"loved it overall the auditorium speech the deafening stomping the crying couple and his student throwing up… the feeling of dread was enormous and the ending scene were all big standouts and haunting as  great great movie huge rebound from tenet it was mostly just dudes in rooms talking but i had this dread throughout the entire thing and it was really well shot and edited didn’t feel 3 hours long and held the entire theatre’s attention the whole time liked seeing rdj being able to show some chops at the end too even if they did make strauss almost cartoonishly villainous at points also had no idea casey affleck was in this but his scene was one of the creepiest and more unnerving parts of the movie can’t imagine how scary it’d be being around one of those wackjob cia types that could just end you whenever they wanted 

and the sound for the big bomb not kicking in at first was great made a person in my theatre scream for their  life when it finally happened ",2023-08-07 02:32:43
i think this movie was perfect example of how not to tell a story there were three good stories here and none of them really got told the three stories that could have been told were the challenges of making the bomb but i get that it was done really well in  man and little boy the story about the conflict between the general and oppenheimer over the need for secrecy while working on the project the story of who leaked the information to the russians and how they turned on eachother which resulted in oppenheimer being hung out to dry  they kinda touched on that last theme but not really because we really didnt see how it impacted oppenheimer emotionally or practically everything appeared to take place behind closed doors and it was just rather boring as it was portrayed as insignificant,2023-08-07 15:46:56
i’m going to need to watch this again with subtitles i felt the trial scene was very drawn out and possibly unpopular opinion you don’t necessarily need to watch this in imax yes the couple scenes with explosions were stunning but i think this film had far fewer visual effects than most nolan films that make an imax viewing worth it but i still enjoyed the film 6510,2023-08-08 01:15:08
my gf didnt like it and i want to die i was so moved by it,2023-08-09 04:05:35
i saw it on tuesday in one of the best theaters in the nation in full imax and im frustrated by how good some aspects were while others were not  i dont have the time to get into everything but i cant believe how simple some of the writing is  and my biggest issue with the movie more than anything else was that the constant swapping from imax to letterbox just seemed so arbitrary  there seemed to be no reason why wed establish a shot of oppe and einstein in imax for one second and then simply cut to another angle and its no longer imax  just film the whole  movie in imax and make it beautiful or if you cant then come up with some kind of artistic decision around which shots are imax and which ones are not  even something as simple as exteriors are imax and interiors are regular  or something more interesting like a certain character is larger than life and is shot in imax while other side stories are not  but the randomness of it was frustrating and it seemed they didnt even attempt to keep a constant color temperature between different shots in the same scene  just like avatar 2 with the flipping from 48 fps to 24 fps doubled back and forth this was a massive distraction and would love to hear it defended or explained to me,2023-08-10 21:44:20
"it’s really good but me and both of my friends agreed it would not have suffered by being trimmed by about a half hour by the third act we were so mentally exhausted by the constant barrage of sweeping orchestral music laid over casual conversation that we were getting headaches

but yeah amazing performances all around beautifully shot and edited score was good just way too loud in a lot of places

i saw it in 70mm true imax not that liemax  and it was a stellar experience but the movie is 100 too long i understand and appreciate how big this story is and how much they fit into that three hours but the last 30 minutes were a bit of a struggle for me not because of the quality of the film but simply because it was over 25 hours of staring at a screen and being assaulted mentally i was actively ready for it to end that entire investigative hearing could have been trimmed down to just a couple of minutes and gotten the exact same point across imo the movie should have cut back to the conversation with einstein by the pond right after the scene where oppie delivers the victory speech to the cheering crowd and starts hallucinating then ended

would have landed just as hard 

rdj was amazing but i was just starting to clock out mentally that far into the runtime 

overall 810 though",2023-08-14 13:26:08
i’m a native english speaker but   did i struggle to understand some of the dialogue,2023-08-21 06:00:59
"amazing actors amazing visuals  as always with nolan
unnecessary convoluted editingstructure wooden dialog that leans too heavy into explaining stuff  unfortunaly it was too much for me didnt click
also  i hated the soundtrack no themes just violin noise terror and stock rythmn  especially in the bomb scene man",2023-12-10 19:19:49
"chris nolan seems to be under the impression that a constant barragesupply of information that the viewers have to follow like holding a slinky tied to a jet ski makes for a good drama and its always been his issue from the very beginning characters explaining things to each other in the most hamfisted obvious ways the constant exposition dump that every single one of his movies suffer from it also doesnt help that nolan decided to frame the entire movie on one of the least interesting aspects of oppenheimers life  that he had some communist ties and that doesnt clear his security clearance like who gives a flying donut  and no one in the movie really does apart from strauss who is only using that bit of information to bring oppie down cause he made him look bad a bit in the past its so lame like seriously why the  is strauss such a big part of this movie also rdj did fine but he does not deserve the award hype he is getting 

  
also somehow the titular character of oppenheimer is completely undercooked there is not enough focus on his moral quandary between the pragmatic aspects of the development of the bomb versus the guilt theres plenty of the movie telling us that he should be conflicted but we barely get to see his inner turmoil through action apart from some cheesy fantasy sequences where they emulate the nuke effect from his pov like i  started laughing when that ladys skin started coming off with its  makeup effect also oppie is written to be such an indecisive spineless   he constantly cheats and cries about it hes totally for the trinity project until he sees some newsreel footage of the devastating effects of the bomb on the japanese and then he finally feels bad like what the  did you think would happen oppie when truman scene came on i wished gary oldman slapped the  out of him overall a pretty disappointing lengthy film that definitely has its good parts but i feel like its one of chris nolans weakest",2024-01-12 23:50:08
this movie is still amazing when you don’t have people yelling about how “long and overrated” it is it’s a little difficult to sit through for 3 hours but it doesn’t have any actual filler scenes and people saying it’s glorifying the bombings really miss the entire point of it  overall it’s one of the most engaging and thoughtful movies i’ve ever seen,2024-03-12 15:52:23
like i understand nolan is all about making cerebral movies but being bombarded with nonstop backandforth dialogue which you cant afford to miss is not my idea of an enjoyable movie its nolan on coke,2024-03-25 10:04:09
really disliked it style over substance florence pugh with simultaneously the most interesting sketch of a character and one of the most laughable moments ive ever seen in a best picture with the bhagavad gita no reason for the length in comparison killers of the flower moon flew by and was actually interested in telling a story awful sound mixing and score well maybe not awful but just downright exhausting drowning every moment of impact when it should have been adding to it no interest in coherent scenes or structure  baffled by the positive reception for such an interesting story with such an interesting assembly of historical figures to be completely butchered it felt like a film students experiment,2024-01-27 14:07:13
"maybe i just wasn’t paying attention to the marketing but the entire movie i was going “wait is that dane dehaan is that josh peck is that jack quaid alden ehrenreich rami malek”

i know there was a review that said the sound mixing was a lot better than before in regards to understanding the dialogue maybe it’s cos the characters spoke fast or my hearing sucks but i honestly only heard and understood the dialogue like 70 of the time sucks because people are saying it’s his best script yet and i wish i could understand all of it

i’m not familiar with the history of jean tatlock so maybe i missed it but were there quick cuts of her death one of them showing a hand drowning her was she killed or did she commit suicide

i like rdj but i genuinely wasn’t expecting him to be that good in this movie he killed it and being unfamiliar with the history i was genuinely surprised with the twist knowing it now his reaction to his humiliation was really well done

i must be a child because i genuinely couldn’t stop giggling when “i am become death” was first said during the  scene of all things you could also feel the audience cringe when blunt looked into pugh’s eyes in that one scene

speaking of the pure silence during the trinity test was wonderful you could feel everyone being in awe of the visuals i braced myself for the inevitable sound jumpscare but it still got me

overall this was a great movie wonderful performances and haunting ending can’t wait to watch it again hopefully with english subs this time lol",2023-07-21 04:50:58
as a new father the crying baby scene was horrifying,2023-07-21 12:46:11
"good movie  the framing device worked for me and i think thats sort of important because telling the whole story chronologically would have been a real drag in the third act  

certainly not my favorite nolan movie but i think he made the best version of this he could make",2023-07-21 16:40:20
immediate opinion is that i really enjoyed the ending and the loop back to the chain reaction and icbms destroying the world a nice depressing metaphorical cherry on top of a movie about a tool that can  thousands instantly,2023-07-21 18:53:43

feel this is gonna be a big film bro movie not necessarily a bad thing i would say enjoyed it but my friends were kinda taken aback by the politics since they expected a more war centric plot at least from the trailers,2023-07-21 23:29:55
the movie was spectacular on technical level i think i went in with too high of expectations i really felt like there was no need for this movie to be imax not saying what they showed wasnt well done but it tempered my experience felt like i was on waiting mode for most of the movie especially with how they teased imax scene showing waves and molecules i wouldve loved it if they replaced the political focus of the movie to exploring the making of bomb and deeper into oppenohimself overall good watch but couldve been better imo i need sit with the movie and i think knowing what type of movie it is now ill probably appreciate it more on second watch,2023-07-22 02:42:21
whatever they paid the sound designers needs to be doubled,2023-07-22 02:53:06

"the film was great  but isn’ odd that the most disappointing thing in the film was the nuclear explosion for me at least after all that hype it was a letdown

but the rest of the film was great so more than made up for it is it one of nolan’s best not imo but still very good

but the whole marketing thing about “no cgi” was obviously a lie the very last shot is from space nukes going off",2023-07-22 07:56:11
"a monumentally important story told in great detail and on a block buster scale while focusing intimately on one man in the center of it all its outstanding and im very excited to see it again

great dry humor scattered throughout too im genuinely happy this is a summer movie",2023-07-22 21:02:22
"i thought it was good you have to be in the mood for it and i agree with the comments that its a 10 episode series crammed down thing is though with those series people always complain that it should have been a film so here we are 

my ooooonly gripe which is more to do with my personal taste is although these films are good they have zero rewatchability 

i cant see it being a good watch at home",2023-07-22 21:52:06
"in the beginning of the film there was some text overlay that said “part 1 fission” or something like that…

…then there were no other text overlays for the rest of the movie i expected there to be a 2 and 3

"i feel like this movie was trying to be everything to everyone and ended up being spread so thin that it couldnt say anything it didnt have time to say much about oppenheimers politics his mental health struggles stances on nuclear weapons mccarthyism but it sure did want to touch on all of them

the closest this came to having a theme was the hurt oppenheimer put people though but even that was spread among like 15 different characters pugh is in what 10 minutes max out of a 185 minute movie strauss is the emotional climax of the movie but hes absent for most of the middle 23s his relationships with tellis and lawrence were fascinating and had some amazing performances but they were crammed in with so much other stuff that they felt crammed in

theres a tremendous amount of fluff that just goes nowhere for example roberts brother really didnt need to be in this nor did the first half hour of the movie",2023-07-23 13:06:06
"i thought it was hilarious that oppenheimer has an actual suitup scene 

with intense music during and after hes literally just walking down the street and theres massive organs playing in the background

im talking about after the guy with the glasses tells him take off that  uniform just be yourself",2023-07-23 14:41:03
people shouldnt downvote people just because they didnt like the film,2023-07-24 16:45:35
maybe i just wasnt in the right headspace to watch the movie or maybe the suits binge i was enduring just before leaving for the theater left me numb to court hearings but i felt like the los alamos timeline was the only thing that really felt compelling to me the rest of the movie was just kind of white noise i genuinely dont remember anything that was said,2023-07-25 08:24:57
“grave of the fireflies” should be required viewing after oppenheimer,2023-07-25 15:14:29
i felt more complete and inspired at the end of oppenheimer as i felt the movie ended on an intellectual high with some great dialogs and brilliant acting in the 3rd act on the other hand barbie failed to tie all of its sub plots together to bring about a convincing solution for the conflict setup in the first half of the movie added to that the ideas and writing became sloppy and too lazy in the end which was not helped with the open ending climax to summarise i felt low after barbie but not after oppenheimer,2023-07-25 22:50:05

this will probably anger the nolan fanboys but i felt like once again the female characters didn’t get muchany development…",2023-07-21 12:48:21
"the scene in the room with the bleachers was so chilling and i think the stand out moment from the film

my only critique of the movie is i feel like they were a bit indulgent with showing off florence pugh’s body 

it made sense in the scene where oppe is being questioned and we visually see him being  and vulnerable along with his wife’s reaction to hearing him document his affair 

it just felt like they reduced her character into a  object instead of a full person",2023-07-21 16:16:58
"i wanted to love this but id say there was about 30 mins of brilliance and the rest left me pretty cold

there wasnt enough build up with straus to make the reveal have any real heft and more generally i didnt feel the stakes of the courtroom stuff considering all the time that was dedicated to it  or indeed any emotional investment into the potential consequences the jumping between timelines or even just rapid cuts in the same timeline in the third act were tedious at times

for me there was so much potential in there for something that was a more straightforward character study of the weight on oppenheimers shoulders and the dissonance of being responsible for this terrible and brilliant thing  the bits where they did explore this were the best for me 

the romances felt really hurried and unnatural to me too

for very different reasons it reminded me of watching thor love  thunder where i felt i had reached saturation point with some of taika waititis worst qualities  this really laid bare some of nolans for me",2023-07-21 19:02:38

"this movie is like caviar i recognize what im consuming is quality well made well crafted well prepared but i dont love it 

i love christopher nolan but much like dunkirk i find oppenheimer an incredibly well made movie thats not for me 

the performances are incredible across the board this film might have one of the most stacked casts of all time seriously theres so many scenes where a well established actor shows up for what could have been an extra that aspect is awesome cillian murphy may have just solidified thats hes one of the best actors of this generation

however the three hour runtime occasional forced dialogue and the fact the movie peaks in the middle really hurt it for me the last hour felt like a slog 

if you like movies like the ides of march charlie wilsons war and all the presidents men id highly recommend it",2023-07-22 05:15:00
the trinity test was very underwhelming it was very obvious that instead of seeing a nuke going off miles away we saw a large conventional gas explosion going off a hundred feet away the decision to go all practical really harmed the impact it couldve had the explosion didnt have any debris being thrown into the air around the base because you cant do that practically without even more obviously giving away the small scale of the explosion couldve at least used vfx to add it in it was pure fireball in the gasoline mushroom cloud vs a real nuke that pulls up so much of the earth below it into the air,2023-07-22 08:06:38
a lot of recency bias with this film i feel in one year everyone will look back and say ‘yeah that film was so hyped up and didn’t really deliver 100’,2023-07-22 08:41:32
i am a massive christopher nolan fan just saw the movie a masterpiece indeed i just wish they spent more time on the science part and building the bomb and cut some of the political stuff at the end i just couldnt empathize too much with oppenheimer at the end all his punishment was to revoke his security clearance they made it appear that he got exiled or tortured for 30 years in an underground dungeon it would have been better to focus more on the bomb building the climax happened too early in the movie nevertheless a solid 910 movie we are lucky to have nolan in our lifetime,2023-07-23 02:43:59
"7510

i went in with huge expectations but the movie honestly didnt click for me sure it was an excellent movie in terms of filmmaking the cinematography and score definitely stood out but i felt like nolan could have done much more with the plot and dialogue 

a lot of it played out like a courtroom drama with cheesy dialogue eg the groves line and the significance of the strauss reveal felt forced even oppenheimers security clearance getting revoked was not a huge turning point for his character given how much of the screentime and attention it got

i wonder if the movie would have been better with more of oppenheimers interactions with jean and kitty to portay his cognitive dissonance",2023-07-25 03:27:49
every single scene in a nolan movie feels like its meant for a trailer  theres this weird energy to everything,2023-07-25 23:41:55
i was a bit disappointed in the story every bit of it that was about physics and the manhattan project and the military and the war was quite enjoyable to me but that was significantly outweighed by the political drama that surrounded it to me the choice to anchor the film in the strauss hearings was a mistake sure they interrogated oppie about his misgivings and regrets but we didn’t really get enough of his personal struggle with what he was doing and what he unleashed imo the interrogation was a clumsy way to tease that out some of my disappointment comes from what i should’ve realized by the title this was a movie about oppenheimer the man first and foremost and the thing he is most famous for the manhattan project is almost glossed over it’s background i think that was a mistake in storytelling,2023-07-26 05:40:08
"am i the only one who feels underwhelmed with the atomic bomb test 


i kinda felt that at the start of the movie when oppenheimer was having visions it looked way more spectacular and immense like the one in the trailer i thought it would be more of that",2023-07-26 18:30:01
"we watched this right after barbie  so many similar themes that it gave me the shivers    


the themes death  men with deep insecurities  how to deal with change  political power    


my favorite scenes  
1 truman felt like he had the burden of responsibility as the man who decided to drop the bomb  so truman was super annoyed when oppie oppenheimer felt like he was responsible as the man who headed the project that created the bomb   oppie couldnt even conceive that truman would feel like the responsible one otherwise he wouldnt have said it the way that he did    
 im the martyr  no im the martyr    


2 strauss thought that oppie said something to einstein to cause einstein to ignore strauss that one time long ago  in the end it was revealed that oppie had mentioned again to einstein the possibility of destroying the planet by burning the atmosphere  so strauss wasnt being discussed einstein simply had bigger things on his mind  even if this didnt happen exactly it was so true to human nature  so many ridiculous rivalries start off as petty misunderstandings or from fear and feelings of insecurity or inadequacy    


3 when oppie was crying after jean tatlocks death  all womanizers including oppie do what they do because they are trying to compensate for some inadequacy they feel about themselves  as someone who was never right for jean but indulged himself anyways he felt some measure of responsibility for her death and that led him to feel responsible for the atomic bomb deaths as well",2023-08-03 09:17:33
"it was good

nice mix of the urgent ww2 efforts with the lingering concern of the future risk different views on martyrdom truman was portrayed as a bloated  from oppies pov of course but he did give oppenheimer a reality check the pragmatic policies mixed with the madness 

minor annoyances
 the strauss plot felt like a forced attempt to repeat the vibe from the prestige of a personal rivalry some mysteries sprinkled in as a red thread throughout the film followed by a reveal with flashbacks maybe cause one guy was named borden  the replaying of the einstein pond scene and isotopes are more useful than a sandwich really reminded me of the flashbacks from prestige 
 the constant over dramatisation  especially in the beginning felt ridiculous to see robert bored in his dorm room and going to museums to the sound of bombastic strings 
 those abstract graphics why trying to say he has a beautiful mind
 the usual problem with biopics so many scenes they were all fine but many felt non essential like camping with josh hartnett the worry over the communist killer many parties",2023-08-04 00:03:08
the trinity test scene was a true masterpiece i loved every bit of it and yes it was surprisingly not boring for being a 3 hour movie,2023-08-06 01:53:59
saw the movie yesterday i was hoping for a little more on why oppenheimer opposed the hbomb and less on the trial drama slightly disappointing how it turned into a typical dramathriller with a moustache twirling villain at the end,2023-08-07 09:09:43
"i really enjoyed the movie sure the female characters are underwritten but no more so than most of the male supporting cast i thought it was actually quite well paced i didnt feel like i was sitting in a chair for 3 hours the story kept its momentum

i think my only real criticism of character portrayals would be that the first  scene really didnt need to be a  scene he and jean had an intimate relationship but they were more of an emotionalintellectual match than a physical one irl so having that first scene of them together just being a still intimate talking scene with their clothes on i think would have been more representative of the real people on a similar note i think one of the  scenes shouldve been with his wife cuz apparently she had to teach him all about how that stuff goes but its possible that emily blunt just wasnt up for that 

i could probably nitpick other things but overall i thought the movie was really well done and accomplished what it set out to do i think the unscreen portrayals of these people were very interesting and seem to have been mostly accurate
i really appreciate it then bringing attention to the fact that a lot of these scientists working on the bomb or jewish and it was initially intended to be used on the nazis not japan thats a really important piece of context that i think too often goes overlooked",2023-08-08 14:56:59
"i couldnt understand half the dialogues i am not a native english speaker but i havent had the issue so bad with other films i watched in the same imax theatre i think nolans use of nonstop background music during all the dialogues and especially when the dialogue is spoken slowly hushed tones makes it completely inaudible 

did anyone feel the same",2023-07-22 03:17:37
"i need to see it again but i can’t stop thinking about that casey affleck scene

genuinely felt like the farmerhans landa scene from inglorious basterds or the basement scene from zodiac

affleck’s interrogation was tense as  and there was a foreboding atmosphere that filled the theater masterwork by nolan",2023-07-22 09:09:56
"a lot of people saying that oppenheimer trial was not important and his communist stuff was not needed in the movie well let me just say that was indeed the most crucial part why because the impact of his atom bomb directly effected the cold war which is why communism vs american philosophy in the movie directly defied oppenheimers later life

people really thinking that usa dropped the bomb to make japan surrender are dead wrong after germans surrender it was only matter of when japan would surrender while usa was making their own plan soviet were on the verge of invading japan these made it necessary from usa perspective to make japan surrender quickly they also wanted to russia to see the real strength of their power by dropping the bomb 

then when nuke happened and ww2 was over  but the main war between usa and soviet had just begun after the world war soviets got their own bomb and hence the new age of fear and anxiety that world was on verge of being destroyed by two different ideology started for more than 50 years this is the ultimate war that oppenheimer had to face he was facing the challenge of his ideology on one side and his home country in another both of whom had the power the destroy the whole world by his creation every thing that happens on the trial is pitting his beliefs and his creation with one another without that this is just a movie of bomb which would have been forgotten in a week 

but the movie focuses more on morality ideology and creativity which will be discussed on who was wrong and right for years to come the movie was never about the world war 2 or about the atom bomb but rather it was about consequence of those things to oppenheimers life",2023-07-22 14:48:06
it’s wild how breakneck the pacing of this movie is when 98 is people standing around talking  loved it,2023-07-22 20:51:13
ive never said this before about a movie but its both good and boring if thats possible,2023-07-22 21:11:21
i found the movie a bit underwhelming direction editing music and acting were top tier but the story felt rather weak,2023-07-23 12:05:08
an hourlong trailer followed by a mythbusters episode followed by a political thriller,2023-07-23 18:32:49
one of the best films i’ve seen got to see it on digital imax my whole body was clenching when they began the trinity test and they showed everything in silence and when the sound waves from the bomb swept through the cast the whole theater shaked i thought that was a genius move i loved the color grade reminded me a bit of kodachrome music and the acting was phenomenal,2023-07-24 23:37:37
"loved the film  9510 would be a 10 out of 10 but as always nolan needs to fire his sound guy i suspect its due to the amount of dubbing required due to the use of imax camera the scoresound effects were excellent however

i really got a sense of the duality of oppenheimers success becoming his own mutually assured destruction

this film was never about the bomb it didnt even really need to be shown it was the human reaction to the most powerful force ever released every human 15 alive knows what an atomic bomb going off looks like

the presentation 70mm imax was also an experience within itself

this was a film not a movie",2023-07-25 21:05:51
"am i correct in that this movie about 10 minutes in had a caption onscreen that read

 1 fission

and then no other caption ever appeared onscreen again

it seemed like it was going to be a storytelling device like his version of chapters of every stage that occurs during an atomic explosion but i dont seem to recall any other captions throughout the movie no captions regarding what year they were in no captions when they went to another area

so as for the movie i think its three distinct stories occuring in three distinct parts of oppenheimers life and they shouldve been edited so that they mostly stay separate sorta like the aaron sorkin steve jobs movie

i cant make any sense as why some scenes where in black and white we even have one scene in which they meet at a lavish round table and some of those shots are in bw and later on in the movie they are in color i dont know if its meant to represent flashback or dishonest recollection versus presenttense and truthful depiction

the scenes involving oppenheimers personal life and personal drama are just not handled well nolan simply does not know how to do this type of drama adequately

i want to compare it with how damien chazelle is able to create a logical emotional throughline with neil armstrong of course its probably because chazelle doesnt rush through it like nolan did here we have scenes in which cillian murphy and emily blunt are riding horses and then 90 seconds later theyre kissing each other with dramatic music like as if weve just witnessed a key pivotal relationship moment it just doesnt connect its flat

the imax 70mm viewingum i cant really say that its necessary theres only one key shot in which its perfectly framed for the aspect ratio and not only that id say that this movie contains a somewhat noticeable level of film grain 

trinity bomb test i think they spent too much time having the camera on the actors instead of showing us what it really feels like to look at a bomb i was expecting a shot in which they show the entire area being lit up like its the middle of the day

final hour actually gets into a pretty good pace and interesting storyline except i think the climatic moment doesnt really feel impactful the movie just gets loud at that moment

i know its a copout to say this but this shouldve been a 5hour hbo miniseries",2023-07-26 04:54:19
"710

i have watched this twice 70mm imax and in dolby cinema 

acting and setcostume design are excellent however dialogue was drowned out by the stupidly loud soundtrack this would have worked better as a nolan miniseries they crammed too much in 3h and the editing flashbacks and color shift were unnecessary the senate hearing and the security clearance hearing were overly long and the trinity explosion was underwhelming compared to the nuclearrelated documentaries i have seen 

since i was the only who had read american prometheus in my group i think nolan did a poor job explaining all of these different characters and their motivations few people could hear the critical dialogue

the prestige and interstellar and dark knight remain nolan’s best movies imo",2023-07-30 19:53:31
"loved it

as someone who shoots occasionally video and primarily photos i want to address the comments that say shooting in 70mm was pointless i think a lot of people would say me shooting in 35mm film today is pointless because sure i could get a recipe for protra 800 or something right but its not the same if im shooting something even if its for a client or a friend or job or whatever theres still a part of me thats going to do it for selfish reasons those being that i am a huge fan of using another tool

and thats what imax 70mm essentially is right its another tool for him to use if i had the opportunity nolan had i would shoot with that camera as  as i  could i like the more full frame look

i dont agree this didnt need to be 70mm imax doesnt need to be a crazy action movie or sprawling cityscape for the justification to be in imax 70mm",2023-08-04 16:59:44
i get that the movie is supposed to be about the people behind this historical event but the unending stream of closeups of characters faces whose ensemble grew exponentially with every scene made me feel dizzy it was like watching a giant zoom call most of the time,2023-08-07 08:55:29
"i watched it with my dad in august 1 but neither of us really knew what to make of it as the overall cinema experience was terrible and we both didn’t really know what it was about other than the guy who made the atomic bomb

just rewatched it on my own tonight and oh my  it is the greatest film of all time i totally get it and i absolutely love it it just so epic",2023-08-18 21:31:28
positives i really liked how the camera work shows oppenheimers isolation with closeups of his face and dutch angles the soundtrack was neat at moments i felt as if i was watching interstellar the trinity test scene is great murphy was really good nothing extraordinary but real solid work negatives the movie was really tiring when the strauss twist came about i was just like huh alright i turned it off around the 2 hours 40 minutes mark and i dont really feel like finishing it as far as ive heard the ending isnt really that satisfying and now my biggest problem it is too long most if not all of the mccarthy stuff could be removed without any detriment to the movie also it is a bit of a wasted opportunity nolan couldve focused primarily on oppenheimers guilt instead of politics but welp i feel like it could have ended with the gym speech scene where he sees the audience get vaporised by an atomic blast the screen fades to pure white and we get the end titles for me it was 345,2023-08-26 00:59:28
"i think the general audience consensus on this will be that it’s kind of a masterpiece but it drags on for too long after the bomb drops i saw a lot of people in the theatre checking their phones constantly in the last 30 minutes or so while at least 3 people actually got up and left the theatre seemingly for good 

i think that this film is like a beautiful puzzle wherein the pieces are laid out slowly onebyone until we finally complete the picture that is the atomic bomb at the centre 

out of the 14 films i’ve seen in theatres this year it’s easily the best the only issue i have is that you need to know a lot about the players involved to really understand the importance of the meetings in the film which may not be the case for all filmgoers 

i’ll probably go see it again before its imax run is finished it’s a lot to process but it’s very rare for a movie of that length to keep me engaged like oppenheimer does if you aren’t into dialoguecentric movies and you’re expecting heavy hitting action i’d probably stay away from this one tho",2023-07-21 13:35:57
unpopular opinion but what’s the point of seeing a movie like this in imax when it’s mostly a dialoguedriven movie,2023-07-21 14:07:30
so…did anyone else think the sfx for the trinity was kinda…cheap lame i expected some visuals like the first time you see gargantua from interstellar but it looks like they just blew up a huge drum of gasoline i dunno,2023-07-21 21:17:09
"i think the flaws in nolans execution can be summarized in the scene where florence pugh is riding cillian and inexplicably takes a break to go through his books happens to find a book with sanskript writing and makes him read it out loud while she rides him again and what words does he read out loud

i am become death destroyer of worlds lol so  dumb",2023-07-22 08:52:15
"mark hughes review is the most accurate in my opinion

the review starts several paragraphs down after some preamble about the box office some snippets of quite a lengthy review

oppenheimer is ambitious and includes many mesmerizing often brilliant moments but those moments cannot sustain themselves nor find common ground as a single compelling narrative or perspective despite seemingly global and even cosmic themes it winds up feeling decidedly contained and restricted eyes cast downward abandoning any visionary search for higher meaning behind the processes of science or politics

and

not that i just wanted a big cgi nuclear explosion — i understand what this film is meant to be and i know all of the arguments and points made about how and why war and destruction and armageddon shouldn’t be casually treated as entertainment and why a wouldbe morality tale shouldn’t glamorize or glorify nuclear holocaust as an “achievement” but the moment including actual restored and enhanced footage could and should easily convey the dread and largescale impression of absolute extinction — and the reactions of oppenheimer and others witnessing it — can add to these themes the film includes a few nods in this direction posttest just not as much as i expected this is the central moment of oppenheimer’s life it’s why we speak his name today and why this movie exists and why his warning reverberate so i just feel it should’ve been a more central moment in the film instead of getting less screen time than and roughly equal emotional representation as his love life

and this just sums it up for me most accurately

i am a huge fan of nolan’s work regardless of whatever criticisms i’ve offered over the years i fully expected oppenheimer to blow me away and be one of my favorite films of the year i imagined it would be on my top 10 list for 2023 and one of the primary contenders on my list of best picture nominees instead i’m disappointed and would have a tough time sitting through oppenheimer again

my general feeling is that nolan is much better at inception  interstellar style films and this would have been handled much better by someone like spielberg with his schindlers list hat on 

thought the stuff with florence pugh was utter nonsense and totally egregious however true it may have been it added nothing to the film i was riveted at times completely lost in the movie then suddenly acutely aware of just how long i had been sat there thought there were some fantastic individual performances rdj in particular

also can you hear the music by ludwig göransson is a sensational piece of music",2023-07-24 10:05:29
"there were stretches of the movie where it was utterly brilliant the trinity test the clapping speech hills speech

but as a whole i was bored this nolans style didnt really click for me i have seen dialog heavy biopics from other directors and loved them so much bridge of spies comes to mind but those movies had lot more tension suspense the stakes were felt

here it just flowed with not much of anything entire world was at stake but i didnt feel it time was ticking apparently but it wasnt shown what was so great about getting the clearance what did he accomplish which he couldnt before how was their progress being seen by the higherups what was the blocker and why did it take 3 years for the bomb to be completed 

3 hour biopic but none of it is explained some really do have boring answers it took 3 years cause its hard and needed lot of reasearch there was no boogeyman stopping them in that case deciding to make this a biopic even was a mistake 


nolan could easily have written an alternate history sci fi where they create the same atomic bomb but with a better story he could have had his cake practical effects for nuclear explosion and eat it too his very own suspenseful time bending story",2023-07-26 21:11:27
"i enjoyed this movie 710 overall but something about nolans directing just falls cold with me and not just in this movie the endless quick cuts the lack of stillness the timeline jumping black and white no now its colour another movie with the dialogue issues hes had a great career but hes also gotten shots at projects that i think other directors could have done more with i think theres a lack of true geniusability with nolan

the film also just should have focused on the manhattan project the true beating heart of this story the stakes of his later career and political battles were just so insignifcant compared to what happened around the development of the bomb im sure this is a common criticism but those last 45 minutes were just tedium",2023-07-27 04:52:11
only christopher nolan could create a film that i still can’t comprehend what actors are saying despite me paying full attention in an imax theater,2023-07-28 14:53:49
"man i feel really underwhelmed its good but no where near the masterpiece people made it out to be

felt very rushed but also dragged at the same time 

the explosion scene was phenomenally done and the ending was fantastic performances were great as expected from this stacked cast

but i dont know i just didnt like it as much as i hoped i would maybe needs a rewatch",2023-07-29 13:42:43
"this film blew my mind it scared me the ending left me quite speechless the extreme closeup on oppenhemier with the background distorting as his reality breaks happens in other scenes where he disassociates too is so incredible cillian murphy has to get an oscar

what a shocking ending though serious slap to the face we will either die of nuclear war or climate change maybe both ",2023-08-05 00:02:55
"had the immense privilege of seeing this in imax 70mm 
my first takeaway is that this is the best movie i’ve seen this year nolan  did it rdj for best supporting actor",2023-08-05 02:19:23
what was the point of the plot lines of strauss and all those interrogations for oppy’s security clearance those took up two thirds of the movie and for what good lord that was way too long,2023-08-06 04:59:54
why didnt bryan cranston play hiesenburg,2023-08-06 20:44:59
it was ok cillian murphy killed it as did the whole cast but its too long and the first two hours are edited like btier mcu fair imo nolan just doesnt have it anymore for me,2023-08-14 00:07:36
"i watched because i love most christopher nolan movies but mannnn  me and my gf had to stop and pause this like 20 times to try and understand certain words that were not in our vocabulary and to try  remember which characters are being disussed and what all the political jargon meant and damnnn we still probably missed like 70 of what would have otherwise made it exciting to watch

often i found myself bored but trying desperately to understand what was happening lol

id like to consider myself a fairly intelligent person but i just couldnt understand the dialogue hahaha",2023-12-15 03:27:16
i feel a lot of people in these comments were expecting a giant cgi exploding with oppenheimer jumping in a fridge last minute to survive the blast,2023-07-22 21:59:41
i was disappointed  i dont mean to exaggerate or overstate anything  i really dont remember the last time i was this bored in a movie theater  the sequencing and scene changing style that persisted through the movie were really not for me i also found the dialogue to be too onpoint with no filler and it felt super unnatural like an actual conversation got chopped into pieces and only the relevant information was spoken  i dont think ive ever gotten either of those 2 impressions from a film before and they really took me out of it  lastly and probably most importantly i just thought the story itself was not exciting  im glad everyone else is enjoying it but im sure my partner and i arent the only ones who just didnt really get the hype  its a neat history piece that i would watch for the same reason id watch a nature documentary if i was in that mood but it wasnt a big exciting blockbuster in my opinion,2023-07-23 17:34:58
"i went to the theaters excited for what i thought was going to be an intense and cerebral movie but i left unimpressed and rather bored 

1 the movie’s overbearing score and frequent flashing sequences left me exhausted when those elements of the movie were actually important 

2 the “twist” in the movie felt anticlimactic the source of the twist came out of nowhere without enough character development 

3 the first hour of the movie rapidly changed scenes at a pace that made each scene seem unimportant to the plot of the movie 

i’m not saying that the movie was terrible it was still a good movie but it’s not one of the “greats” nolan has definitely done better work",2023-07-24 13:48:52
"lets take away all the bells and whistles by which i mean the fantastic sound and visual effects which are par for the course in a nolan film and this film is 3 hours of a congressional hearing you have vast amounts of exposition and dialogue of a very technical subject matter obviously they didnt delve too much into the science of nuclear fission and rightly so but the point stands and the machinations of washington politics and mccarthyism set over a booming soundtrack 

it just felt quite jarring and wasnt particularly engaging cant help but feel the subject matter would have been better suited for a limited tv series i would feel particularly hard done by if i saw this in imax because beyond the explosion there werent exactly numerous visually captivating scenes",2023-07-28 23:30:14
"no need to go out of your way to see this on imax or whatever  the visuals were disappointing

it was a good movie  710

would never watch again though

i was expecting more test scenes and being blown away by the visuals  

was basically staring at murphys bone structure for three hours",2023-07-30 02:23:18
i guess i’m the only person who thought it was boring,2023-08-06 03:49:23
"this just didn’t do it for me

the subject had high potential and murphy is a perfect pick for the character yet his was only explored so much up until the trinity test — after which my interest vanished it started well though exploring his psychological complexities but where the movie lost me was with the whole russian spy accusations and communism storylines which could have been greatly reduced 

the women roles in the film are sadly pointless einstein lacked any depth and wit as we should expect from such a legendary person the dialogues between him and oppenheimer could have been iconic then too much music at the wrong times the many dialogues composing the movie’s action unchain way too fast with few pauses and to me just lacked sensitivity or heart

the trinity sequence was good with a relieving moment of silence

the black and white scenes are stifling visually it’s nothing fantastic and overall the images don’t really live up to my expectations for nolan and imax 

and again the moral compass being the crux of such a subject i wish it would have been fully explored yet in the second half murphy’s oppenheimer seems almost invisible dormant rdj’s was a big question mark for me the character doesn’t add anything of value everything feels stifled flat unimportant the ending leaves little remembrance

in the end it’s way too long the pacing and rhythm are off feel obnoxious and the story never breathes i like nolan and his work with momento prestige inception interstellar but this was another waste just like tenet",2023-09-12 23:04:43
"i personally think the movie was over hyped i came in with to much high expectations from people saying its phenomenal one of christopher nolan best movies produced within decades besides interstellar 


cons  the begging was strong flashing back an forth within scenes killed it for me it was annoying how there wasnt enough time for the audience absorb the information and breath just flash information flash dialogue flash next scene 

 i wish there was subtitles because the background soundtrack were overlapping with dialogue at certain points of the film 

 there was little character development some characters appeared on film because they were important but i didnt know who they were and what happened to them

i dont wanna bore you anymore but everything else was amazing the actor visual effects emotions etc",2023-12-30 12:39:31
i enjoyed the movie although like many i have criticisms ill hone in on my biggest one which is that i think it was an artistic mistake to not show the destruction of hiroshima and nagasaki it was intentional on the movies part they wanted to be subtle and only reference it but a major theme of the movie is they wont understand until theyve usedseen the bomb so show the audience show the actual instant incineration of a hundred thousand souls,2023-08-07 16:53:37
"nolan or some fan should release the film with the scenes in chronological order for a biopic having to jump between discussions was tiring getting yelled at by multiple sources took a toll on oppie as well as me

acting was great but i hope wardrobe and makeup get praise i was able to see it in the 70mm imax form there were some nice tracking shots of walking and scenery as well as  beautiful closeups of actors but i believe it isnt all too necessary to travel and find a theater 

i will grow to appreciate the film more with subtitles and viewing it alone rather than in a packed theater",2023-08-16 22:29:10
just finished it one of nolans weakest films imo,2023-11-30 02:32:03
couldn’t stand it every scene felt rushed and the dialog was too choppy it felt like i was watching a 3 hour long trailer it was a race to the end and yet there was absolutely no payoff they tried to fit too much story into short scenes when they should have slowed down to help ground the audience and allow for actual character development acting was great but that’s about the only good thing i can say about this film so underwhelming can’t believe people actually enjoyed that mess,2024-01-10 05:10:42
"i feel like people who aren’t as knowledgable on history or politics especially revolving around the us will be quite lost and bored the trailers seemed to show the movie as more about los alamos and the manhatten project but what we got was a trial and a lot of post war politics and geopolitical talks and maneuvering definitely seems like a movie for historypolitics enthusiasts rather than one for people just expecting the development of nuclear weapons and the horrors of them 

for context the entire final hour or so is about a trial relating to his potential communist links and removal of security clearance and subsequent reputational loss",2023-07-21 10:43:21
"i felt underwhelmed by the movie

 it jumped around too much and it was hard to really sympathize with oppenheimer because they offer you nothing to sympathize with we dont see the horrors of the bomb we arent given enough to really get his relationship with his mistress or what she meant to him the opening scene is him trying to poison a dude for no reason i did not care for him as a character at all

then it was also unnecessarily pretentious with him saying the famous phrase while  his mistress  yes im super sure that really happened then with him imagining the quantum world in the beginning to the point of losing sleep but then that just magically goes away once he gets  that could have been an interesting angle but it just disappears

i felt like they could have focused on the political intrigue or the bomb itself but they did some hybrid that didnt really seem to work expectations were set without delivery",2023-08-08 05:59:02
oppenheimer is two movies the one about oppenheimer and the bomb is great the one about political battles with a bureaucrat is maddenly boring and just irrelevant whether he retains his silly security clearance is of no importance compared with his other achievements i couldnt care less about it it was so frustrating to have that part ruin the otherwise great movie 25 just awful,2023-08-20 17:39:46
a lot of people in this thread who don’t understand what a character study is the movie is called oppenheimer not how we built the bomb or cool abomb explosions i’ve seen a lot of comments saying this movie didn’t know what it wanted to be and i couldn’t disagree more this is a character study of oppenheimer the man everything else is just a framework to explore him and his story outstanding film if you went into this expecting some action packed caper with awesome war footage and explosions you were watching the movie wrong,2023-07-28 02:29:38
"i went to the imax viewing of this movie its was pretty great ngl

but my date went to the movie bathrooms to smoke  and get totally baked before the screening and she didnt understand  about it and kept asking stuff and when the bomb went off she was just like wooooooo

overall it was good",2023-07-21 17:37:23
the real mvp is the guy who took kyoto off the list,2023-07-21 18:15:09
dont understand at all how people are disappointed with the trinity test the dead silence after all that buildup is absolutely suffocating especially in imax does a fantastic job of portraying how oppenheimer felt in that moment  i dont even think the i am become death quote was needed the scene alone perfectly gets that point across,2023-07-22 01:19:04
very bold and genius decision to have the actual explosion be quiet and we just hear everyones breathing i was ready for the sound but the scene made me really take in the implications of the blast and its effect,2023-07-22 05:06:49
"i feel like im going crazy here seeing everyone saying it was too long and the last hour with strauss and the hearings shouldve been cut for me the last hour was probably my favorite part of the film

admittedly im a major manhattan projectatomic history nerd ive read american prometheus and the making of the atomic bomb multiple times among other things on oppy and the project if any part of the film was a bit of a let down it was the time at los alamos that could very well be due to my familiarity with the subject but i felt like it was lacking depth curious to know what people not as deeply familiar with the science and history thought of those scenes

i never once felt bored the 3 hours felt like like 1 hour i couldve easily gone for another hour of run time

i think that a lot of people are going to be disappointed by the  focus so much on oppys personal like and downfall rather than the bomb and hiroshimanagasaki but the films title is oppenheimer not the manhattan project its a portrait of a deeply fascinating and complicated figure whos actions alongside all those on the project irreversibly changed the course of human history i absolutely loved it",2023-07-22 08:31:00
3 hours is just too long for most movies its good but dragged for me,2023-07-22 13:22:51
this was a solid film but wish it went more into the science,2023-07-22 13:56:45
"what an absolutely astonishingly fantastic movie great direction great acting great audio great emotion building great visuals both evocative and real and of course incredible storytelling with the time jumps to introduce the psychotic antileftism of postand pre tbhwar usa and then returning to resolve it after the los alamos focus in the middle also a great coverage of the relevant parts of oppenheimer’s life

i was on the edge of my seat for literally three hours and people call it a “boring biopic” like 

i get that it wasn’t for you everyone has different taste but holy  it was not a biopic and if an event that has affected the whole world since it happened is boring to you i really don’t know what to say

with peace and love ofc",2023-07-22 21:44:05
my only complaint is that the first 20 minutes were very quick and felt i wanted more from pugh’s character after that the movie really got into its groove and never let up also i think that scene in the gym is the best scene nolan has ever made that singular scream the melting face stepping in a charred corpse… yeesh,2023-07-23 02:37:57
"two jump scare explosions to represent the two bombs dropped was a nice touch by nolan because i was  bricks when the room got bright during the scene of oppie and rob going at it

waiting for that third jump scare explosion that never happened was some edge of your seat horror 

cannot wait to rewatch this again

honorable shoutout to the old man sitting next to me idk if it was the hearing aid or maybe the man was a war vet but he did not flinch during both explosions while i jumped out of my seat like a cat stumbling upon a cucumber ",2023-07-23 14:27:46
what a colossus of a film the ending alone was one of the most… hopeless and helpless feelings i’ve ever had watching a film this should be required viewing along with threads,2023-07-23 23:40:18
i am become  destroyer of ,2023-07-25 04:20:40
"my favourite part of this movie was how the ending calls back the scene where in the early stages of the atomic bomb one of the teams biggest fears is atmospheric ignition a runaway reaction that sets the entire atmosphere ablaze the film does a wonderful job of visualizing this theory 

after some calculations they determine that the chances of this happening are near zero oppenheimer even laughs about this with groves they are confident in what they are creating 

this is contrasted in the ending of the film oppenheimers fear is of thousands of nuclear warheads being detonated that set the entire world ablaze eerily similar visuals to the atmospheric ignition oppenheimer’s near zero confidence that they will destroy the world is now near zero that they won’t 

haunting",2023-07-25 14:23:32
"i recently saw the new oppenheimer movie and the main reason i like it so much is that its really good at giving me goosebumps especially with the ending  
so this question goes to people who have also seen the new oppenheimer movie what other movies can i watch that are just as good at giving me goosebumps as oppenheimer and are also not classified as horror movies",2023-08-04 02:56:20
just finished a second watch this time at an imax and i thought it was even better it was a lot better knowing who all the characters and timelines were going in and not worrying so much about keeping everything straight to me this is a 1010 movie,2023-08-04 22:12:16
"saw it last night in 70mm imax great movie

i gotta say though… if you don’t live near a 70mm imax theater i really don’t think it’s worth making a special trip unless you’re very interested

yes imax is still better than standard format yes it’s a unique experience to watch a movie on film and there are some spectacular shots that fill the entire screen but this movie has no action sequences and not much special effects it’s about 90 characters in rooms talking to each other",2023-08-09 15:26:37
it was pretty good i guess i wouldnt watch again though,2023-08-27 21:23:08
was it fermi who ran outside at the last second to watch the trinity test because there was a nearzero but nonzero chance it would destroy earth and so he decided “hey this might be our last few seconds might as well get the full impact and a better show”,2023-07-21 13:11:26
"i wont liethe entire scene with casey affleck and telling matt damons character about it on the train just zoomed over my head had no idea what they were talking about someone explain like im a big 

edit just did a barbenheimer double feature with a friend so got a lot more from afflecks role and scene i also forgot they had the brief cut in of them wiring the office so hugs all around",2023-07-21 15:26:39
rdj should get his oscar btw man killed his role in the last 20mins of the movie,2023-07-21 15:45:42

no hans zimmer 
too long get rid of the 1st act
phenomenal acting",2023-07-21 17:52:38
"i liked it i just wish there was more bomb and that  scene was just out of place
ost was great constant stress",2023-07-21 18:47:58
can we talk about how horrible the dutch speaking was i didn’t even recognize it at first lol it was surprising because you’d think on such a large production they would have worked on it a bit people at my theater in the netherlands were giggling,2023-07-21 21:35:30
"i felt before the film i didn’t even want to look at books and readings about oppenheimers history and how the manhattan project and los alamos unraveled i wanted to go in blank

after watching i wish i did the first 2 hours was unbelievable if it simply ended there i’d have called it nolan’s best my  though was that last hour such a bore i had no clue about what was going on as they were so much names and people i didn’t know who was who maybe it’s just a me thing i literally study for a degree in politics yet it’s the political side of the film i really didn’t enjoy ",2023-07-21 23:45:11
"the movie was overwhelming leaving you feeling quite upset and deep in thought i really enjoyed it it is absolutely not for everyone but a very interesting character study of a very complex man who changed the world you do not feel resolved and happy you have to feel what oppenheimer and einstein felt with the burden of knowledge maybe it was the hype andor plot people seemed to have thought this was going to be a michael bay style action film filled with explosions i feel the action is what goes through the intense mind of oppenheimer we dont need endless bombs and to show what truly happened in those japanese cities similar to dunkirk you dont have to see the war and bombs to feel the horror 

cillian was absolute excellent he stole every scene he was in rdj pleasantly surprised me taking on a serious role i think the last time i saw him in a drama was the judge emily blunt was great but i thought her accent was inconsistent i love safdie brother movies but havent been impressed by bennys acting and thought his accent was bad i didnt really care for anyone else not really happy to see jack quaid and a bunch of others thrown into the movie but they werent distracting at least gary oldman took me a couple of seconds to recognize but he really stole the show in those few minutes of screen time",2023-07-22 02:02:42
"really fantastic film loved it

last scene was amazing lots to ponder all day after seeing this film",2023-07-22 02:13:21
"i could actually hear all the dialogue in this one 1010

but for real that’s the best script of nolan’s career best use of broken timelines since maybe pulp fiction haven’t seen an audience that dazed during the end credits in a long time maybe nolan’s most complete work",2023-07-22 06:17:32
i can see robert downey jr getting nominated for oscar,2023-07-22 17:10:59
"i really like the movie overall but perhaps its because i avoided watching any clips or reading too much about it before the only part of the movie that made me all  was the absolutely random florence pugh  scene with the bhagavad gita indian twitter uproar in 32  it felt pretty forced kind of like fan service in anime but i dont think it ruined the movie just didnt add much imo maybe it was because nolan was trying to add all aspects of oppenheimers life idk im tbd on this thought what does everyone else think

i did like the similarity between oppenheimers relationship with jean and the bomb both being things he created the relationship and jeans anxiety  the bomb that he felt guilt for to that effect my favorite line was kitty saying do you think if you let them tar and feather you the world would forgive you it reminded me of the time earlier in the movie when kitty scolded him when jean committed suicide and told him he doesnt get to do something horrible aka cheat on kitty and then have everyone feel sorry for you",2023-07-22 23:53:23
now that was a movie for adults loved it,2023-07-23 03:49:45
i havent seen this mentioned in any of the top comments but the whole middle section basically until the trinity detonation felt like a 15 hour trailer to me the way scenes and dialogue were cut together just seemed so odd it was jumping back and forth from location to location and across timelines every 510 seconds with almost zero breaks in the dialogues oppie shows up somewhere says 3 lines to another scientist cut now hes on a train with matt damon and they say 3 lines to each other cut now hes back in los alamos and says 3 lines to his wife cut now hes somewhere else again and talking to another scientist for 10 seconds cut and so on no breathing room in any of these scenes and it even seemed like they cut the dialogue so that the lines follow each other directly without pause and that made it sound unnatural hence the trailer comparison i didnt love it as much as apparently everyone else here,2023-07-23 13:52:27
people who cheat in relationships destroy the world,2023-07-23 21:25:41

my favourite mathematician of all time i do study graph theory and logic and just a harrowing story only slightly mentioned here i am giddy

espelling",2023-07-24 03:03:08
that ending with the music tho holy ,2023-07-24 05:28:57
before watching the movie i’ve always seen myself as an intelligent person but after watching the movie i realised i’m by far not as intelligent as the people that made the choices in that time  and nowthe genius and intellect shown on the screen was really something else,2023-07-24 06:54:43
"i loved how smart and concise some of the narrative elements are 

 one of the scientists misspeaking and saying “bomb” instead of “gadget” to get the codeword across to the audience
 using bowls of marbles to represent progress and build tension
 a whole other affair is heavily implied with practically 0 actual screentime used
 being able to instantly recognise time periods with the receeeding hairlines and greying hair of the male characters

i’m convinced nolan didn’t want this movie running a single minute over 3hrs and for that reason had to be creative with exposition for a director who sometimes struggles with exposition tenet inception it worked massively to his benefit refreshing to watch a movie that trusts the audience to piece it together and most importantly actually gives you enough information be able to do that",2023-07-24 13:31:21
"apart from hearing his name in history class i was not at all familiar with robert oppenheimer before going into the theatre is it fair to say that oppenheimer as potrayed in this film was an extremely complicated man cause i dont know what to think about him i felt the brilliant genius inside his head the weight on his shoulders of carrying the burden of knowledge the inner motivationconflict in his heart of having to create something so destructive and evil and the guilt that came with his creation but i also felt his massive ego his carelessness and his indecisiveness a lot of what lewis strauss and also his wife said about him in the final third of the film rang true even though a part of me wanted to ignore him because strauss himself was no saint either and because i felt bad for oppenheimer for what strauss had put him through 


ill need a rewatch or two to come to a more definitive conclusion but oppenheimer didnt come across as a hero nor a villain and not an antihero either its difficult to define what he is after watching this film at first i was confused by this because my brain is wired to label characters in hollywood films as heroes and villains but the more i think about it the more im fascinated by how oppenheimer is potrayed in this film cause there are lots of different ways to interpret his character which makes me look forward to my second viewing of this film next week even more because then ill be watching it with friends instead of going by myself oppenheimer is a film that doesnt give you many answers but leaves you with a lot of questions to contemplate about and to discuss and talk about with others right after you leave the theatre",2023-07-24 20:59:41
cheering like when the end game portals open everytime albert comes on screen,2023-07-25 19:32:42
one of my favorite scenes in the movie was just after the explosion one of the scientists is holding his bongos up and the whole scene just looks super primitive what a deeply moving film i really enjoyed it i’ll probably go see it again,2023-07-26 05:55:05
holy  the tension the build up in the trinity test sequence my heart was pounding so fast in that moment accompanied by the masterpiece of a sound design nolan really knows how to keep audiences on the edge of their seats this is truly an experience for years to come cinemas alive as long as we have christopher nolan ,2023-07-26 23:19:58
"hello my wife and i are very interested in going to see oppenheimer in imax but she has quite a lot of anxiety about the theatre but she wants to see this movie in imax the number one thing that she is worried about that we cannot find any info on is the  scenes seeing people  makes her extremely anxious and she has heard that there is at least 12  scenes 

i just want to get some insight into when these scenes are so she can either turn away or sneak away to the bathroom at that point",2023-07-27 01:13:10
"went back and saw this for the second time yesterday morning  and it did a ton for my appreciation of the film the three major storylines building the bomb oppenheimer’s clearance hearing strauss’ confirmation hearing are weaved together beautifully the chemistry between the actors is fantastic and nolan shows us a lot about how the characters see the world without telling us how to see it

i think my final conclusion is oppenheimer was cursed with the gift of his mind from the beginning the ptsd and nightmares certainly crescendo after truman drops the bomb but they start way back when he’s a lab student whether he became “the father of the atomic bomb” or just became tenured professor at a prestigious university he was going to have demons either way",2023-07-27 14:36:14
i really didnt expect to love a three hour biography as much as i did but it was amazing,2023-07-27 16:43:23
i dunno if it was me sitting in the front row but the sound made it so hard to hear the music builds tension but muddies the dialogue a bit also i just felt so uneasy when hed go right into another scene just as you were getting settled into the current one it adds to the tension but also lost me a few times great movie and loved how the ending played out,2023-07-30 00:04:05
"great movie overall 

sound  as usual for nolan dialogue was really hard to understand at points and the third act was kinda slow 

the first two acts were really good ill probably end up watching it 100 times over my lifetime",2023-07-30 02:18:55
"i thought it was good but the amount of jumping didnt work for me i get the unfolding story about oppenheimer and strauss i get its a biopic 100 but thats where i bounced off

where im coming from is that the story told in rhodes the making of the atomic bomb was much more compelling to me than oppenheimers martyrdom the gradual accumulation of scientific knowledge leading up to hahn and meitner splitting the atom secreting scientists away from europe and the nazis the norwegian commando raid on german heavy water the incredibe violence of fire bombing and the war in the pacific etc all felt like the ticking bomb nolan would be interested in there were moments in rhodes accounting where i felt almost like once humans discovered physics a nuclear bomb was going to happen one way or another

i also felt that while the story certainly addressed the moral quandaries of the bomb and the horrific devastation of hiroshima and nagasaki that reckoning feels more poignant and affecting to me as a climax than strauss downfall and oppenheimers redemption again i recognize its a biopic on oppenheimer but i think thats the story im less interested in than the inevitability of the bomb 

the cinematography was top notch the trinity test was worth the imax alone the acting was quite good and cillian murphy was compelling i think i just bounced off because i personally was more invested in other aspects of nuclear development",2023-07-30 03:47:49
very much worth a rewatch i wasnt a fan at all the first time but gave it another chance a few days later bc i got cheap tickets criticisms are still largely there but its def more gripping the 2nd goaround,2023-07-30 08:34:32
saw this in 70mm imax and it was such a surreal experience felt way more real than i was expecting i just got so absorbed in the film i felt like i was just watching the real thing play out the 3rd act was a little long in my opinion they could of shaved 30 mins off altogether but i still really enjoyed it,2023-07-30 20:08:05
"i liked this movie but i think the second half fell a little flat they treat it as a big twist that rdj was against oppenheimer but they aren’t even shown to be super friends or anything and rami māori appears for like 2 minutes sure oppenheirmer didn’t want to sign that thing but it isn’t even a big twist

and it went on for way too long i think they could have definitely shortened that second half a lot",2023-07-31 17:08:19
just came out of the theater and the movie was absolutely incredible the anxiety was so realistic and done so well it was loud unrelenting and deafening my heart was pounding multiple times and it was such an amazing experience,2023-08-02 14:01:01
saw it last night it was well made and i enjoyed it top notch performances cast acting and camera work but also dont think it was anything incredible it was good but also forgettable dont see a reason to ever rewatch it,2023-08-02 18:33:59
watched this this morning and i can’t get over it i also can’t help but think about comparing oppenheimer and turing two brilliant academics who were instrumental in winning the allies the war but their country’s would not protect them,2023-08-02 22:29:21
i absolutely adored this film the whole way through and surprisingly i didnt notice any issues with audio mixing but maybe the theatre i was at just hade some roid speakers or something i dont know my girlfriend asked a couple times what someone said so maybe it wasnt as good as o realised i also totally understand 90 of the complaints people have i think it just worked out for me because ive already had a lot of interest in the time period the manhattan project aswell as just a general liking of both legal and political stuff but yeah long asf and i definitely expect any rewatches to feel like a bit of a drag but yknow what i loved that  so lesgoo,2023-08-21 17:13:30
insane absolutely amazing to watch in imax,2023-07-21 03:24:29
i havent watched the movie yet but for people who are reading reviews on this thread for deciding to watch this film or not this sub on dunkirk thread literally  made it seem like it was one the worst movie of all time i was actually amazed by how much good of a film dunkirk was after i couldnt watch in theater after so many years i strongly believe it is nolans best work so never go by these kinds of thread,2023-07-21 03:31:07
“don’t let the crybaby back in the room” lol,2023-07-21 03:34:53

i saw it in providence ri only theater in new england showing it in imax 70mm audience was dead silent the entire time except when they announced jfk was the senator who blocked strauss cabinet confirmation everyone burst into applause and cheers because new england lol,2023-07-21 04:07:33
i literally felt my heart pounding out of my chest as it led up to the trinity test when the bomb finally dropped… i was in awe it was beautiful… but i was still scared cause i knew that shockwave was coming and that it was going to be loud i was waiting for it lol,2023-07-21 04:24:36
albert einstein as the mystical elder guiding him was a great role,2023-07-21 04:29:59
loved the movie but that dutch scene i dont know what the  that was but it wasnt dutch sounded more german to me source im dutch,2023-07-21 05:03:59
one of nolan’s best films to date tight pacing great dialogue phenomenal performances along with his trademark direction and sound mix reminds me of scorsese in the best way with how well nolan defined character movements and story beats such a massive yet intimate character study,2023-07-21 05:51:39
i go back and forth on whether or not i like nolan but wow that was one of his best not a single minute wasted,2023-07-21 05:58:36
i like all nolan films but this is the first in a long time where the writing matches his technical brilliance,2023-07-21 07:21:51
"a nolan film thats three hours long and 95 dialogue is this good im kind of blown away quite possibly my second favourite nolan film its just fascinating and engaging from start to finish not a single part of the movie felt like a slog to me add to that the gorgeous cinematography and fantastic score

the craziest thing about this movie is how when they starting building up to it i felt no excitement to see the bomb go off more dread than anything and the dead silence in the cinema was incredible",2023-07-21 07:52:31
"stunned with everything a revenge story much like amadeus but with the most realistic explosions ever depicted on film if there was ever a justification to blow 25 on a movie ticket do it for this film you need to experience the ‘terror’ of everything in as loud an environment as you can 

also loved the film’s depiction of mccarthyist paranoia and how “out of left field” it hits oppenheimer there’s a lot of talk about where exactly oppenheimer leans and what he believes but i think the flag’s flowing upon the celebration at los alamos tells it all 

also go bears ",2023-07-21 08:08:24
"i dont know what to say its not a movie about the bomb and it doesnt have some crazy plot twists its not forcing gyou to cry or feel proud or whatever its just a really decent period drama tense well acted beautifully shot actors in this are amazing every one of the main cast deserves all the praise and hype i feel like a lot of people may find its slow or lacking events since were going to a nolans movie duh but i really enjoyed it

it leaves you with this feeling of not wanting to go back to the real world and just immerses you completely i dont feel it that often if that makes sense like when you need 2 hours after the movie to shake it off",2023-07-21 08:16:10
that first build up of music and drop…goosebumps,2023-07-21 14:36:49
"i havent seen the movie yet but i have a question for anyone whos seen it 

how is enrico fermi portrayed in the movie he was a pretty major person in the manhattan project but i havent really seen anything pertaining to him around the discussion of this movie",2023-07-21 18:20:12
"really enjoyed it  i think there are definitely some valid criticisms about the run time and the going back and forth between plotstimelinesetc but on the whole i thought it was great

there were some incredible performances from the cast and i personally didnt have cant understandhear the dialogue problem people often complain about with nolan i saw tenet 3 times in theaters and the biggest issue i had was understanding some of the deep accents not necessarily just understanding the dialogue to begin with

the nature of the film reminded me a lot of a beautiful mind which i also really like

i dont think its perfect nor do i think its nolans best but i do think its very good and will enjoy it again on streaming when i can take an intermission",2023-07-21 23:28:24
is the audiodialogue easy to understandnot garbled i had a really hard time with tenet,2023-07-22 03:28:09

can anyone provide an insight into the type of person lewis strauss was throughout his life of course he is portrayed to oppose oppenheimer in the film but the film is obviously focused on the events surrounding the atomic bomb was strauss actually a bit of a  throughout his whole life,2023-07-22 04:57:29
sam mendes hiroshima movie coming in hot,2023-07-22 06:30:15
shoutout to the three sudden flashbacks of characters i couldn’t remember when they were mentioned nolan obviously realized remembering certain people might be a challenge and addressed that issue in a tasteful and nondistracting way,2023-07-22 07:50:47
what a ride cillian was amazing need to rewatch asap,2023-07-22 08:54:48

tim dekay showing up was a very pleasant surprise as a white collar enjoyer,2023-07-22 09:46:43
the twist of why scenes were color vs black and white was perfect and fitting to the story i was confused early on because it clearly wasn’t beforeafter bomb like many assumed there were a lot of payoffs and callbacks in the end such good storytelling that made it feel like a nolan film,2023-07-22 14:01:03
i can understand why oppenheimer had strong opinions on nuclear weapons,2023-07-22 15:30:59
there was a minor historical mistake that was mentioned regarding the debates of neils bohr and albert einstein one of the characters said something along the lines of bohr proving einstein wrong regarding quantum mechanics however this was not technically proven until 1964 by irish physicist john stewart bell,2023-07-22 20:26:50

"often times i see a movie and i get bored halfway through due to runtime and unnecessary scenes didnt feel that way with oppenheimer or barbie 22 for the weekend

i was hooked on the dramatic tension from the start and it was a rollercoaster until the end this mixes two of my favorite types of movies historical drama and talkies i love it when a movie just points a camera at an actor and let them recite lines 

i loved matt damon emily blundt and florence pugh in this movie i said suspected got a loud snort from me emilys testimony scene was phenomenal and florences scenes going from  to obsession to vulnerability to guilt was a nice parallel to the bomb creation",2023-07-23 19:32:58
mine favourite work of nolan is still memento and prestige,2023-07-23 20:23:48

one thing i’m not able to wrap my head around is the timeline in which the chain reaction equation scene is situated oppie discusses the equation with einstein when teller gives him those equations which is way after oppie join the univ of berkeley but from strauss’s pov bw the scene where oppie tells einstein that they might have started the chain reaction is right after when strauss and oppie meet if they have discussed the equations after teller gives him the equation then how is it possible that oppie tells einstein after he meets strauss which is at the beginning of the movie someone please explain,2023-07-24 06:14:57

it was ok the acting cinematography etc were great but blimey that narrative structure jumping back and forth in time for no good reason with those overstylized blackandwhite scenes also for no good reason was tedious as  its such a hallmark movie type of cliché to make a whole story centre on a trial even one that isnt really one but actually is one the nontrial was the least interesting part of oppenheimbers life story its weird to put so much emphasis on it i know its meant to be about his glory and demise but thats also such a tired trope the moral implications of his work and the whole dilemma and burden it put on him are far more interesting it should have been more of the movies focus,2024-04-04 17:45:40

"another nolan masterpiece not his best nothing could beat inception and interstellar but still enjoyable and true to nolans style the chronology of the story is all over the place in a good way

that said i still went in blind ie without watching any teasers and trailers and am pleasant surprised at how starstudded even the supporting cast is and their cameos didnt feel cheap at all

we got kenneth branagh as the charismatic niels bor who inspired oppie to further his study of quantum theory in germany rami malek as david l hill who played a crucial role in iron mans strausss downfall we even got gary oldman going from playing churchill to playing truman being annoyed at oppie for being a crybaby about hiroshima and nagasaki when truman says as a matter of factly its ultimately truman who pulled the proverbial nuclear trigger on those cities not oppie

for others played by lesserknown actors im amazed at the amount of actual historical figures and scientists that i learned in school involved in the manhattan project who made an appearance 

figures like fermi feynmann heisenberg just popping in like they were always there

nolan also put attention to detail in many interesting sidestories from these characters 

stories like

1 how niels bor got smuggled out of nazioccupied denmark into neutral sweden and then had to fly a new experimental raf aircraft that bypassed nazioccupied norway to take him to scotland but to do so the aircraft needed to fly at very high altitudes and bor forgot to wear his oxygen mask and fainted during the flight

2 how secretary of war stimson spared kyoto from getting nuked because he and his wife honeymooned there actually the stimsons honeymooned somewhere else but stimson did indeed visited kyoto before the war and must have liked it enough to strike it off the list of japanese cities to be nuked",2023-07-27 12:52:12
how does nolan’s sound mixing still   after a decade and a half,2023-07-27 23:56:37
"this was a wonderful character study where we explore two distinct and different individuals and we look at their narratives and the stories they tell to themselves about their individual relationships with knowledge power risk and morality 

what struck me was that while they pursued ends differently both oppenheimer and strauss are frequently worrying about the same thing things but doing so in their own respective ways and therefore reaching different conclusions in the end i felt like both men come across as very tangible deeply flawed real humans 

as a curiosity i saw oppenheimer in imax with my wife who is 36 weeks pregnant when the bomb went off it startled by son out of sleep and into violent wriggling",2023-08-03 17:44:45
well that was pretty sick but probably 40 min longer then it needed to be,2023-08-13 17:30:08
"
so many nuances this movie is truly a masterpiece not only did he make it 100 accurate and factual but he didnt push the barrier and still showed you lil entries and characters and facets of the time
nolan peaked here",2023-08-14 20:09:54
"man this movie was a huge drag to get through definitely a big let down 

the beginning of the movie felt completely jumbled jumping back and forth between multiple timelines with constant dialog made it hard to actually get invested into the story the middle act of the movie with the development of los alamos and the testing of the bomb was easily the best part i wish the movie expanded on that more instead the final act and last hour of the movie was just a huge disappointment the final gotcha moment to strauss at the end just didnt do it for me 

overall i really feel like the marketing was misleading the trailers made it seem like this movie was centered around the race to get to the atomic bomb instead it was really just about oppenheimer losing his security clearance not sure why this was claimed to be a must see in imax when the movie consists almost completely of just dialog  

also come on did anyone else laugh a little when he used the famous i am become death the destroyer of worlds line while having  that was just too ridiculous for me",2023-08-22 20:59:25
"this movie isnt terrible but neither is it a masterpiece

too me  it can be summed up as too much of everything and too little of anything

it tries to show you so much about oppenheimers life and the circumstances surrouding it in a quantitative sense that nothing gets discussed with any substance oppenheimer is a communist womanizer deeply conflicted genius and whatnot but none of those aspects felt really tangible at the end of it due to that i almost never was emotionally grabbed by the movie and the result was a huge issue with its tension curve  if you can call it that

the only part where i felt tension and involvement with the story was during the los alamos and trinity sequence  albeit the actual explosion feeling anticlimatic

the movie also doesnt do itself any favors by putting in all the time jumps the presentation is already very fragmented as it pertains to following oppenheimer chronologically due to the linear timejumps hence why the jumps into the future feel like a distraction from the core story no matter how well rdj plays in those scenes

the final interview part was largely uninteresting to me as oppenheimers interests in communism are never explored why does he support it what stakes does he hold in it

in the end it  the movie looks good has a very very strong cast and gets carried hard by an honestly even stronger performance by cm considering how much you can do with always looking sad into the camera he wasnt given much it ends up being visual eye candy that leaves a lot of character arc and depth to be desired

410",2023-08-05 14:04:00
i thought that end scene was so good one of the best ends to a film imo,2023-07-21 14:03:53
this movie will probably create a rick and morty situation where people who are simply not interested in biopics and mccarthy era us politics will think its boring and the other camp will call them idiots its not an easy to watch pop corn movie thats for sure i enjoyed it immensely though ill give it a good while before watching it again i was physically and mentally tired at the end,2023-07-21 14:19:25
"it was a good experiences but somehow i have many gripes with it

x200b

ill be honest strausss conclusion was kind of a bummer that is the part where nolan put his complicated puzzle pieces in the movie not complicated thankfully but the full completion of that puzzle was a whimper the build up to the explosion was brilliant but the explosion itself was mediocre  they have the cadences to not show japans destruction and go with the hallucination but the hallucination itself was too shallow it doesnt hold any impact and too brief  the layering of the sound cues during that was great mind you just the visual  talking about the the visual the visual representation in the first half of the movies were way better than the second half with the coiling of the molecules and everything but when it comes to the visualization of his anxiety it lacks the oomph  they rely more on the score and sound cues for the anxiety but i think some hyperbole in the visual department could be improved  

i respect and appreciate the small changes in film and visual cues but probably not enough for me i think nolan improve his sound and narrative writing but tone down in the visual department for this movie  i hope next time he can find some balances since i was really disappointed in some key moments in the movies the test explosion the hallucination of the bombing victim the moment his wife breaks down the moment he find himself exposed or maybe thats just me and my high expectation

x200b

either way a great experiences",2023-07-21 18:43:19
"generally i liked the movie perfect acting quality set and production as a biopic it stands very well in my opinion trinity test was meh it lacked the scale and visuals looked like 1 ton explosion with tnt cloud its shame nolan doesnt want to use cgi there is a remastered video of this test irl on youtube i guess its possible to be mixed into the frame and make it big he has money for that this is maybe the single point of the movie that i dislike  
also not worth imax because 3 hours and its mostly dialogues with lots of close face view makes you appreciate the makeup though",2023-07-21 20:47:11
it was like a 3 hour cynically written episode of the west wing and that made me so very happy  fantastic movie,2023-07-21 20:57:04
"just came back from the cinema  what an amazing movie lengthy for sure but i was glued to the screen from start to finish the visuals music and acting all on point  


some dialogs might have a been a bit over the top or overacted trinity test sequence might not have been what a lot of people expected and perhaps few scenes were a bit out of place but its definitely a must watch movie in my opinion  


only regret is i wish i had imax available without driving for several hours to get to it",2023-07-21 22:00:33

loved gary oldman hes so good,2023-07-22 04:07:53
i loved every second of it and im so glad people like nolan are still putting effort into big screen film experiences like this buuuuuuut given the lack of truly epic visuals aside from a few quick shots i wouldve also happily watched this in my home theatre as a 3part miniseries a la chernobyl downvote me,2023-07-22 06:48:48
"oppenheimer opens up the same way it ends with the pitterpatter of raindrops on the cement floor maybe signifying how it rained fire from the sky on 6th august 1945 in the japanese town of hiroshima the movie does an excellent job of showing the trauma and the dilemma faced by oppenheimer both while designing and in the aftermath of the atomic bomb oppenheimer like a lot of nolan movies does not have a linear timeline the story is split into three main timelines which indeed does help build suspense and makes certain scenes more satisfying like the ending with oppenheimer and a certain scientist no spoilers  
  
cillian murphy is perfect in the role of oppenheimer as he perfectly expresses the mental war going on in the mind of a scientist who wonders what to give priority to his duty or his moral obligation the parallels with the bhagwat geeta are also fascinating as that scripture has a similar moral dilemma going on with the prince arjun  
  
rdj knocks it out of the park never thought i could hate a character played by rdj after endgame but yet here we are emily blunt and matt damon as well absolutely brilliant in their roles loved emily blunts demeanor throughout the film and how she represented a woman beyond the stereotypes of the 1940s  
  
florence pugh though the character didnt really seem too strong and doesnt give much of a memorable performance here didnt feel any of her scenes had much power or a memorability to them  
  
the trinity test scene is by far one of the best cinematic pieces in any nolan film no arguments there it won me over  
  
coming to its flaws now especially as an international viewer i feel nolan expects the audience to be pretty well versed with every event from world war 2 that too from the american perspective and of american politics and even with the timeline of events along with which countries were in what teams moreover the film has way too many characters to the point where in certain sections of the film it gets confusing and you cant understand what exactly is going on and who are they talking about this brought down the level of the movie for me and was a real bummer id say for a solid 20 minutes i was wondering wait who exactly was roger robb whos evans whos rabi and where did i see him before the fast pace doesnt help with this either because nolan doesnt give me breathing room to realise who the character actually was  
  
is this nolans best work no that is inception for me followed by the prestige and interstellar  
  
overall i would give it a 7510",2023-07-22 13:12:07
loved it definitely not the movie i thought it was going to be many were concerned nolan was going to make the atomic bomb explosion look “cool” but the trinity  probably the meekest thing in the movie,2023-07-22 13:36:55
i rather liked the nonlinear plot finding it pretty easy to follow the dialogue was very clumsy at times the physics and new mexico line actually made my theatre giggle and it feels very tell dont show but i dont think it detracted that much— each actor does very well with their parts its a spectacle at points with sound design that made my stomach sink and genuinely brilliant moments of cinema i really like how the existential dread of the bomb is conveyed and the last usage of the world swallowed by flames visual was well worth the price of admission alone the awkward moments dragged it down for me but i enjoyed my time in the theatre with this film as much as you can enjoy this kind of film anyways,2023-07-22 14:51:52
"saw it thursday immediately after a stressful day at work and wasnt in the right mindset for a nolan film gave it a 7510

after seeing it again i can confidently say this is a 910 movie and arguably nolans best only gripes are runtime seriously hollywood knock it off with these 3 hour showings and somewhat shaky storytelling 

i could see murphy pugh downey jr and blunt all getting nominated for an oscar slam dunk film everyone should see",2023-07-22 20:56:59
"i’m not sure if i’m just going deaf or if the theater i was at was  but i had trouble hearing like half the dialogue in this film anyone else 

other than that i enjoyed it i’m not a movie critic so i’m not gonna write a rambling comment 

the one thing i will say is i remember thinking “seriously” when i heard matt damon was gonna play leslie groves but i thought he did a phenomenal job",2023-07-22 23:05:04
"i know that the bw scenes are supposed to be subjective while the scenes in colour are objective i didnt fully realise by subjective that means theyre subjective to strauss instead of oppenheimer until the reveal

i honestly wish the movie had been 5hour long instead of 3 lol  though i know thats nearly impossible at least marketingwise in this day and age the first half was a bit rushed to me it felt like nolan had to try to cram a hefty chunk of both history and science into it even with the fairly liberal amount of runtime

anyhow i know for a fact im seeing the movie again i havent felt this thunderstruck leaving the theatre practically since parasite",2023-07-23 02:50:13
just left the theater about an hour ago and what a surreal experience telling that important of a story in such a beautiful yet tragic way had me in awe the whole runtime performances were off the charts and the silence in the theater during the trinity  truly something i’ll never forget in my opinion it was a masterpiece in every sense of the word side note  a nolan bond movie would be perfection,2023-07-23 04:29:09
"i enjoyed the movie most when it not whipsawing between different timelines i didn’t see much point to such a non linear story line when it finally settled on los alamos and one timeline it was much better it felt focused it really drilled into opps misgivings over the bomb trying to not be as conflicted as his fellow scientists until it really hit him

dc politics and the university conflict between communist and non communists could have been aggressively cut down to be more tight than a slow 3 hour film it’s never good when 3045 minutes could be cut off and the audience would still get a similar affect

past the twist i doubt much would have been lost considering the film was fine having a huge epilogue after the bomb test and explosion",2023-07-23 04:55:14
"an underrated scene in the movie that i absolutely loved was them going back and forth between fission when oppenheimer is getting grilled by robb about moral qualms and fushion when strauss is losing his mind after hill’s testimony

both men feeling it slip away",2023-07-23 23:43:14

"watched it last night and although it did have to do a lot of heavy lifting in the start to establish the state of the science community and the political climate before the war it really picked up the pace once the manhattan project began

cast was great rdj will probably get some rightful nominations and awards but i gotta give casey affleck a shoutout for his role as pash dude was spooky",2023-07-24 09:13:27
i might be late to this but i havent felt this way in such a long time about a movie its only every few years a movie has such an impact on me due to my lack of hnderstanding of an area i dont know anything about this might be one of my all time favorite films for that ive been meaning to study science and mathematics and usually i only ever think of the positive aspects of it but this film really demonstrates the complexities that come with it we all vie to do something great and impactful but what i have always enjoyed about that word is that people dont consider that whatever impact you make theres something on the other side of the force taking the major hit this movie is for sure in my top ten for making me really just think about a lot im trying to take my dad this week to see it hope you guys enjoyed as much as i did,2023-07-24 19:51:04
"wasn’t expecting the who’s who of actors to be in this film but it was worth every cent everyone puts on their best performance the sound design is absolutely perfect  it made 3 hours feel like maybe 2

i will say the time jumping was a little jarring at times but it almost always worked every scene was delicious the dialogue was snappy but captivating everything from oppie’s sudden regret of dropping the bombs to the  political talk between him  florence pugh was awesome

i never thought i’d say i’d want to see a 3 hour movie twice in the same week but this might have done it fantastic movie",2023-07-24 22:02:31
really great movie i loved watching it however i did feel like i just bingewatched a whole season after leaving the cinema,2023-07-25 07:19:11
saw it on saturday and again last night never done that with a movie before see it more than once in theaters but this was worth it an astounding achievement in artistic expression and from a technical standpoint as a friend put so succinctly it felt like what it would’ve been to see 2001 a space odyssey in theaters back in 1968 this is an alltimer nothing quite like it,2023-07-25 20:04:52
"this is basically the wind rises if miyazakis wonder was replaced with nolans dread

after the nearperfect first two acts the third act involving the mccarthyist interrogations and hearings lacks the tension it simply cannot compete to the will the nazis get to the bomb first stakes 

i know this is a biopic about oppenheimers character not titled the manhattan project but much of the plotline at the end could have been shortened to 20 minutes at the longest the movie is nonlinear anyway so i wonder if there could be a fanedit that restructures most of the third act scenes to before the bomb detonation so that rather than a movie split in clear two stories the constant momentum of creating a bomb would pace out and elegantly make it more of a cohesive experience as a whole

im saying this because the wind rises did that and still managed to be a thoughtprovoking characterpiece as much as i found tearjerking the romance in that movie i would not have been fond of it if miyazaki made that a real climax long after the successful flying test the final fourminutes ending of the wind rises speaks as many things about the character and theme as oppenheimer does in its overlong 50minute third act",2023-07-25 23:14:33
"lots of great acting on display but the use of music was just bizarre every single scene that rather uninteresting blaring music at times making it hard to hear dialogue that was obviously important to the plot it felt weirdly amateurish compared to everything else in the film

also what was the deal with that poisoned apple scene in the beginning oppenheimer did indeed try to poison his teacher but in real life he got caught – he almost got expelled and was forced to go see a psychiatrist this is not what happens in the film where they have him almost poison niels bohr by mistake but then managing to avert the whole thing however in the film when oppenheimer talks about the incident with another character the sequence of events he describes is the one that took place in real life tried to poison my teacher got sent to a psychiatrist and not the one nolan showed us in the beginning",2023-07-27 19:08:57
i liked it but it could have done with more editing work pacing is off the time jumps were jarring i had listened to a pod cast about openheimer before seeing it and i feel like without that i would have been lost,2023-07-31 22:21:46
is this the more serious prequel to dr strangelove or how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,2023-11-19 00:59:11
all throughout the bomb making oppenheimer kept on saying that it’s not his job as to how the bomb would be used but suddenly after the bomb drop he developed morality and movie didn’t explore this at all it was all about the witchhunt something doesn’t connect,2024-03-17 14:11:28
"i agree with quite a few criticisms even though i enjoyed it not sure id want to watch it again though

nolans movies can be frustrating he has some weird obsession with time in different phases and seems like he has some shortcomings when it comes to telling a human story this could have been a better movie in the hands of someone else

i also feel bad for florence pugh spends most of the movie  for no real reason nolan typically doesnt put nudity in his movies so it seems like an odd choice",2023-08-07 17:27:49
"i was looking forward to this one but like some others here ultimately the experience was disappointing in my view its major flaw which choice i understand from a thematic standpoint was wrapping the core story of the development and dropping of the bomb inside the comparatively bland and bureaucratic proceedings of the committee hearing and security clearance interview

this structure was a major disservice to the emotional experience of this 3 hour epic for me largely because it was just about impossible to reengage with that storyline or care about its dramatic questions after going through the wringer of the development and dropping of the bomb every little question about whether he was a spy and was strauss going after him was in my experience trivial and near impossible to care about anymore and i had to endure that trivia and remember the sterile details of who trusted who to do what for another whole 40 minutes that home stretch was mostly clock watching for me i do understand its function but that whole dimension felt overdeveloped and the best candidate for trimming this down to a more emotionally engaging and tighter 2hour experience

in the end this didn’t work better for me than any other decent biopic significant improvement over tenet but sitting well behind dunkirk or interstellar both of which were also much better imax experiences than this very talky excursion",2023-08-16 14:46:18
"for me this might be nolan’s best movie  doesn’t have the flash or the flair of inception interstellar and the batman trilogy but the story was brilliantly told even though most people know the end result that the bomb was successful 

most impactful moments of the movie to me where the conversation with einstein and oppenheimer by the lake and the way the context of the scene changes throughout the movie 

you get to see it from afar and it looks like one thing then you see strauss’s interpretation of it and it looks like something else then you see it in its entirety with the conversation between einstein and oppenheimer that you get the full brunt of it  

top notch filmmaking right there

also a wild gary oldman appears and completely steals the scene he is in",2023-07-21 12:05:17
"man this film was really testing my patience at times honestly i found the whole robert downey jnr timeline a chore to sit through


the best parts of the film are oppenheimers beginnings and the middle stretch covering everything within los alamos and the bomb


everything else after felt convoluted to me the imitation game did the whole betrayed by his country plot better and more efficiently


lastly sound is still a big problem in nolans films there are scenes where the rustling of clothesfootsteps whilst people walk is louder than the dialogue i cant comprehend why that is a stylistic or conscious choice",2023-07-26 22:08:05
"i wanted to like this movie but i regrettably could only find myself agreeing a lot with all the hateresque opinions on the internet

the movie was engaging from start to end thats sounds like an impressive feat for a 3hour movie only if it was in a vacuum it was engaging simply by keeping the entire movie at a stagnantly fast pace and equally stagnant tension to put it very crudely its like scrolling tiktok for 3 hours  you are technically engaged for 3 hours

the idea of show dont tell felt so wrongly executed that it went full circle and became just telling do you need to show oppie  to show his shame do you then need to show jean riding him to show the hurt in kitty do you need to have the defeaning sounds jarring cuts and white light flooding the scene to show oppies internal strife cilian is known for his phenomenal face acting  just let him do his magic man the only part which leverages that is the very last shot of the movie

to me a great movie should leave a big impression and be thoughtprovoking after the fact after oppenheimer im just like  ok yeah its not an ugh but theres no wow let me compare it with 2 biopics the imitation game and steve jobs 2015

 people generally know alan turing is considered the father of computers he had a notable contribution to the war effort against germany and he more or less died because of his homosexuality the movie did a good job of dramatising his early life for us to feel for him it did neglect the sciencey part like oppenheimer but the emotional drama made up for it i left with a better understanding of turing as a person good and bad
 most people agree that steve jobs is a visionary some consider him a genius others dont a good number of people also know that steve wozniak was the man behind the scenes the movie did a fantastic job of showing why jobs is a visionary with the way he thinks and perceives things it also had a good balance of showing the  side of him as a person i left with a better understanding of both jobs greatness and lowness also impressed with the performance of fassbender and especially seth rogen in a serious role

everyone knows that oppenheimer made the atomic bomb almost everyone knows  and has watched  that clip where he says the iconic i am become death the destroyer of worlds most people could infer that he felt regret over the fact that japan was nuked the movie added nothing to this aspect the movies way of attempting to show oppenheimers internal strife as mentioned earlier honestly felt less compelling than that one footage of the real person speaking on television it even culminated in him literally going to the president and saying out loud i feel like i have blood on my hands bruh we may not all be detectives but we can take a hint

the movie put an emphasis on the communist accusations against him and i actually thought it was good  people dont really talk about that part when thinking of oppenheimer however the execution just couldnt cut it there was no attempt at dramatising just having things look bad for oppie at first then plot twist strauss is the bad guy then the movie presented hill speaking for oppie and against strauss like a deus ex machina sorta thing then bad guy loses yay happy ending okay this was an opportunity to show the significance of that trial for oppenheimer personally and they let it slip

and a special mention oh dear the incessant camera cuts during 1on1 dialogue scenes towards the start of the movie i know there is no right or wrong in filmmaking or in the creative field in general still thats the classic amateurofamateurs mistake and im not nitpicking  its not like im scanning through the film again to scrutinise it it was so jarring while i was watching it

perhaps the one thing i liked was the very final moments of the movie i liked how it circled back to the very start of the movie and it was a good line good way to end a 3hour allovertheplace biopic it did have that thoughtprovoking spark although its nothing novel oppenheimers opinions on nuclear weaponry and the final 1 certainly cant carry the other 99 my lasting impression is mostly this was quite a waste of all the acting talent especially cilian",2023-08-01 07:46:08
i guess i was confused this whole time i was expecting the trinity test scene to transport us into the actual gaget at the moment of ignition showing the firing pins igniting the explosives and the chain reaction they showed small glimpses of what i thought that might look like but when the test finally came it was pretty underwhelming,2023-07-21 04:08:49
josh peck definitely got cut out of that film badddd,2023-07-21 14:57:47
"only 10ish into american prometheus before seeing the film last night the book quickly dives into oppenheimers erratic moody and intense nature that i think cillian murphy and nolan nearly perfectly depicted at first i thought the film started with too much scene cutting but as it progressed i think it actually set the tone well i thoroughly enjoyed how it went back and forth morally speaking oppenheimer and the los almos team in general were taking this new beautiful physics that emerged in the last 20 years and turning it into the potential destruction of mankind that still poses a threat today while being both immensely proud and devastatingly guilt ridden having these scenes of an arms race in one of the most influential wars of all time interwoven with the destruction of oppenheimers own career was so well done all the acting from murphy to downy jr to the far too few blunt scenes was just phenomenal will definitely be seeing the film again in theaters when i finish the book 

10 out of  10",2023-07-21 18:01:44
i fell asleep,2023-07-21 20:43:18
"decent film with some brilliant scenes and moments the  bomb test his speech oppenheimers wife being questioned

i just didnt enjoy it as much as i was hoping to didnt really care for the convoluted strauss plot maybe that was just a bit too subtle for me 

also i dont think the chain reaction metaphor wasnt as clever as they thought feels a bit like nolan built the film around this",2023-07-21 23:14:41
florence pugh was the real bomb in this movie ,2023-07-22 00:42:41
i’m a pretty big technerd guy this was my first movie i 70mm imax and i was not impressed at all it was just big but nothing else really stood out i was in an end seat which made it awkward what am i missing,2023-07-22 13:36:32
"solid but the final third repeatedly lost me everytime i thought i understood what was happening something else happened and i was lost again 

also didnt really see the point in florence pugh being in it the scenes didnt do anything for me 

1st half was much stronger imo but didnt think nolans style was especially suited to a biopic there were a lot of great shots but its still really exposition heavy

it worked better once they moved on los álamos and when the plan was being formed up to fruition",2023-07-22 20:07:26
anyone else have trouble hearing the dialogue  im wondering if it was just because of imax but it seemed like the score was twice as loud as the dialogue and it was hard to follow what was going on  honestly i thought most of the movie didnt need a score at all,2023-07-22 22:02:06
"my feeling coming out of this movie is that i had a read on everyone but robert oppenheimer by the end of it for a biopic its incredibly not insightful about his motivations his beliefs his origins or even what he was really like when hes not being bad at running meetings

all of the scenes where hes not in public  where its him and one of his women for instance  murphy plays him as a cypher as though oppenheimer leaves himself in his pocket when he takes his pants off the scene that most literally sets itself up as the reveal  where oppenheimer under the probing inquiry of strauss clearance renewal board is literally exposed  actually turns out to be the reverie of his wife as the secret tragedies of their marriage are suddenly laid bare

it just seems like a whole movie full of things that happen to robert oppenheimer including lewis strauss falling flat on his face due to absolutely nothing that oppenheimer actually did why did we need an hour to set up the downfall of this guy who had nothing to do with the manhattan project at all

and whats even the moral of the movie as delivered by albert einstein robert remember to hold a grudge against these scientists you worked with for the rest of your whole life

 alden ehrenreich as senate aide
 scott grimes as counsel

really i see it as evidence that nolan pretty substantially misuses the three hour runtime that a 13rd of the movie is given over to this section where 23 characters dont even have names",2023-07-23 04:50:39
"not sure where the complaints about the sound mixing is coming from i watched it in an imax cinema and the only parts i couldnt hear are the parts that obviously arent supposed to be like when theyre talking about the h bomb for instance where oppenheimer was disassociating with the world 

i was absolutely fine with everything else and could understand it perfectly fine even the more complex dialogue much better than tenet which even i cant defend 

i loved the approach that was taken for the film it had an ethereal feel for the first hour and i liked it there was a bit where i felt it went a bit long after the test but it picked up pace and finished very strong 

i loved all of the performances in the film and i dont think i can say that about most films 

and the music was perfect and used so well 

one film that will stick with me for sure this is for sure one of the scariest films ive seen in a while",2023-07-23 15:26:58
"i remember leaving the movie theater and couldnt believe that 3 hours went by that fast the pacing was perfect and never felt like there was a lull in the screentime 

every 10 minutes some big actor just randomly showed up and i loved every time that happened even though you knew that the test was going to be a success when the countdown was happening and they knew the chance of a chain reaction of potentially lighting up the atmosphere i had a goosebumps and hearing oppie breath as the  commencing was surreal

overall solid 45 idk if id see it again due to the time but absolutely a must see regardless",2023-07-24 14:48:17
"i was super hyped for this movie because ive been a fan of cillian murphy so i was excited to see him finally get a lead role in a big movie plus i quite enjoy biopics 

i would say this met my expectations and then exceeded it the build up to the trinity test was thrilling and i felt tense and on the edge of my seat i know a lot of people were disappointed with the explosion but i thought it was sufficiently impressive  i especially liked how they used silence as in that moment it allowed me as an audience member to feel a combination of awe anxiety for the sound that was about to come and dread 

i was expecting this to maybe be the climax of the movie but when it went on to the conclusion of his security clearance being revoked and even later into his life when he was given awards etc i realised nolan was trying to fit oppenheimers entire life story into this 3hour movie and the trinity test was just one significant moment in his life vast amount of content i appreciate the ambition of the movie but i cant help but wonder if it would have benefited from a tighter storyline  narrower scope as at times it felt like it was rushing through events i would say come into the movie with some understanding at least of oppenheimers history as the movie doesnt spend too much time explaining things to you and assumes you have some contextual knowledge already eg i was lost on what was going on with strauss at the senate

also i know some people think they should have actually shown the hiroshima bombings and aftermath but i actually think it works that they didnt  the movie is about oppenheimers life we see things from his perspective and he didnt actually get to see the bombings its not a disaster movie so i appreciated it actually that they didnt do that though when he was watching the slideshows i felt like one or two photos to show the effects would have driven the point home a bit more 

i would give it a solid 810 overall",2023-07-25 19:35:57
this felt like a tv mini series shortened and edited to a film many scenes seemed short just to establish a beat weirdly enough for a three hour film there wasnt enough time to simmer on personal rivalries etc thats my main complaint,2023-07-28 00:18:57
"disclaimer id intended to make a post to give the uninitiated a heads up but since it got removed due to this pinned discussion ill throw this dross here while it feels a bit useless since everyone here has likely seen the movie already i feel like an  having typed all this so feel free to ignore as you will original post



psa you dont need to see oppenheimer in imax or 70mm

edit scratch the 70mm bit i dont know enough about it it may well be a worthy pursuit but i stand by the imax disclaimer

im only saying this because as the release approached i saw a bunch of articles about how this movie was going to change the way we see movies  its a landmark production  the only way to experience it in imax or 70mm or even 70mm imax as nolan intended etc

i just saw it great movie i loved it i saw it at my local cinemark in the xd theater so a bigger screen than most but nothing super fancy

anyhow of all the bigtime landmark movies that might make this claim this is not the one that you need to see in imax

i saw the matrix reloaded in imax back in the day i think its the only movie ive ever seen in imax it was fun i was in college and got  in the parking lot beforehand so extra fun  uncomfortable somehow but that film had a certain draw to it that made sense  its a bigbudget huge set piece action movie we all loved the original matrix and given its nature imax suited the experience

now if this were mad max fury road or villeneuves dune or even an animated gem like spiderman across the spiderverse  or even one of nolans other ventures like inception or the dark knight  id say that imax would be a grand way to experience these movies i know that its not that simple and that special cameras are involved in filming etc

my point is the vast majority of this movie is just men in suits talking to each other its men in suits at a legal hearing men in suits at what looks like a deposition men in suits in a classroom men in suits making preparations for the manhattan project dont get me wrong  i was glued to the screen its wildly compelling stuff i waited until the last possible moment to jet to the mens room to  but its certainly nothing that needs to be seen in the imax format where the giant screen devours your peripheral vision and youre paying 28 for a movie ticket

see it on a big screen its a great movie but you dont need to dish out the premium ticket for that special movie experience when youre just watching people talking to each other for most of three hours",2023-07-28 11:59:48
"i couldn’t keep track of all the characters  so few of the supporting cast of scientists were developed enough to properly understand their motivations or allegiances 

the guy who ran outside to watch the test i honestly couldn’t remember if he’d been in the film at all up until that point or if he’d been set up as someone impulsive or something and this was an example of that",2023-07-29 18:50:09
christopher nolan really is a master filmmaker and if there are any aspiring filmmakers this film is a great one to study,2023-07-31 00:45:23
"just got out of the movie and i am completely blow away by oppenheimer i was one of those sceptics when the trailer came out and almost decided to not watch the movie but good  mr nolan indeed delivered 

the performances of the stellar cast the making the visual effects the background score everything about this movie was pure brilliance this is cinema at its best 

cillian that was a performance of a lifetime matt damon emily blunt robert downey jr all brilliantly  performed 

finally nolan  thank you for delivering this master piece which otherwise would have ended up as a netflix documentary",2023-08-02 13:53:12
all time great movie it was an experience to watch it one of the best movies ive ever seen and ive seen over 2000 movies this falls in the top 1015 easily absolute masterpiece the score is amazing and just added to the suspense nolan found a way to make a biopic into a suspenseful thriller a 3 hour long movie a biopic and rated r will have likely grossed close to 1 billion when its all said and done  masterpiece this is art,2023-08-14 04:45:51
i wasnt intrigued to watch it because i saw 3h and biographybut i gave it a shot to see why is so many people praising himand now i know this movie is  good history and political aspect is brilliantly made acting is on point,2023-11-21 18:33:05
"i just got out of the 70mm film showing and was kind of underwhelmed honestly

i knew it was a straightforward historical biopic which im fine with but it was just a lot of like a lot of talking in rooms and direct logistical depictions of the actual production of the weapon the big payoff scene was personally underwhelming since they went with an extreme close up of the explosion for obvious reasons since nolan didnt want cgi and i felt a ton of the impact of the test the explosion and the ramifications for mankind was lost

overall it felt way more direct history chanel biography to me than cinematic experience about a man a project and a weapon changing the course of humankind",2023-07-23 09:13:36
"my honest opinion is going to get me hate for this but i’ll say it anyway i didn’t think the movie was that good 

yes it managed to keep me entertained but that was impressive due to the fact but the way it was portrayed was pretty shoddy the play on the timeline was hard to follow at least to begin with the confusing use of black and white shots to show scenes from strauss’ view was not obvious the black and white seemed to initially present scenes that happened after the creation of the bomb which led to confusion until you later figured out what they were trying to portray the first 30 mins of the film felt like it used 30 seconds clips to introduce every character one after the other not long enough for the characters being introduced to create a lasting imprint in your brain some of these characters seemed to only be reintroduced in the last 40 mins of the entire film meaning you had completely forget their names and who they were from the beginning of the film which at this point was over 2 hours ago the scene transitions and time leaps seemed random one minute oppenheimer is teaching a class the next he’s attending a party with seemingly no mention or lead up to the party actually happening from what i can recall the whole movie to me played out as if it was a mood board random scenes and ideas that were important to the plot of the movie but lacked any actual structure to lead one scene into the next it felt like reading a book that had all the major plot points for the story but no build up or segway into each plot point like a bullet point list of events in oppenheimer life rather than an actual movie 

the cast was great
the subject matter fantastic
the scenes overall entertaining 
but the structuring of the film absolutely ruined it",2023-07-26 00:38:10
i’m in the minority as i didn’t enjoy it the score the tension the cinematography were all fantastic but i was bored,2023-08-04 23:29:47
i genuinely dont know why people are so shocked that christopher nolan is not michael bay the movie is about the theoretical physicist behind the atomic bomb not the actual bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki which are already well documented,2023-07-22 11:05:14
"every time i thought this movie would end it kept adding another 20 minutes lol 

good movie but id probably never willingly watch it again",2023-07-23 06:19:52
surprised be the amount of people who seem underwhelmed by the film i think a lot of people seem to have come in to the film expecting spectacle first and foremost because of how much weve heard about nolan and practical effects but at the end of the day this movie is a character study yes the imax format can be used to heighten the spectacle but here its used so we can see every pore on cillian murphys face its more about close ups on moments of high emotional intensity than about making the explosions look impressive and i think it succeeds,2023-07-25 00:46:45
"i think it was spectacular

pretty much every conversation was brilliantly written and acted which is absolutely essential for a film like this the film is gripping and filled with tension but doesnt ever pretend to draw tension from the questions of whether they will successfully build the bomb or not

the politics and characters of the film are complex and brilliantly showcased i really enjoy the way the story unravels personally and allows nolan to sneak in his nonlinear storytelling and some twists in a story that most of the audience know the outcome of

i really dont think it was overhyped but you could argue it was wrongly hyped the sound design is spectacular and the successful bomb  wonderfully directed but i dont think thats one of the scenes that stick with you when you walk out of the theatre im glad i saw it in imax but the things that make the film sensational wouldnt be lost watching it at home

an an absolute smorgasbord of incredible actors given some fantastic dialogue to sink their teeth into coupled with nolans typical top class sound and visuals

i think its nolans first home run in a while",2023-07-26 19:06:51
"i literally was able hear like 30 of what was being said nolan really needs to work on his sound mixing  and he can’t make an excuse for a movie like this which is solely based on dialogue

and before anyone asks i did watch it at a legit 70mm imax theater and the audio levels for dialogue was still ",2023-07-27 02:48:13
it felt like there were two movies the first part was good the second part turned exclusively into a court show which also wasnt really a court the bomb explosion was a little disappointing but the acting was 1010,2023-08-13 10:14:41
"i felt the themes and ideas were there but it was sooooo poorly executed i saw this with three friends we all work in the film industry so we had a long discussion afterwards we agreed on a lot of things but interestingly i was the only one that came away disliking it

i think the purpose of the trial and communist angle is to show that in the war machine anybody and everyone can be a casualty a microcosm of dropping a bomb on innocent citybystander even for someone like oppenheimer the father of the bomb was just a  in the game who can be chewed up and spit to the side oppenheimer gave the us an incredibly powerful weapon and edge in the war yet ends up becoming a casualty himself  he tried to speak on the dangers of the bomb but gets silenced in the end thats why at the end they say the awards arent for you hes just a  to use and they use his notoriety for propaganda  lauding him on magazines like an american hero if you drop a nuke it doesnt give a flying  if your its dad does it

so i felt the idea and theme was there but incredibly poorly executed the scenes dialogue story character dynamics felt so redundant repetitive and long  so many scenes where different people getting questioned about his communist past all felt the same the plot never felt like it moved forward didnt feel like there were any cause and effect oddly i didnt feel like his reputation getting dragged in the mud as a communist  or the trial didnt hurt his life so the purpose rather seems meaningless in the end  my friends and i discussed how people in a room talking can be interesting  look at 12 angry men   a masterpiece that still holds the difference is imo 12 angry men the arguments and dialogue move the story in different directions for oppenheimer those scenes felt very repetitive and stagnant

even the scenes where oppenheimer feels the weight of what hes done just felt surface level to me any10 year old understands dropping a bomb is a horrific event so the scene where he sees everyone nuked   it was like oh yeah you didnt know bombs do that lol the purpose of florence pugh relationship was to show his loss grief and how that relates to if he felt like how he lost someone to a nuke but again it just felt so poorly executed pughs character was so one dimensional and their relationship felt so forced and contrived  after the film i joked to my buddy why the  he so hung up on his side piece and we couldnt stop laughing about it one second he meets emily blunt and they have chemistry next scene shes knocked up and then next scene shes suddenly a   poor relationship and character development

i think they missed the boat on exploring the humanity and duality of creating a weapon of mass destruction the us was afraid of monsters that could use nukes on them yet they become the monsters themselves dropping two bombs on a country that was ready to surrender the morality of preemptive strikes was just an afterthought

at the end of the day we all like movies for different reasons my film friends and i agreed it was too long convoluted repetitive but they enjoyed it for various reasons some liked the history of it some enjoyed  the artistic directorial and editorial choices cinematography etc for me im very critical of story character so it just was not for me",2023-08-20 19:44:52
hated that nolan thought that this movie needed a pissy mustache twirling villain with monologue included with rdj he was mean to me with einstein made me laugh,2023-08-28 19:26:17
this movie was mostly disappointing and over hyped i hate how they down played the explosion i thought that was a cop out the last act of the film was also extremely slow and boring,2023-10-10 07:02:22
am i the only one who was a bit disappointed,2023-07-21 11:37:06
im a huge nolan fan but i felt a little underwhelmed with the delivery of the trinity test i dont feel like it delivered on the scale of horror it boasted in fact the beginning explosions in the opening were scarier,2023-07-21 14:17:40
this movie was like somebody took a world class hbo show 3 seasons of 10 hours each and edited it down to a runtime of three hours every individual thing about this movie was amazing casting acting cinematography set design music etc but as a cohesive piece it suffocates under its own weight lines are delivered too quickly the beats of the story arent really connected causally its just this happens then this happens then this happens for three hours in my humble opinion this film has so much wasted potential if dune gets two films this should have had at least three when some of the most interesting and enigmatic scientists of the 20th century show up as cameos with less than ten words of spoken dialogue theres a problem people are going to call it one of the best films of the year but i honestly really dont see it to me its just the cult of nolan all over again,2023-07-22 21:03:13
holy  what an insanely incredibly well done movie just saw oppenheimer in imax finally a movie that lives up to the enormous hype and still delivers more,2023-07-22 22:12:18
kinda surprised by all the lukewarm or negative feelings on the movie in this thread it’s not my favorite film ever but the level of ambition and filmmaking pedigree on display here compared to 95 of other films we get in theaters nowadays is not even comparable i always enjoy nolan films but he’s never been a goto filmmaker for me but this is my favorite film of his for sure seems like a culmination of all the techniques he’s built up over his career paired with an unbelievable adaptation of the novel with which staying true to the original work was one of his priorities,2023-07-23 19:40:15
"all the complaints about the trinity test are a symptom of meme culture clearly getting to people  

people really went in ready to rate this movie explosion against others like it was some michael bay type  instead of a nolan directed biopic",2023-07-24 02:43:26
i think a lot of people are forgetting that the movie was a biopic about j robert oppenheimer it wasn’t intended to be a history doc about the manhattan project or a science lesson about how fission works the senate scenes are incredibly important to the story of oppenheimer not the story of the atomic bomb strauss successfully revoking his clearance and destroying his credibility alters the us nuclear policy for the duration of the cold war oppenheimer created this existential crisis and then his opportunity to try to fix the wrong he feels was made is revoked he’s forced to live the rest of his life knowing he can’t do anything to help with what he created expecting anything else is like walking into dark knight and expecting more cuts of the joker than batman,2023-07-25 04:19:00
im realizing so many people are disappointed because for some reason they thought this would be about nukes and ww2 and not the guy the film is named after,2023-07-25 14:46:05
"it was an incredible cinematic experience but

the only thing i was bumbed about is the big elephant in the room

the explosion

the build up was perfection

but the actual detonation was very underwhelming for me compared to the actual footage

see for yourself


i wish nolan would have captured this better i think its lack of cgi played a factor in it not beingfeeling nearly as big and impactful",2023-07-25 23:06:17
"it was pretty enjoyable im not a big fan of christopher nolan movies so i went in with tempered expectations and what i saw was better than i expected a few things i didnt like about it or i thought was meh  
  
despite the movie clearly shooting to present itself as somewhat as an epic the global physics academic milleu shown in oppenheimer lacks charm and ultimately feels dull and lifeless especially in comparison to movies like goodfellas or boogie nights that pull off the vibe of a crew pretty well maybe scientists are just boring people but i suspect it has more to do with christopher nolan just not being able to write or direct normal human interactions take the scene at the christmas party for example  here is a perfect opportunity to spend some time letting the various characters weve only seen at work act more natural feel more human to the audience and nolan has to ruin it right away by making the event all big and historic with bohr being introduced at the party  
  
there are some odd choices when it comes to detail like the one scientist dude with the drums  why is he always playing on the drums it felt like a cool detail nolan decided to put in because some character consultant on set knew that fringe detail about one of the scientists at los alamos just felt a bit distracting there are other references to history that also are distracting like this like the name dropping of john f kennedy marvel cinematic universe style  
  
some of the stylistic choices felt pretty stale like when kitty hears about oppenheimers infidelity or when oppenheimer is talking to a crowd after the bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki  
  
also despite the movie attempting to tell us so i would assume that theres a world of difference between feeling guilty for developing a nuclear bomb that killed 70000 people and feeling guilty for breaking up with someone before they commit suicide like i get that nolans trying to draw parallels here since hes known for creating intelligent movies but its quite a stretch  
  
i laughed when i saw einstein appear from behind the car after oppenheimer gets dropped off at his house  i get that einsteins supposed to be the physics yoda in the movie but it felt so out of place a friend i watched the movie said he thought oppenheimer had hallucinated einstein in that scene  
  
emily blunts character was pretty bland she seems to have a tad more character in the first half of the movie but in the second half she devolves into a pretty stereotypical hollywood movie wife oppenheimers anger translator  
  
i just feel like christopher nolan just doesnt really trust his audience he doesnt think theyll know how to respond to a scene so he oversaturates most scenes in his movie with background music and then stops the music at scenes that he really wants you to think as important he has characters often explaining whats going on in a scene to the audience because he thinks the audience cant grasp whats happening onscreen this kind of spoonfeeding sometimes feels too obvious to the point where it almost feels 4th wall shattering  
  
despite these flaws it was overall pretty watchable the atomic bomb scene people said was underwhelming  i actually quite liked but not enough to watch this movie again 610",2023-08-07 01:58:45
"i finally saw it last night had to wait that long to get a showing in 70mm 

great movie expertly shot acted and the sound design was awesome it could have lost 20 min of runtime and nobody would have known the difference most movies these days have that problem  as others have said herethere was a lot of of buildup of a few plot lines without a respectful payoff those threads could have been left on the cutting room floor and the movie would not have suffered one bit  

that saidthere was no reason to shoot a courtroom drama like this in imax",2023-08-10 12:50:52
"huge nolan fan saw in imax london underwhelming 

acting especially cillian was brilliant 

the audio mixing was borderline painful struggled to hear around 2030 of dialogue over the ambient noises and average score particularly in the first hour the sound design itself is really cool but its hard to take in and enjoy when youre being clubbed to death by it 

the structure is really janky and barely felt like a nolan film act 1 is a  of dialogue and music passing by at light speed act 2 ending with trinity is definitely the strongest act 3 was enjoyable but could have been a different film entirely 

visuals were brilliant but i wasnt a fan of the black and white cuts in act 3 

film is decent but i probably would have enjoyed watching it at home more than imax due to the audio cillian steals the show easily my least enjoyed nolan film",2023-08-18 18:46:28
"nolan has cultivated such a cult and brand surrounding him that any criticism of his movies that are not the technical aspects like sound mixing will be deflected by saying you just didnt get it 

nolan made a pretty straightforward biopic that had some great moments but if this was directed by anyone other than nolan this movie wouldnt get a fraction of the hype",2023-07-21 09:54:38
its a solid 810 movie im just glad they didnt make anyone look like a hero,2023-07-21 11:07:16
"can i just say i wished they added cgi to the test bomb it was too small and too “free” idk how to describe it

as much as it looked good id definitely didnt feel like an atomic bomb it felt like heaps of tnt detonated alltogether my take only",2023-07-21 13:00:07
"to echo the comments of others i think this is nolan’s best work to date it’s a bit messy around the edges and i felt like some of the time jumps in the first half did more to muddle than to clarify but it’s undoubtedly a masterpiece

also rdj and emily blunt steal every scene they’re in i’m sniffing best supporting oscar nom for rdj",2023-07-21 14:36:57
"i am very disappointed that the movie kept the lie that los alamos was created from scratch and not from stolen land where the latino population were given 24 hours to leave and all their herds were shot  and then they were forced to work  without the protection given to white people

otherwise good movie",2023-07-21 18:44:20
i’m glad so many of you enjoyed it but personally i was really bored by it i appreciate how well made and acted it was but the structure of the story didn’t keep me engaged just kept bouncing around different periods of time without any room to breathe and it became hard to keep up with what happened when gonna watch it again in the future at home with subtitles and hope that helps,2023-07-21 18:46:58
"i wasnt a fan 

the cinematography and acting is some of the best ive ever seen in a movie 

on the other hand i found the pacing to be boring im familier with oppenheimer and his story and even then at times i found it hard to follow its as if the movie wanted to pull a westworld season 2 and try to be obtuse as possible with telling the story out of order i like that in fictional stories but not in a bio pic with a lot of charectors 

the marketing also heavily pushed nuclear weapons and the movie swung and missed here oppenheimer in the movie of course feels bad terrible and awful for having created such a terrible weapon but the movie doesnt really show why theyre so bad and terrible he winces at some slides of the aftermath of hiroshima but they arent shown in the movie he goes crying to the president about his feelings the movie didnt really show why he was so against it we all know why but the movie would have been better served if it showed that better it assumes the audience is intimently familier with why nuclear weapons are bad but in the modern day i think the horror of nukes needs to be shown on screen to remind us it tried by showing icbms flying and skin peeling off of random audience members but imo it didnt get the message across it focused more upon his personal hand wringing rather than about the topic of nuclear weapons themselves which with the advent of the ukraine war and pakistanindia sabre rattling is needed now more than ever",2023-07-21 20:20:49
"good movie chris nolan does a biopic 

the bomb is probably underwhelming on purpose in order to show the disappointment oppie feels

in the scheme of things the test was miniscule 

in the scheme of things the real bombings are out of his hands distant unseen but devastating long term for him and his psyche

in the scheme of things he was probably most hurt by the loss of his security clearance above all else in life to go from being the heart of top secret projects to being an outcast is painful he was the golden child father of the largest modern weapon 

the structure and focus were masterfully crafted to reflect oppenheimers perspectives and thats a right proper thing by no means a hollywood blockbuster but rather the showcasing of how those hard moments felt to the genius himself as he rose and subsequently fell",2023-07-21 22:06:10
absolutely brilliant film cant recommend  it enough really well told and had some brilliant moments in it everyone was excellent as expected easily best film ive seen in the last year,2023-07-21 23:22:30
"a phenomenal film from one of the premier directors of his era the organization of the various storylines was not only coherent but exceptionally crafted to represent the complexity and gravity of this dark period in history

brilliant direction acting and cinematography many people nitpicking the trinity test as underwhelming are missing the point from the perspective of oppenheimer the bomb and  its initial explosion is not about admiringglorifying its raw power and destructiveness even after dedicating years of ones life towards its creation

nolan respects his subject matter and its surrounding history doing well to not deviate too much into the stories of the side characters but in highlighting their roles in relation to oppenheimer  the  scene in the trial between oppy  pugh is one of the only complaints i have  nolan seems to be talking down to his audience and spelling out the words for them afraid they are unaware of kittys perspective in lieu of oppys infidelity which emily blunt masterfully does already through her  expressions

this film properly grapples with the agonizing moral complexity inherent to the bombs creation its purpose and its future influence on world relations  the dialogue is kubrickesque at moments with its humor and is also reminiscent of screwball comedy in other snappy exchanges  most importantly nolan captures the development of oppenheimer succinctly as his arrogant and stubborn personality transforms into ambiguity

one of the best films in the last decade one of the most surreal and polished biopics and arguably nolans best film to date",2023-07-22 00:08:52
"absolutely loved this film from start to finish i was totally invested  some people are hating on this film i am not a nolan fanboy but i thought this rocked  cillian murphy is such a great leading man  

question this movie made me want to scratch an itch regarding oppenheimer and the manhattan project  any books you all could recommend  

thanks",2023-07-22 00:47:30
"wow what a movie this movie will clean up at the oscars

rdj was just brilliant cillian delivered a near perfect performance

i would have loved to have seen adrian brody in this movie",2023-07-22 01:01:39
did anyone else find the first 23rds of the movie a mess in terms of pacing get like a 56 hour miniseries condensed down to 3 hours,2023-07-22 05:33:23
"asking this in good faith because ive seen this sentiment a lot but why are so many people shaken to the core by the ending exactly i expected the end to be a real gut punch after everything thats been said but oppenheimer expressing that the nuclear weapon might be the destruction of us all is

a objectively true  he would have known that the second he understood the scale of the weapon so why would it be a revelation for him to think that

and

b something hed already expressed many times in the film already",2023-07-22 14:50:39
"no cgi for a nuclear bomb that’s capable of destroying the earth as reiterated multiple times throughout the film

a weapon that nearly eradicated two major japanese cities

a weapon that accelerated the arms race

no cgi for a weapon so strong that it ensured the concept of mutually assured destruction

extremely strange editorial choice in my opinion",2023-07-22 15:36:33
anyone else find the dialogue hard to understandhear at times saw it in imax,2023-07-22 16:08:18
"just got out of my 1115 viewing of this incredible film cillian murphy rightly deserves all the praise he is getting and he will undoubtedly be nominated and possibly win best actor 

however to me rdj absolutely knocked it out of the park as strauss he gave a powerhouse supporting performance 

anyways the movie was sooo good i could hear a pin drop in the theater during the “i have become death destroyer of worlds” scene when the bomb went off what blows my mind is that there was no cgi used i’m still trying to figure out how they did that 

anyways imo among nolan’s best if not his best best picture is likely in the bag",2023-07-22 19:17:44
we must respect the genius of nolan to turn a biography of a scientist into a blockbuster movie,2023-07-22 21:53:39
"i’m pretty torn on this one the acting was all very strong so i have no complaints there i think the final third was pretty underwhelming though all of that drama and arguing and talking over a security clearance 

the thing really sticking in my craw is oppenheimer’s relationship with his wife she seemed so dedicated and loyal for the test and during all the security clearance stuff but pretty much everything else made it seem like they didn’t really like each other weird dynamic",2023-07-23 00:37:45
"mixed feelings overall
film was gorgeous and extremely welldirected and acted but it was overstuffed overwritten overedited and overscored

did not care for the communist ties stuff and i wish the last hour had leaned more into him coming to grips with what he had done rather than give us one incredible scene and have us take the rest for granted

i thought the women were pointless even though emily blunt was great in her scenes i did not get what her deal was as a character actually i didn’t get anyone’s deal as a character

for a character study i feel like i didn’t get to know a single thing about oppenheimer’s inner workings 

there was just too much going on too much bombardment of dialogue too much time jumping sequences which never felt more than the sum of their parts

the score while lovely on its own felt manipulative in creating dramatic tension",2023-07-23 04:38:24
"i thought the first half felt very disjointed more like a collection of scenes rather than a coherent movie do you guys think that was an intentional stylistic choice maybe to show the craziness of his life then to really juxtapose it with the postbomb world

for context i absolutely loved the movie i thought it was alright in the first half save for the above comment but the second half was astounding",2023-07-23 06:15:39
just saw it and im mixed i knew what i was getting into with a biopic a lot of dialogue and to hopefully learn more about the man who lead the development of the atomic bomb however the scenes were so disjointed with multiple timelines and story beats that i had serious trouble following along at times this felt more like a collection of scenes that somehow ended up being less than the sum of their parts i also feel like i didnt get to know oppenheimer that well i could see how the creation of the bomb affected him as well as the legal battle with strauss but i felt like i didnt get to know him compared to other biopics it was overscored to  not every scene needs to have a piece of music tied to the background i thought interstellar and tenet had similar issues so im assuming its just a nolan thing i did enjoy the race against the clock aspect and the build up to the trinity test was the most tense ive felt in a theater in a long time also absolutely loved the ending scene with einstein it was a solid 710,2023-07-23 09:04:03
"was overall a great movie and a wonderful cinema experience 

however cant help but feel like the nonlinear storytelling was completely unnecessary for the most part in a film like this a choice based on style over substance it made the story that much more difficult to follow and almost pretentious 

also didnt feel like there was an emotional connection with any of the characters at all partly due to the speed of the film 3 hours of going at 100mph which ties into my first point again

the trinity test scene was absolutely amazing loved how it was done as well as the scenes following that particularly the gym speech some of the best directing and conveyance of emotion ive seen in a while those are the show parts of the movie the third act unfortunately is entirely tell and does not leave much to the imagination a courtroom drama can be fun exciting and thoughtprovoking this had all the material to be that but truthfully it just felt exhausting trying to keep up with all the information being thrown at you overall 7810 for me",2023-07-23 09:14:23
in the third act when rdj was explaining to the audience how smart oppenheimer was for fooling them it was sooo annoying felt like a badly written scene,2023-07-23 10:38:43
"the first half of the movie lost a lot of points in my eyes from the editing  there were so many flashbacks flash forwards change of time change of scene etc  at one point there was even a flashback within a flashback which really got me  it was digestible but so unnecessary  there was also probably 15 minutes of unnecessary material in the last act surrounding the trial over his security clearance  the story really bogged down in that section

people in the prisoner of the moment keep bandying around words like masterpiece and magnum opus  but to me it wasnt it was any other chris nolan film which had like 95 brilliance and 5 what the  were they even doing here  closer to an a than an a",2023-07-23 11:09:10
"it was a good movie  but you really dont need to see it on an imax screen in fact i dont understand why nolan even shot it in imax since the majority of the film is just discussions between scientistspoliticians and the trinity test just looks like every other hollywood explosion  in fact it was extremely underwhelmingdisappointing  i say nolan failed to deliver on that end especially when all the advertising says to watch this film on as large a screen as possible  

so yeah imax is very unnecessary imo  save your money and see it on a regular screen

but still  good movie  im sure cillian and robert downy jr will receive oscar nods",2023-07-23 14:00:38
i am a huge fan of nolan but i must say i was a bit disappointed i get that this movie is a biography about oppenheimer not atomic bomb but the trailer and all the posters helped shape my expectations such that i expected to see more visually stunning scenes portraying the explosion as well as the nolantypical science things the movie was good overall but it fell short of my expectations,2023-07-23 20:28:07
this was one of the best movies i have ever seen i loved it,2023-07-24 03:09:35
does anybody feel that the whole discourse surrounding nolan and his apparent disdain for cg has reached toxic levels especially in light of the news that he hasnt credited 80 of the people who worked on the vfx of oppenheimerpersonally as someone who feels that cg is an incredibly effective tool that has given us some amazing sequences  and im not just referring to the great but obvious examples like say avatar or gollum or caesar but more so something like finchers skillful use of them  the whole current everything is done for real anticg trend just feels thoroughly meanspirited to me especially when theyre downright lies and downplays the contributions of hundreds of cg artists whove put in their blood sweat and tears into the workand its not just oppenheimer i noticed this with the new mission impossible where all the marketing suggested that all the stunts were practical whereas its evident that cg has been used  quite judiciously i might add  in all of the stunts  something that even the director confirmed at this point being a cg artist feels like an utterly thankless job  you do your job well and nobody notices and are blamed when it doesnt turn out 100 perfect all that after working for low pay under insane crunch and deadlineslastly and this may be an unpopular opinion  nolans distaste for cg actually affects his work adversely in my humble opinion post inception none of his filmss set pieces have ever filled me with awe or felt spectacular to me interstellar being the sole exceptioncg works great in accentuating the impact of a set piece even if it is mostly practical  george miller himself has admitted to used a lot of cg to heighten the impact of the stunts in mad max fury road  but most of nolans set pieces post inception have fell flat to me not least of which was the much hyped trinity test sequence in oppenheimer the build up to the test was more exciting than the actual test itself in fact if anyone here has seen twin peaks season 3 i wager you can attest to the fact that same test sequence in that film  done with cg i might add  conveyed way more of the dread awe and sheer terror of an atomic bomb blast,2023-07-24 08:10:12
"my first comment to my gf about this movie was im so glad i read the book beforehand i dont know how anyone could follow all the political intrigue and characters involved in any other way maybe that wasnt the point and people got the effects without necessarily following every line of reasoning and every accusation leveled at oppie

also nolans dialogue sound thing is still an issue i felt i was constantly trying to decipher the dialogue despite being a native english who had read the entire book a month ago sitting dead center in an imax theater anyone outside these parameters especially nonnative english speakers will definitely have a hard time and appreciate when they can watch with subtitles i know i personally will

having said all this i enjoyed it and am just shocked at how nolan basically adapted the whole book minus adolescence and retirement",2023-07-24 09:27:41
"pacing was too hectic never a moment without score or dialogue no chance to let the audience absorb anything it was always right on to the next thing at first i figured it was a reflection of the sense of urgency of the project but the pace kept up for the whole movie

mixing was bad i had to really focus to listen and my girlfriend said she couldnt understand at least 25 of the dialogue

the problem with not using cgi is that youre now trying to use conventional methods to portray a completely unconventional method of warfare as a result the trinity test was underwhelming there was no sense of scale to the explosion the fireball looked like a pool of gasoline set on fire

with such a lack of focus on the atomic explosions why was there a need to see this in imax or 70mm sure the hearings looked good but i would have enjoyed them just as much on a regular screen i think

good movie got its point across effectively but there was a lot that could have been done better in my opinion",2023-07-24 16:11:23
the movie was interesting for sure but it dragged on for too long there were plenty of scenes that could have been cut and the movie would be the same there was no real plot it didnt really feel like a story there wasnt really a climax or resolution it felt like a camera following around a real person oppenheimer during a portion of his life,2023-07-25 02:16:47
this was easily my favourite nolan film its just so so good i want to see it again immediately also as a science student this was my infinity war  it felt so funny that every 2 minutes another physicist showed up,2023-07-25 14:27:28
"it’s so great that this movie is an event i love marvel but i feel like it’s applied pressure on directors to assume viewers have no understanding of nuance

oppenheimer isn’t needlessly complicated either it’s not meant to be a  the nonlinear structure complements the narrative by contrasting the perspectives of oppenheimer and strauss as “fusion” and “fission”

class movie man hope nolan goes on to make more",2023-07-26 14:46:46
just seen it was one of the best films i have seen in the past 10 or so years i expected more inaccuracies but i was genuinely impressed with how much nolan got right the trinity test scenes were visually stunning and would give it a solid 9810,2023-07-26 22:41:50
this 3 hour movie didn’t drag first movie i’m on the edge of my seat for the detonation scene,2023-07-28 04:46:12
"what a great film i often come away from films with something about them i didnt like or wouldve changed but this is the first film in a long time where i couldnt think of a single criticism

every scene every actor everything was as perfect as it needed to be 

i really enjoyed how the movie was essentially a deconstruction of great man theory a lot of the characters see themselves as great men who define history only to be bought down by their own hubris chiefly oppenheimer and strauss but even einstein teller and truman each one thinks theyre the centre of the universe only to have it come crashing down einstein and truman are loose fits einstein doesnt give off the same hubris as the others but the outcome is the same while trumans treatment of oppenheimer and his statement of they dont care about who built the bomb only who dropped it channels the same hubris but we dont see the same vilification oppenheimer and strauss experience what was ironic about this was that a trailer for napoleon preceded the film

such a layered film probably nolans best",2023-07-29 21:47:06
nolan just made his magnum opus bro is still growing as a director can’t wait for what is to come,2023-07-29 23:34:10
"loved the movie  ill say that the movie was terrifyingly beautiful the moment when the bomb dropped my theater was dead silent and then the sound boom came from the bomb and that was epic 

anyone recommend more historical movies like this",2023-07-30 10:30:11
my favorite part of this thread is that all 6 of the people who didn’t like it on the rt meter are in here if you did nothing else but read this thread you would think the movie was  lol,2023-07-31 02:01:22
i like my fair share of slow movie but i definitely felt it with this one although i do like the film i did expect atleast more sciences revolving the nuke i also think he should’ve used cgi instead of making a huge bomb look like a nuke cause i was able to to tell that wasn’t big enough,2023-08-01 03:09:28
"i love nolan movies but looking back at the dunkirk release i really dont understand how oppenheimer had what feels like a lot more hype i finally saw it today after trying to get imax tickets since release and i didnt even get to see it in 70mm i havent seen a movie this sold out in a while especially with barbie hitting 1bil at the same time its like the country got hit with cinema craze

as for the movie itself i enjoyed it cillian murphy is great gary oldman blends in again if you dont see it coming everything around the test sequence is incredible but this is a film about oppenheimer and not the bomb so it goes deep into the strauss issue and it ends up being too far imo a film about the bomb would have been a better watch but i understand we would have lost a lot of the nuances with oppenheimer the regret after the bombing of hiroshima could have been slapped on to anyone but this was the oppenheimer movie so we got a little more than that i dont think i needed to see florence pugh  in the conference room eitherthat was an excessive amount of nudity serving no real purpose and lastly what about the environmental impacts of los alamos oppenheimer took this place that he loved and destroyed it with lasting impacts to the environment and native people and then personally the university of chicago scenes theres no way you can convince me that basement was just 2 guys in an empty room and a reactor",2023-08-07 07:24:55
"i wish we couldve seen the consequences of opies actions more than just him seeing visions the whole point of what happened after nagasaki and hiroshima was that guilt he carried wouldve loved to explore that more instead of the courtroom drama we got 

x200b

also hot take we shouldve seen the bombs in japan go off but i doubt they would give nolan the budget to create more bombs",2023-08-13 09:53:43
"as close to a 1010 i can think of

one of the best films ive seen in the last few years every actor hit it out of the park even the small roles every beat hit the right note and the pacing was perfect emily blunts kitty has to be the best female character nolan wrote as well 

only issue i have is how the film shifts atmosphere pretty quickly posttrinity the whole movie is centered around the security clearance but i thought it was over dramatized with the the clearance and hearings for strauss maybe not exactly the most interesting subject matter to treat it with such intensity still it was all well shot and well told within the movie so the only real issue is the dramatic shift towards strauss hearings and oppenheimers clearance

other than that near perfect story and storytelling by nolan i read the reviews and reactions and went in thinkint the dialogue will remain stiff nolan but i found it surprisingly engaging yea its still nolans dialogue but i thought it was still great maybe its the acting that carries most of it as well lol

also really really surprising to see the two biggest movies of the year barbie and oppenheimer be this political and about progressiveleftist politics dont think ive ever seen a big hollywood movie portray communists so positively and portray the government basically as the bad guys and ofc barbie was so explicit about the patriarchy doubly surprsing its nolan of all people telling a story pretty positively about communists and communist sympathising figures",2023-08-23 08:04:45
the movie was excellent the people next to me who kept whipping out their phone were terrible and it took a lot of restraint to not yell at them,2023-08-27 22:05:13
"once again nolan leading with his head and not his heart could have been an extremely emotional movie but is treated as a cinematic documentary perfect movie for science nerds or history buffs of quantum mechanicsbecause nearly zero is explainedand what a shame because its such a profound theory

the score is essentially the lead actor i know scorestones are suppose to infer the emotion or lack thereof but this one demands how you should feel

movie itself reminded me of oliver stones jfk with how heavy the dialogue is

410",2023-11-23 15:22:28

"i dont understand how people go to watch a movie called oppenheimer  about  a guy called oppenheimer  with the director confirming to make it historically accurate and then complaincry on reddit that it was boring or shouldve been more than atomic bombswtf lol

absolutely amazing movie stayed historically accurate as possible with amazing symbolism and imagery throughout sound was on point and the direction of the film switching between past and present having the grey screen represent objective views not in the eyes of oppenheimer was phenomenal

"this movie felt like 80 of it was filmed around a boardroom definitely dont need to watch it at imax

was hoping to see more science and build up to the trinity test but most of the movie was just politics

not my cup of tea",2023-08-01 15:43:16
it’s a good watch but imo there was a little too much dialogue considering it’s a 3 hour long movie i was expecting slightly longer bomb sequences but that’s okay cillian killed it literally,2023-07-21 19:06:36
of course i wasn’t expecting an action movie but  if it wasn’t a wee bit boring at times like i really tried to adjust my monocle and tell myself how fine art this is for 2 hours but had to just give up at some point just wasn’t my cup of tea,2023-07-21 19:45:06
"just a few of my scattered thoughts

this was much more of a biopic than i thought it would be i expected it to focus almost completely on the manhattan project so i was pleasantly surprised when it basically turned into a courtroom drama in its third act

as someone who didn’t really know much of the history other than the fact that oppenheimer made the atomic bomb this was a very riveting story for me with lots of twists and turns the whole espionage subplot was really interesting and the “villain reveal” for strauss was unexpected

three scenes in particular gave me chills the detonation the speech and the ending the buildup to the detonation genuinely had my heart racing which for someone who looks at movies as more of a work of art than something to be immersed into is pretty rare i genuinely felt like i was there and i was horrified then you have the speech scene which was haunting and did a good job of personally visualizing the horrors of his creation for oppenheimer with the added bonus of not exploiting japanese victims finally that ending is one i’ll never forget “i believe we did”

the acting performances were great murphy and downey are both front runners in their respective oscar categories damon is very much an unsung  my opinion and all the cameos were effective i do wish blunt was given a bit more to do but she had some good moments in the third act 

on a technical level this film is brilliant the score might be my favorite in any film this year the cinematography visual effects editing and sound design were all top notch and i don’t think this film will get anywhere near as many audio mixing complaints as tenet did 

as for negatives i wish we got to see more of oppenheimer’s scientific genius on the manhattan project itself as opposed to in his schoolboy days i also struggle to decide whether this film was about how the us government diverted all the blame for the bomb onto oppenheimer or if it was about the dangers of the bomb itself as a result it felt a little unfocused to me but that might’ve just been a result of me not expecting the film to focus on oppenheimer’s life as much as it did an issue that could easily go away with a rewatch 

after tenet it seemed like it became the cool thing to hate on nolan for his films being overly pretentious and confusing with bad audio mixing now i have no problem with people hating or loving any filmmaker even my favorites it’s all subjective after all but i do wonder if this film will put nolan right back in the club of reddit’s favorite directors

all in all i  loved it",2023-07-22 04:06:22
long long stretches of this film felt like 100 trailers stitched together particularly considering the tense score that never lets up especially when youre needing to focus on conversation and that no scene seemed to go on for more than a minute or two acting was great visuals were awesome both as expected felt too long though and i wasnt alone a lot of the audience was squirming and checking the time on their phones its getting a lot of praise but i wouldve found it more enjoyable if either shorter for a single film or longer as like a short series to give these great actors more opportunities with their roles,2023-07-23 00:12:53
"i am a bit disappointed that the film didnt delve further into oppenheimers career post his security clearance revocation his continued speeches and appearances all the work he did post los alamos was still impactful stuff that definitely shaped global psyche on weapons of mass destruction he was even politically rehabilitated through jfk

there was an opportunity to end the movie on some more hopeful themes but i guess nihilism is more fun 

that said i loved this movie and every single character rdj killed it as strauss",2023-07-23 05:23:13

after watching the movie today the testscene was pretty much like 30secs at best and the scenes in the trailer looked better than in the movie why the fuzz about the effects if 99 of the movie are talking i give the movie a 610 sound is 810 tenet was like a 210

"cillian and rdj deserve oscars for their performances the imax experience was incredible for this movie while i am usually annoyed with the abrasive sound editing that nolan uses i loved the electric textured pulsating sounds that occur throughout   


i also really enjoyed the procedural court roomesque 3rd act that some people ive seen on social media are saying drags on a bit overall this is a very dialogue heavy movie with incredible performances sound and editing i cant wait to see what nolan does next bond",2023-07-21 16:40:38
when matt damon said “what for” i said  out loud because i knew we entered the third act right then,2023-07-21 16:44:46
"this movie was really good the cast from top to bottom was impressive cillian murphy commanded your attention and was so captivating as the lead robert downey jr also showed why he’s a talented actor beyond just blockbusters as much as i love iron man and his sherlock holmes it’s nice to see him return to dramatic work also emily blunt was sooo good in the last act made me wish she got more to do i also wish florence pugh had more meat on the bone as well really loved how the film wasn’t about a triumphant sense of accomplishment about making a great scientific advancement it was about the pressures that basically guaranteed that nuclear weapons would be created and how oppenheimer has to wrestle with the weight of forces beyond his control truly it shows that human progress is a process of standing on your predecessors’ shoulders and how every little discovery funnels civilization down to the path that we know today in some ways the nuclear arms race was fueled by forces beyond our control and we have to deal with our own complicity and responsibility within that system the ending shot was so effective

barbenheimer was such a fun time at the theater",2023-07-21 21:57:57
did 70mm held my hand over my mouth for the last hour a masterpiece how the  am i gonna be in the mood for barbie in 2 hours,2023-07-22 00:34:11
one of the most impressive films of this decade and ive never been so bored and disengaged 1010,2023-07-22 01:48:38
"my two fav things about the movie

1 the acting cillian and rdj were just killing it even though some people are saying the last 23rd was prolonged but you cant deny rdj ruled that part

2 the soundtrack i was absolutely stunned  im so impressed that this was so well done inspite of not being done by the nolanzimmer duo  crazy nut",2023-07-22 04:48:59
i wonder why nolan chose not to show nagasaki or hiroshima maybe out of respect or maybe it would have been too violent i think this movie could have been more powerful if it showed the consequences,2023-07-22 06:00:46
"rdj was outstanding i must say

it was amazing how he became gradually more and more unlikable over the course of the film to finally getting what he deserved right at the end",2023-07-22 13:48:46
i need to rewatch this with subtitles i felt like i didnt fully understand the plot because if you missed one line of dialog you were  and it was hard to follow 5 time lines at once i also felt it was way too long and could have been 30 minutes shorter i didnt get that normal payoff you get when you finish a movie and woke up today thinking i didnt really enjoy it that much it seems im in the minority and maybe a second viewing would change my view,2023-07-22 18:49:20
three wise men rode in on the 4 horses of the apocalypse terrific film,2023-07-23 02:02:15
i just got back from seeing it and nolan did very well it is such a great story about a man who was thrown away by his country after they used him i loved it,2023-07-23 02:54:13
that the holdovers trailer felt like it went forever  near saw the entire film,2023-07-23 17:54:46
"at the end of the day i was entertained this movie is not fir everyone

btw the  scene really was pretty whatevs like i was expecting fine crazy  but thats all it was",2023-07-24 07:07:52
thought the movie was brilliant definitely worth the 3 hour runtime its just packed with great dialog amazing soundtrack and stunning visuals and a very  worrying message the actors did all an amazing job everyone used their screen time to the fullestfor examplerami malek only had one really important scene in the movie and he just nailed it also really liked the use of black and white for strausss perspective and a colored one for oppenheimer and i really enjoyed the way the movie told his life before creating the atomic bomb and showing how intelligent quick learning yet quite difficult at the same time his life during the creation of the bomb which was a very stressful experience and had many situations that definitely pushed oppenheimer to the limit and his life after the hiroshima and nagasaki bombings filled with political drama and agendas from people he knew for years and the emotions of guilt regret and also fear but also maybe pride for being that one person who changed the world completely also the ending was extremely powerful seeing an old oppenheimer after his whole very stressful even tragic life sitting and shaking hands with people who ultimately played a part in his demise as a person and as a figure overall think this is one of nolans best films for me a 1010,2023-07-25 22:11:04
fantastic film great performances from everyone,2023-07-26 14:45:12

the loudest movie i have ever seen my lord,2023-07-28 13:17:02
"came for cillian murphy in the lead stayed for another nolan favorite

i really enjoyed it i honestly wasnt expecting any less and im glad it met my expectations all the cast fit right into their roles in my opinion dehaan  well surprised me wish we could have seen more of his character he rami malek and josh peck were the last people i expected to see in a nolan film i came to this movie with barely any knowledge about the cast aside from main players cillian rdj damon and emily blunt so throughout the movie i was pleasantly surprised to see so many familiar faces trust nolan to gather a unique league of actors you never thought you would see together in the same movie 

i do agree with others that some things felt a little bit fastpaced i think i need to rewatch the movie just to let some things better sink in i believe this is nolans first biopic and i think he did fantastic overall

i saw it in imax and couldnt help but feel like i was missing something experiencewise this was my first imax experience and 3rd theatre visit in a long time too so i wouldnt know the difference i honestly just blamed it on our not so ideal seating as we were rather close to the screen im not sure if there was supposed to be a 3d effect there somewhere the sound system was awesome though and served the booming of explosions really well 

the sound design was phenomenal the way its used to both enhance the plot and to give insight into oppies conflicted thoughts and later ptsd along with nolans trademark juxtaposition was done really well i got intersteller vibes from some of the scenes and i wasnt at all complaining the score was brilliant but thats sort of a given with nolan films",2023-07-29 14:51:09
"i thought oppenheimer was good the cinematography was stunning and some of the scenes truly drew you in to them 

i just have one question about the style can someone explain to me the choice of having some scenes in black and white and others in colour",2023-07-30 12:05:55
i loved it  ill watch it again and again,2023-08-02 13:47:19
"as a stem student with the hopes of a becoming a future physicist this movie was incredible i’ve already know this stuff for years but to see it on screen was something else

and it’s kind of scary to think about and how we stand on the shoulders of people who led us to this advancement in science in history i’m not saying that we might be the faces the minds of the future science but maybe one day we might have to take part of something some advancement or tech that might not always be good that might destroy more then create

the manhattan project was thousands of people coming together minds from across the globe and they all had to live with the repercussions of what they created and it’s scary to think of and what our future work might one day do",2023-08-02 17:03:47
how long will oppenheimer be in imax is there any date set for this or does it depend on something else,2023-08-03 11:14:12
can anyone help explain how oppenheimer was betrayed in his security clearance hearing i had a bit of a hard time keeping memory of names faces and motives as the movie went on,2023-08-05 17:01:40
just saw the movie and had one thing jumped out at me and made my eye twitch so during the scene when they are prepping the test bomb and putting the core in it i find it hard to believe that with all the scientist and engineers involved that they would use  two crescent wrenches vs the properly sized wrench for such a critical piece of equipment,2023-08-13 00:14:22
great movie absolutely amazing but the constant screechy violin music in the background of absolutely every scene is really annoying and completely unnecessary,2023-12-23 21:01:33
"i bet chris nolan has never felt a human emotion but probably thinks human emotion is fascinating none of the “people” in oppenheimer made me feel anything all but the titular character and strauss are ridiculously onenote they’re there to spout exposition to move the narrative along tragically exemplified by emily blunt’s kitty who is introduced as a booze hound and you guessed it can’t go one scene without alcohol making a clunky appearance that’s her character that’s it but nolan has never written or directed a great or even kind of good woman character 

but boy does this move edits and scenes are brisk too brisk nothing breaths but at least that lends itself to the absurd time constraints of our nerdavengers coming together to make the worst invention in the history of human existence 

the technical filmmaking itself is pretty astounding as expected it’s gorgeous to look at and the actors that are actually allowed to shine murphy and rdj are exceptional the narrative is inherently compelling and it’s an entertaining watch especially the courtroom drama stuff where things can actually slow down 

but for a movie that can’t decide if its thesis is an insular character study or a legitimate warning of human extinction via nukes  i still didn’t really feel anything either way",2023-07-21 14:59:19
this film was made with the sensibilities and aesthetics of an action movie but it is actually a biography of an american scientist the carving up of what was a linear life into a confusing collage of rapid cuts back and forth over decades of time made it borderline incoherent and i saw it having read the book twice nolans fear of being boring made him do all sorts of things that are clever and being clever is the last thing needed in a film with a subject this serious i went in hoping for the best but my worst fears were realized the real oppenheimers message was that democracy deserves to have important decisions such as building huge stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction be made by the people he lobbied for more candor from goverment and less secrecy and was destroyed for that watching this movie youd think it was all a grudge match between oppie and rdj it went much deeper than that the film also downplayed oppenheimers disgust with using the weapon on an enemy that was already defeated its just a movie but its a shame that the important things about oppenheimer were buried under a confusing mess of a film,2023-07-21 16:56:55
"this was a very ambitious movie with several problems plaguing it that i found too hard to ignore will try to keep it spoilerfree first the positives

1 artistry the movie takes very unique creative liberties in showing oppenheimers internal psychological state manifested as external changes to his environment which i found was very fresh and bold for a nolan project the snappy editing nervewracking audio crescendos and quick cuts to particles strings explosions using raindrops on pavement to symbolize the chain reaction of nuclear fission  were all delicious 



2 soundtrack haunting and imposing the soundtrack dominates this film which is a good thing and a bad thing as ill explain in a bit 



issues i had 



1 structure and pacing this movie is miserable to sit through on first watch because you cant infer any sense of structure the film has a nonlinear narrative which is fine when done well but here it seemed almost deliberately sabotaged to feel overwhelming tedious and impossible to track i couldnt tell what scenes were building to couldnt tell if we were approaching inside or leaving a crescendo moment or low point couldnt tell if any given scene was intended to be any given way it just flows without identity from one scene to the next to the point where i could no longer follow it if i tried there is no discernible structure to the screenplay the movie refused to invest itself in any given scene opting instead to use every scene as a buildup for the next scene  the result being youre trapped in a constant rising tension without any actual payoff at any point with one or two exceptions the best analogy for it would be that i felt like i was a passenger in a plane that couldnt land and was constantly edging closer to water trying to find a runway that doesnt exist 



2 musical interference nolans movies are infamous for the dialogue being hard to hear and this movie is no exception i was straining to hear what people were saying for most of it and anyone who has trouble with differing accents of english will have even more trouble but thats not the only way music interferes the ost carries across scenes without stopping and the music is deliberately emotionally ambiguous the result is that the music doesnt help invoke any particular emotion nor does it help to bookmark and categorize the movies narrative it makes the structure problem even worse because the same track will blow over from one scene setting and timeline to the next like its one giant 3hour montage instead of an actual sequence of scenes with cohesive structure 



3 dialogue this is my biggest issue with nolan movies and i was disappointed to see that he hasnt learned yet all of nolans characters are the same character they all talk the same way they all use the same cadence the same verbosity the same choice of vernacular the same conversational pace no matter whats going on or who they are its ridiculously distracting once you notice it and it never goes away the dialogue is the weakest part of this movie which doesnt help because the movie is almost nonstop conversations arguments discussions and one very bizarre  scene 



4 scope this film is too ambitious it tried to do too much and felt cramped disjointed and bloated it tries to be a movie about a young scientist coming to fame for his brilliance it tries to be a love triangle it tries to be a story about the atom bomb and the effects of it on oppenheimer postwar it tries to be a political smear campaign drama its 3 different movies stuffed into one 



all of these problems make the film almost impossible to sit through despite the sparks of creativity that sometimes show overall 410 would not watch again",2023-07-21 18:58:10
i uhhh no words just hm,2023-07-21 02:20:12
masterpiece,2023-07-21 02:43:52
" yes  nolan is back with a vengeance  

just got home from a imax screening  what an amazing cinema experience that was",2023-07-21 02:54:37
nolan got a good performance out of everyone in this i was  stunned,2023-07-21 03:35:31
this was a movie truly worth seeing in theaters one of nolan’s best films imo and that’s saying a lot murphy should be up for best actor consideration,2023-07-21 03:52:01
"there’s one scene that i found jarring and interesting to think about when oppy brought his son to be taken care of by his friend his friend with a ton of grace “the fact you say you’re terrible for doing this means you’re not terrible” and in so many words you have the world on your shoulders at the moment and i understand your need for help along with his wife’s

i thought that was powerful and really humanized the characters for me",2023-07-21 04:06:12
the sound design was breathtaking it better win for that and i’m so happy cillian finally got his leading nolan role he truly is one of the best actors of this generation,2023-07-21 04:29:25
"thought it was really good  little long for a 9pm showing with work in the morning lol

i thought having murphy and pugh have  in front of the council with blunt watching was an inspired choice to say the least

also where was the oppenheimer  i was promised",2023-07-21 04:31:02
"the explosion scene and the entire sequence leading up to it the writing acting visuals score and sounds was straight up some of the best cinema ive ever seen moments before it exploded i noticed id lost all feeling in my hands then it exploded and it was silent and horrifyingly beautiful then he looked up at the giant fireball and said those words then the shockwave came pure perfection

and the ending scene with einstein was probably one of nolans strongest endings which is saying something",2023-07-21 04:33:17
just got out from watching the movie here are my thoughts i have not been in a movie theater in almost 10 years and this was well worth it beginning is a little fast pace and sporadic but once the movie gets about a hour in the rest of the movie is amazing the ending was very powerful and i love how they show the political corruption in washington in the third act acting was great all around i did feel that there was some parts of the movie that didn’t add to the main story and could be easily taken out allinall this is a must watch i’ll give it a 810,2023-07-21 04:33:30
that  scene with murphy and pugh on the chair i did not expect that in a nolan movie,2023-07-21 04:34:25
benny safdie as teller was phenomenal an incredible foil that elevated the whole movie,2023-07-21 05:01:23
the denotation scene was one of the best scenes i’ve ever watched the intense build up stunning visuals and startling sound were perfect nolan outdid himself,2023-07-21 05:16:56
i absolutely loved everything about this movie the only thing i dont understand is why they used the german language during the lecture part in leiden and then state that theyre speaking dutch seems sloppy for such a high profile film and someone like nolan,2023-07-21 05:22:26
cillian is getting his best actor hardware i’d put my life savings on it,2023-07-21 05:27:22
that might’ve been the fastest three hours i’ve ever experienced in a movie theatre which is an incredible feat for how dialogueheavy it is unbelievable performances all around from both the principal cast and the minor supporting characters i think i’m going to have to see it at least one more time to fully absorb it,2023-07-21 05:28:50
amazing pacing for a 3 hour movie  never felt bored,2023-07-21 07:04:18
not to be mean or anything but when i was watching this movie there was one time where the audience laughed in the theater and it was when the general or whoever said theyll spare kyoto because they had their honeymoon there  it was very jarring,2023-07-21 07:12:36
i am so glad i watched this in imax excited to watch it in 70mm next week another masterpiece from nolan such a powerful film that really makes you think and feel,2023-07-21 07:13:58
"holy  that final scene was absolutely haunting 

side note though the jfk mention felt like the  reveal in the kingsman prequel ",2023-07-21 07:25:53

"i’ve honestly never felt like i needed to revisit it unlike most of nolan’s other work 

i didn’t have that experience at all with oppy saw it on 35mm starting at 930pm in a completely sold out theater and while there is a few dips and drags here and there when the credits rolled it didn’t feel like i’d been in a theater for 35 hours idk",2023-07-21 14:27:35

hey i just have a question for those who have seen oppenheimer especially in imax how loud is the movie should i bring concert ear plugs,2023-07-21 23:43:54
so after the bomb scene and you hear the now i am become death quote was that the real voice of oppenheimer as a clip or cillian,2023-07-22 01:10:42

good the sound effects in dolby you felt it at least i did visuals acting audio all great",2023-07-22 04:14:54
between this and beau is afraid 2023 is becoming the year of 3 hour anxiety fests,2023-07-22 05:49:03
i had a huge grey border around the image due to nolans specific aspect ratio in my cinema as with tenet that i found infuriating shrinks the image by about 20 and was really immersion breaking,2023-07-22 07:13:14
this feels like a culmination of everything nolan has worked on thus far,2023-07-22 08:44:00
did krumholtz character age at all through the movie i swear he looks the same on the train scene early on1920s as he does during the ending scenes lol,2023-07-22 09:21:02
"i have a technical question throughout the marketinginterviews cycle people keep repeating that this was the first time nolan was able to shoot entirely in imax

but at our screening the aspect ratio changed throughout… suggesting it was a mix of full hight imax and ‘regular’ 70mm…

have i got that wrong and if so wasn’t dunkirk already a mix of 70mm and imax",2023-07-22 09:27:01
how does it compare to oppenheimer 1980 from the bbc im watching that series now and really enjoying it,2023-07-22 16:46:59
will we have a director’s cut version with even more footage,2023-07-22 17:10:56
"im still gathering my thoughts on the film and overall liked it but i really dont think the third act was needed with lewis strauss the way it was told for me it took away from oppenheimers inner anxieties and conflicting struggles on what he was building everyday family issues and just the increasingly uncertain world due to the war 
i also felt like the looming thread of the germans developing a bomb first wasnt as heavy on the charecters as it should have been by the time the urgency to test the bomb had come up  was dead

i definitely walked away feeling a huge weight on my chest from this film science and the understanding of it is such a gift that humanity has and this is arguably the biggest example of science used for so much destruction that it creates a forceful and fearful sense of peace",2023-07-22 17:55:04
its da bomb ,2023-07-22 23:50:53
 question can someone tell me how they explained what they were doing with the marbles into the 2 glasses throughout i totally missed what they said so i never got what that was about ,2023-07-23 00:09:56
"i felt like oppenheimers personal flaw was not thinking of the consequences of his actions  he has an affair with kitty which causes a chain reaction of her getting pregnant having to divorce and remarry then be stuck with a child shes not prepared for with basically an absentee father

then with the bomb its more about if his theories will work than anything else",2023-07-23 02:40:31
einstein parts were very well done and my favorite  some serious pitch quiet to jump scare loud moments i wasnt expecting gary oldman as truman was a nice touch,2023-07-23 02:54:10
where does this rank in the all time casts so many actors in or close to their peaks showing up in minor roles,2023-07-23 03:02:07
"cillian will get best actor and downey jr best supporting at the oscars

surely theres no chance for anyone else

edit just want to mean other movies not other actors in the film matt damon was awesome and hartnet was great in every scene",2023-07-23 04:01:04
loved it such a deep movie but in a really ineffable way i think murphy did a great job portraying the sorrow and regret that oppenheimer felt at the end of his life,2023-07-23 04:41:57
"a question i have asked in other replies but hopefully someone can shed light

was oppenheimer vital to the timeline of getting the bombs out there  the film deals with a lot of his guilt and if he does for a change think about the consequences of his actions which he doesnt in the development of the bomb and with the affairs and pulls out of the project does someone else just come in and it all goes ahead but with a different name as the father of nuclear war",2023-07-23 05:09:26
"hey i was wondering if some people who saw the 1570 imax film version can comment on whether they got a techncial  from it 

i like seeking out things like 120 or 48 fps showings just to see how they look 

but i have read some comments so far that derided it as hubris  unnecessary for this film",2023-07-23 06:56:46
the truman reveal was a welcome surprise nolan kinda portrayed him in a negative light though while also acknowledging that he did feel responsible for the bombs use definitely didnt expect it,2023-07-23 07:24:19
not sure if it was me needing the biggest  ever but the final act did seem to drag on a bit longer than it should have incredible film though,2023-07-23 13:29:11
did they fuse the real voices together at the end if so super cool move by nolan,2023-07-23 16:03:08
i think the wildest part to happen during the screening of this movie was that initially they gave us an interval of 510 minutes and then after they resumed playing the movie for another 5 minutes they paused it again and everyone started getting audibly confused and then it started back up after the anti tobacco ad common in india,2023-07-23 19:53:06

"always love nolan’s style as usual man just has such a way of driving home points and scenes memorable 

also this movie really did reach my need of wanting to see a great display of insanitycognitive dissonance really well kinda cringe comparisons but like aot or arcane just really well visual documenting the grey scale and the consequences with being within it",2023-07-23 22:41:02

does anyone have a list or a link to real v reel personalities in the movie would love to understand the movie more,2023-07-24 05:58:21
"call me crazy butat the end when oppenheimer finally reveals what was discussed he brings the equation up that edward teller discovered that could result in catastrophic results from the bomb being useddid that initial conversation not happen right when oppenheimer arrived in the beginning of the moviebut then somewhere in the halfway point its clearly brought to oppenheimers attention by edward teller during his lecture which he then states he will go speak to einstein about the possibly deadly discovery

my question is

how did he bring up the equation with einstein in the beginning of the movie during their secret conversation if the equation wasnt discovered till later on by teller where he brought it up for the first time in the woods

i might be confused on something and if so please explain because i thought one of the big shockers at the end was that oppenheimer knew all along about this equation said nothing then acted surprised when teller found out about it in class and that sounds silly

also as a side note at 12824 a black gloved hand is rather covertly seen coming out of the shot from the back of jean tatlocks head as if she was drownedi discovered theres a bit of controversy behind whetherornot it was indeed suicide and want to note oppenheimers quick and ready attempt at his professors life with the cyanide

i dont think its too farfetched to believe he had something to do with her death and the reports that she didnt take enough to technically be lethal",2023-07-24 06:12:02

question for the ones reading this what unsettling questions came to mind for you after watching the movie ending,2023-07-24 06:37:50
the cinematography is out of this world nolan really delivered no complaints as history has already been written from what ive read movie is pretty  accurate 910 rating is absolutely deserved,2023-07-24 12:58:30
"is the regular screen nonimax aspect ratio supposed to be windowboxlike cropping when projected to me it looks like a floating rectangle with dead area on all four sides is this normal for a regular screen showing of oppenheimer 

or was the theater supposed to zoom in and fill in the the screen top to bottom and then there would be letterboxing on the left and right

letterboxing on all four sides on a rectangular screen is strange",2023-07-26 02:39:50
so i’m rushing around like a maniac this morning hoping to finally catch oppenheimer in 70 mm it looks like it’s going to come down to how long the trailers are whether i get to see it or not are they the normal 20 minutes or is it different for this movieformat i would be seeing it at a regal in case that matters any insight would help thanks,2023-07-26 12:58:13
what does it mean when einstein said ‘when they punished you enough they will serve you potato and…’,2023-07-27 20:35:58
"who is the actor in the rdj scenes not alden
but the secondary actor who has a few lines can’t find them on the imdb cast list",2023-07-30 17:59:46
did they do the i am become death the destroyer of worlds speech in the movie,2023-08-03 06:02:00
does anyone have an opinion on the more troubling scenes involving oppenheimers visionshallucinations were they meant to be more symbolic of his inner turmoil or literal in the mindbreaking panic sense if it was the latter im not sure i can believe a person can hold themselves together as well as was portrayed,2023-08-06 04:13:34
"could anyone have predicted that the first occurrence of the i am become death destroyer of worlds line would be right as he slides his oppenhammer into a hot commie whose knockers are on full display

i dont know what i expected entering in to this movie after all the barbenheimer hype but it certainly was not that right up there for me with discovering how perfectly they nailed what kens favourite song would be",2023-07-21 09:52:28
honestly it was good but not extraordinary it definitely was a little long and idk i wish we got to see more of the scientists interacting and stuff although i dont know  about quantum mechanics or bombs their interactions were really exciting to me also i though oppenheimer would be doing science stuff and be more involved but he was just moving around and not doing science stuff like where he would get a eureka moment or something xd lots of missing context imo,2023-07-21 15:13:06
good movie terrible pacing,2023-07-22 22:52:04
"that was an incredible film

in terms of whose film it is and who it’s about and the subjects it touches on i would compare this movie to hayao miyazaki’s the wind rises both are biopics that serve as allegories for their creators’ career",2023-07-22 23:58:41
"movie was good cast was great thought nolan did a good job pacing out the movie considering how much he was trying to pack in

almost felt like 3 hours wasn’t enough and nolan just hopes no one left for a  break because every scene seems essential for the overall story 

i do feel like i would’ve preferred this as a short series on hbo

the bomb itself was kind of just what you expect a bomb to look like don’t think you need to see it on any special screen explosive fire in slow motion will look like explosive fire in slow motion on any screen 

some scenes played with sound and that was very cool but again no sounds out of the ordinary that makes you go “only surround sound can achieve that” 


great movie i would recommend to friends who haven’t seen it",2023-07-28 14:21:44
"the opening halfhour felt like they were trying to cram the backstory to get to the manhattan project then everything during los alamos had a good pace then after the bomb went off it was sprinting again 



the explosion was great sound wise not so much visually the explosion was beautiful and i think they could have benefited from letting its beauty speak rather than the quick cuts to the public then the boom then oppy then the boom 




nolan really indulged on sound loudness with this one i mean his soundtracks are  great but  brotake a chill pill my ears need a break",2023-07-30 23:39:43
"i found oppenheimer to be too unlikeable so it took me a bit to realise im meant to be rooting for oppenheimer rather than against him with the whole strauss thing

there should have been more focus on oppenheimer seeking redemption soul searching and perhaps introduce the destroyer of worlds passage here rather than in a  scene a more visible change in him although they did a good job during the speech showing his internal turmoil also if they made strauss appear more of a slimy petty character sooner rather than trying to have it as a reveal when its already obvious its strauss pulling the strings id have gotten on oppies side more readily like it felt i was supposed to",2023-08-06 09:39:14
"cinematography and acting were great 

however the movie itself is structurally all over the place the pacing was jarring the fast editing felt out of place i felt like i was watching a continuous montage none of the scenes felt like they had a chance to breathe the constant build up of urgency and tension never seems to pay off and resolve in a convincing or satisfying way the jumping between different points in time did nothing to enhance the movie and only made it more confusing too many characters to keep track of  

the last act of oppenheimers security hearing was arduous to get through the dialogue got bogged down in legalese there was also a ton of adam mckay style exposition particularly in the scenes with strauss   

there were a few interesting moments and themes but overall i found it to be a disappointing film",2023-07-23 05:28:01
"that script was not good for me if you had no clue about any of oppenheimers story i could see it being hard to follow the score and acting was great but out of the 3 hours there were only about 3 memorable scenes for me suspense build up for trinity test gymnasium speech einstein talk at the end

oppenheimers conflict with strauss felt so forced felt like nolan went oh no we need a real antagonist to wrap this up disappointed in the movie overall",2023-07-21 11:07:12
at last i can scream it at the top of my lungs  oppenheimer is mediocre,2023-07-21 10:53:04
"this movie is about communists physicists and the american government if you want to watch a movie about an atomic bomb look elsewhere 

the testing of the bomb had a great anticipatory lead up but a disappointing climax a bit of cgi and better situational references would’ve made the explosion 10 times more intense it was pretty obvious nolan decided to blow up a couple tons of tnt and use a forced perspective to make us think it was an atom bomb 

the fact they did not choose to show the bombs being dropped on nagasaki or hiroshima or the fallout missed the mark for me a few scenes of the horrible reality of what a nuclear weapon is capable of doing to civilization would’ve lent way more gravitas to the entire film 

if you want to watch a film about the nuanced shades of moral grey that robert oppenheimer operated in then buckle up",2023-08-01 15:45:22
"i cannot believe the amount of whiny bastards on reddit complaining about this movie “music was too loud in parts” “the jfk line was ” “the explosion wasn’t big enough” all people do now is nitpick the  out of movies when there’s not any major problems they’ll find some go work for screen junkies 

this was easily the best film of the young decade and maybe the best i’ve seen since the social network back in 2010 it’s certainly up there 

never did i think i’d watch a 3 hour intimate character study and court room procedural drama made for 100 million in a theater in the middle of july and i’m so glad i did many of nolan’s films are great but get overhyped this one deserves every word of praise imaginable",2023-08-03 04:04:50
"oppenheimer is a movie about “smart” people made for a  audience this movie was a three hour cringesnooze fest that wasn’t worth the price of admission and did not deliver the overhyped promises that have been promoted for months i expect it’s going to make a box office splash this weekend and fizzle out

1 everything about the true story was oversimplified and yet the film manages to over complicate the delivery if you go in not knowing anything about what happened at los alamos you might come away feeling like you “get it” but if you go in with any information at all you’ll be struck by how hollow the storyline is and how much truly fascinating stuff they left out

2 this movie should have been a miniseries and not a three hour flick the most interesting stories didn’t end up on the screen for instance did anyone catch the whole thing about the volume of babies being born at los alamos there is nothing about the very weird social life at lanl for instance 

each scientist gets a two minute cameo but they don’t do anything on screen thats not totally true i guess teller sweats a lot the science also somehow seems unimportant in this movie people wooed when einstein came on screen initially but he wasn’t really featured nor were his ideas none of them or their ideas were none of them seemed to matter and felt like marvel movie superheroes there was a chance for nolan to show the physics through film that could have been amazing but instead we just get never ending poorly written dialogue that goes nowhere

3 oppenheimer’s character is made to seem like a linguistic pedant i read das kapital in german but there is no commentary about the fact that he technically misquoted the bhagwat geeta and didn’t actually capture the hindu meaning that  scene where the book is brought out is horribly disrespectful and unnecessary i was expecting his studies of hindu religion and philosophy to be explored— maybe he’d have a vision of vishnu or siva maybe hindu tests would actually be important nah let’s just show 

4 the dialogue was a cringe fest it was really bad 

5 the explosion was a let down

overall that was a waste of time and money it’s fine j guess but i don’t think it’s a very good movie and it did not live up to its hype",2023-07-21 15:18:16
best movie of the year for me best actor oscar for cillian,2023-07-21 10:37:44
the film feels very similar to lincoln it’s a long dialogue heavy movie that makes sure to focus on the person rather than the war going on at the time,2023-07-21 13:53:35
"overall i enjoyed it great pacing brilliantly edited world class actors all around 

however i wish they had shown the devastation of the bombs in japan more i’ve been to the peace museum in hiroshima and it was truly horrifying",2023-07-21 14:08:36
am i the only one who felt like that scene with emily blunt was fantastic she did such a good job i wish they gave her more of a role,2023-07-21 17:44:30
"i think the explosion itself ruined the movie for me it was build up with this powerful theme of being the most scary thing humans had ever done yet the explosion just looked like a big gas station blowing up i also hoped we would have seen fear in peoples eyes as they saw what a nuclear explosion looks like and the scale of it compared to regular explosions its vastly different in many ways and i think it should have been made with cgi or maybe a combination to really emphasize the impact it had i also wish we had seen it from a birds perspective to give a sense of scale

i mean they even had a scene where he shows the biggest chemical explosion ever the ship and then explains how a nuclear bomb is way more powerful than that yet they use a chemical explosion in the movie as a nuke that was a let down for me tbh  
i wasnt a big fan of the multiple timelines with constant dramatic music back and forth there was no rythm to the movie and it all seemed unsorted and random thats probably why i didnt really like dunkirk either

i also think that the movie is too fast paced it never really slows down except a couple of times so its just one long bombardment of information and names to remember combined with the jumping in time

but other than that i think it was a crazy beautiful movie both visually and audibly would i see it again yes but at home where i can take my time watching it",2023-07-22 00:26:33
"a frankenstein story that calls attention to the door opened by our entry into the atomic age the time where the miniscus between reality and impossibility collapsed and humanity looked in the mirror and saw a death more complete than anything before this was an american story that highlights both the american courage to press on where no one has before and the american arrogance to push too far and never look back and we truly never did the tools that could end everything weve ever built all of our little toys and scribblings sits littering the surface the totality of death held by the few

i dont think enough has been said by any
voice loud enough for the resounding guilt our culture should feel not just for the people of nagasaki and hiroshima but the rest of the world the nuclear age has ended any real sovereignty to this day we sit in a mexican standoff such that protects not only our seemingly enlightened exceptionalism but our increasing unhinged despotism if there were no nukes would ukraine be in its current position

oppenheimer was a patsy for the world that we all made

this film should be seen as an indictment against anyone who speaks just quietly enough that you hear something being said but not quite what until too late it was the centrism and inertia of the postsurrender alamo scientists that brought us here but as they have said on both sides they were simply following orders doing what wouldve been done without them

nolan has pierced the surface past what can be seen as tangible reality and entered the loose coagulation of sense and memory that is the human experience this film was not perfect but it marks new territory for the medium as dunkirk and tenet both did vollying a barrage of grandiose imagery carefully balanced color memorious editing and all encompassing sound its something that you just see if you are invested in popular cinema",2023-07-22 02:48:42
robert downey jr deserves an oscar  the way i hated this person was beyond belief  amazing acting ,2023-07-22 03:12:11
worth seeing in imax just for cillian murphy’s dreamy blue eyes,2023-07-22 04:28:48
"yeah i just watched cillian murphy win his oscar brilliant nolan did it again 

i thought the comparisons to the social network were kind of off  choppy quick dialogue with court hearing drama sure but otherwise totally different  and i was actually pleasantly surprised by the clear political message of how mccarthyism was the mechanism through which the main scientist behind the atomic bomb was denied a hand in shaping nuclear safetyregulationpolicy postww2 its obviously antisurveillance as well 

i have to admit i wasnt as impressed by downey as early reviews were  im sure  get an oscar nom but i havent seen barbie and dont know if its a lock  but i thought emily blunt was fantastic and stole every scene she was in particularly towards the end

but what a score what great pacing better sound mixing than nolan usually has the visuals acting story everything i thought id be prepared for anything but that scene when oppenheimer gives to the speech to the people on the bleachers really was haunting and he always nails his endings",2023-07-22 11:50:13
"honest question here… is this one of the best casts assembled ever for a nonsuperhero movie i genuinely can’t think of another one with this much star talent 

what an incredible movie was completely immersed from start to finish the score was an absolute masterpiece",2023-07-23 06:35:25
i feel like the whole last hour could have been shortened into 15 minutes otherwise decent movie,2023-07-23 13:50:20
"alright 11k comments in this thread and i’m not gonna lie i read a lot of them before seeing it and a lot have said it’s not that great or it’s boring so going into it i had to lower my expectations because of what i read here 

sure there’s glaring issues with some of the editing and pacing of it and the last hour with the hearings is slow as  but honestly i actually enjoyed the  out of it the point leading up to the trinity test and the part just after it with his speech was pretty crazy especially him hallucinating the effects of the atomic bomb 

i’d give it a 710 not the masterpiece lots of people here claim but it’s also not awful or boring as many others claim the last hour or so may be boring but the intro and bomb test parts make up for it imo if only barely 

i think this is a reasonable take and don’t tend to agree with people who go all 1010 masterpiece for everything or people who just  on everything and call it  and insult those who actually enjoyed it this was a good movie not 1010 good not even close but it’s a good movie nonetheless that’s about it",2023-07-24 02:56:04
"the trinity sequence was beautiful i am become death destroyer of worlds hit so hard there are no words to describe the sensation that moment truly one of the best scenes this year probably ever

the rest of the movie was fine i loved how they were telling the story through various time periods and somehow making it work aside from that it was good maybe not the best but it was more than fine hard to follow sometimes but good enough",2023-07-24 04:36:16
i thought it played out more or less how i thought it would 3hour long biography centered around a trial so to speak ala the social network it was a good film but as others are saying i expected more out of the explosion i also dislike the exposition nolan just puts in his films out of nowhere laughable moments for me but enjoyable film,2023-07-25 04:55:54
"75 out of 10 im a bit less harsh on the film than many sound mixing was uneven bomb scene was good i think the pacing and plot issues were an attempt to maintain the film as a popcorn flick and for that i admire it even if i think it wasnt completely successful

the third act for me was an issue i might get flamed for this but i think much of his trial scene could have been contracted into a montage that ended with kittys testimony in regular time same with much of rdjs hearing with the exception of rami maleks monologue much of the third act could have been shown to us rather than painstakingly expositioned lets be honest the bomb was the big scene and i think we needed to get through the truman scene the malek scene the kitty scene and the einstein scene and thats it 

everything else could have been montage stylesped up",2023-07-25 14:55:57
"i honestly enjoyed the movie and would still rate it a 8 or 8510 but it could’ve easily been one of if not the greatest character study in film had it focused solely on oppenheimer’s optimistic creation of the bomb and the harrowing aftermath of it’s completion like the scene where he had a panic attack was perfect because it capitalized how distraught he was with his actions at that moment

the recognition the time magazine him being labeled “the father of the atomic bomb” from an external standpoint he’s famous and widely known almost like a  but from an internal standpoint he has so much guilt over what he’s done as the creator it’s quite the juxtaposition i honestly don’t care about him being accused as a communist and getting his security clearance revoked the sole focus should’ve been on his internal conflict struggling with the fact that he caused the death and destruction of hundreds of thousands",2023-07-25 16:43:26
i dont get all the talkmarketing pushing this is a movie you must watch in imax there were like 2 or 3 scenes that i think would benefit from a huge screen like that,2023-07-26 00:28:52
"brilliant film

not his magnum opus not interstellarinception heights but  close

needs subtitles though i was the only one to laugh at some of the jokes because i was probably one of the few to actually hear it",2023-07-26 10:33:23
i’ll get downvoted for this but oppenheimer was way too long and i lost interest after they dropped the bomb,2023-07-22 09:54:11
movie was excellent up to the news of the bombing in japan then i really felt the runtime it could have been shorter also even with the length the entire movie felt one continuous montage because of how quickly scenes cut from one to the other and the intense music never seemed to stop which was almost jarring i actually had trouble following what was happening at points everyones acting was top notch the sound design and score was amazing the visual depiction of the atoms colliding in oppenhiemers brain was very unique and engaging plenty good about this movie but certainly not nolans best,2023-07-21 12:44:06
its kinda poetic how strauss and oppenheimer disagreed on how to handle russia vs usa nuclear threat and strauss wanted the mutually assured destruction option it’s kinda poeticironic considering him destroying oppenheimer also ended up destroying his own legacy,2023-07-21 17:32:53
i think it could easily be nolans best work imo the tension was done amazingly well towards the end and i loved the way the non linear storytelling was done and the way they were overlapping with each other and recontextualising events that were shown multiple times the scene where oppenheimer was giving that speech to the crowd after the bomb was dropped and was imagining them being killed in the blast was haunting as  especially as ive been to the peace museum in hiroshima and having that added context and weight behind oppenheimers guilt made it hit even harder and that final conversation with einstein is probably one of the most awesome endings ive ever seen to a film it has not left my mind since i finished watching it i even watched barbie after and while it was a fun distraction my mind went straight back to oppenheimer after it was over 1010,2023-07-21 22:27:59
"i loved it cillian murphy absolutely killed it 

i wasnt expecting a huge people drama part to it but i think that added to the film for me because at the end of the day policies and the people who make them get there by squabbling and infighting and turning on each other it really made the point that the people who make decisions about nuclear weapons or how they get used arent always people who are rising through the government to be selfless its people who hold grudges backstab and are petty the best person for a position doesnt always get the job or loses it because of a personal vendetta 

science would dictate all those types of decisions are made on a purely facts based level but they arent the human element complicates things once the do or die aspect of a pending war was removed and urgency faded choices about who lead what and who did what became humanized 

its not meant to just be a biography or a story about the atom bomb its about how we approach nuclear weapons how we make decisions about them and how the people who ultimately make those choices get to the position of making those choices really shines a light on the difference between those who make a bomb possible and those who choose to use it

also this is small and nitpicking but i really liked the little animations they did for his school days thought they added to showing how his mind worked and wished they had brought them back more during the 2nd act and leading up to the trinity test

the music was fantastic too its so immersive and full of feelings i absolutely can hear a theme and thought the composer göransson did a good job hes also worked on the mandalorian and really gave the film a theme

the silence after detonation while the spectators wait for the sound waveshock wave to hit was excellent those tense seconds that lead into the what have we done and  it worked to getting the full force of the blast its one thing to see a blast its another to feel it",2023-07-22 03:03:10
"seeing a lot of people complaining about the women being underdeveloped do people really not know how women were treated in the 50s or do they just like to talk out of their 

not only that but jean and kitty’s characters were performed spot on by florence and emily you completely felt the guilt and depression consuming jean emily blunt also nailed kitty’s character to a tee a brilliant biologist who’s succumbed to be a housewife while also being a pretty  person in general but extremely loyal hate when people say they’re underdeveloped when they’re just women in patriarchal times",2023-07-22 03:36:45
"decent movie definitely felt like its been played up a bit and will fall down the pecking order of nolan films once some time has passed but its definitely an experience 

also i found rdjs performance to be a bit overrated since i was expecting a lot based on what id read before going in and felt like him being behind bodens access to the file was super obvious i found florence pughs performance to be a bit underrated i havent seen a lot of her movies but was quite impressed with her",2023-07-22 16:11:12
a great movie but it felt mentally exhausting to have 3 hours of almostunbroken nolanstyle filmmaking tense music lots of tiny scenes in rapid fire iirc the only real breaks in the tension were the detonation incredible scene and the final conversation with edison its a style that works in some situations but on this movie it was too much,2023-07-22 18:06:40
"of all the ways in which my religion was represented in imax i did not expect to see florence pugh topless and forcing cillian murphy to read scripture during insertion to be one of them quite the emotionally confusing scene to put it lightly

i wonder what my mother a religious scholar would think of that scene",2023-07-23 19:09:57
"i personally loved that nolan portrayed harry s truman as the weak conniving and insecure piece of  that he was 

henry wallace would have never dropped those bombs",2023-07-23 20:52:43
it has been a few days since i saw the film but i was slightly disappointed with it i was bored nay unfocused throughout its runtime like it kept jumping back and forth very unnecessarily the first  scene was completely unnecessary and borderline blasphemous and the whole strauss thing the blackandwhite stuff was completely unnecessary considering the fact that we are there for oppenheimer and not oppenheimerstrauss dont get me wrong rdj was brilliant but it was written pretty poorly it reminded me of the pixar movie villains like strauss opposition to oppenheimer seemed so bloody trivial from what the movie showed perhaps these could be relegated to the background and focus more on oppenheimer like it bloody should id probably read the novel the film is based on for better understanding of what happened perhaps that might clear up some of my criticisms for now this is one of nolans weaker films for me perhaps lower than dark knight rises and dunkirk i didnt really like that one,2023-07-24 16:32:19
was anyone else completely lost throughout the whole movie i was i just couldnt enjoy the movie because i had no idea what was going on maybe its just me but the constant back and forth between his interrogation and his life confused me come to think of it i had no idea what his trial was even about i also dont know what lewis strauss was doing the movie seemed to be saying that his character and what he did was important but it just went completely over my head until someone comes and changes my mind 310,2023-07-24 17:34:02
"anyone else think that rami’s character giving the testimony at the end was anti climactic should have been one of the most dramatic moments of the film but it’s impact was lost because the viewers have no connection with that character

i’m glad nolan didn’t waste rami but we should have had some build up to what essentially functioned as a plot twist",2023-07-24 18:00:20
"i thought the film looked and sounded great acting is on point but the screenplayughthe movie covers most of oppenheimers life but its mostly ankle deep  all the base stuff is covered where he studied where he worked his relationships  the most solid part of all i think but we almost never get to see what he really thinks or feelshes pretty passionate about socialist cause i guess but then he gets opportunity to head manhattan project and that stuff is forgotten why does he decide to join anyway is it ambition scientific interest patriotism we dont have any inner dialogue and all we hear from the man himself are a few noncommittal phrases like well we must have it before the nazis how did his attitude change through the project we see people with pretty clear stances but only see oppenheimer playing politics and floating between camps hes pretty horrified after the bombing ok but not much else is clearly shown and its not a complex character displayed  its more like guessing politicians character from his speeches

i dont get what the film is really about we dont get to see much the inner world of titular character  science and engineering marvel and brilliant people around manhattan project are largely grazed over ethics is left at bomb bad but what can you do but theres a looooot of hearings in  a 3 hour movie it feels there is not enough time to dive deeply into anything but we get 40 minute subplot of whether strauss can get the post he really wants is it really necessary the emotional climax of the movie is scheming politician getting some karmic justice in the form of getting a slap on the hand

its not a bad movie there are many cool shots  oppenheimer with the bomb a lot of jean scenes trinity test but the emotional core feels kinda hollow we dont really get to know the man who the film is about and so much of important themes are just grazed without any deep exploration  feels like nolan tried to fit way to much into one movie and didnt manage to really fit anything substantial",2023-07-26 20:55:43
"great movie but holy  the constant music was  infuriating we dont need suspense music going on the entire time

edit christopher nolans 12 angry men",2023-07-27 19:28:34
seems like a lot of the negative reviewers in here were expecting a boomboom exciting war movie and not a biopic about a scientist,2023-07-22 00:43:08
"i hope the editor got a sack of money for this one i don’t think we had one long cut in this movie

the technical aspects of the movie were great but i think nolan needs someone to focus him in this went a little overboard on strauss  its going to get some oscar nominations

i buy many physical copies of nolan movies but this is one i think i’ll skip i don’t see myself wanting to see it again i am glad i saw it in theaters it’s one of the better movies i’ve seen this summer…but if i had to see oppy or mi7 again i’m seeing mi7",2023-07-22 04:18:37
"i really wanted to love this movie but it just had too many issues the run time maybe the biggest one i cant think of any movie thats earned a 3 hour runtime except fiddler on the roof at that length turn it into a mini series after chernobyl i think hbo would have done a better job it just gets too boring people took out their phones in my theater people fell asleep etc

second biggest mistake might have been focusing so much on strauss why do we care if strauss gets to be secretary of commerce or not if theyre worried about a world ending arms race and ever more powerful weapons the payoff of the third act felt totally inconsequential with the weird time jumping and also switching to and from black and white why i think we already knew he was another einstein right basically informally influential but totally out of date in terms of the science and just working at universities clearly his reputation was important to him but it seemed like he was going to end up alright no matter what

if it went longer into his life and showed how he died during arguably the height of the nuclear arms race and didnt see how his fears of mad with the soviets never happened it would have been more impactful but it couldnt decide if it wanted to be about trinity or a biopic



and the trinity test itself felt like a letdown after all the theater shaking sound effects and music we get a bright fireball looked cool but i was expecting awesome",2023-07-23 21:00:46

"i think i would have preferred a coen brothers interpretation of oppenheimer nolan takes oppenheimers perspective too seriously a look at a jewish protagonist grappling with the meaning of his ultimately nihilistic and barbaric work a man learning to fit into a role laid out for him act out the life that he fell into gradually learning how to play the part only for the same political machines that made him to engineer his downfall a moral examination of how we are all simultaneously actors in history and prisoners of fate and how we deal with that psychospiritual burden the manhattan project played as a farce laying bare the detachment with which people can calculate and design the annihilation of lives many thousands of miles away with smiles on their faces without ever fully grappling with what theyve done until its too late

 ill shell out for movie tickets again for a coen brothers remake i think itd be good",2023-08-11 18:12:43
"i found oppenheimer to be a breathtaking masterpiece a genuine aweinspiring experience nolan has taken everything he has learned from his previous works and applies it to oppenheimer creating a film that is both an epic and one of the most harrowing character studies i have seen a film that is bombastic and loud yet also intimate and poignant

cillian murphy and robert downey jr give career best performances they are both so unbelievably good i mean really  good the rest of the cast is rounded out by great supporting performancesespecially from emily blunt and matt damon but where murphy and downey jr take their performances is something that demands to be seen on the big screen it is electrifying to watch two of the best actors light up the screen this way murphys performance as oppenheimer is so fully formed and multilayered he showcases all the sides of oppenheimer his determination wit ambition morality and guilt carrying a film like this is a tall task for any actor yet cillian murphy does it flawlessly it is a striking performance

the final hour of the film is unlike anything christopher nolan has done in his career and it is mesmerizing i was so happy with the direction he took the film of course the cinematography by hoyte van hoytema is gorgeous the music by ludwig göransson is transcendent but the real show stopper of this film is not the detonation of a nuclear weaponthough that scene is tremendous its the editing by jennifer lame oppenheimer is an editing master work it is perhaps nolans most dense and layered film and the amount of pieces that jennifer lame juggles seamlessly is aweinspiring and of course as is tradition of a nolan film he directs it all with surgical precision and it all comes together in a way that gives you chills so many moments im going to be thinking about for so long",2023-07-21 06:54:36
"i feel like this was a  near masterpiece i’ll have to watch it again i wish we saw the entire world burn at the end instead of just like a third of it and maybe even explode  all the light in the frame and leaving us in pitch black like the black hole they mention but then again that wouldn’t make sense at all 

but man those last words and that shot of him looking on will stay with me also love the way the walls shook and the lights got brighter mixed with the music you can feel the intensity he was feeling",2023-07-21 09:11:02
i loved the movie from the beginning until a little after the bombed dropped the legal drama portion wasn’t as good as the beginning but was still pretty good,2023-07-21 14:26:00
"i went in sort of blind although the title of the film should have clued me in to the laserfocus nolan gave the man himself  unfortunately i went in expecting nolan’s version of “ man and little boy” a great movie from 1989 actually about the manhattan project

instead i got a much more biographical film that doesn’t reallu give you any handholding the framing story of lewis strauss’s senate confirmation hearing seems am odd choice and i still i don’t know really who he was former admiral head of the atomic energy commission… gonna hit wiki after this or why i should care if he gets confirmed for commerce secretary

zero chance your avg moviegoer is going to recognize bohr heisenberg fermi or any of the scientific giants that had small parts in the film  i was reading the credits before this and discovered the jack quaid played richard  feynman talk about bit parts

75 out of 10",2023-07-21 19:35:04
did anyone else feel the like you were watching there will be blood for a second when early in the movie they were riding horses at dusk in new mexico and the soundtrack was of a discordantly weaving strings section it was so overt it felt like an homage,2023-07-22 03:14:02
i really really  loved this film i don’t have as much depth to give as many in this chat have but  did i love this film,2023-07-22 06:58:10
the pacing score and rdj brought this movie from good to great it felt like a 2 hour movie,2023-07-22 07:08:36
interesting that no one has ever mentioned it but after jfk was assassinated the following year lewis strauss was hugely involved in supporting the presidency campaign for barry goldwater might sound like a conspiracy theory but was nolan implying something when strauss asked the senate names who denied him secretary of commerce cabinet position and john kennedys name was highlighted,2023-07-22 09:02:53
this was probably my favourite theatre experience ever the way nolan can keep the tension throughout this runtime is extraordinary also nolan really knows how to end his movies because he left my entire packed theatre speechless,2023-07-22 09:03:06
nowadays i tend to go into movies with no expectations but since it was a nolan film there were some expectations to be met im not disappointed or dissatisfied just a bit underwhelmed by the movie it was good not great if i had to give a score it would have to be 7510 not his best work imo,2023-07-22 09:14:54
"if cillian murphy doesnt get nominated for an oscar for this we riot im so serious

his acting is amazing like his face says so much without dialogue the auditorium speech scene or interrogation scenes are highlights to me 

i foresee there are gonna be tons of reaction memes coming out for the various reaction shots he has its amazing how he just has the appropriate reaction to everything people say in split seconds",2023-07-22 12:14:21
i think i will go see it again,2023-07-22 17:02:37
"oppenheimer post nut clarity the movie

the nuke test should’ve been called postcoital tristesse instead of trinity",2023-07-22 18:10:28
nolan finally found a good sound guy,2023-07-23 00:42:33
i liked it okay but it needed more feynman maybe then it would have had a bit more heart and soul,2023-07-23 00:43:23
"saw this and barbie today went in totally blind without knowing really anything about the real oppenheimer or anyone else involved i did enjoy it the explosion looked good but im not sure the other 2h 50m or so really needed to be in imax 

my only complaint really is the last 1020 minutes or so oppenheimer gets denied and then strauss gets denied in a similar fashion i liked that parallel 

but it didnt tell me what happened next what is there to do after getting denied i dunno it felt like an odd way to end the movie the conversation with einstein was good but i just felt their stories  could have used a bit more closure",2023-07-23 04:50:24
"great film thats guaranteed 57 oscar nominations nolan always misses on the emotional impact  his films always leave me a bit cold ditto here  he didnt build a case for me to care about any of the characters 

that said excellent work by the lead downey and especially sound mixing",2023-07-23 06:14:49
seeing it soon is the infamous i am become death speech part of the film,2023-07-23 06:45:30
"i thought this was an incredible film
honestly it didnt feel slow or plodding for a moment of me
i feel like some people expect this film to be more about the bomb and its aftermath while this film is more about oppenheimer and how he and the world to some degree are affected by his own creation and how one man brought to the world so much fear and destruction and because of that became one of the most talked about men in modern history

the reason the courtroom scenes for example were so long i know some people had a problem with that is because 
1 at the time it happened it was truly a huge huge deal and should be treated as such it wasnt just a court case that could be summed up in 5 mins it was the talk of the year on one of the most controversial men

2 the film centers around oppenheimer not just the bombing it shows some of the aftermath of the bomb through both oppenheimers trauma and through showing how much the world was nearly hypnotized about his case and everything that happens with him which reflects just how big of an effect the bombing had

to cut that short imo would be wrong as it would undermine these points

overall i truly loved this film altho i can get why its not everyones cup of tea",2023-07-23 12:46:49
nolans biographical movie on oppenheimer was truly outstanding i appreciate his approach in portraying the life of such a remarkable figure personally i hope he continues to explore the stories of unsung heroes like alan turing in future projects as well it would be fascinating to see his unique perspective bring these incredible individuals to life on the big screen,2023-07-24 03:30:55
wow i wasn’t expecting going into what would become my favorite film of the decade thus far,2023-07-24 14:15:51
does anyone have a link to a good video  short documentary that explains the legal situation a little more clearly going to take my gf this week but want her to be able to follow along also will benefit my second watch as well im terrible with names and was getting a little lost towards the end,2023-07-24 16:32:28
when oppenheimer went to show einstein the formula that showed there was a chance of a worldending chain reaction from the detonation einstein was talking to someone in the woods on that trail i swear he said goebbels but that just makes no sense to me is that who he was talking to or did i hear that wrong,2023-07-24 17:45:42
a lot of the score reminded me of there will be blood and i think it cant be coincidence the string picked up as the scene changed to the new mexico desert,2023-07-26 05:00:33
why did kitty refuse to touch teller sorry that’s what i didn’t understand,2023-07-26 06:19:14
"as someone with a degree in physics and a phd in engineering lots of the movie felt very impactful they captured a feeling of internal conflict of curiosity and fear in a way i found resonated very well 

to what degree the scientists and engineers are responsible for the genies they let out of the bottle i think is something many of us considerstruggle with not to mention how that interplay with the desire to pursue a questions through to its solution and its not a problem i ever thought id see depicted in film let alone so well i think cillians performance really sold this part for me as a side note i recommend liu cixins novel ball lightning to anyone interested in a story with those same themes but more scifi

overall very much enjoyed it at the end i was stunned by how captivated i had been by 3 hours of just character dialog  scenes felt well utilized and executed in general except the reading of the book one i felt like they really wanted the become death quote for emotional impact later on but it didnt really work for me but i also think the later  scene which was very effective doesnt work as well without it so 5050 on that one",2023-07-27 13:23:49
"i overall really liked the movie but i did not like the beginning the pacing was too fast at first and i felt like the point was that oppenheimer was such a genius and amazing and above all he  then it seemed to lose this fast pace vibe and stopped trying to sell me on how amazing he was and that he  and all the characters started becoming more interesting and developed

the last two thirds i was way more invested but the first act i really did not like the choices nolan made id still recommend it",2023-07-30 03:41:13
"what was said between einstein and oppy at the end i caught most of it but dont think i got the most important words

also what award did they show him winning i thought he didnt win a nobel maybe it was just a random award",2023-08-02 21:36:28
did strauss get publicly humiliated before he offered oppenheimer to take the position at princeton or was it after…,2023-08-06 05:36:28
"i saw this last night i was confused about the end

x200b

so obviously spoilers ahead

at the end of the movie we see strauss remembering the time oppenheimer poisoned einstein against him 

he is then questioned about the possibility that they werent even talking about him

we then go back to see what they actualy said to each other and oppenheimer says to einstein if he remembers the time he showed him the calculations according to which a nuclear explosion could start a chain reaction that would set fire to the atmosphere and destroy the world

my problem with this is wasnt this moment when we see for the first time oppenheimer talk to einstein in the campus back at the beggining of the movie way before they are even summoned to the manhattan project

x200b

iirc in the commision against him oppenheimer gets questioned about why didnt he studied in certain university in the usa his answer is that he founded that university

then he has a flashback to when he came back from europe and is invited by strauss

he strauss says oppenheimer is the only physicist in usa devoted to quantum physics

also in this university he has the first pupil so he isnt yet renowed as the father of the atomic bomb at least so how could have they at the time remember something that didnt happen yet

x200b

also i didnt understand the significance that one of the senators that voted against strauss was john f kennedy",2023-08-09 14:59:13
i found this to be my favourite of the year so far only complaint is that the noise is too high at points where it need not be so loud,2023-08-23 01:53:21
"ive just watched the film for the first time sadly no imax and dubbed in italian although with a good dubbing the acting was still great despite not being able to appreciate it fully ill rewatch it in english soon

the film is great really spectacular id not say its nolans greatest because the prestige seems to have been his peak and dunkirk memento and the dark knight are just as close but its amazing

the plot was well built the initial hidden dialogue with einstein revealed in the ending it was quite obvious what it was about for everyone who knew their history but still built well the pov structure with the use of bw for strauss scenes was an excellent choice the  scene werent overdone and the one during the interrogation by kittys pov despite being very obviously explicit and called was good

the trinity test scene was amazing despite not being able to rival the real explosion obviously only the seemingly lack of journalists on the spot is a bit of an imprecision

the buildup to the moral dilemma his shift of beliefs and convictions was done quite well although it would have been better in context with expansion to einstein fermi rotblat and szilards opposition either to the development of the hbomb after enola  or to the use of the atomics altogether

another little quirk is the scene that depicts einstein and gödel which the general public wont recognise despite being one of the greatest mathematicians and logician of the  century there are some nice elements taken from real life like him and einstein having strolls while discussing science and philosophy his love for trees and his refusal to eat which led to his death but from that short scene he comes across as a non important and slow old man which is quite unfair as a portrayal the same is for some einsteins scenes especially the one where he appears behind the taxy by surprise a little over dramatic",2023-08-30 00:40:58
i feel like the 11 miles of imax film thing is incredibly wasteful there was only really one scene for it 99 of the movie was just people talking,2023-07-21 11:26:15
"didnt enjoy it  
the story is interesting but i dont think it was editedwritten well it felt messy and boring

ive seen comparisons written how they wish it was shorter and more like the imitation game and i agree a focus primarily on the war and manhattan project would have been more entertaining i frankly couldnt care less about his security clearance issues or his affair",2023-11-29 07:44:42
pretentious hollow rubbish boring over long convinced if its own importance and suffering from a total lack of narrative flow or characterisation watch as reviewers and fans try to get both veg and the meat in they mouth here is a  emperor with an army of sycophants there are good bits the subject the ending etc but this is a boring wordy mess that taught me nothing much about the central character and nothing at all about the actual process scam,2023-07-22 03:33:09
"hot take
oppenheimer wasn’t good everyone is just caught in the marketing",2023-07-24 04:12:39
"i felt nothing watching this  the movie just jumps here and there then here then there etc the flow was all over the place 

the relationship between cillian and emily was also poorly done again scenes just dropping in out of nowhere where they talk then back to the main plot i felt nothing for the relationship with her or florence’s character 

there was zero emotional attachment to this character for me 

the best chunk of the movie was in the middle when los alamos was in full swing and they where gearing up to the trinity test i think shorting this down to 2 hours would have benefited because that last 40m draaaaaggedd",2023-07-30 16:51:16
i guess i’m in the minority in that i didn’t like it   it was way too long and didn’t need to be 3 hours  by the end i was ready to go,2023-08-04 17:02:37
movie was great but the bomb was a tiny bit underwhelming i think nolans refusal to use cgi was more of a detriment than a benefit when it came to the explosion itself,2023-07-21 02:20:03
"film was decent but i wish they would have included some and taken out some scenes 


 there really was no need for the  scenes as they added nothing to the story  the dialog alone was enough to let us know she has mental issues especially during the closed hearing 

 they really should have gone all out for the explosion as it looked nothing like the historical footage 

 they should have shown the aftermath of japan since he went on a whole spew about what they had done 

they missed his most important speech about being death and later on another speech before he died ",2023-07-21 16:07:24
ill be brief  it was a good movie nothing remotely extraordinary though infact nothing on nolans past work if script is king hes had better ones its a pretty alright biopic with standout moments in a nonlinear setting the women dont really get to do much pugh is completely wasted blunt steals every scene shes in rdjdamon and safdie are spectacular the former is winning the best supporting actor oscar cillian is great but somehow even after 3 hours watching him be central figure i feel like we didnt get enough of him and his range i wonder if anyone else feels the same,2023-07-21 22:36:00
i personally thought it was a good movie but i didn’t like the huge focus on whether or not oppenheimer was a communist… to me it diluted the emotional impact of the movie and diverted too much from the subject matter at the end they revoke his security clearance… i mean are we supposed to feel bad who gives a ,2023-07-22 13:40:55
why didn’t i like it ,2023-07-22 16:32:14
wonder how many people are going to get like halfway through oppenheimer and realize that they liked the idea of watching it more than they actually like watching it,2023-07-23 03:33:31
"i felt like 20 of this movie was absolutely brilliant but the remaining 80 unfortunately rather dull had it been 3045 minutes shorter i would have said it was a much better movie

obviously the communist accusations and security clearance aspects were important parts of oppenheimers life and absolutely needed to be addressed in some way but i felt those scenes were too repetitive and went on for much too long  not to mention delivered over monotonous foreboding music that was too liberally applied 

i really wanted the camera to get out of that tiny room and see some magnificent landscapes and epic cinematic moments but instead we obsessed over bland legal arguments that just frankly arent that important or interesting to someone watching this decades later after the trinity test which i thought was incredible basically the entire rest of the movie was devoted to this relatively dull and irrelevant plot point  wikipedia is a better medium than cinema for all the detail

at least there was some payoff at the end the crux of the storyline rested on what was said between oppenheimer and einstein by the lake and this was revealed marvellously but my goodness it took a lot of time and dialogue between men in suits to get there",2023-07-23 09:01:16
too many people in this thread wanted this to be ‘atomic bomb’ the movie not oppenheimer we were never going to get grisly footage of bomb results or actually see what happened in japan and the fact that so many people eagerly wanted to see that terrifies me what we got was perfect those anxiety scenes are more effective than watching some random people get vaporized,2023-07-23 14:31:48
"maybe i was just propagandized by my american education but i was always lead to believe the end of ww2 went

nuclear bombs dropped 

japan surrenders

 suicides

germany surrenders

it actually blew my mind that  had been dead for months before the bombs were dropped in japan just the realization that they could’ve stopped because there was no more danger of the nazis building their own bomb and japan was more than likely far more vulnerable now with no allies left without the necessary force of two whole nuclear bombs what a  gut punch

edit i should clarify a large portion of my history education took place from 20012010 in post911 nyc so maybe some details were withheld to not villainize the us in a very jingoistic era an hour away from ground zero ",2023-07-23 20:08:05
one of the best films ive ever seen,2023-07-25 00:20:57
great movie but a weird theater experience  right when the sound cut out during the bomb test some guy a few rows back ripped a pretty sizable ,2023-07-25 04:05:30
i thought the movie was slightly above mid and def overhyped if i get spammed for having an opinion the russians have won,2023-07-26 18:02:54
"absolutely enjoyed this movie but have two main critiques 

1 florence pughs  did not need to be out and the  wasnt really necessary 

2 rdj said he felt like this character pushed him yet i think hes still playing the same character  himself hes boisterous cocky arrogant electric and emphatic just seems like he didnt have to push himself too hard for this role thought matt damon did great though 

ps i dont think this movie passes the bechdel test but since when does cn care ",2023-07-28 03:39:17
"amazing movie but felt pretty dragged out after the trinity test could have either replaced some scenes with something else or just cut them out

loved the visuals the build up and writing",2023-07-28 19:07:02
"felt like the movie was far over hyped and i felt it was a good movie but not great maybe it missed the mark or something for me but the first act felt far too chaotic and the cuts too frantic 

i think i took more issue with oppenheimers character in general i understand it’s a biopic but he felt incredibly self absorbed and while that might have been the intent to portray him that way i found him insufferable",2023-07-29 06:04:13
they needed to do a better job explaining the two different timelines in the beginning i must have missed a line of dialog or something and was confused throughout strauss is not a good character imo why should we care about him at all,2023-07-29 14:04:10
"just saw the movie i think by the 2 hour mark i was sort of diappointed but the final hour is fantastic and nolan at his best that scene with him giving a speech for the los alamos crowd after the first bomb was harrowing

i wish emily blunt had a bigger screen time and they shouldve focused a little bit more on the sciene of it all too still great movie",2023-08-01 20:24:17
"good movie not the masterpiece being claimed though unfortunately excellent acting murphy downey jr and blunt are great way too long a movie  about an hour too long and drags quite a bit at times 

i’m a huge nolan fan but prefer his scificomic inception interstellar tdk over his historical dunkirk oppenheimer",2023-08-14 01:23:05
"i saw oppenheimer this weekend and while i liked it overall i also agree with a lot of other people’s criticisms of the film but i think the film had a lot of positives too 

what i didn’t like

the score was a bit distracting and distorted the audio so i found the dialogue hard to understand at many points while i understand the security clearance investigation was critical to oppenheimer’s life i would be lying if i said that the way that story line was integrated into the movie around the manhattan project piece made the three hour long film feel like it was five hours long a lot of the scenes where people were being questioned about oppenheimer’s connection to the communist party of america were repetitive drawn out and boring i would’ve preferred those parts to have been condensed 

i also feel like this movie could’ve also just been two separate films or a part one and part two the first one could be about how oppenheimer got involved in the manhattan project and the creation of the atomic bomb and part two could’ve focused on the postwar aftermath and his security clearance trial

i also felt like some of the timeline of the events was confusing but again that may have been because i was exhausted when i watched it 

what i did like

the acting was top notch i was very impressed with the strong performances in the film there were some truly chilling scenes ie the foot stomping and oppenheimer stepping into the ash husk of a corpse that were terrifying depressing and yet hauntingly beautiful 

i want to watch this film again when i’m less tired but yeah i still enjoyed it overall",2023-08-21 19:58:03
yo this thing was long,2023-08-27 15:30:29
"i may be alone in this opinion but did anyone think actual shots of the explosion not the build up the build up was incredible didn’t quite convey the scale and power of the blast i understand the choice to not use cgi but the actual imagery of the explosion felt a little small scale to me compared to real footage of the trinity test

anyway that didn’t detract from the movie at all for me incredible film",2023-07-21 05:57:30
"i think overall it was a good movie but if i’m being completely honest i wasn’t that invested in the first 2 acts still good but i wasn’t really that into it the 3rd act though was great 

also my first time seeing a film in 70 mm so that was pretty cool 

probably a 7510 for me",2023-07-21 17:46:48
"anyone else feel like there were some “adam and eve” moments the odd poisoned apple the  scenes and  dialogue afterwards they were  and ashamed

felt like this was a metaphor for “original sin” and “no going back”",2023-07-21 22:37:36
this movie really drives home that real life is more dystopian than any fiction we live in a fascist world,2023-07-22 03:33:44
"it is hard to process any words after seeing this just left me with the heaviest of feelings it has to be up there among nolan’s very best i have to rewatch this

nolan cillian and rdj are coming for those oscars",2023-07-22 07:07:31
"the cinematography was great sound was great acting was great script was good but the nonstop talking really got to me 

the majority of the scenes felt like a trailer or a flashback scene with horrible pacing and characters talking immediately after each other in an unrealistic manner

i definitely need a rewatch but i don’t think the pacing issues will fade if dialogue was paced correctly the movie would be 45 hours long",2023-07-22 08:54:07
"saw the film in imax today really wanted to love it but couldnt quite get there murphy rdj and damon all nailed their roles great screenplay and cinematography i thought the story flowed well and was a movie where the audience is respected as the story isnt overtly told you had to be paying attention to piece it together

 i found it at times to be a little lackluster feel like the movie could have been 30 minutes shorter issues with the sound quality and not hearing completely what was said throughout the film and at times it felt oversaturated with background music not sure we got much depth out of the story feel could have been fleshed out further overall the movie felt like those times when you buy a nice looking cake from the store and the taste is bland to ok but you keep convincing yourself it tastes as good as it looks 810 for me",2023-07-23 07:54:20
"i could barely hear a thing loved the few scenes without music like the trinity test i missed entire plot beats because of this

am i the only one was the the sound mixing or the speaker quality at the theater",2023-07-23 13:55:53
after my second viewing of this film i appreciated its craftsmanship even more the flawless execution combined with the historical significance of the story it tells makes this an essential film,2023-07-23 19:18:57
"just came out of a viewing now normal screening cause imax and imax 70mm is sold out all over los angeles

its a very good movie from start to finish great performances killer score editing is on point it is gonna be nominated for all these awards and it is 100 deserving

having said all that i think they stumbled a bit in the third act with all the courtroom stuff now again those sections are very good and everyone is giving their all in the performances but i feel like oppenheimer going from wanting to build the bomb to having unimaginable regretptsd over it shouldve been the only focal point

theres a scene during the third act where kitty is like you cant make everything okay by being a martyr and it sums up the third act perfectly but robert downey jr wanting to get petty revenge just felt like a completely different movie again what nolan gives us here in the third act is still pretty goodi just think it makes the movie drag when the end scene involving einstein telling oppenheimer that hes  the world essentially wouldve been there regardless

still worth time seeing although now that i only saw it on a standard screening i do not see the hubhub about imax seems like it can stand on its own as long as the theater doesnt  the projection",2023-07-24 02:32:08
oppenheimer casually dismissing the possibility that him  a colleagues wife might have contributed to his death pretty much killed all my sympathy for him right at the end,2023-07-24 07:22:53
"this story told on 70mm was a movie experience i’ve never had and will never forget a biopic of epic proportions and scale nolan undoubtedly created a masterpiece

i am left wondering though…did he miss the opportunity to show the true devastation this bomb caused why is it that the only explosion we saw came from trinity rather than the ones which wreaked actual human havoc",2023-07-24 08:45:22
its 3 hours long but it still felt rushed like somebody watched tim robinsons i think you should leave drivethrough sketch and told me oppenheimers life story as fast as they could,2023-07-25 19:02:57
it’s kind of interesting how this movie is getting glowing reviews over here and getting absolutely  on over in the true film reddit,2023-07-26 05:55:30
"im just glad nolan listened to criticisms about audio and made the dialogue fully audible for this film there are some parts at the beginning with a loud score behind them but aside from that its crystal clear 

it was disappointing to see so many reviews of tenet from viewers who never even gave the film a chance because they couldnt hear what was going on and in an expositionheavy plotdriven movie theres only so much visuals can do at that point nolan really shot himself in the foot with that one i truly believe if tenet had better audio it wouldnt have been nearly as maligned",2023-07-27 14:21:47
why did oppenheimer and kitty have a second child if they didn’t like the first one,2023-07-27 21:48:57
i understand the frustration of some people it could have been so much more but it has some rough edges this shouldnt take away the fact that it is an acting visual audio masterpiece it left an imprint on me that i cant shake off,2023-07-31 11:57:39
i loved so much about oppenheimer and have been thinking about it non stop since i watched it a week ago but i’m having trouble with the third act i was struggling to engage with it watching in real time and even now thinking back i think it could have been done better i know the sort of deflating feeling after the massive climax of the second act is intentional but still,2023-08-06 15:26:01
"this movie cramped too much story even its 3 hour run time is still not enough it rushed every single scene with dialogues dialoges boom moved on to the next scene dialogues next scene dialogues boom next scene without letting the audience absorb or process the scene

its like doing a marathon while holding an explosive diarrhea this movie cant wait to see the finish line

nolan should just focus the story about oppenheimer and the bomb leave the story about his communist past his messy love life his trial and that strauss rdj story this is a movie not a documentary focus

imagine if better filmmaker made this like paul thomas anderson scorsese coen bros or dennis villeneuve they would focus the story and let the scenes breathe nolan is technically brilliant but hes just an artsy michael bay",2023-07-21 11:52:55
downvote me all you want this was a  snoozefest it might not be a bad movie objectively maybe it was made for cinephiles but i personally thought it was really boring never in my life did i want to leave the theatre in the middle of the movie maybe i am a bit slow in the head but i just couldnt keep up with the pace of the movie the timeline was all over the place and confusing i couldnt understand quite a huge chunk of dialogues due to poor sound mixing it doesnt help that i am a nonnative english speaker the british accent is tough to grasp without subtitles i also found the third half of the movie too stretched out or rather unnecessary i was simply not interested in the courtroom drama although i acknowledge that it might be necessary for the story of oppenheimer lastly the actual explosion was kinda underwhelming i was expecting more honestly the only part i was genuinely hyped about before watching the movie also they didnt show the hiroshima and nagasaki bombing which i found a bit weird in the end i would like to say that this movie was not for me i had a completely different movie in my mind but the actual result was the complete opposite of my expectations i was expecting more action more focus on the making and working of the bomb and lastly a bit more emphasis on the actual bombing and test what i got in return was a the social network type of drama but with long conversation scenes and characters i couldnt care less about again i am in no way saying that this was a bad movie the acting was topnotch the soundtrack was also great and the filmmaking by nolan was also absolutely amazing i just couldnt get into it and its totally on me this was not a movie about ww2 and the atomic bomb this was a movie about robert j oppenheimer and his life i just want to give a heads up to the people who are also expecting something more from the movie its not an action movie or a ww2 movie its a long character study with a lot of dialogue exchange between different characters i believe many people share my opinion but at the moment they are afraid to go against the crowd you will definitely see conflicting opinions about the movie after its run ends,2023-07-21 15:52:45
"it’s sad that such a compelling and thought provoking film will be seen as a meme

couldn’t have asked for anything more from this the actors across the board all deliver great performances murphy and downey jr are remarkable and the directions their characters take are navigated so well that you are constantly wanting more 

nolan took a story that the world assumed was known and took us behind it sure the stunning and the deafening parts of the movie looked and felt great at no point during this movie did i feel slogged or look to a watch it brings you deep into a story that keeps giving and giving however the true stunning moment is the emptiness you are felt with in that closing scene and how that emptiness defined a man’s life to both himself and his peers",2023-07-21 03:34:51
3rd best nolan film for me after tdk and memento cillian proves he can carry a major hollywood film and hoyte is as brilliant as ever his first shot at dominating an awards season is here,2023-07-21 13:10:42
"this isnt nolans best work ever im my opinion its interstellar but still this movie is sick the plot was paced well and everything was moving fast and i didnt really feel bored for the entire 3 hours

my favourite scenes from the entire movie was little frames of oppenheimers mind like little frames of fire the nuclear reaction stars and etc those sounded amazing and nerve wrecking in the imax theatre

the trinity test could have been longer and better nolan should have also used a bit of cgi to enhance the practical effect done for the test 

i would rate this an 810 its a really amazing movie but it has its flaws",2023-07-21 22:02:03
"i liked it a lot it has a lot of what makes nolan great cinematography sound design well mixed great acting cillian murphy gives an incredibly understated performance where i feel you can see every ounce of pain he feels despite not having a big climactic emotional scene 

it also has the things i dislike about nolan where i dont feel he really leaves any room for subtlety or themes a bunch of times during the movie i thought oh this is a great nugget to think about before a character would just blatantly say what was trying to be shown 

also felt it got a little silly with the name dropping and i almost burst out laughing when einstein was chilling behind the car towards the end like he was nick fury it was practically marvel for science nerds with the number of name drops and cameos when han solo said senatorkennedy john f kennedy i half expected him to look at the camera and wink 

but the 20 minutes or so when they test the bomb and then the aftermath with him giving the speech was absolutely outstanding i may not watch the film in cinemas again but ill definitely watch this passage of it over and over for years to come harrowing and very well done

810 from me",2023-07-22 02:27:01
"nolan makes very good movies and this is no exception

but this is not even his top 5 shows you the levels he’s at

there’s a lot to like about this movie cinematography cillian sound are the top three things but i think he easily could have shed 3040 mins from it

overall for me its a solid 75810",2023-07-22 09:15:20
i guess this is an unpopular opinion but i really hated the scenes with rdj and alden ehrenreich just kinda cheesy and you didn’t need ehrenreich’s weirdly smug character to put together the pieces that the movie laid out already,2023-07-22 13:02:02
just stepped out of the 70mm imax showing in indy i have no words this is the best nolan has ever done not sure who finally got him to work on the sound mixing but he definitely took it to heart that was a beautiful cinematic experience,2023-07-22 18:40:51
i thought the movie was fine but maybe a little mid i lost the story a few times and it would take me a bit to get it back and despite emily blunt and florence pugh giving good performances i felt like those characters could’ve had a bit more depth to them 610 for me,2023-07-23 03:37:39
"super fast paced and sometimes the music would be so loud that i couldnt make out what some of the characters were saying

nonetheless i loved this movie so much anything by christopher nolan is an instant hit for me but this one rivals interstellar on my list of favorite movies i came out of the movie theater with a lot to think about and a substantial amount of dread about our future lol",2023-07-24 05:56:48
really didn’t like dunkirk thought it was a good film but not close to the rest of nolan’s work oppenheimer was brilliant  went in blind  there couldn’t be enough hype for this film  it’s brilliant,2023-07-25 01:27:53
"was ready to not like this movie but i was so happy with the way it turned out so glad the climax of the movie wasn’t the trinity test but the moral repercussion of the japanese bombing especially the theme of martyrdom in exchange of accountability didn’t think nolan would think that through but he took the story where it truely needed to go 

my biggest gripe is the sound mixing please for goodness sake turn off the music so we can hear what people are saying it’s my only gripe 910",2023-07-25 13:20:37
my main take away is that after reading american prometheus it shouldve been a miniseries seemed rushed in some aspects and left a lot of context out overall very solid great performances,2023-07-29 06:18:24
insanely good movie my favorite nolan work except maybe interstellar,2023-08-06 22:27:57
i have a very short attention span but this movie kept me locked in for the entire 3 hours i felt like i didnt even blink great movie 1010,2023-08-07 07:17:19
"anyone else see the commonly between oppenheimer 2023 and imitation game 2014

both take place in the advent of ww2 one being about oppenheimer and his ostracization due to communist connections and the latter about turing and his downfall due to homosexuality",2023-08-22 16:36:04
a near perfect film and nolan’s crowning achievement a big win for cinema,2023-08-27 16:59:31
"this movie did not go down well with me
it was not what i expected
the pace of the movie is set to 110 the entire way
there is so much dialouge its impossible to keep up
with the pace of the dialouge conversations do not flow or have any emotion or feeling also it is hard to follow
it is rooted in politics 90 of the movie which most people that do not understand complicated politics of the usa in the 40s will struggle with
time jumping back and forth make it strenuous to follow a story
other character relations are unclear and unmemorable its actually easier to call them by the names of the actor
what i thought would be the climax the necluear blast was so underwhelming its comical they clearly used gasoline fire to simulate a nuclear blast and it looked nothing like an actual nuclear blast the shock wave that hits the spectators is hilarious i thought the producers just used a leaf blower and some dust on set 

310 for me
could be 810 if you already have a firm grasp on the political back story",2023-07-21 11:02:37
"i love nolan but across his entire body of work no matter how ambitious and intelligent the film i have yet to see him create one truly compelling female character or at least one whos life doesnt revolve around the male protagonist 


tenet was sort of the last straw for me and this film does nothing to alleviate the frustration casting two of the finest actors in the industry and and giving them nothing to do but either be  or drunkenly cry is a real shame


especially after seeing it with barbie i was just hyper aware throughout the film how underused and underwritten the women are 

otherwise it is stellar though 810",2023-07-21 09:47:06
"i saw it today on imax this movie will win all the oscars best movie best direction leading man supporting actors music sound editing etc and deservedly so

cinematography script editing sound composition and performances overall are excellent

but it’s not 1010 masterpiece even after 3 hours and fantastic performance from cillian murphy and the others i felt empty like i didn’t care if oppenheimer loses his security clearance or not 

and i realized what’s missing from most nolan’s movies heart they are masterful displays of technical excellence and pure cinematic revelations but sometimes the characters feel somewhat empty and just tools for a puppetmaster to spin his creations around the playground

in contrast earlier this week i saw mission impossible in imax as a movie its not at the same level as oppenheimer even though its a very good one but the moment main character ethan hunt jumped off the cliff on a motorcycle i was in tears both for the technical excellence of the movie crew and for actually caring about the character

really hoping nolan will next direct something scifi again so his inability to bring warmth to his characters is not so distracting and he can solely focus on technical excellence and complex plot",2023-07-21 20:19:25
"that was a return to form for nolan much better than interstellar dunkirk and tenet 

nolan works best when it’s something more grounded with a twist while dunkirk was fine that movie felt like it was three hours while oppenheimer felt like two tenet and interstellar run times could also be felt while watching 

maybe it’s because i had read “in the matter of j robert oppenheimer” in high school that it all started connecting as the story went on i hadn’t read that play in over 15 years so details of who and what was happening were fuzzy but when they revealed strauss as the antagonist i remembered more and more of the context of the play that helped guide the film along 

really good work by him and really hoping he stays within reality either for a biopic like this or something like the prestige memento or insomnia for his next",2023-07-31 23:39:46
florence pugh should have been cut out of the movie,2023-08-01 07:19:36
"saw it last night in imax it was ok its a solid movie but not meeting the hype think the overwhelming sentiment of our group is im glad i saw it but ill probably never watch it again 

dont think the storytellling writing or structure of the film was very good the first two thirds are messy dont think the crescendo of the film lived up to expectations and it lacks the epicness i think i expected and if it was going for a more subtle look at him then it missed the mark widely",2023-08-06 21:38:13
watched it today it was an okay film in my opinion yes the acting was good particularly cillian murphy however it didnt have to be so long many scenes particularly the  scenes were absolutely unnecessary i expected some more discussion about the physics and logistics challenges of making the bomb 35,2023-08-28 00:08:39
just watched it for the first time i was immensely disappointed i would have given it a c or c if it was a normal length movie but i have to drop my grade down to a d since it there was no reason for it to be 3 hours long im sick of all these directors putting out mediocre films over 25 hours if your film is not a masterpiece keep it at a reasonable 2 hours,2023-12-09 18:13:37
"i thought the movie was trash sorry

matt parker and trey stone south park once gave a lecture on story structure if your story beats are connected by and then youre fed what should happen between those beats are the words therefore or but

oppenheimer was nearly all and then it was a bad story for the first 2 hours how were his student days in europe relevant to the story the plot and villain only kicked off after the explosion

until then every scene was something along the lines of dr oppenheimer you arent allowed to do this well what if i do it anyway i see your point lets do it there was no time for conflicts to establish before they were solved and then the next scene happens tell me the point of showing us oppenheimer and colonel groves selecting the location by drawing a map with an x oppenheimer saying were going on the train and finishing the sentence with to los alamos when they arrive as if they stopped talking the rest of the train ride another problem solved before it was a problem and then

nolan has always had trouble writing relatable human drama thats okay he made up for it in spectacle and blowing my  mind but without those to fall back on oppenheimer fell on its butt imho",2023-07-28 15:34:01
"im sorry to say i didnt have a wonderful time watching oppenheimer i thought it was good not great i had trouble following everything especially regarding the back and forth jumps in time i also got confused about all the different people and their relationships and spent far too much in my own head trying to figure certain things out that i couldnt immerse myself fully in the experience i also felt that everything moved a little too quickly at times 

in all likelihood a couple to few more viewings and i might get all the way there but i dont think i enjoyed it enough to go through the effort",2023-07-21 09:46:35
im surprised how many people are saying they liked the bomb scene like yeah the direction and the audio and all that was great but the explosion itself looked like someone took one of those cheap special effects explosion packs and pasted it onto the black background and called it a day it looked really awkward like a car sized explosion going off a few feet away from them and not at all like a nuclear explosion in the distance,2023-07-21 03:20:39
"i’m in the minority here but i definitely felt the 3 hour runtime wellmade movie with a lot of greatness but it also felt like nolan at his most indulgent can’t help but feel this probably could’ve been like… 2 hours

i think having an hour of fallout focused on a fairly dry subject postclimax kinda soured my mood by the time i walked out of the theater",2023-07-21 04:12:57
"people are complaining about the last one hour but my issue is with the first one hour i felt like those scenes werent that interesting with nothing much happening other than establishing that oppenheimer is leaning towards leftwing also the love story part didnt serve any purpose 

the part from the los almos to meeting with the president after hiroshima and nagasaki is good

the part after this felt like a complete genre shift after what we have witnessed until that point but i found this part profound and moving

since all these three parts are intercut in the movie the movie is boring and engaging depending on the timeline

over all the entire movie felt it had too many characters too much interrogationroom drama too much of a nonlinear narrative also the conflict with downeys character didnt feel like it is well established",2023-07-21 13:53:53
"it could have been 1010 for me if

 cut some scenes and focus on certain important scenes longer all the scenes felt short but there were a lot of scenes

 the trinity explosion should have been bigger and more scary and longer duration lynch gave a great example in twin peaks the return episode 8 it gave me a visceral feeling dreamlike but terror and fear

 pugh was miscast

 a lot of famous actors playing characters that were never properly introduced so it just felt like rami malek is here and playing somebody and so on

 wish it was more on how they worked to create the bomb and how the aftermath affected his public image

what i appreciated

 cillian is amazing his performance  is brilliant  not for a second i thought he is thomas shelby except maybe when he did that walk with the hat and pipe on but he carried the whole movie perfectly 

 rdj finally back to acting and showing how good he is

 garry was there for like 5mins and he made me despise truman

 the underlying dread anxiety and melancholy we are living in a world that can end anytime due to nuclear bombs",2023-07-21 15:22:35
"as someone who has trouble with dialogue heavy movies this was tough to get through i was kinda expecting it though after reading a few reviews i probably wouldnt have been able to finish it in one go if i was sitting at home its a bit easier in the cinema

what i was expecting to be the highlight of the movie for me the trinity test itself was sadly kind of a let down it was build up amazingly well only for the actual explosion to be kind of underwhelming where i didnt really get a sense of scale maybe because of the editing i liked the silence and the delay of the shockwave alot though

through out the movie i was also thinking what is the point of filming it in imax when most of the scenes are indoor in small rooms as for the cinematography it didnt really stand out to me cant think of any memorable shots unlike fx dunkirk and interstellar that has many amazing shots that made my jaw drop

the performances were all excellent and i can definitely see an oscar nomination for cillian murphy and rdj

the score was also amazing just wish it was used more

overall it was a very well crafted movie with the performances and score as the highlights for me the dialogue was great even if there was a bit too much of it for my taste the pacing also felt like typical nolan very fast paced almost no downtime which i like",2023-07-21 18:18:24
"i cant heap enough praise onto cillian murphy and emily blunt for their dialogue not just the flawless accents but the unique cadence and delivery of people of that time period thats essentially disappeared from the current era it just isnt something people think about when theyre acting nor would i expect them to but  it was incredible to hear 
not just the thought given to it but the perfectly casual execution at no point did i feel like i was watching an actor act and thats the best indicator of a performance for me 

this was a tense and heartrending movie an excellent emotional journey ill probably never willingly experience again because i like to be happy lol

i knew i would enjoy the movie but im surprised how obsessed i am the morning after it always had several things going for it that appealed to me big murphy fan a historical event and figure im interested in but the way it sank its claws in i cant believe it that uh that ending sure leaves you spiraling",2023-07-21 18:25:05
weird that nolan decided to include heisenberg in the movie walter white wasnt even alive during wwii,2023-07-21 18:46:55
"i really liked the gym room scene and how nolan captured anxiety it was amazing

but i am gonna be honest i was really bored for most of the movie it’s a very dialogue heavy movie and personally i don’t know much about the history behind oppenheimer so for me it was not as enjoyable  but still there are some great individual scenes",2023-07-21 20:54:29
"good if you like history and the acting was amazing the script wasn’t as great and it jumped around a lot while also dragging this meant you didn’t really get much depth from the characters even with the long run time i also felt there was a lack of historical context setting beyond it being wwii and ‘communism bad’ the second half was superior to the first and his speech after the us bombed japan was my favourite scene

not surprising but nolan really needs to improve his female characters pugh felt wasted considering jean was pretty interesting in real life and that  scene with that line was laughable

65710",2023-07-21 22:25:20
"going against the grain here but i should have known as most nolans movie leave me emotionally cold because he seems more interested in the steps of his ideas than the emotional core of his characters

technically its a gorgeous film some of the better cinematography of nolans oeuvre with solid performances from most of the cast

but the nonlinear narrative is needlessly complicated three timelines fighting is each other with distinc flair but not much new substance to some of them mostly the strauss committee where an action taken prior to it is treated as a twist

the score is overbearing at times some great sound design choices convey great emotions while others only muddy the dialogue 

its runtime is really felt the most interesting parts for me were before the trinity test with a clear real time crunch the postdam conference and the subsequent bombings and important discussions of what to do with the bombs and the diverging opinions of the scientist

and the nudity felt aukward and superfluous",2023-07-21 23:09:33
"its so wild that nolan cast his own daughter as the girl with her face peeling off 

like he had to make it personal and disturbing to himself in order to psychologically feel the weight of the torment and recreate it",2023-07-22 03:18:05
i think the hype killed this one for me it’s a good movie but not in his top 3 imo,2023-07-22 03:43:20
" if you guys go into this movie expecting a fantastical nolan movie like tenet inception or interstellar you will definitely leave the theater dissatisfied 

 the non linear storytelling helps in looping back story in a beautiful way but it is also its achilles heels it made some part feels out place and rushed

 this movie doesnt need to be watch on 75mm bar one scene the black and white part serve as a narrative purpose but imo it doesnt have the awe where you would say yes it better enjoyed as a black and white film

 dont go into this movie with hype but goes into it with an open mind and a room to ponder as someone who is a novice in science and american politics i did get lost in whos who of it all

 the trinity test was beautifully presented but nolan absolutely fails to scale to the audience how big the explosion was you know its far from how it was presented but you dont feel it was far like seeing on a map how far 3 hour drive is vs actually driving for 3 hours

 despite my gripes with the movie it have the mark of an oscar for me from the acting the score the editing it is a peak for nolan movie",2023-07-22 03:43:48
"this is one of thoes movies that i can acknowledge that it’s very well made and can understand why people love it but it’s just not for me 

the direction and acting was top notch in this movie seriously incredible but three hours of people in boardrooms talking about science math and ww2 era politics just doesn’t interest me very much the non linear storytelling works great when you are doing a high concept scifi action thriller but when you’re doing a biopic where the characters their relationships 
and motivations are the most important thing and you can’t understand what’s going on half the time is a huge problem overall this felt like a very exposition heavy wikipedia article that is one of thoes movies that the teacher would put on a friday afternoon and i would sleep through i don’t really know who i would recommend this movie to other than history nerds 

610",2023-07-22 05:49:55
"in the least derogatory way possible this is the wokest movie i seen in recent memory

it dissects the american myth of requiring nukes to force japan into a surrender our role in the global proliferation of nuclear arms and just overall the bullish and short sighted nature of american foreign policy 

then there was the moment that separated communism as a shorthand for soviet influence with communism as a proworker prohuman organization 

im just surprised that a mainstream american film actually examined and criticized those pillars that held up 20th century us

like the movie could have focused on the triumph of the manhattan project but focused on the horror of an upcoming atomic age",2023-07-22 05:54:54
the way oppenheimer’s love for quantum mechanics portrayed by the infinite expanse of the universe in the beginning of the film versus the end where he’s encased by a b52 unable to see beyond the warheads shooting up into the clouds was masterfully done,2023-07-22 15:15:16
"the movie isnt about the manhattan project and isnt an oppenheimer bio either of which wouldve been more accessibleaudiencepleasing but i dont think those topics interest nolan  he wanted to emphasize the divergent motivations and attributes of those who produce scientific wonders vs those who consumeusesponsor them and how the former cannot control the latter

the genesis of the film was the fact that the manhattan project folks knew there was a nonzero chance to destroy the world but pushed the button anyway   thats why trinity is highlighted and hiroshimanagasaki not shown   nolan  seems to feel were doing the same thing with ai  its a cautionary tale",2023-07-22 19:54:49
"actually didn’t like it as much as i thought i would might try and go see it again but to me the pace was suffocatingly fast felt overly explained and oppy felt white washed when his character displayed traits almost as destructive as the weapon he created

i loved the imax features and cinematography overarching themes were very interesting but nothing interesting seemed to happen until the bomb dropped just much more biopic than expected not my favorite nolan movie but still decent 
6510",2023-07-23 00:00:24
"the movie was fine a few steps above a lifetime biopic 

i remember the dark knight was my favorite movie for years starting when i was 12 at release then i rewatched it recently and found some of the dialogue to be a bit lacking but nothing too crazy maybe just age 

then comes dunkirk tenet and now oppenheimer all ive found guilty to varying degrees of horribly conveying the dialogue with tenet being completely unwatchable for me theyre either poorly mixed or the conversations are just so rapid unnatural and full of information

subtitles would improve my experience for sure but overall for a 3 hour movie to feel so rapidfire with fast paced dialogue and switching between timelines is not a great experience and im sure people will say its supposed to induce anxiety etc etc but thats such a cop out i feel tje same way with the bear if anyone can sympathize with that

this had no need to be 3 hours long and with more selectivity of its scenes and dialogue would have personally taken this from a 6510 to at least an 810 nolans a great director but his insistance on writing as well keeps some of his films from being my favorites now that im an adult",2023-07-23 08:38:37
fun fact in the post credit scene where rdj starts the oppengers initiative is call back to a previous film he was in,2023-07-23 16:34:00
"the only part of the movie that left a sour taste in my mouth is the depiction of strauss in a film thats trying hard to be very nuanced and showcase all angles of motivations considerations etc it seemed absurd to turn strauss into a onedimensional comic book villain who wanted to destroy oppenheimer because he made him look bad once and have that be the driving force of the character i thought that was probably the worst possible motivation to give him

awesome movie though thoroughly enjoyed the rest of it the speech scene after the bombs went off and seeing people throw up outside and picturing the flesh being burnt off of beautiful women was all very haunting and interesting kind of baffles my mind that anyone can cheer after dropping a nuke

most powerful and chilling line of the movie had to have been when he talked about how he changed his mind about the nuclear program once he realized that any weapon we created we would use",2023-07-23 17:38:11
i think im too dumb to get this movie i couldnt follow what was going on the insane pace of the movie didnt help,2023-07-24 00:20:41
holy  the music the acting the directing was all fantastic by far the best movie that’s come out in the last 5 years,2023-07-24 05:46:59
"to have such a great quote from great book reduced to a  scene is immature  such a typical westernizing thing to do

other than that everything else was great in the movie",2023-07-24 15:16:13
watching oppenheimer speak german at the university of leiden which is in the netherlands instead of dutch and than have someone say i didn’t know you could speak dutch was the most confusing thing i’ve seen in the cinema this year,2023-07-24 19:30:54
only thing holding this movie back is a lack of scenes dealing with the scale of the atrocities we committed there are a couple good scenes like the scene at the gymnasium highlighting the human cost of the bombs but the movie couldve used more of that to drive home the horror of what oppenheimer had created,2023-07-25 04:04:14
i feel like the explosion just didnt work for me the sound wave hitting was good dont know if we needed the big clap twice but it kinda jus looked like a big petrol explosion past the initial blinding light in b4 downvotes and well thats what a real abomb explosions looks like i dont care it was lackluster for me i know thats what an atom bomb looks like but i feel it wouldve hit better to keep the slowmo close up fireball that was shown at the beginning for this clock hits zero slow mo explosion moving out blinding light fireball thunder clap i know what a really big explosion looks like but this was supposed to show them heralding us into the next age of humanity just didnt hit home but it was still interesting past that with all the aftermath and political skulduggery which i didnt really know going into the film i knew he was against the nuclear arms race but didnt know about the rdjr guys attempts to silence him overall it was alright its not going on the rainy day films list with other great biopics though,2023-07-25 19:33:30

prior to watching oppenheimer i read the book american prometheus upon which the movie is based i rewatched most of nolans films and spent time watching the best interviews i could find with the cast this is definitely nolanfanboy behavior but i do this as much as i can for different media  
i watched the movie and enjoyed it immensely but more than anything felt it was an important piece of art that merited discussion at an intellectual level that matched its subject matter yet every review seems to be drowning in its authors own moralistic or political agenda or perhaps is a smothering evaluation of nolans entire output or maybe is but a suffocating recitation of who plays what and if they did an okay job  
not that redditors need any reason to feel superior but commenters honest reactions to moments in the movie as stated in review threads are often the most illuminating discourse on a movie despite frequently being drowned in a sea of perennially upvoted funny quotes  
we are lucky to have a film that is a real artwork on our hands here and it deserves real critique it deserves learned critique ie professional reviewers need to have read the book it deserves humble critique that does not have an agenda of its own and it deserves empathetic critique seeking to understand the movies goals rather than espouse your own understanding of issues  
if anyone has favorite reviewers or other resources that this insufferable snob might approve of i appreciate your recommendation",2023-07-27 05:15:03
"this film was incredible i’m actually left feeling really impacted after this film and only the real good films do that 

i think nolan is just a genius at what he does i know a lot of people say that but it can’t go understated i’m trying to get my head around how someone can structure and write a film like that with a budget and create something so complex that tells such a profound story and deals with everything in such a gripping way it’s amazing 

the score was absolutely phenomenal and i really hope cillian murphy gets an oscar for this because he’s such a fantastic actor and he deserves the recognition i also think emily blunt was fantastic 

i latched onto the sense that the film would end where we finally see oppenheimer’s perspective in the einstein conversation when strauss mentioned how he wondered what they had said i assume this was what nolan wanted the audience to think it urges you to wonder what they spoke about that left einstein looking so shaken and it really pays off 

i’m going to have to watch this again in the cinema while it’s out because it’s a film that absolutely needs to be seen in a cinema for the full experience",2023-07-28 04:09:40
i personally thought the last hour could have been edited down i got bored in some spots but otherwise great movie very intense and amazing acting,2023-07-28 18:21:41
the audio mix was  awful on this movie missed so much dialogue,2023-07-29 17:05:07
people just get a liiitle bit overexcited when its nolan the word masterpiece comes too easily for my liking it was ok,2023-07-29 19:36:56
"went to a imax showing at regal westbury for 1030 pm last night and once the movie ended the majority of all you heard from everyone leaving was how that was the most boring film they have ever seen i on the other hand loved it i did however find the first 20 mins very confusing but it just got better and better by the minute  


it truly made me sad hearing constantly from 80 of everyone leaving the packed theatre how bad the movie was as the movie was ending some guys in their early 20s just shouted boring at the top of their lungs and everyone laughed i even heard several people say they expected many nuke scenesshowing of japanese bombs  


i bet the people who watched it opening weekend felt otherwise",2023-07-30 18:19:08
"i enjoyed it overall but i think it was a halfhour too long i found myself getting bored waiting for the manhattan project to start up i think robert downey jr had the best performance in the movie and i really hope he gets best supporting actor at the oscars for it

edit there were also a few scenes that were a bit too loud for me like the shockwave from the trinity test even though i knew it was coming it still jumpscared me",2023-07-31 04:31:24
"the entire movie is exposition i couldnt get past it every single scene is an uninterrupted spew of expository factoids its like a wikipedia audiobook

i really wanted to like this one but i just couldnt shake the feeling i was watching a bunch of robots reciting very fast cue cards at me like no one even talks different they all have the same cadence voice vocabulary witticisms

i have to admit i actually laughed when rdj said so youre saying the greatest accomplishment of my career is about to become the greatest humiliation in history or something like that thats some george lucaslevel writing

reluctantly 6 out of 10 my ears hurt",2023-07-22 05:14:15
nolan has definitely lost it now 4 of his last 5 have been average a best and interstellar wasnt even all that good his annoying fans are keeping him relevant,2023-07-21 12:48:44
i thought the film technically was amazing the acting was fantastic the story as a whole was kinda weak but nolan did a great job overall 910 i thought the actual explosion was overhyped unfortunately and i thought the pugh scene where he reads the scripture should’ve been cut out,2023-07-21 13:34:09
"masking the sounds of the applause in the audience with the screams of terror from hiroshima cascading with the neverending pounding of the stomping was straightup panicinducing

i was honestly surprised at just how subdued the visuals actually were for this movie a lot less than what you would get in most nolan films there is a part of me that admittedly was first disappointed watching the abomb explosion since i hyped myself up so much to see it

the shots and sounds he did use however wow some of the most absolutely mesmerizing and haunting images that i have witnessed particularly the shots showing oppies anxiety after he gave his victorious speech and especially the last scene with einstein before the credits that image of the warheads and our world will forever haunt me seeing it on that 70mm imax screen

it is terrifying to see what has been unleashed but so  necessary this was everything i pretty much couldve hoped for when i first heard about this film all i hope now is that the day never comes where we see nolans vision ever play out",2023-07-21 15:45:44
nolans best ever work he reached his zenith as an auteur here,2023-07-21 18:16:47
"while i’m not going to ramble past the fact that this is the most my heart has ever pounded inside a theater and it’s easily a 10 into my top 3 movies ever

whoever said the audio is easily hearable was lying or they didn’t watch this in imax 70mm some scenes it was the accent others the music was to loud over whispering but i missed a lot of what they were saying but that’s it that is the only flaw of the movie nothing else was perfection

trinity test was unreal the silence was palpable",2023-07-22 06:19:52
theres some greatness in it but overall its too long with and has low rewatch potential imho  i read the book on which its based also too long  nolan did about as good a job as one could  do given the cast of characters though he did downplay the apple episode a bit,2023-07-22 09:46:13
it was very consistent unlike barbie maybe it didnt go over the top for a movie about a bomb but it built up so steadily and consistently for such a long movie then the payoff then the implicationsrepercussions about what happens after we get the bomb was well played i felt the gravity of the situation multiple times they dropped a lot of names and it just felt like so many important people were there and being moved around and coordinated by oppenheimer made him seem even more divine lots of nuances subtleties callbacks solid movie,2023-07-22 14:52:21
the pacing was weird af all the fx at the beginning of the movie the weird visuals the loud noises and then it just turned into a biographical picture,2023-07-23 04:09:10
"i cant remember the last time ive seen a film in theaters that truly moved me it didnt feel like i was watching a film in 2023

oppenheimer is excellently crafted and nolans use of nonlinear storytelling lends itself perfectly to the plot

my only criticism is that nolan seems really committed to how he approaches the volume of dialogue and in a dialoguedriven film it was fairly aggravating to frequently miss important things that characters said to one another

other than that bravo",2023-07-23 14:32:19
"a question to nonnolanites

is this film actually good",2023-07-26 17:44:57
i think this movie is probably great for people who are really into history and politics i definitely admire the movie for how thorough and indepth it is in that aspect and theres something about christopher nolans storytelling style that really forces you to focus and pay close attention to the story and i thought that was effective here and kept the movie from being boring for the most part but i thought there wasnt really enough payoff to justify how dense the story is the scenes that took the time to slow down and focus on a particular event or mood were fantastic but they were too few and far between,2023-07-27 16:30:52
very good  half hour to an hour too long  but this is becoming typical  score was too constant and too loud in most scenes    but thats a nolan thing  did he pick up a coke or adderall habit in the last few years,2023-12-24 02:30:55
i love nolan but am i the only one that thinks he missed showing the magnitude of the explosion was it cause the self limitation to not use cgi everyone is talking about the sound… do you see why everyone is talking about the sound because visually we didn’t get the explosion love nolan anyway this movie is awesome anyway,2023-07-21 07:31:07
that gymnasium scene had no right to go so hard,2023-07-21 08:06:31
had the pleasure of seeing it in 70mm and was amazed and blown away,2023-07-21 11:58:18
anyone else tear up during the actual bomb though,2023-07-21 16:41:01
göransson did an incredible job with the soundtrack leitmotif is amazing ive been listening to it all day,2023-07-21 16:45:49
my favorite part was when josh yelled its spherical spherical before he launched the bomb,2023-07-21 20:44:43
the pace and structure of this movie isnt hard at all to follow dont know whats all that about ,2023-07-21 20:46:31
i think they could’ve shortened rdj screen time and it would be a tighter movie i loved his performance but it bogged down the movie just condense his scenes,2023-07-21 21:30:55
"this is embarrassing but i caught the 70mm screening and wasnt a fan of the film not the movie but the film

for me at least i was expecting a much bigger screen and the flickering during bright scenes was a little distracting",2023-07-21 23:03:35
the explosion was an amazing theatre experience the moment the bomb detonated there was just silence in the whole cinema it felt so intense waiting for the shockwave and the sound blasting out of the speakers but overall it was an ok movie for my taste way too political especially the communism  before the detonation i actually drifted away there and didnt really know what was going on it was just too boring i really hoped it wouldnt get that much politicsand it was way too long but nonetheless a good movie,2023-07-21 23:11:18
"i loved that one part of the score that included geigermueller detector in it typical nolan being a genius with sound design
this was the first time i have been to one of his movies and i understood every word it was refreshing",2023-07-22 00:20:34
i liked it and i dont usually like this type of movie i guess i had the right expectations if you went to see the movie just for big bada booms your going to be disappointed but the acting was fantastic as was oppenheimer visualizing things the third act was definitely the best part of the movie and had me on the edge of the seat how things were going to work out even though i had a general idea of how it did in real life rami maleks character came in clutch and i was so relieved when he spoke up,2023-07-22 01:04:49
saw it in 70mm imax absolutely phenomenal the silence during the trinity test felt absolutely suffocating,2023-07-22 01:13:54
plot question one scene early in the film when oppenheimer is a professor the other scientist ernest lawrence says he has a lecture and oppenheimer needs to leave oppenheimer says  sit in but lawrence says no then two military guys walk in and oppenheimer leaves what was that about,2023-07-22 02:03:10
"loved it  having been interested in the atomic program since elementary school i was particularly interested in this film  im not a scholar or mega fan of chris nolan either but the actors in this movie are all actors i really enoy   

ultimately i too was maybe expecting more of an action movie than it really was because i knewremembered that this was largely based on a novel i was able to pivot my expectations rather quickly  i also dont mind a dialogue heavy movie  but it certainly took a conscious second to tell myself oh ok this isnt going to just be a bunch of exploisions and get into the movie for what it was  

tons of memorable lines  tons of great acting  the score was incredible  being reminded of the weird communist timeline was fascinating  i really enjoyed the haphazard smattering of historical events and historical scientists sprinkled throughout the film even if i only kind of recognize their names rather than knowing how important they actually were  

i often find myself bored in movies and this was 3 hours long and i never felt that way  that alone puts it in a rare category for me  

the explosion itself wasnt as spectacular as i would have expected but i also didnt really care ultimately  it did its job in the film and i respect that they didnt cave and throw in a huge cgi element  also the suspense leading up to it was palpable  

the speech scene was intense and visceral  

really great movie but one that i feel will be hard to recommend to certain people in my life  if history or this particular time in history isnt that interesting to you then im not sure theyre gonna be able to sit through this  andor if they dont enjoy a dialoguedriven movie this isnt gonna sit well  also having some knowledge of the players and events here goes a pretty long way even if it really isnt that important to the story portrayed people might get tripped up thinking they need to know more about these folks than they really do",2023-07-22 05:05:05
2nd most political film i’ve seen today lol,2023-07-22 05:52:31
the first 14th was rather jumbled and messy but the rest was fantastic,2023-07-22 06:02:04
the soundtrack was the best part of the movie all the actors did their job brilliantly the visuals were great too overall 910,2023-07-22 08:37:06
went in blind without doing much research the third act after the explosion i felt a little clueless ngl the entire movie is still tense and scary never the less now that i have read more and looked at who played who im definitely going rewatch again,2023-07-22 09:15:50
just want to temper everyone’s expectations around oscars for this film we have another film by a legendary director that’s guaranteed to be great coming out this year  killers of the flower moon where that film might hold an advantage at the oscars is its representation of minority groups while oppie is a 100 white mostly male centred film representation is something the academy has stated is a big focus for them and i won’t be surprised if it works in killers… favour,2023-07-22 13:26:03
loved the movie as a reader of american prometheus i wanted more scenes from before the manhattan project showing more why oppenheimer was considered as the man to manage the project with no prior knowledge i could see everything as rushed and confusing though it’s a lot to try to cover even in 3 hours i really wanna see what had to be cut and wouldn’t be opposed to a nolan cut or oppenheimer begins ludwig’s score really sold the movie though especially in the moments of silence overall as an already invested party i enjoyed what got covered and the scale nolan reached is it for everyone nope good nolan movie yup it’s up there,2023-07-22 20:52:01
"honestly it reminded me a lot of lincoln a general slow burn with really poignant moments and extremely well acted all around 

the storytelling isnt anything ground breaking but i really enjoyed the nonlinear format going back and forth between the past and present to add motivation and context to the characters 

also im a sucker for einstein so i was grinning ear to ear in the scenes he was in",2023-07-23 01:22:34
wait was the guy playing colonel sanders supposed to be truman,2023-07-23 04:21:05
"just got home from it being a fan of nolan murphy  biopics i really wanted to love this movie and i ended up just…liking it 7510

so much of the cast feels overqualified for the actual screentime and depth or lack thereof their characters end up having pugh and blunt in particular and for very different reasons are criminally underused pugh’s role really seems to come down to “this was a famous actress willing to do  scenes” i’m left asking myself why they bothered casting rami malek kenneth branaugh or gary oldman given their roles are essentially cameos but not necessarily scenestealing ones you’ll remember years later like channing tatum in hateful 8 or bullet train and minor parts that went to actors like jack quaid or olivia thirlby feel beneath an established actor and better suited to unknowns for whom simply being present in a nolan movie would serve as a resume highlight and become recognizable years from now in retrospect 

murphy is of course phenomenal and will deserve the best actor awards he collects next year the cinematography and sound design are fantastic and no one gives a subpar performance my criticism is purely in the amount of material they’re given to work with not their actual work itself 

now i’m the last person to complain that a movie is “too long” and i’m not sure i’d say this one is…but it really didn’t need to be 3 hours and i could feel my theater’s collective vibe growing restless when it was clear that there was another hour to go after the trinity test 

and the clearest thing to cut this’ll be a controversial take is almost everything to do with rdj’s character that subplot particularly in the last hour seems to exist primarily to give rdj screentime to build a best supporting actor campaign and ultimately kinda throws off the momentum of the film which is at its best when it’s either following the story of building the bomb with the interview frame narrative or grappling with the moral  philosophical questions the bomb has introduced such as scenes with krumholtz’ character or einstein ultimately i just didn’t care about rdj’s character and wasn’t surprisedeffected by the “twist” because i never felt he  oppenheimer were particularly close jason clarke was a far more useful “antagonist” such as he is by being the anticommunist attack dog interrogating oppenheimer in the frame narrative than rdj became in the last hour and i think the film is just a lot leaner if the framing interview itself serves as the source of tension in the plot 

anyway i know that take might catch me some grief to be clear rdj is good in the role i’m just not convinced the character actually adds to the movie apart from padding an extra 45 or so minutes of runtime so i’ll reiterate that the film is objectively good and i recommend seeing it on the biggest screen possible…it’s far from nolan’s best and it has in my opinion been overhyped",2023-07-23 04:50:23
15mins too long,2023-07-23 05:37:52
"the only issue for me in the movie was the first hour it was painstakingly slow but it’s understandable as they need to build up the plot music was perfect from start to end dialogues superb acting top notch from every one cillian and rdj coming for the oscar 910

btw people here have valid complaints about the movie being boring and a snooze fest for those who expected more explosions rather than courtroom drama i can definitely understand it it’s one of those of movies you’ll either love it or hate it",2023-07-23 07:34:44
id love to see a stat for the average length of a shot in this film it moves so quickly not just in terms of pacing but the cuts too i felt like i was getting whiplash,2023-07-23 19:26:26
i have nothing to say really other than nolan really knows how to end a movie,2023-07-24 02:33:11
gillian is a shoe in for best actor his performance is mesmerizing,2023-07-24 05:22:59
"my favorite nolan movie so far outside of the dark knight trilogy it is the only nolan film i have seen in a theater so that might be part of it 

what i really liked about this film is the feeling of dread  that comes with the whole life of the atomic bomb from the moment someone thought of the possibility to the final scene i got this sense of oh  the world might just end tommorow and the actors were great at portraying just that cillian murphys performance was incredible",2023-07-27 22:57:15
what were the reactions of the real physicists to their portrayals in the film,2023-07-28 23:07:02

loved it,2023-07-30 20:06:06
it was phenomenal,2023-08-13 00:12:19
can someone explain roughly the chronology of the movie  i got almost everything but the ending left me so confused the ending is going back to the very beggining when oppenheimer talk with einstein it explain the scene where strauss think oppenheimer set einstein against him the truth about what happened is revealed and we see what the conversation was about except that it end with oppenheimer reminding einstein about how he came to him because of the almost nonexistant probability of an explosion that wouldnt stop and would destroy the atmosphere and how he was afraid that it actually happened right  so this conversation happened after the bomb was created and used but before the whole strauss revenge attempt im confused about where to place this moment because i really thought that oppenheimer met the whole crew of physicians after meeting with strauss in the very beggining their meeting is also very first time meeting you the way they talk to each othersintroduce themselves is also as if they were complete strangers then but if the chronology is as it should be they should have met already a few times that one time strauss was ridiculized that one meeting where they got different opinions as well and then again if the chronology is as i understand it it should logically be that oppenheimer is a teacher then is chosen to lead the secret project then the whole project happening also including asking einstein for his opinion about the risk of damagingpotentially destroying the atmosphere and the whole world and that one interview where oppenheimer ridicule strauss then project is a success and oppenheimer become like the most known man in the world then strauss offering the post as the beggining of his revenge and then thats when the discussion with einstein happen  is that right  or do they meet before the project  but then how come oppenheimer was talking about the probability of having affected the atmosphere with einstein if it was before the bombing  and if it was after then how much time pass between strausss offer to oppenheimer and the whole interrogatory thing  ,2023-08-19 04:23:43
"do i need to see oppenheimer in the theater

i have tickets for a 70mm imax coming up this tuesday

the argument for the experience would be that nolan movies are some of my best theatrical memories dark knight interstellar inception i saw all of them two or three times in the theater and still continue to watch them annually

arguments against
 “it’s loud and the sound mixing is terrible it’ll be even worse in imax” said some industry sound expert friends matches with nolan’s reputation
 i watched tenet once at home and haven’t watched it since didn’t love it or hate it just meh
 i have two young kids so seeing a long movie in a theater is taking time off work and my partner watching kids for the evening doable but some cost there
 i watch everything with subtitles on because my hearing sucks and nolan definitely doesn’t help i feel like i’m going to miss a good chunk of dialog given his reputation

leaning towards not going and just watching at home 3 months from now thoughts

edit saw it good",2023-08-28 05:28:52
"this was my worst cinema experience so far it felt like a business meeting boring useless overly long full of talk without pause you can’t leave for courtesy reasons and you don’t know when it will end if i had watched it on netflix i would have stopped after trinity i did not care at all about his  security clearance why does he even need it anymore after the project had been finished i considered leaving the cinema after 230 hours but didn’t because i thought i might be the only person in the room too dumb to get the movie but it turned out my partner felt the same 

i realize after reading the ratings that she and i are probably the only people in the world that didn’t get the movie so this will probably also become my most downvoted comment ever that’s ok i‘m more sad about having wasted three hours of my life and i won’t get them back ever 

i do not understand the appeal of the movie whatsoever maybe it was the german dub that killed it for me but i really don’t want to waste another three hours to check if the original makes the worst movie i have ever endured a decent one",2023-07-28 08:24:01
"yeah now that ive slept on it this was a bad film i think that a 610 may be generous plot is not compelling whatsoever so sterile in general from the characters interactions to the overall vibe of the movie oppenheimer himself has no consistency as a character cillian murphy did a good job acting but the script and dialogue was just so lame and lacking anything that resembles an interesting story

x200b

the skipping between time periods thing works sometimes but it did not for this movie its jarring to skip forward and backward so much especially when the only interesting plotconflict comes at the end of the film nolan has never been a particularly great writer of dialogue and without an interesting setting or characters the entire film just feels so flat how you get a cast this good to give some of their most forgettable performances is crazy

x200b

for me nolans worst film and quite disappointing",2023-07-21 12:51:52
"just watched the movie last night 

i can not understate how phenomenal the soundtrack compliments the movie it constantly creates this feeling of uneasiness and wonder i love the fact that it plays for the majority of the movie making a dialogue intensive movie feel like a thriller while also making the moments without music special and hit harder 

the use of imagery throughout the film was fantastic the cast as expected was amazing 

as someone that did just visit the peace memorial at hiroshima i do think a little more could’ve been said about japan  the controversies around the bombing but to be fair this was a movie from oppenheimer’s pov",2023-07-21 17:49:44
really good movie one of nolans best,2023-07-22 04:15:49
never in a million years did i imagine i would be so captivated by a 20th century biographical film the movie made great use of pacing and dialogue to make a lot of information easy to digest for the audience,2023-07-22 05:17:17
people who don’t like the communist plot line are missing the point and are taking for granted the fear america had  when russia liberated berlin a lot of scientists went to russia like they came to america via operation paperclip the fear nazis made us start the bomb the fear of the communists made us finish and use the bomb  the mccarthy era is and will be a dark stain on america one stain of many thematically it was a good mirror of einstein’s experience before fleeing i might be missing other things but the communist plot line is vital to this story,2023-07-22 14:26:03
"one really poignant moment which stood out for me was when the bomb departed on the trailer and you could hear the metal chains moving against it as oppenheimer watched evoking that  be forever shackled to it 

i thought the sound design overall was incredible though i can’t pick out a single aspect which wasn’t",2023-07-22 16:59:57
"as someone who grew up in los alamos in the late nineties and early 2000s this movie was strangely personal to me and i want to share a few things  
  
1 a few of the scenes in the movie such as the christmas party took place in a building called fuller lodge that was there since before the manhattan project when the place was essentially a camp for boy scouts growing up ive had middle school dances boy scout ceremonies and other town events take place there

2 in the ninties my dad briefly met edward teller the hydrogen bomb guy essentially teller used a restroom my dad used at the same time they didnt talk or anything but my dad and the father of the hydrogen bomb peed next to each other which i think is neat

3 los alamos is a lot more of a pine forest that occasionally bursts into flames than it appeared in the film a lot of the area surrounding los alamos resembled what it looked like on screen though but it was mostly like the pine forest from the one scene where oppenheimer is in the snow crying about his former lovers suicide",2023-07-22 23:00:21
hats off to nolan making a movie with 3 not pointless  scenes probably the first i can recall in a long time possibly since titanic,2023-07-23 21:04:36
"i dont know i like the first 23 of the movie where it feels like an physics flavor arms race but when it turns into more of the political drama itlost me i dont enjoy it as much maybe im being monkey brain but idk 

but i know this is an important film and the mainstream liking this fares better moving forwards for the artform and for what kind of movies can get made   

that being said the ending is brilliant",2023-07-24 05:12:45
ignorantly i didn’t know really anything about oppenheimer before going into this movie so in the third half i kept wondering why oppie was getting tried so intensely and accusatory  especially considering he was being celebrated not long prior  i thought surely this cant just be because he embarrassed strauss i thought i’d missed something well turns out no it was exactly that and strauss was just a massive narcissist with the most fragile ego  true example of being petty as fuuuuck,2023-07-24 07:03:39
"generally dont like biopics but this film is incredible and i really cannot stop thinking about it

i think people who see nolans name come into this film expecting some big extravaganza action flick but this is a character story about obsession guilt and ambition the film makes us feel what oppenheimer felt went through from his spectacular achievements to the despairing depths in his life",2023-07-24 14:36:28
"am i the only one who had a hard time understanding bits and pieces of the dialogue especially from charactersactors with heavier accents

the pacing was all over the place the score was demanding and insistent and never gave scenescharacter interactions room to breathe the movie being edited in a nonlinear fashion didnt help either

the trinity test explosion was underwhelming when you compare it to footage which you can find on youtube of the real thing

good performances all around rdj is in pretty much a shooin for best supporting

tom conti was one of the highlights of the film for me his portrayal of einstein was fantastic

oppenheimer showed more remorse and regret for jean tatlock than he did for helping create the most devastating weapon in the history of mankind",2023-07-25 13:03:31
i personally dislike biopics as i feel they dont accurately portray anyones life or if they are boring i thought that nolan made the best movie he could with the biopic formula basically i am saying biopic has low ceilings and nolan hit it,2023-07-25 17:30:50

the cutaway shots of particles swirling atoms splitting wave functions mingling and collapsing v2s flying overhead the atmosphere burning and others were beautiful and exciting

 the cast
the cast was excellent all around emily blunt and cillian murphy are standouts to me

 photographic accuracy
some details were recreated with astounding accuracy the gadget itself looks exactly like the photographs of it

what i disliked

explosition
oh my  holy  every other line in this movie is a character explaining either a technical or plot detail matt damon says ive heard a lot about you you are a womanizer a dilettante etc its such weak dialogue this is the oppenheimer movie hes the main character but it sounds like damons introducing him as a member of the suicide squad

 scene length
id be shocked if any scene in this movie was longer than a minute the movie has a relentless pace for 3 hours we hardly get any time to take in the characters just being in a scene

 nolanery
this complex interleaved narrative structure is what nolan is known for but i think the movie strains under the weight of this format so much screen time and dialogue goes to showing us the inner workings of this political attack that is ultimately just a petty smear campaign bland details are shown then reshown then relitigated again in hearings to tie down this messy structure

yeah science 
the movie is so long and it exposits so aggressively why is the science is reduced to pure mysticism christopher nolan seems obsessed with realism so i dont get why these genius men and women are relegated to speaking in platitudes about the science they devoted their lives to study

 why this story
about half the movie is focused on lewis strauss attempts to smear oppenheimer we the audience do not hold the fervent anticommunist views of america at that time we dont care if oppie is a communist or not this hearing is a natural framing device as oppies past is combed through and exploited but why on earth do we focus on the precise details of who wrote what memo to whom based on which leaked document

 why not other stories
the making of the atom bomb involved some truly fascinating events and many brilliant scientists but they all show up in the movie almost like cameos heres feynman heres leo szilard heres fermi here in the corner is pile 1 and oh my  is that moon knight i can respect that nolan stuck to oppies story he was only around for certain events at certain times except i cant respect that because the whole second half of the movie is about  lewis strauss

 why not more oppenheimer
oppenheimer was a weird fascinating dude he considered the bhaghavad gita to be one of the books that most shaped his philosophy of life in the movie it comes up as a curiosity that leads into a  scene why not show more the story is about a warrior named arjuna hesitating before a large battle his charioteer krinsha an avatar of vishnu depending on who you ask counsels him krishna is death destroyer of worlds and he says that arjuna would only be slaying men krishna had already taken arjuna needed not mourn the many he would have to  their lives already belonged to the infinite devourer of all things too bad that story has no bearing on the themes of this movie s

 visions and imaginings
like i said those pulsing whirring visual cutaways were awesome why did they just stop was it so we could go to the strauss housse they lent such magic to the first few beats of the movie and then they abated there were so many elements of the manhattan project that couldve been visualized in this way lookup explosive lens moreover oppenheimer cared about things other than the bomb we couldve also been treated to mystical visions relating to his deep interest in hinduism or why not some vision like this one from dr michihiko hachiya who survived the atom bomb 

 it seems i was in tokyo after the great earthquake and around me were decomposing bodies heaped in piles all of whom were looking right at me i saw an eye sitting on the palm of a girl’s hand suddenly it turned and leaped into the sky and then came flying back towards me so that looking up i could see a great bare eyeball bigger than life hovering over my head staring point blank at me i was powerless to move

how much more captivating could this narrative have been if we were allowed into all of oppenheimers thoughts not just the ones nolan thought were interesting

 the trinity test
it was certainly different perhaps the promotional material overemphasized the scenes importance but i cant help but feel like that scene was intended to be a big moment nolan certainly likes his setpieces and he spent a great deal of time and money trying to get it right but man did it fall flat for me
weve all seen footage of real nuclear explosions it seemed like nolan was trying his darndest to recreate it in camera to seemingly no purpose why not just use the existing trinity footage and gussy it up a bit hes filming something thats already been filmed without really choosing a new perspective he had so many options to make this scene a bit less lame

 show some of the peripheral details that we havent seen before the blast echoing off of mountains a massive valley being illuminated with the brightness of day the cloud lingering after sunrise some of the weird gizmos the scientists had to get their own measurements of the blast tonnage fermi had some setup with strips of paper if i recall correctly

 if youre going for a more grounded and realistic vision give us that rather than a set of cuts that intersperse closeups and several different perspectives give us some time to take in the blast for ourselves

 give your actors some time to sit in the aftermath and give us some sense of the human impact of the thing

 use some physics driven simulations to give us something that isnt just a hollywood gasoline fireball

 intersperse some of those cutaways i talked about earlier of atoms smashing or the explosive lens lensing

 hiroshima and nagasaki

to nolans credit this film does reflect the historical fact the bombs were dropped not just to end the war but also show our power to the soviets many historians argue that japan was on the precipice of surrender before the weapons were deployed

i think nolan made the wrong choice not showing the bombings in some way the charred corpse and burned face i think were not sufficient we needed some sort of vision depiction description or reaction beyond what was presented the very end of the movie is this fiery vision of doomsday we ignore that fact that the same doomsday was already unleashed and that our government wouldve unleashed it again and again on whoever they couldve if the soviets hadnt developed their own weapons

many victims in hiroshima were effectively melted but did not die right away they lingered in blind agony pawing with macerated limbs for their children and their parents who were dead or left as moaning faceless ghouls rivers of corpses ran red then black with the sooty fallout that came down afterwards nolan did not shock and upset us nearly enough these scenes shouldve been excruciating 

this movies trailers sold it using the atom bomb not oppenheimers chaotic and influential life i think its fair to say that the bomb is what drew a lot of folks into the theater in the first place you cannot make a story about the bomb and gloss over its true victims like this its irresponsible and it supposes the scariest thing is an imagined apocalypse rather than the real ones our government triumphantly wrought on cities full of civilians

but thats the power of the bomb no nation no matter how cruel can ignore that using these weapons guarantees doom for everyone we are powerless before the infinite maw of death devourer of all things destroyer of worlds the greatest invention of the last century may still save us but we cannot forget the lives it destroyed

editing as i see typos",2023-07-22 18:05:15
"everyones entitled to their opinion but the people calling it boring are definitely missing the point i can understand why they may feel that way but it also goes to show  just how little the general public knows or appreciates  its own countries history as someone who studies political science the nuclear treaties are actually the most well followed international agreements 

 i appreciate the restraint in not showing hiroshima or nagasaki being bombed and just the trinity test seeing the two bombs being transported in shaky trucks was more unerving than actually seeing the blasts again 

i also appreciated how kitty oppenheimer didnt have some historonic reaction learning about his affair with pugh when she had cheated on her husband with oppenheimer it was fascinating seeing him interact with niels bohr and einstein  and enrico fermi even knowing they were real people theyve almost become mythical figures at this point the three interwoven stories were also a master  in structure 

i would have like to see more of the smear job with senator mcarthy and j edgar hoivers involvement but felt the private committee kangaroo court did an effective job",2023-07-22 22:29:44
"

unpopular opinion oppenheimer was kinda clickbait

im a bit dissapointed because i was expecting a lot more physics and engineering in the movie and problem solving instead we got a more personal approach with moral and psychological struggles in the focus and the boring capitalists vs commies conflicti dont think thats bad per se but that wasnt how the movie was presented in advertisiment i put the blame on the overwhelming ads that just put the expectations in the wrong direction which just ruined the experience in the cinema for me a bit the ending was probably the best part of the movie for me i must say so to conclude if i knew the movie was like it was i would watch it from a different perspective and enjoyed it more it isnt truly made for science geeks feel free to disagree with me here",2023-07-24 12:56:40
"hot take   
  
my wife and i both agree that this probably would have been more enjoyable as a high quality tv miniseries stretch out more of his romance with jean before the los alamos his connection and leaning towards communism etc make it a 45 1hr episodes  
we both really liked it a lot the story was good the history and background but we left the theatre thinking we probably would have enjoyed this on our tv instead",2023-07-30 01:27:11
i cried so much during the trinity test nolan beyond perfectly executed the cosmic feeling of horror and awe i have never in my life felt that sort of thing before it was beyond empathetic and spoke to this higher judgment of human tragedy a spectacle of human being hubris,2023-08-28 00:33:57
"can i say something without getting downvoted into oblivion

i didnt like it all that much it did some things incredibly well all the acting was great the run time didnt bother me film making aspect of it was all great and what you expect from nolan

i just didnt find myself caring about oppenheimer at all i dont care about his love life or his relationships i dont care about the communist party aspect or how the world sees him or his legacy the most interesting thing about the movie to me is answering whether or not its morally correct to even create such a weapon and once thats covered the rest did not interest me at all suddenly it turns into a political thriller that i wasnt all that thrilled about somehow out of nowhere downey is the bad guy and the explanation of that felt rushed to me even in a 3 hour movie it was just random and didnt resonate with me i just didnt care

i guess i wanted something a little more fictitious that was just set around that part of history i thought it would have some more nolan flare and something more scifiesque would be happening but no its just a run of the mill biopic type movie

i didnt out right hate it and maybe i have to give it another shot later to see what i missed because apparently its fantastic and it just didnt scratch my itch

things i liked the bomb scene is immaculate super well done the visual and visceral ptsd depiction he felt after making it was great the stuff with the other scientists was great but too much on the love life and the political aspect turned me off his wifes big connecting weve been through fire together moment is that she helped him greive over the death of the chick he was  on the side insane to me lol

idk it was meh to fine i guess

nowhere near interstellar dunkirk memento the prestige and inception for me",2023-07-29 03:36:36
"absurdly overrated imo
knowing the physics history and having experience how such technical project is approached i couldn‘t name a single thing which was done well
character study after sitting in this movie for 3h i couldn‘t tell you anything about oppenheimer‘s character apart from some vague generalized guilt felt very superficial and onedimensional all the time",2023-08-07 09:32:42
"i was expecting an outstanding movie what i watched was a glorified 3 hour trailer 

interesting how my critique is downvoted but all the others aren’t  misogyny",2024-02-17 03:21:49
"i’m starting to feel like nolan is an excellent magician he’s so good at wrapping a product in an excellent package to manipulate you into thinking it’s good but once you unwrap the unnecessarily intricate packaging you find a fairly pedestrian product that can’t figure out what it is it’s like learning the secret behind a great magic trick a magic trick that was fairly disappointing to begin with there’s so much slight of hand to cover up his own weaknesses messing with the timeline to make you think about the story more than you really need to by forcing you to stitch things together as it goes on blowing through dialogue so you don’t realize how much of it is totally canned female characters that are played like cliche scenery rather than real people 

the time jumps make it feel like he’s ripping the pages out of a book and throwing them on the floor for you to read just for the sake of unnecessarily challenging the reader",2023-07-21 12:53:35
"it was a good movie and i enjoyed it however i feel like it was way too long some scenes were repeated 34 times where 2 would have sufficed i feel like this would have been a great miniseries but it just jams too much information i see why they needed to do the colour black and white distinction but its also jumping in time within the different times which makes it very confusing 

the directing acting effects were simply fantastic

"wow

im genuinely stunned  

i saw it in the 70mm

just so blown away by the scale of this film and the cast  when they say ensemble castthey mean it  i didnt know that half the people that were in it were going to be in it

it was beautiful it was riveting and they need to give all the oscars to murphy rdj and nolan",2023-07-21 23:30:32
"am i crazy for saying that the movie didn’t really have anything new or profound to say about the dangers of humans having nuclear warheads everyone is saying the ending scene hit so hard but we’ve known humanity having nuclear weapons was a mistake for decades  it’s a themesubject that’s been explored dozens of times in media already maybe that scene specifically was just supposed to be showing oppenheimer’s guilt over that fact but idk didn’t have the impact for me that it apparently had for some 

very good movie overall still but i didn’t find it as groundbreaking as some people here",2023-07-23 14:18:08
"it may be my favorite bomb explosion scene in a movie ever even more so considering it being all practical  

as someone very familiar with the history of oppenheimer im glad i heard about the color scenes being subjective  black and white being objective so that i didnt have to worry too much about inaccuracies  and to be fair they went above and beyond because sometimes the dialogue in color scenes was taken directly from what we know happened but because they changed the context somewhat or didnt want to have jarring transistions midscene if the followed it up with fiction they kept it in color   

i wish the sscene with truman was clearer ive always taken that interaction as truman getting mad because he thought oppenheimer saw themselves as equals and he wanted to put oppenheimer back in his place but the group i was with walked away thinking he was just trying to be a good leader and take the burden of guilt off oppenheimer  

also one of the prevailing messages of the movie which was subtle at times and somtimes less was the idea that being apolitical is in fact a political choice  oppenheimer truly seemed to want to make arguements to american politicians and the world at large after the war and just be like because science and logic and in the end he got crucified for not playing the political game  fast foward to covid and ppl literally injected themselves with horse dewormer instead of the crowning medical achievement of the millennium so far because scientists said trust the science to a country where 50 of the population couldnt pass middle school biology",2023-07-23 16:07:33
"i saw oppenheimer i’m a huge cosmologyquantum physics nerd so i was stoked to see this movie for months

great but not perfect trinity nuke test was awesome—the most hyped scene some of the special effects of oppy’s dreaming of quantum physics were cool too movie’s focus was highly on oppy’s communist ties and holes in los alamos’s security as well as oppy’s bomb test and regrets about building the bomb

i have some criticisms but only because my expectations were so high

nothing about why oppy and company liked socialismcommunism besides unionization if that’s the only reason then well ok nothing about how einstein also liked socialismcommunism probably didn’t want to  half of america trying to give the one valid defense of socialismcommunism that most americans will ever see in their entire lives

super duper quick explanations of quantum physics star fusion and supernova i’m talking 5 seconds on each tops no mention of e  mc² which its most prominent usage is in nuclear physics i’m not expecting an episode of cosmos but i doubt having a few extra seconds would’ve spoiled the movie’s pacing missed chance at some needed science education

nothing about oppy not winning the nobel prize although it’s implied it’s due to the witch hunt

nothing about oppy translating the bhagavad gita although oppy is shown reading sanskrit once plus the “i am become death” quote

didn’t walk around the trinity detonation site afterwards

los alamos appeared rather small given there were 6000 employees there irl

no louis slotin poking around at demon core nobody shown dying of radiation oppy’s nightmare sequence was pretty good but it about as “low budget” as it gets heck i don’t even think anyone dies on camera besides oppy’s gf

not much about oppy’s and heisenberg being friends prior to the war and heisenberg being recruited by the nazis

the 4th quarter with robert downey jr and the committee grilling oppy was too long just cut to the chase—“hehad communist sympathies he was apprehensive about the nuclear arms race he let the soviet spy slip and edward teller ratted him out guilty clearance revoked”

nothing about oppy’s dwindling health and weight loss during the course of the manhattan project

oppy’s communist gf committing suicide was kinda eh just thrown in there to give oppy another reason to cry red herring

hiroshima and nagasaki are never shown you see the cockpit of the ebola  for 5 seconds but that’s it stalin and ussr are also never shown my complaints are getting petty by now

i give it an 810 because of cillian murphy and how powerful some scenes were a director’s cut would be 910 it’s just a matter of adding or replacing a few necessary scenes i mean i get it i’m not expecting fluff like fully detailed scenes of hiroshima and nagasaki getting nuked because of time and money constraints but if it had it would’ve been  perfect think threads all over again

the closest movie to this one would be the jfk movie and how it was a past retelling of what happened before during after the jfk assassination except replace the assassination with the trinity test

an aside this movie was clearly meant for smart and privy viewers as it really went through lots of characters that i couldn’t fully follow and i even knew about oppy and friends beforehand so if the movie is operating under the assumption that the audience isn’t  then go for it tell us every gritty detail no need to dumb down the science or politics for the mainstream viewer

also this movie was rated r for… scenes and that’s it for a movie that culminates in the death of 140000 people it really doesn’t appear to be an rrated movie besides the aforementioned  scenes 

i know it’s a wall of text but we’re talking about the biggest budget science film in years so yeah i’m gonna get a bit passionate about it",2023-07-24 22:34:38
i think cillian murphy just gave an oscar winning masterclass on sublet acting,2023-07-25 22:57:10
"as my mom said its a movie id have to watch twice to really understand and shes right unless you already know the story which i didnt its hard to follow jumping between the 40s and 50s before giving the context of how they relate really  a lot of the movie for me like i might just be an idiot which is more then possible but i was very confused and it sounded like a lot of the people in my theatre were too

once i got the story in order it was a very enjoyable movie the cinematography and depth of most scenes were fantastic but the only gripes i have are the sexnudity scenes and the bomb the movie wasnt raunchy or romance filled or what ever the  50 shades of grey is like i dont even think there were any real light hearted moments so the  and nudity scenes felt very awkward and misplaced the bomb scene felt a lot like godzilla 2014 except in godzilla 2014 you see godzilla at the end instead theres a lot of upclose fire shots but they completely miss the staple of what an atomic bomb is and thats probably purposeful to focus on oppenheimer but at the same time id of much rather swapped the  scenes for a decent portrayal of the explosion the power the heat and the classic mushroom cloud

on a personal note i had family on three sides of the world war two conflict im lucky to be the mutt of japanese german and early american settler ancestry and that i had family fight for three of the four major powers in world war two and that my grandmother experienced nagasaki albeit from afar",2023-07-30 08:04:16
"best movie since covid to watch in a theater another masterpiece from nolan

the story timeline somewhat resembles godfather ii but it all happened to one single person the movie contains almost everything about the scientist not only his career and researches but also his ideology philosophy and personal life which are indispensable to his career achievement oppy can be described as a humanitarian with sympathy toward socialism despite making the most deadly weapon ever of human history he was a clean man compared to those making accuses based on jealousy or reputation laundering

about admiral strauss rdj this is arguably one of the most memorable villain on film in the decade at certain point he was portrayed as a reliable colleague or even friend and even oppy himself was deceived he deserves all the bw treatment throughout the film for a janusfaced character rdj deserves the oscar for best supporting actor next year

i wont type out spoilers here ill just give a few notes 

the oscar for best score goes to its still early but this

the amount of dread i felt through the first two hours almost brought me to tears i just i dont know how humans havent already destroyed the earth already i felt oppenheimer on all accounts this film will definitely stick with me 

emily blunt  rdj  matt damon  cillian murphy  all stars

it didnt feel like 3 hours to me but as hour 3 started i thought that would drag the movie down it did in some ways but the amount of rage i had toward truman rdj and all of the panelprosecutors in the room i honestly dont think an oppenheimer movie would be complete without that 3rd act 

inception is at the top of my list of nolan films i like everything else but inception man i love that movie i think this movie is going to hang up there at the top with it

"great movie christopher nolan has beautiful visual effects that are done without a lot of computer generated imagery sound design which is great fantastic acting and especially awesome performances by cillian murphy and robert downey junior

theres  also some really great ageing of the characters which really surprised me cant tell if it was cgi or prosthetics

theres also questions about the future of mass destruction in weapons but ultimately its a drama about the humans who create the mass destruction and their thoughts and feelings it could be seen as a pre cursor to artificial general intelligence or hypothetical research as to how it could happen

story is okay wasnt a massive fan of the dialogue but i think this movie requires multiple viewings to really understand it i could be wrong also the pacing was killing me maybe my attention span is in the bin but i really felt the length

and yes this is made for imax watch it on imax you will feel your seat rumble during the explosions and practical visual effects so worth it

"this movie is about oppenheimer and the reasons we don’t see the aftermath and destruction is because he was so naive he thought nuclear weapons were going to stop all wars hubris no cgi it’s from his point of view i think those were all choices artistic ones in service of telling the story of oppenheimer as a flawed human being

"overall i really enjoyed it but i think it was overwhelming in a way that made it hard to fully love 

i think it was kind of confusing to keep up with the dialogue is nonstop and especially in the first act it was moving so fast so many random names to keep track of across different timelines and in different accents with nolan’s infamous disregard for proper mixing so many characters popping in and out while im not entirely sure on who they were because they were introduced in the blink of an eye and with 25 of the dialogue being missed

i dont agree with the people who seem to think that it was boring or bad or disappointing

the movie is called oppenheimer of course it is mainly about him and his life the third act is important because it shows us how he has to deal with all the  and fallout from his creation most people knew him and that he made the bomb not very many people knew about the  his own government put him through afterwards

"my main gripe was the sheer number of names the audience had to keep up with i found myself struggling at times to remember who they referencing and the pace of the movie didnt help i get it that was the story but still could have been handled better

the last half hour felt rushed and a bit all over the place its almost as if they realized that the length was already substantial and just decided to up the already strong pace even further and speedrun it people have mentioned that scenes werent allowed to digest fully before moving on and i agree with that i felt like the test scene needed more time especially the blast and immediate aftermath the lack of a mushroom cloud was strange too considering how much of an icon it would become in the early cold war era

i enjoyed it but i wasnt blown away which is ironic considering the subject manner solid performances all around i liked damon as the disdainful military man who wanted results and nothing else id watch it if it was on tv but its not something id go out of my way to see again",2023-07-22 14:53:57

but as a nolan film it was good but not his best nothing beats inception or interstellar for me but undoubtedly an amazing movie nonetheless

but cilian and rdj just too good for words",2023-07-27 18:55:56
i was really into it the first hour but after that i got a little bored  maybe if it were focused on just one of the stories i would have enjoyed it more  as it was it just felt like it was meandering and there was no significant story arc  technically good but just didnt hold my interest,2023-07-28 02:21:49
"i watched the movie last night and i have to say i expected more  something of a schindlers list quality but instead it was an interesting movie with too many characters and a strange dialogue i found hard to follow additionally i was somehow uninvolved and uninvested in the stories of the characters the twist and reveal of the conversation with albert somehow didn’t matter that much to me as they wanted to 

i think that schindlers list is an appropriate comparison but the list was so much better makes you so invested in the characters and somehow has an universal message about the war and world in general i felt that was missing here",2023-07-31 15:06:08
"overall i really liked this movie a lot however there are definitely a few issues that drag it down the length being the biggest one of them the movie really began to drag toward the end imo still a great 810 movie though just not a masterpiece that many claim it is imo

i nearly fell asleep i probably enjoyed only 30 minutes of the 3 hours starting at before the bomb test then it lost me half way into the discrediting of him

and a solid 3 on entertainment value

i’ll never watch it again and i don’t really have any feelings on it i saw it cool

"its a pretty good moviegreat for history buffs science nerds and cilian fans great performances by all with rdj being the standout excellent cinematography by hoytema as usual great soundtrack too the movie was never dull despite its runtime thanks to the pacing

but  was some of the dialogue unbearable too expository too stilted and sometimes even cringey scientists dont talk that way to each other a lot of discussions were dumbed down way too much for the general audiences i think someone like sorkin wouldve done a better job and the name drops were quite insufferable especially john f kennedys at the end it was so unnatural the way they bring his name up over all the other senators who held out",2023-07-21 10:07:08
"it looks like im in the minority here but i thought this movie was painfully average there were a few striking moments and the last 4 or 5 minutes with oppenheimer and einstein was amazing

but there were a lot of moments that felt like they didnt reach their full potential for example the scene where oppenheimer is being applauded by everyone in the gymnasium wasnt nearly as good as it could have been i thought it was going to do something amazing when the womans flesh was being seared and then oppenheimer stumbled on the charred corpse but then he walks outside and some random dude is throwing up and then it ends it would have been more impactful if everyone in the audience was slowly disintegrating and everything was destroyed when he got outside or something else like that

i feel like the movie didnt give us enough of a reason to care about the relationship between oppenheimer and the politician that rdj played so developments in the last part of the movie  kind of fell flat for me also rdj had a horrible line of dialogue that made me laugh out loud in the theater something along the lines of he knew i would make him the most famous person in the history of the world",2023-07-21 22:33:41
"listen up nolan fanboys just because its nolan doesnt mean its good

the overarching story itself oppy vs strauss is interesting and downey is amazing but the journey to get there is a minefield of incredibly awkward and unnatural dialogue  at few points do two characters have an actual conversation as two human beings would  instead they exchange clipped exposition as quickly as possible and move on to the next scene  occasionally nolan will throw in a flashback to whomever the two characters are discussing  helpful but amateurish

nolan likes to bite off more than he can chew see interstellar tenet but someones got to reign him in for his next project

and  jack quaid was wasted in this film",2023-07-21 23:02:57

you gotta distinct when something is “boring” and “not for you” 

this is nolan’s best movie full stop in my eyes it felt like the culmination of everything nolan’s worked on up until this point and has the perfect premise to not drown itself in convoluted nonsense looking at you tenet

edit cillian deserves an oscar for this performance",2023-07-22 21:22:31
why are people here so  negative like its not even constructive criticism which would be fine its people legitimately not being able to comprehend that there could be a 3 hour long dialogue heavy movie yes people not every movie is action heavy some movies are slow burn and its just people talking idk what people were actually expecting lol that being said this was a fantastic movie albeit not flawless cillian murphy absolutely killed it,2023-07-23 07:05:58
"does anyone else feel like this movie executed one of the most successful social media marketing campaigns of all time to construct a narrative that this movie is a masterpiece  not just a masterpiece but one that must be viewed on the big screen and in 70 mm imax if possible

cillians performance was superb but the rest of the film was dull droning and forgettable  there was no reason to see this on a big screen  i waited for a month to be able to get a ticket to see it on 70 mm imax and the ticket was like 27  i  feel swindled and wish i just saw it in a standard theater for a fraction of the price  i cant remember a single scene in the movie that benefitted from the imax experience  maybe the gym scene with the stomping  in fact i think i would have enjoyed it more at home on a tv or laptop where i could take a break from the tedium of the film  im curious to see how people will remember this movie in a year or two",2023-08-21 19:12:20
apparently its just me but every scene was so over dramatic and then after ever piece of over dramatic dialog was delivered massive string instruments would start blaring and it went on for three hours meh it was a good movie the cast is stacked i wont be watching it again anytime soon,2023-07-21 04:51:40
i think i have realized that im just not a fan of christopher nolan anymore,2023-07-21 23:32:56
"equal parts great and frustrating the opening actfirst 45 mins is very rushed  much to the detriment of getting the audience invested with the characters outside oppenheimermurphy

people are lauding its sound design and i agree to an extent but the bulk of the films soundstage drowns out much of the dialogue in typical and frankly amateur nolan fashion

the biggest issue i have with this film though is emily blunt and matt damon feeling like miscasts i prefer when nolan didnt rely on hollywood names to sell his movie and instead used reputable names but in a way that gave a film a more unique experience like  ive seen matt damon and emily blunt in too many  blockbusters to give a  about their role in this movie

also im incredibly disappointed with nolan not pushing the envelope with the depiction on how the construction of the atomic bomb killed 250k innocent japanese civilians sure its talked about and you can sense some implicated remorse through murphys character and dialogue but the overall execution and almost complete dismissal of the significance of the only time we used atomic bombs on people the japanese would be like watching schindlers list without any of the gripping scenes of jewish brutality at the hands of the nazis that made the film so harrowing and engrossing instead we get political mind games and scheming that out stays its welcome

id give oppenheimer a 710

its good but nowhere near great",2023-07-21 23:55:50
a masterpiece my eyes were glued on the screen the music the cinematography the can you hear the music scene the way they keep cutting to different scenes the last scene where he was the pilot and seeing bombs flying over him this is the first time i rate something 1010 wow im even considering rewatching it again,2023-07-22 11:18:25
"that was the most tell dont show movie ive ever seen every single scene is an unending stream of characters explaining what they are doing and feeling in that moment

as you know i am from the xyz department and im here to get you to do something different

well as you and the xyz department know character the science tells us we must do it this way

what if we did it a third way as you know im from the abc division i thought a third way was possible

promising i know as you all know that this third way is significant we will go in that direction now

i cannot work with this new direction i am temperamental and also german as you know

i have a new science factoid

i knew that

any of these lines can be given to any character in any scene this never changes",2023-07-22 15:34:30
"just got out of the theater

i know im in the minority here but i did not give a  about the hearing stuff i feel like nolan had two visions for this film oppenheimers life and his reputation and they got smashed together in an ultralengthy way definitely couldve shaved an hour off the runtime in my view the film shouldve ended with the scene where hes giving the speech and hes imagining the bomb killing everyone in front of him and then he walks out and sees his colleagues cryingvomiting

nevertheless i really liked the movie excellent cinematography casting and acting and pacing of the first half the use of sound was very unique and the withholding of sound during the test sequence and speech scene were powerful my whole theater which laughed and commented a lot was dead silent during these scenes 810",2023-07-23 05:02:36
"theres a grear movie in there but i dont feel like it was found and so we get an overly long good movie 

its nice to know i wasnt the only one with sound issues theres times background footsteps drown out dialogue the echoing effect of microphones and some rooms with a score that was over balanced just didnt work for me

i bet most audience members cant name 5 nonobvious only about three obvious ones characters even though there are two dozen

once again timeline  was just confusing and unnecessary 

for a biopic it needed to focus on a vertical and never does its becoming a theme from the nolans for me to open interesting lines and never fully explore or comment on them

score was brilliant but over mixed visuals were fantastic performances were impeccable 

i thought there was a better film beneath what we got and an ever better one that could have been written",2023-07-24 06:45:45
"call me a big dumb nerdy man if you want but personally i was much more interested in the splitting of the atom creating the most destructive bomb in human history and winning world war 2 than i was in mccarthyism and the human drama behind how oppenheimer didnt have his security clearance renewed

also no really impressive visuals whatsoever the test and the actual atom splitting were big disappointments for me

i think this film was a bit of a let down in multiple ways

acting was great ofc but then with damon cillian murphy blunt rdj etc there was no danger of that dialogue got on my nerves at times some of the faux profound one liners seemed a bit ham 

also i know its an artistic thing some directors like but i hate when the soundtrack is louder than the dialogue and bloody black and white for me it just makes it more difficult to watch",2023-07-24 08:36:14
"im very conflicted on the movie on the one hand i think i liked it but the more i actually think about it the more bad things spring to mind 

i saw someone mention that the first 2 hours of the movie felt like a really long trailer and i cant help but think thats really accurate the movie is just constantly bashing you over the head with cuts more and more dialogue intense blaring music trying to tell you whats happening on screen is actually really insightful and a constant sense of smug selfimportance during the third act of the film there is a long winded section where actors are just explaining the plot to eachother mostly when strauss and his aide are discussing the situation with loud horns in the background for 20 minutes 

like many others have said the trinity explosion was underwhelming 

the development of the atomic bomb and the technical trials of the manhattan project could have used some more attention everytime i see someone mention this the response is well this isnt a movie about the manhattan project im sorry but it is or rather it is if you can believe the marketing stop telling people that they are shallow if they are going to this movie expecting it to focus more on the development of the atomic bomb the development of the atomic bomb was the focal point of oppenheimers life and i feel it should have been focussed on more rather than the loss of his security clearance 

i also wasnt a fan of how einstein was used it feels like he was a marvel hero making cameos the whole time that scene where the car drives out of view to reveal einstein standing behind it in particular  i was expecting the avengers theme to start blaring every time he came on screen  

another thing i didnt like is how the physics were portrayed in the movie i dont mean the physics of the bomb i mean the actual physics behind the development there is a scene early on where oppenheimer explains quantum mechanics to a single student he mentions that quantum mechanics is paradoxical this cannot be but it is thats quantum mechanics or something along those lines then he starts writing a few formulae on the blackboard and you see the student smile with a look of holy  this man is a genius that is not how physics works you dont just sit around a table say quantum mechanics is crazy yall and frantically start writing stuff on a blackboard i get that its difficult to make a subject like this interesting for the big screen but this is just not how science works same with the scene in the start where they ask oppenheimer if he hears the music science chemistry and physics are not like that its not something that you just feel and improvise through its study math more study and more math i do research not exactly into quantum mechanics or anything like that i mostly work on new treatment techniques for pollution and i have published papers so anytime i see science portrayed like this it feels almost insulting im sorry but if you are bad at math you cant compensate for that by just feeling the physics or something like that 

speaking of blaring the soundtrack is good but very overused there were a lot of dry dialogue scenes that they tried to spice up by putting very intense music over it which feels rather cheap 

overall writing it out like this i think i did not like the movie much it felt very pretentious as though its riding on the clout of being about oppenheimer the entire time the movie is huffing its own farts about how artsy it is and even writing critisism like this i expect someone to tell me im just too  to understand the utter brilliance that is oppenheimer",2023-07-25 11:01:42
"the movie felt simultaneously fastpaced and super slow drag 

the dialogue moved quickly and if you missed a few lineswords you end up confused the constant time jumps were hard to follow at times but also the movie felt like it couldve benefited from being about 45 minutes shorter they didnt need to dedicate all that time in the 2nd half for the court proceedings

overall i give it a 510 there were some elements i really liked namely the 1st half of the movie and the scenes portraying the emotional turmoil oppenheimer was going through due to making this bomb the 2nd half and parts of the 1st half were such a boring drag though like we get it he had close familyfriends that were in the communist party but he is not a traitor",2023-07-26 11:52:54
i am shocked to jump into this thread and see mostly critical comments this movie hit me like a truck 5 stars,2023-07-27 23:07:03
"saw it last night i know i was meant to like the film but i just didnt reasons

 slow start
 editing  very quick scenes darting from one to another and at different times got confusing
 very heavy on the dialogue which was hampered by the incessant musicscore in the background
 boring plots  i really didnt care much for the delay in the security clearance or the inquisition oppenheimer received about his connection with communists
 not enough detail about the development of the bomb and the difficulties they faced building it

anyway just my opinion please dont be upset if you disagree",2023-07-28 05:33:30
"i feel like if we could compare this to another film it would the imitation game and that was a far better film than this this movie felt so different over dramatic for all the wrong reasons we barely spent anytime with any character that it felt hard to understand what anyone’s motives were was his wife an alcoholic adulterer who regretted marrying robert yet later she’s defending him and getting mad he’s not defending himself she’s only shown being a massive  to the point i wondered why they are married

the story is also hard to follow if you don’t have prior knowledge of what is happening with all the communist stuff and security issues i had to watch an explanation video after walking out of the theatre to even understand the ending 

also the  scenes were painfully cringe and i can imagine nolan sniffing his own farts as he films them sat  in the hotel or having  in the interview room for no reason “and then she stops having  with him to walk over to the book shelf pull out a random book that has the film quote it in brap sniffff oh  i’m good”",2023-07-29 18:53:21
"ive been trying to figure out how to describe it after just walking outt at first impressionistic came to mind but its too muscular and aggressive for that ive landed on dialectical this is what i imagine eisenstein would do with 100m if he were alive though carl dreyer seems in their too with the number of cillian murphy closeups in full frame

its a thoroughly exhausting film both intellectually and physically  but rhythmic tension only goes so far and at a certain point dissipates if it keeps going on i wasnt immediately a fan of dunkirk but on my second viewing i got in sync with it and now i think that film is a masterpiece i guess the same could happen with oppenheimer but it seems unlikely the rhythmic experimentation is just hard to sustain for 3 hours of tension",2023-07-30 05:46:23
"i felt like i was watching a three hour long trailer 
the way the scenes were succeeding each other jumping in time or place a bit too often and music in the background all the time

the movie was beautiful and the music amazing but i felt like i was watching a trailer",2023-07-30 19:21:04
i am sorry for anyone who paid extra to watch this movie in imax,2023-11-14 03:17:50
"i’m feeling a 610 at best on this one i’m generally a big nolan fan too but i think this is his worst film honestly 

really meandering pace the time skipping cuts are bordering on confusing dialogue generally forgettable movie somehow drags at the last 3045 mins which was the most interesting part 

genuinely think the script was just bad i thought that despite the insane cast that all the actors were underutilized and forgettable murphy gives a good performance as oppenheimer but he’s characterized in so many different ways in this film it’s pretty strange 

he doesn’t seem to have a consistent personality or way he acts besides being aloof a lot of the time and not in an interesting way his familial relationship is implied to be  but his wife only exists to act exasperated and crazy while being a housewife stereotype pretty weak imo 

just overall not compelling whatsoever to me big nolan fan but i think a 6 is generous on this one",2023-07-21 02:47:21
"my thoughts

1 the story is kind of disjointed there are two plot arcs  the creation of the bomb and the changing public perspective on oppenheimer the creation of the bomb arc is great the politicking arc is… weak the stakes aren’t properly laid out ie why is oppie losing his security clearance such a devastating blow why is it even beneficial for strauss to put effort into destroying oppies reputation

2 along those lines there were some weaknesses in the plot development the first 45 minutes seems to suggest strauss is having to defend himself for having a positive relationship with oppenheimer… then suddenly the tables turn and hill the apparently sole witness that testified against strauss… where the  was he all movie sure he poked his head up once or twice but for such a minor character to be the sole downfall of strauss seemed silly

the heel turn by strauss’ aide is also rather absurd

and generally strauss was a  “villain” if 15 minutes of exposition at the end of the movie is required to explain a bad guys motives he’s a poorly written bad guy and that’s exactly what we got

3 the entire third act just drags way too much exposition way too much “finishing scenes from earlier but with an unexpected twist”

4 i’ve already whined about it with strauss but character development the wife kitty goes from being a useless  that he’s stuck with because he knocked her up to being the most badass character in the final 30 minutes there was almost nothing to support her sudden attitude shift in the hearing scene 

5 man the whole security clearance thing just bugs me oppenheimer is the head of the manhattan project months into development already has los alamos built and has assembled his team… and he doesn’t have clearance yet i don’t know the historical accuracy of that but it seems like some creative liberty to add to the drama but it makes all the drama about him losing security clearance at a time he’s apparently no longer involved in the aec even sillier 

i dunno i give it like a 610 because i saw it on imax i think a home viewing would be a 410

i think the movie would have been much better served by focusing on the making of the bomb or on oppenheimers public perception and internal turmoil regarding the making of the bomb

also a quick perusal of the google and imdb reviews suggests to me one of the most overwhelming bot campaigns to fluff a movie i’ve ever seen just pages and pages of chatgpt responses to “write a positive review about oppenheimer” regurgitating the same buzz words over and over",2023-07-21 13:57:04
"this was boring and way longer than need be

i guess i foolishly assumed that the bomb manhattan project and ww2 would be the main foci of this movie not oppenheimer’s love life or a meeting in the mid50s about renewing his security clearance i also don’t think there was any reason for a nonlinear narrative 

the movie was super interesting for 10 minutes then boring for 25 then interesting for 10 boring for 25 and so on for 3 hours all in all makes for a lessthaninteresting film",2023-07-25 11:03:13
"i cant help but think this is a missed opportunity

i thought thered be a twist or at least a sharp deviation from established historyscience like the interstellar bookcase

when it became clear that it was instead essentially just a well acted dramatization i thought theyd lean into the messaging more and use the opportunity to share en masse with a general population that the prospect of nuclear war is terrifying and that it is not an abstract concept the explosion alone was clearly supposed to do that but frankly it wasnt enough  were completely numbed to blockbuster explosions it didnt feel any more real than any other cinema explosion they should have doubled down on his paranoia and shown us explicitly the effects of these things they barely scratched the surface with what we did get

i enjoyed it for what it was but im not sure id recommend this to anybody really

edit alright guys i get it i had a pretty sizable preexisting interest in this particular subject area so maybe i just let my expectations get too high it just wasnt made for me and thats fine",2023-07-21 14:25:50
"this is easily one of the most overhyped films i’ve seen in a very long time 

no cgishooting on imax cameras was completely unnecessary 70mm film sure why not due to this being a timepiece with black and white shots 

the amount of star power was distracting i love how nolan somehow chooses the perfect actor for certain roles this thing threw every known actor they could find on it just for the sake of it oldman as truman really 

musical score was very underwhelming every time i leave a nolan film the score sticks to me not this time too busy trying to decipher what they’re saying to appreciate the music since it’s a  3 hour movie with 90 of it being pure dialogue 

playing with the timelines doesn’t work for a film like this imo i shouldn’t have to do homework before i watch a film to fully enjoy it if you don’t know a brief background on oppenheimer before watching this you’re going to be lost by the time you figure things out you’re kind of bored by the film 

the only true positives for me were cilian murphy and robert downey jr acting their  off i feel damon has already played this exact same character in another movie 

rewatching in hopes to enjoy it more the second time since i’m a massive nolan fan",2023-07-27 12:21:01
scrolling through this thread is so great because someone will write a very articulate thoughtful comment on why this movie didn’t work for them and then a swarm of nolan fanboys will swarm in and say “not enough explosions for you go back to tic tok” you people are the worst,2023-07-22 15:58:52
unpopular opinion oppenheimer was okay and people are afraid to jump off the bandwagon and say how they really feel it was good but not great people are raving about how this is the greatest movie of all time and “you gotta see it in imax” i think this movie was way overhyped and people are afraid to go back on it now 6510,2023-07-26 20:10:35
"i really enjoyed the movie for the most part but i do have a couple of nitpicks 

1 the  scenes are very  and awkward maybe that was nolan’s intention but i certainly didn’t enjoy those scenes they felt very cheap and unnecessary 

2 the cast is too bloated several of the characters are easily forgettable and serve no significant purpose to the story 

3 would have preferred a tighter runtime could’ve been 3040 minutes shorter

still a great movie and worth seeing though",2023-07-22 02:51:48
"the  that was tenet just prepared nolan for the seamless and masterful shifting between timeiines in oppenheimer

who knew physicists and congressional hearings could be so unrelentingly tense and gripping",2023-07-22 05:27:37
"i was expecting more of a visual spectacle so was slightly disappointed 
i also thought the  scenes were not needed",2023-07-22 21:39:18
"i am in total awe of this film the silence during the trinity detonation and in the theater audience was so defeating i heard was the sound of my heart beating of my chest what i feel the film did best was captured all the differing viewpoints equally both of oppenheimer and his creation even truman with his brief scene is made clear to the audience his assessment of oppenheimer’s moral unease truman believed since he ordered the mission he was the one who should bare the weight

the cast was without a weak link praise will be sung for cillian murphy emily blunt matt damon but my  was rdj’s senator straus one utterly contemptible vindictive  let this film be shown to anyone who feared rdj’s craft was dulled by the mcu robert downey jr took no prisoners in this film

with dunkirk nolan captured that race against clock anxiety but with oppenheimer an albatross has been set over all of our head and the powerless anxiety knowing all that keeps it in place is level heads but also ironically a devastation so overpowering it can only destroy us all 

what a truly amazing film",2023-07-23 04:58:20
came out feeling a bit let down and confused will need to rewatch again with subtitles it felt like nolan is just throwing random  at you at the beginning then tries to tie everything together as the movie goes on which could be brilliant but not a good firsttime watching experience im sure ill appreciate it more after a 2nd viewing with subtitles,2023-07-23 08:45:38
robert downey jr was great but when they ended the movie by testing the bomb on an oddly pink plasticlooking city was strange and didnt feel quite historically accurate,2023-07-24 01:01:23
excellent movie but i really don’t understand the hype to see it in imax after watching it,2023-07-26 16:13:44
casey affleck was incredibly menacing in his role there are so many amazing performances but his really stuck with me,2023-07-27 18:18:01
great movie could’ve been 30 minutes shorter,2023-07-29 18:58:46
it was good but i don’t get the obsession,2023-07-30 23:39:40
despite the last 3rd of the movie being mostly dialogue i was 100 engrossed  i felt that all of the emotions of this complex man and his circle of colleaguesfriendsfamily were portrayed beautifully,2023-07-21 13:32:39
i overall liked it but in typical nolan fashion his nonlinear storytelling confused me when exactly does strauss’ and oppy’s relationship begin is it the round table meeting when “russia fired the starting gun” also what exactly happened at the isotopes hearing when he embarrassed strauss i didn’t understand the stakes of that,2023-07-21 14:27:28
just got back from a 70mm showing absolutely adored it for a three hour movie it never felt like overlong in the slightest great acting sharp script amazing cinematography and godlike sound probably my favorite nolan film,2023-07-21 21:12:12
nolan so perfectly conveyed the emotions the suspensethe fear involved in the making of the atom bomb oppenheimers  inner chaos is so masterfully displayed his internal struggles is palpable  we get to be in his shoes its one of the most important story of all of mankind,2023-07-21 23:22:28
"the first 2 acts is the best film of the 2020s the 3rd act is still good but nowhere near the level of the others 

still nolans best most complete film since inception",2023-07-22 01:49:23
man nolan just has such a good way of visualizing the abstract that i love so much fission reaction the neutrons colliding all of it so interesting that even tho i don’t get it i feel it so viscerally,2023-07-22 02:58:24
"this film was a lot to take in i’ll see it again shortly but for now even including memento i think this is nolan’s most artsy film to date i’m sure i’ll think about this movie a lot in the next months

edit standout actors other than murphy rdj blunt and pugh are josh hartnett david krumholtz and macon blair tom conti is an honorable mention

edit 2 i thought for sure the film is going to have an end title card stating that oppenheimer’s name has been cleared last year instead it ends with that shot i really think this is peak nolan",2023-07-22 05:18:42
jaws made us scared of sharks oppenheimer made us scared of nukes again,2023-07-22 08:03:42
great soundtrack as expected but the first half at times felt over done with quick editing bits and overlapping story telling to keep things interesting second half with the bomb was obviously greatbut the movie continued after wards in the same way as the first half which slightly made the ending annoying for me performaces from all actors were great still overall it performed lower than my expectations,2023-07-22 17:11:09
"incredible film full stop 

my only critique is that some of the references were a bit on the nose such as kennedy being mentioned as one of the voters against that took me out of it but i am also someone who is a history major so thats probably more of a me issue",2023-07-22 23:49:59
can someone please explain to me why this movie is doing so well genuinely curious i went to the movie and really enjoyed it and thought it was really well done but that said there are many wellmade movies and there are some great movies about history and they dont perform like this at all i know that its directed by christopher nolan but still every show time every day for days is almost completely booked which i cant remember ever seeing for anything the parking lots at my theater has overflow lots that ive never seen full that are completely packed with cars what exactly is the draw to the general masses that dont turn out like this for other movies im genuinely confused,2023-07-23 03:40:59
"loved the story felt so engrossing and the moral dilemmas and conflicting notions of a deeply flawed man are so well potrayed by murphy

however the real show catcher was rdjs strauss who i believe can be anyone of us always having to be sidelined looked at with contempt by men who supposedly have been given some great curse of intelligence men who have to bear with us normal folks men who assume that they have a greater say in what is moral and what is not

however not a great adaptation of a fantastic book too many parallel storylines going on at the same time especially in the first half nolan loves to overdo it with time its like he cant accept anything being a linear story clearly here that would have been the better approach",2023-07-23 17:12:56
don’t know why people are hating oppenheimer because shock horror it actually focuses on oppenheimer,2023-07-24 07:38:32
soundmusicsilence was used so powerfully throughout,2023-07-24 13:14:07
"i drove hours to the only analog 70mm imax in the pnw and was not disappointed 

i was going in wondering how nolan would incorporate his usual action packed scenes into a story with the peak being the trinity test i left with a greater understanding of the emotions felt by all involved and im glad it wasnt a jumpcut action film 

the trinity test was slightly underwhelming visually and could have benefited from cgi in my opinion that was easily made up for by the phenomenal audio experience the composition was amazing and the explosions were earth shattering through the analog system at the theater 

the only time i was taken out of the movie was in the scene where the ladys skin was being melted off it looked fake and reminded me of that scene from the office where dwight puts the mannequins face on his 

overall amazing cinematography and phenomenal audio the denouement was a little ambiguous but the actors told the story well 

810 in my opinion below interstellar and inception above tenet the prestige and the dark night",2023-07-24 21:22:21
seeing robert downey jrs scenes in the third act i wish he would have been cast as joker his  performance during the trial was so tense,2023-07-25 03:58:56
fantastic movie some of the best acting i think ive ever seen in a movie before scenes that were supposed to induce tension definitely did through the sudden noise and lack of noise making me paranoid when the loud bang would come and expert buildup of said scenes to not seem like im gushing it took me two watches in order to completely understand the story and especially the trial scenes dont feel bad if you dont understand how to connect the dots during your first view i can see how multiple viewings can be a drawback for people but i was planning on seeing the movie again anyway for some reason the format and editing and pacing just all resonated with me in a way that makes me want to watch it several more times with all the hype of how disturbing it is i was a little disappointed not walking out with any kind of dread that even people i saw the movie with felt also i personally dont think imax is as big of an upgrade as its made out to be it was a good experience for sure but just going to a good quality theatre was perfectly fine too which i did for my second watch to compare it to my first imax viewing people would get mad at me and call me a bot for giving it a 1010 which is how i personally feel about it so ill give it an 8910 due to how subjective certain aspects like pacing and format can be for an average viewer besides myself,2023-07-25 04:56:11
if the practical effects look worse and less historically accurate then what cgi could have accomplished whats the point,2023-07-25 13:31:05
my movie clapped when the nicole kidman commercial started,2023-07-28 16:53:53

why was teller back for the trinity test after he quit,2023-08-13 19:42:03
such a boring movie  it took me 6 days to complete it,2024-03-10 08:59:14
it was an ok movie my two major complaints are that it focused way too much on the trial and the whole national securitycommie spy angle which was a big distraction from the actual interesting topics of nuclear energyweaponsphysicstechnologymorality the national security aspect was also quite predictable and boring the other complaint is that the trinity test in the movie was very underwhelming and looked nothing like the actual trinity test  and did not capture the scale of an atomic explosion,2023-07-21 02:34:24
that was a bad movie the actors were great but the storytelling was terrible i couldn’t hear half the dialogue cause of the ambiance music l the story was too disjointed and i had no idea what or who some people were at certain parts did not enjoy,2023-07-22 15:31:16
"puritanical filmmaking so much was made of nolan’s refusal to use cgi for his explosion that i think he forgot there are other ingenious ways of making films without cgi i’ve seen bigger and better explosions in the opening credits of the ateam after that we had to sit through 2 hours of supposedly caring if oppenheimer got his security clearance renewed we’re we supposed to care nolan singularly failed to make me care he tried though by dumping free youtube action music over otherwise utterly dull conversations
and why was imax so important nolan doesn’t even seem to care if his shots are lit nicely so why would i care how big it is

5810",2023-07-22 15:38:09
anybody thought the bomb scene was super underwhelming,2023-07-24 05:39:45
"anyone who is planning to watch this should know what they are getting into this movie is all about politics and a court case there is not much science los alamos and the trinity test just take up minor screentime in the movie

the trailer makes the movie out to be some thriller where they are racing against the nazis to make the bomb and its a life and death situation they need to build the bomb to end the war but they dont know if the bomb will destroy the world super high stakes but i kid you not 80 of the movie revolves around a boardroom and courtcase

my favourite part of the movie by far was building up los alamosteam and the trinity test even the trinity test felt abit anti climatic the blast didnt feel epic maybe a bit of cgi wouldve helped here was hoping to see more science of building the bomb the technical issues they had the fear they had whether it will work or not the fear whether they will blow up the whole world etc

the final hour of the movie was the biggest issue imagine going from the high stakes tension of the trinity test to a one hour court case where the only thing on the line was whether oppenheimer would lose his security clearance thats right the entire tension of the last hour was about a security clearance 

like others have said the acting was amazing but the movie is letdown by the storytelling

i love nolan interstellar and inception are top 10 movies of all time for me but this movie was not good imo",2023-08-02 23:50:14
"not a nolan fan but this was his best film that being said i still put it as a 710 maybe 75

the cons

 way too bloated could easily cut 4550 minutes out particularly in the first hour and the last too much time with rdjs character and the whole thing with oppy possible losing his security clearance

 dialogue was better than most nolan stuff but still pretty bad too many exposition scenes too many cute comments from the characters and way too many references to earlier lines from the movie

the meh

 the acting for the most part was fine nothing terrible nothing that impressive

the pros

 cillian murphy was phenomenal absolute perfection start to finish

 the middle of the movie was incredibly strong firing on all cylinders

 they 100 nailed the test scene maybe the best 1015 minutes of nolans career

 the last 5 minutes or so was perfect

x200b

overall very good but typical nolan cant get out of his own way 
x200b

ultimately a solid matchup but barbie wins barbienheimer",2023-08-07 03:49:47
what a mess of a movie i had high hopes and turns out it not only did it not live up to the hype but it was a miserable slog to endure had 10 minutes left in the movie and couldn’t take anymore acting was pretty cheesy too,2023-11-24 23:13:03
"it was an alright movie 710 the worst of it was the time jumping you’ll be in one year then all of a sudden you’re 5 years later talking about something else then you’re back again then the explosion they finally showed was so lackluster and underwhelming if you’ve seen these explosions on old film you can tell what they did was just a gasoline explosion they shouldn’t have done full practical with this it should have been mostly cgi they didn’t show anything of the hiroshima and nagasaki bombings i’m guessing he was trying to be tasteful but all you get are imagined screams and a ashened body and a white girl with her face peeling

edit i’ll mention i didn’t get to see the film in imax or fake imax just regular theater it may be way better on it as far i described",2023-07-21 10:03:16
mid,2023-07-21 16:02:04
movie was too long and it was definitely overhyped take out rdj scenes and end it soon after oppenheimer realizes that he made a severe mistake creating the atomic bomb and the movie will be an alright film nolan peaked with interstellar it seems ,2023-07-22 04:12:16
"i really dont what to make of people that are calling this a 910  or one of the best movie going experiences of their life

edit  this is not a 90 movie boring bad pacing confusing editing i frequently didnt like the sound not captivating too long utter disappointment with how the explosions are handled hard to understand dialog at points completely glossed over the physics and physicists every time equations are shown its for less than a second instead we get multiple  scenes 

after the nuclear explosion the audience gets blue balled for any more visual displays of the consequences or power of the bomb asides from a handful of hallucinations instead the movie stretches on for an hour of some literal who wanting to maintain some political position with some petty grudge and op losing his security clearance which it didnt even seem like he even cared about keeping this is all pertinent to include in a biopic but i think the only reason this got highlighted is because of rdj too much time going back and forth and back and forth over whether he was a commie

the reviews are polarizing and i feel like some people like it by default or they feel theyre supposed to appreciate it for being cinematic",2023-07-24 04:01:22
"it was alright considering the fact that it was 3 hours i would have preferred to see less  and more bomb

we got like 15 seconds of them making the actual bomb which is the most fascinating thing to me

they talked way too much about making the bomb and did not show enough of how they made the bomb

also the explosion itself was pretty meh probably due to it being practical i know that the real one wasnt that big either but its a movie and that looked like they lit a big puddle of gasoline on fire",2023-08-04 18:27:03
" best nolan film since inception for me absolute masterpiece

 casting pvt joker and the reference to jung made me think of full metal jacket there is probably no one who encapsulated the duality of man more than oppenheimer

 robert downey jr was excellent as was the entire ensemble

 the film didnt feel like it was 3 hours long despite being dialogue heavy it was extremely engrossing",2023-07-21 02:51:00
"there was very little moralizing anyone in the film despite potentially oppenheimer at the end are we meant to feel bad for him i’m trying to understand the conversation between him and einstein at the end where einstein basically says he left his own country it’s okay for you to do that too but then oppy loses his security clearance and… seemingly doesn’t leave the country what happened to him after again are we meant to feel bad for him 

maybe these are the questions nolan wants us asking but i’m trying to understand if strauss was just a selfrighteous  trying to get back at oppy or what i didn’t expect that feud to consume the whole back third of the movie",2023-07-21 03:02:57

"still collecting a lot of thoughts but basically

 cillian murphy best actor nom
 rdj best supporting win this is the best thing i’ve ever seen from him the whole scene tearing into oppenheimer for his martyrdom what electric 
 david krumholtz had big alfred molina energy he was awesome 
 the  parade of cameos so many that it was insane gary oldman as truman broke me 
 the final moments with oppenheimer and einstein are the movie the whole last hour really but that final bit made this movie one of nolan’s best
 once again nolan let’s down women in his movie but blunt and pugh excelled at what they had 
 the thematic beauty of the mutually assured destruction of oppenheimer and strauss a cold war leading to the end of their careers over pure pettiness 
 see it in 70mm or the biggest avalible screen possible with the best sound the bomb wasn’t even the most intense moment of the movie the  auditorium scene is haunting 
 the scene with the secretary of defense james remar another wild cameo spoke  volumes that whole desperate justification for the nuke when japan was on the verge of surrender 
 florence pugh that is all",2023-07-21 06:55:15

i watched without subtitleswill i get more immersed with subtitles in my next watch,2023-07-21 14:50:47
this movie did a really good job of portraying true genius just how completely different the way a person like oppenheimer or einstein thinks i felt transported into higher academia and felt the stakes of what they were accomplishing in the classroom as truly as what they were accomplishing in los alamos,2023-07-21 16:22:28
lots of good feedback for the acting namely rdj murphy and blunt but was very impressed with josh hartnett,2023-07-21 18:26:23

"straws was portrayed as the one who unjustly defamed oppenheimer which i found inappropriate when oppenheimer openly expressed his regrets regarding the use of atomic bombs his words gained global attention and led to criticisms aimed at the usa in an attempt to prevent further blame on the us government they tried to silence his views by labeling him as a soviet sympathizer and later paradoxically awarded him a medal

nolan may have been hesitant to reveal the genuine reality in fear of potential repercussions from both the general public and the us government which the movie could possibly encounter",2023-07-21 21:38:17
what was the artistic purpose of certain scenes being in black and white,2023-07-21 23:29:25
i wish they had touched on oppenheimers childhood i know it wouldnt necessarily have fit easily into the format but i think the context would have been nice i also wasnt that crazy about the format in general there was a little too much bouncing around imo and i disliked scenes being repeated i understand for some of them why it was done but it felt like they recycled about 15 minutes of clips overall i liked it but probably wont rewatch i think it could get repetitive or difficult to follow for people without background knowledgeinterest,2023-07-22 04:54:22
"maybe a top 3 nolan movie score which is saying a lot considering zimmer arguably the greatest working film composer has done 7 of them

overall a really tight movie 3 hours that felt long and short at the same time some incredible work from nolan with a few career high shots absolutely incredible acting from the entire cast with a few standouts rdj blunt

feels to me like it’ll land in the top half of peoples nolan movie rankings but probably in the bottom half of that with the caveat of “it’s just too hard to pick”",2023-07-22 07:47:26
"the practical effects were mostly neat but i think some cgi could have worked better not for the test just earlier broll visuals

i remember nolan early on in the press tours for this film mention that its important that oppenheimers story be told and it sparked some sort of is he being too left wing debate on social media i think that the real magic of this film is what it gives and what it wants to give but couldnt it gives entertainment rich history a judicious retell of a scientists life and the existential burden that comes with knowing what it wants to give but couldnt is a movement for people who know the truth it is so difficult these days to get out there and spark action to the ordinary individual because these days only people in power have the means to scientists can tell us over and over and over about the drastic effects of climate change of nuclear weapons etc on mankind today and for our children but at the end of the day it will all be reduced to political interests sucks to see how it has panned out before and how it hasnt changed much today,2023-07-22 18:54:16

but i felt like there were two different amazing films or films i’d enjoy more in here and the film as it stands never hit the heights either could have 

i also felt like the film was oddly shallow given the subject matter the bomb took up a lot of space in the movie but i never felt like the movie sustainedly and seriously grappled with it  even when the movie was telling me that’s what it was doing 

it was still great and everyone was giving a stellar performance",2023-07-22 21:33:49

i have been seeing so much hype around when kitty was saying 16 17 no 18 years during the  hearing this may be a dumb question but what was the point of this was she just trying to be snarky to the guy or what i want to understand if there was underlying meaning i missed or if people just thought she was being bad ,2023-07-23 20:46:02
"i generally really liked it it was like reverse tenet like tenet was so all over the place but still so enjoyable for what it was whereas oppenheimer was pretty straight forward and vanilla for nolan 

my only legit criticisms because everything else is either good to great 

1 they could have easily shaved off 20 minutes and it would have been fine 

2 i would have liked to see nolan get a little more creative on his story structure 

3 some of the procedural stuff could have been edited to be a little more clear

4 i would have liked a little more explanation of certain elements that werent obvious like the huge difference between hydrogen bombs vs the smaller yield fission bombs not knowing a detail like that can cause folks to not quite grasp his adamant opposition to them

everything else was just quite lovely fantastic performance by murphy and really the entire cast was good good camerawork great sound design good music well written dialog a good message and meditation on a heavy existential topic without getting overly preachy 

8810 i dont want to rush off and see it again right now like i did with interstellar or dark knight but it was good on par with other solid nolan flicks",2023-07-24 02:31:19
"i thought oppenheimer presented an interesting take on the great man archetype thats been ubiquitous throughout all of american film history think citizen kane the godfather or there will be blood the more the men in those films thirst for and accumulate power and wealth the more corrupt and depraved and robotic they become oppenheimer reaches the pinnacle of his field but instead of pushing for never ending growth in it pushing for the creation he helped steward into reality to more readily available for warfare to be pushing for more powerful atomic bombs or to his later misfortune a hydrogen bomb instead he speaks his conscience whatever it may have been at that moment and of his guilt in a sense nolan has taken a story about the 20th century and made it about the 21st about a man without strong convictions or beliefs who pushes the technological envelope to its breaking point and is forced to deal with the fall out by attempting to mitigate the completely foreseeable consequences of his creation after its too late essentially oppenheimer does the opposite of the characters in those other movies but the end result is the same he has won but at what cost

i thought it was very engaging quickest three hours i can remember in a theatre what is with the music in these films though so loud the musical cues in all quiet last year almost ruined the movie for me and that was at home",2023-07-24 03:59:24

"really enjoyed the seamless transitions between people talking in different time periods and places oppo would be talking to one physicist then the camera would flip back and he would be discussing with someone else especially done well in the board room interview scenes 

the one part i didnt like but knew was coming was when things started to get real tense in the board room and it climaxed to something like the bomb going off that felt pretty cliche and at that point the movie was already long but overall one of the best biopics ive ever seen",2023-07-24 13:09:28

screwup  i’m almost positive that in one of the scenes where large numbers of those working on the bomb gathered to meet or celebrate there was a basketball backboard no doubt it was part of the recreation available in los alamos but the backboard was not the rectangular design but the fan version having played since a kid in the 1950s til the present the fan was not something that existed in the 1940s obviously if i am right there is reason to question everything else eg did oppenheimer exist was there a bomb ,2023-07-25 15:10:15

immediately wanted to rewatch the whole movie hoping for another viewing in imax

minor complaints 
the final act kinda drags a bit anyone and everyone having to put in their statements

do wish nolan would have been more explicit in the brutality when they are showing the slides of the aftermath 

concerning actors
rami malik pursing his lips again i loved him in mr robot and night at the museum saw highlights and his mouth seems relax it started with bohemian rhapsody did enjoy the movie

but ever since br he is like always doing blue steel le tigre magnum mouth did br  up his mouth or does he have a condition

on some level i like casey affleck but i can never buy him as a tough as nails dude if anything i think of him as the weasely brother from oceans trilogy",2023-07-26 03:55:31
was a little discouraged going in to see this tonight a lot of viewers said it was too long and too much dialogue i really enjoyed it the acting was phenomenal great cinematography and score never felt bored maybe in the third act at times but it ended so well nolan never disappoints,2023-07-27 03:50:14

"enjoyed it a lot a whole bunch of incredible performances trinity test and the scene in the gym where amazing but what will stay on my mind the most apart from the ending was how they were discussing targets for the bomb with absolutely no regards for how horrible a crime they were committing  
  really enjoyed the portrayal of oppenheimer as an absolute genius but also a spineless coward that ultimately never believes in anything with conviction  
  the pugh i am become death  scene is as discussed in this thread extremely cringy but i do like it from the angle that pughs life is the first one oppenheimer destroys he really has become death  in that moment",2023-07-27 22:46:00

staggeringly dull as a movie probably ok if you wanted to sit in on historical conversations presented as docu drama scenes instead of dealing with the morality and human tragedy of nukes it chooses to spend 3 hours in dull rooms with men in suits debating security clearance incredibly tedious from start to finish,2023-07-26 19:23:29

the movie is a masterpiece actors really have a chance to shine i am extremely impressed i know nolan’s work and i read a lot about oppie including the book the movie was based on this was a truly great experience people saying it was boring didn’t understand it people saying there’s too much characters didn’t get that this is a biography it’s not gonna be a classic 2 mains 57 supporting this movie is kind of like an opera you should prepare in advance familiarise yourself with the story and some people and then you’ll get your money’s worth an then some,2023-07-21 15:32:46
"note im not a film critic or anything i have no idea what im talking about these are just my feelings from seeing the movie and movie expert people may be able to correct me on some stuff

i was pretty frustrated i love nolan and some of his work probably isnt as good dunkirk tenet but whenever i think of nolan i think of interstellar or at least i went into this movie hoping to be floored the way that interstellar floored me i loved that movie so much that i bought the science of interstellar and read the whole thing in a day or two something like that anyway point being nolan made me so immersed in the interstellar universe that i couldnt get enough of the details involved in how it was made up

i guess i was hoping for something similar here who was oppenheimer what did his story look like what were his motivations what did his work on the bomb look like 

and some of this was addressed i think again im just a guy who doesnt know much about the subject as a whole  oppenheimer is a guy from america i think i dont know he loves the wild west i guess hes levelheaded and attempts to do the right thing like when he donated to those suffering in spain he was the director of the manhattan project i think

some things really frustrated me i almost left the theater after about an hour or so 

1 his first love interest was the most dull woman she had a monotone i always love wiggle room line and then they started having  what why is oppenheimer interested in this woman at all then she starts having all types of mental issues and rejects his flowers but he apparently is so infatuated with her that he ignores how ridiculously rude she is to him she throws his flowers away repeatedly but apparently thats not that big of a deal
2 the woman who ends up being his wife holds his hand at a party once and is apparently a giant  who cant take care of their son at one point he comes home the baby is howling like a madman and shes wasted and he just gives her a hug and asks how things are going what the 
3 robert downey junior who i also really like was this sort of silly fun dude that was eager witty and sort of slightly jumpy which is the opposite of what he probably should have been hes supposed to be a high level careerman type of politician and if youve ever seen interviews with those types of guys theyre often logical and frankly somewhat boring instead you get this silly goofy robert downey junior who literally skips down the steps to go meet oppenheimer a high level political schemer like his character would  never do that those guys are serious they walk slow and theyre intentional in every move that they make nolan tried to show this off in the character later when he schemed against oppenheimer but it was already a bit spoiled at that point
4 way too many characters dude im sorry but i tried to follow all of the plots of the movie and even that was too much but the number of people who i had to remember was too much and i  gave up who was the guy who interviewed him and sat across the desk from him while the psychopath american military guy sat next to him who was lobolowitz or whatever his name was who was the big  guy i got so lost

also i have no idea why he wanted his brother to come to the base he kept asking for this and even i was like dude compartmentalization matt damon is right

oh and the dialog was  horrendous every few scenes someone would come to oppenheimer and go oh my  oppenheimer you have to do something youre gods gift to mankind the smartest guy in the universe no one talks like that to their friends or colleagues even if they respect them i really wanted to like this movie hopefully christopher nolan will put out a good one in the future",2023-07-22 00:58:21
"the film was far too long they could have cut all of the romance and that would have saved at least 20 minutes for example it felt very self indulgent 

i feel the film didnt know what story it wanted to tell scientific discovery or political thriller i feel the payoff in the third act was messy and relied far too heavily on the audience recalling every scientist and their actions and motives the black and white scenes were a failed idea 

the score whilst fitting  and functional didnt leave me wanting to rush home and boot up spotify like other nolan films 

the acting was excellent",2023-07-22 01:23:04
"i looked forward to oppenheimer having had a lot of physics in college 

found it to be ok but not entirely up to its hype

1	it should not have taken over three hours to tell that story  
2	it should not have required 100 million to tell that story  
3	it wasn’t a big enough piece of cinema for imax tv would have been fine  
4	in the 3 hours they might have developed the other scientists more  
5	the trinity test didn’t look like an atomic explosion  
6	fwiw gary oldman played a great truman it was a small part but it was enjoyable",2023-07-22 03:23:39
"to me it felt like 3 hours of exposition the scenes felt carelessly placed together non stop talking and no real emotional depth

it was boring i really wanted to see more regarding the nuclear side of things not actors dropping quantum physics in dialogue every now and again the bomb test was underwhelming too

it just felt like nolan threw all these scenes together i was really trying to enjoy it i didnt want to see a really underwhelming court room drama honestly why focus on something with stakes so low

i felt no connection to any of the characters

good to see josh hartnett back at it again though",2023-07-22 08:17:19
"poorly written and poorly edited 

the movie shouldve focused only on the manhattan project not his early life and postwar political struggles its just spread too thin

"i love nolan but this was such a disappointment for me it was impeccably acted by a brilliant cast but i can’t say i’d ever want to sit through it again it was way too long and dwelt on the parts i had least interest in in the context of the whole story was his security clearance really that important to spent an hour on i actually found the ‘courtroom’ scenes very tedious and repetitive by the end 

it’s also the first time i’ve bought into the nolan ‘must see at imax’ hype and thought afterwards it wasn’t worth it if anything it set my expectation of a spectacular movie at least in part  when actually i’d have been better off watching it in a smaller indie theatre like i did for stuff like the social network",2023-07-25 23:47:10
reading through the comments and its astounding how prudish and antisex so many people are my  some people need to grow up,2023-07-29 23:55:36
"i just watched it and i cannot say that i enjoyed it i think 3 hours is simply too long the movie could have been best served with an edit as i felt some scenes dragged on the plot in parts was too convoluted and the three parts of the movie were just not cohesive enough to justify it being 3 hours long is nolan untouchable that nobody wants to dare edit the movies to a more bearable 152 hours

the scene everyone was looking forward to  the nuclear blast  was as others have pointed out underwhelming probably deliberately so but in a movie like this i think that the nuclear bomb should have packed more of a punch to show the terrifying and frightening worldchanging majesty of it the silence was a wise choice but the bomb itself just looked small like any other bomb really it made me question what all the hype about it being imaxsuitable was all about the only scene that really packed the necessary punch was the last 10 seconds of the movie sadly 

i think the movie bounces around from scene to scene so frenetically that its easy to get lost as with tenet an even worse film though fortunately it was easier to hear what was being spoken in oppenheimer 

i dont think the movie did enough to really make us care enough strauss nor did i think it really made a lot of sense to dedicate so much time to this mans ego it felt like a little random bit of isolated drama though i will say that robert downey junior can act as too can all the other actors 

einsteins scenes were just all accidentally funny he reminded me of some random bumbling villager in a video game who appears in random scenes in the same city to offer a bit of thinkythinky wisdom to the main character 

i note the scarcity of women in nolan movies is always obvious  theyre just supportive two dimensional characters who act as shadows of a man or in this case just let their kids cry relentlessly every time they appear in a scene the lack of women is pretty ironic given oppenheimers competition is the feminist barbie movie

i will say that i am at least now more curious to read about oppenheimer the manhattan project american prometheus the making of the atomic bomb etc",2023-07-30 15:03:48
the pacing was terrible ive never been to a movie before that felt this long and fast at the same time the first two acts were so crammed together it left no room to breathe dialogue after dialogue after dialogue no explanations on the maths the figuring  anything it just happens pacing was a little better in the third act but by then i was growing antsy due to the length of the film overall id still rate it a 7510,2023-07-31 21:49:36
"the cinematography was incredible but thats all i enjoyed from the film

the pacing was too fast so many scenes went by with a flash with normal conversations having dramatic zoom ins it was hard to grasp what was going on when we keep jumping scene to scene time skip to time skip the best moments in the film was when we actually stuck around a bit and focused on something for more than 5 minutes some characters purely existed for character development

another issue was the audio it was so loud that it was hard to discern what the characters were saying at times

it felt like a botched amateur documentary interstellar was nolans last good movie what a shame",2023-08-06 18:07:28
i‘m really getting annoyed how nolan occupies great ideas and then produces pretty mediocre stuff from them except for some aspects of visual aesthetics,2023-08-07 09:34:54
" i was looking forward to oppenheimer but i found some aspects of the films execution disappointing i am sorry if i got anything wrong i plan on watching the movie again with subtitles this time my first language is not english so that along with the background music score made it so hard for me to understand the dialogue in the theatre

1 visual styling im confused by nolans choice to present the future in black and white while showing the past in color whatever it was meant to symbolize was lost on me however i appreciated how he juxtaposed oppenheimers and strausss trials allowing their stories to run parallel
2 background music this was so loud that i couldnt pay attention to any of the dialogues this is a nolan thing but watching and parsing a movie should not be this hard and it affected my ability to fully engage in this movie 90 of the movie had a background score and most of the time it was so loud i had to really focus on the lips to try to gather what was being spoken
3 characters development mainly in the first half i actually didnt fully understand a lot of the aesthetic storytelling choices nolan made while jumping time in the first half of the movie i saw coldfusions video about oppenheimer before watching the movie and he is such a nuanced and interesting and gray character but i felt that nolan didnt really bring that out effectively while diving into his problematic past making it hard for me to connect for instance arcane is one of my favorite shows that writes gray characters and morally gray choices so well and effectively there were so many characters and without a lot of historical context i kept forgetting them and had to keep a wiki page open to follow along as a good storyteller i feel that the intensity and depth of emotions can be conveyed without having the background knowledge about each character and their relationship with oppenheimer
4 portrayal of women i noticed that the film briefly touched on tatlocks influence on oppenheimers politics but it didnt delve into this aspect i didnt particularly like the way she was portrayed i terribly disliked the scene where the two of them have  as the cheating incident is recounted in the room of the hearing as a way of expressing how haunted kitty felt by the incident i didnt feel like it was done tastefully
5 the scene of the bomb this was really good however maybe this is just me being nitpicky i dont understand why nolan didnt want to use cgi for this if it could have been made better and i think its hard for me to understand how this bomb scene could have blown up the budget of the movie here is an interesting video where a dude tries to recreate the effects from the movie link

the films execution in the first half left me somewhat disconnected from the characters and their complexities i did find the second half much more gripping oppenheimers haunting expressed by the footstamping in the room he comes to give his speech after the bomb the scene of the bomb itself his future vision him telling einstein i believe we did in response to setting off a chain reaction kitty telling him that he does not get to sin and then expect others to feel sorry for him kittys response to the board in the trial room all of these were amazing i think its just since the first half fell flat i couldnt feel the intensity of being swept away by a character so morally grey and haunted and tortured as oppenheimer i plan to watch the movie again and would appreciate any comments that can help me maybe understand and appreciate this movie better",2023-08-15 23:14:10
i thoroughly disliked the film the plot doesn’t know what to do next and the emotional climax occurs 40 minutes before the movie decides to end,2023-07-22 02:15:17
"was anyone else incredibly bored way too long

had very high expectations",2023-07-22 21:26:40
"as much as everyones dunking on people who didnt like this movie and saying they expected some insane action marvel movie this to me felt like one big marvelesque biopic queue epic jfk namedrop

the cast i could not take seriously they usually get some big framed entrance with the camera in their face taking up the whole screen only to be a minor character the reason why they get all these entrances is because its a cameo for actor not the character which completely takes out of the movie seriously theres no way you guys saw rami malek read his script for 10 minutes and thought wow his character that i totally knew the name of blew it out of the water

matt damon is particularly egregious in this movie as he does not fit whatsoever and is the least convincing for his part in the movie on the other hand emily blunt and rdj i felt were the most convincing ignoring some of the issues with blunts character

a lot of the dialogue for kitty in the last hour felt like she was only there to be a vehicle for the script to baby the viewers so they can explain to the audience how complicated and nuanced oppenheimer is every  issue or motivation a character has every  bit of nuance a character possesses is always directly spelled out and explained to you by some characters dialogue

also with the dialogue nolan has this thing where he wants to do a lot of iconic lines that are meant to feel smart and cool but the thing is he does this with every other  line of dialogue to the point where every conversation feels very unrealistic manufactured and corny and none of the cool sentences hit as hard he has the very same issue with the editing and score

the editing and score in this movie is so adhd its incredible the first 2 hours is legit edited like a trailer and not a single one of the iconic scenes were able to get a sense of tension or emotion out me because none of them had an ounce of room to breathe or sit with the audience

he wants to blast the music every  scene to make it grandiose or make me feel something but instead it hinders entire movie because his overscoring fails to make a single scene stand out he is not thoughtfully selecting where to put the music hes just putting it in for the sake of putting it in due of this the emphasis and the enhancement scores are supposed to give is lost because nolan is afraid i will lose interests if he doesnt have some orchestral music playing during every little moment same goes with the mindless editing which i guess was a poor attempt to make things feel frantic the movie does this  where they will cut like 5 times in 3 seconds for no  reason the movie refuses to let me sit with anything or digest something the thing where oppenheimer is talking about something and it will cut quickly onto whatever hes talking about was cute but became quickly overused and almost a parody of itself basically moral of the story less is more

the cinematography was meh as a lot of it consisted of close ups of some actors face taking up the screen which isnt bad if done purposefully but again this is a 3 hour long movie and this is like every  shot to me it just felt like hey look at this actor look do you see all the star power we have come look at this actor

because of the bad dialogue the bad editing the bad score usage and the meh cinematography every bigimportant scene flopped i think the last oppenheimer imagining the room blowing up scene where he was being questioned was the most successful scene in the movie in terms of setting out to achieve its goal all the other big scenes in the movie failed to hit its mark

i know a lot of people were complaining about the trinity bomb scene and yes lets please all admit that was pretty underwhelming if you want to see a good version of that i direct you to the twin peaks trinity atomic bomb scene easily found on youtube

the last hour of the movie was the better part but there was a lot of telling instead of showing with the characters explaining oppenheimers as well as themselves motivations and feelings in great detail because nolan cant write dialogue to save his life due to this it got pretty annoyingly prooppenheimer preachy with the characters not the movie itself it feels like again the script was treating the audience like babies and trying to get some marvelized superhero come back moment for oppie

final thoughts this isnt a bad movie just felt very amateurish with a lot of its creative decisions i dont find this movie boring it would have been ridiculous to end the movie at just just the bomb scene and cut out the last hour the time jump idea was okay but poorly executed

also random thing one scene that was kinda annoying is when kitty is doing her testimony thing and shes like 16 no 17 actually sorry 18 or whatever the way they had her read her lines that one specifically was like disney channel levels of babying the audience if i was in that room i would instantly assume shes lying with her playing it up to that extreme degree it felt like she was just reading her lines that way so the audience knows that yes she knows what shes doing and shes being strategic about it but to the detriment of the believability and seriousness of that scene where im just like theres no way those guys in the room are not thinking shes clearly lying

610",2023-07-24 13:49:38
"i assume ill catch  for this but honestly its a 6510 it really didnt need to be 3 hours there are some really cool scenes bomb drop his speech where he saw the crowd as the bombed victims the einstein award etc but it suffered from pacing issues wom on the movie will be interesting to see 

saw it at a 70mm showing",2023-07-21 05:24:15

"pasting my comment from the other thread


went to an early imax screening last night


its a great film without a doubt with so much going for it but i really hated how it was edited constant cutting back and forth every time someone talks essentially some of the cutaways lasting less than a second sometimes where characters dont even say a word just random inserts all shot in the most bland way ever


maybe this was intentional so it would give the film energy as to not make the audience feel like the 3h were a slog but man it got to a point where the editing for me was really hurting some performances which was sad to see


im also curious to know whether other people noticed a huge amount of shots that appeared to be out of focus i think this was a problem with the film and not my theaters projector but who knows


its a solid film that couldve been even better had they taken greater care with some aspects of the filmmaking",2023-07-21 17:30:08
i thought it was good overall but it did feel like two movies steamrolled into one on one hand you have the construction of the atomic bomb and the fallout on the other you have the strauss vs oppenheimer plotline overall i felt it was a bit confusing with how they were mixed the direction and acting were top notch though,2023-07-21 18:35:46
absolutely fantastic film the final scene is absolutely chilling given current events,2023-07-22 18:42:43
i like how nolan doesnt do text on screen instead relying on the audience to pay attention you dont get oppenheimer going to london then giant text saying london or text saying what year or date it is thats not a bad approach to have those but oppenheimer demonstrates how you can do it effectively without it as well and i just think a lot of filmmakers use it as a crutch or maybe a studio exec gives the order to have them just because they dont have faith in the audience,2023-07-22 19:02:58
"an agrade film for sure and the best movie of the year so far it felt like the culmination of nolans entire career

the movie definitely has its faultsnotably some hammy acting here and there and a gratuitous cameo or twobut it kept me enthralled from start to finish the trinity test sequence followed almost immediately by oppenheimers speech in the gym was arguably filmmaking at its finest

oppenheimer is definitely going to be remembered as a 21st century classic i hope its success inspires hollywood to focus more on making intelligent films for adults",2023-07-22 20:42:58
incredible felt shorter than 3 hours the different time periods were weaved together very well i was never confused about when we were the age makeup was great too cried at least twice going to be thinking about this one for a while oh and two hours after it finished we went to see barbie so now i need to reflect on my life while suffering existential dread,2023-07-23 19:35:25
"unpopular opinion i thought matt damon disappeared into his role and really enjoyed him and i thought the opposite for rdj

although maybe it was because 2hr30 into the movie the teens next to me loudly whispered yo thats iron man bro haha",2023-07-24 04:54:18
"the constant background music was bugging me in the beginning but it allowed for a grand silence during the explosion that had me in awe not sure if that was on purpose 

let’s give the goofiest cast member the role of detonating the first atomic bomb in history i’m sure that’s a great idea 

also not sure if rdj did a poor job or the role of strauss was overemphasized 

idk mixed feelings about this one enjoyed my time at the theatre though",2023-07-27 23:49:44
did not expect a movie about oppenheimer to feel so similar to oliver stones masterpiece jfk making people having conversations in a room for 3 hours as propulsive and masterful as this is  level filmmaking easily nolans best,2023-07-29 00:42:20
good movie but not perfect the ending scene did give me chills though,2023-07-29 19:38:10
"awesome movie i couldn’t care for dunkirk and tenet but this one just blew me away sound in 70mm was crazy the people next to me were full on covering their ears during the trinity test lol 

my only criticisms would probably be the florence pugh scenes i didn’t think it added much substance and wasn’t executed well could have been cut without losing much significance in the plot i also couldn’t hear some of the critical dialogue due to the music idk what oppenheimer said in the final scene with einstein 

the  imax seats also made this movie seem much longer than it was",2023-07-31 07:21:30
apparently a lot of people claim they walked out of this movie i’m not sure i really believe all those claims like i get not liking the movie but hating it to the point of walking out seriously maybe i’m just different but i’m trying to figure out how awful a movie has to be for me to do that and if a movie is truly that awful i probably in a million years wouldn’t be interested in seeing it in the first place even if i don’t end up liking it really i find some value in it,2023-08-06 19:08:25
35 to me performances and editing were fantastic but the cinematography screenplay and actual bomb scene fell flat for me the goosebumps i got during the gym speech and last sentiment didnt feel earned thru the premise so much as forced through the score im glad i saw in in theaters but ill probably never watch it again,2023-08-25 22:28:20
"while not terrible i was pretty disappointed i really wanted to like it  i have a background in theoretical math and history of math and science and was really compelled by the subject matter but  despite the great cast on this movie it was completely soulless i know all of the scenes with women were based on real life but there was no emotion in them and i would have preferred they be cut out of the movie i did not buy him as a womanizer in fact all of oppenheimers relationships felt empty there was no chemistry between cillian and anyone except matt damon at times and albert einstein when cillian played oppenheimer in moments where he was alone eg when people were cheering or stomping and he was fading out he killed it but otherwise he overdid the stiffness to the point where every interaction felt dry thank  for the rdj scenes they werent even amazing but at least they were a change of pace

this movie felt a lot like nolan read show dont tell and got scared he wasnt showing enough every demonstrative scene of something eg cillian and josh hartnett disagreeing about unionization felt forced the result of which being i never actually felt like they were ever friends while i liked the emphasis on the fact that this was a large group effort they threw so many names out there all the time just to have them i also  hated the style all of the oppenheimer scenes felt so  rushed i get what nolan was trying to do and im glad it worked for most people but for me i wish instead of trying to add in all this tension and stress at the beginning it let it slowly build up the movie did find its feet in the last 80 minutes but by that time i was super worn out and annoyed i didnt enjoy it as much as i would have otherwise ultimately these issues wormed their way into the biggest issue i didnt even care about the movies message because it was sort of flung at me dont get me wrong i felt a lot of tension and suspense watching the movie but it did not get me to think critically nor did i feel like it actually had as much to say as it thought it did it was classic i think im so smart stuff teller challenging oppenheimer to share his beliefs was such an important part of the movie and it just fell completely flat like the rest of their relationship which again i was supposed to care about so by the time oppenheimer started shouting in the break room i didnt really care about anything but the admittedly fun adrenaline rush the soundscape was taking me on

now that thats out of the way here are some things i liked the sound effects were incredible the detonation sequence in new mexico was also incredible as were the scenes with cillian melting down in crowded spaces i really liked the einstein scenes maybe because the movie actually chilled the  out was probably worth seeing but sooooo long and such a slog to get to the good stuff that ill gladly never watch it again

tldr this movie was tryhard and rode on some really fun and excellent soundscaping it is different and creative but not in a way that actually made the film better in fact the experimentation with the storytelling contributed to why it 

edit grammar",2023-08-01 04:52:54
"i never thought id consider leaving a nolan movie thrice 

this was a movie about senate politics security clearances and love affairs for three hours and most every  forsaken dialogue was quick cut between three or more serious men filling in each others sentences for the entire dialogue like they all split the scripts lines between them

everything builds up to the test in the middle of the movie and its just a poof in the desert there is so much cinematography to explore in order to show what oppenheimer felt but this was just him starring at an underwhelming light show the barely surviving silent black and white original film capture from the trinity test makes it look more massive and mortifying than this did

cillian murphy is miscast not as robert oppenheimer but as this oppenheimer the real oppenheimer rolled on the floor in anxiety this oppenheimer mostly gulps he was known to be a dramatic and eccentric individual this oppenheimer is timid and bland id love to see cilian murphy get to do oppenheimer right

do i even have to mention oppie saying his now i am become death during the  scene the  scene

i wish i had seen barbie twice",2023-07-28 00:47:23
"i found the movie to be way too long and felt like an absolute drag there was way too much skipping all over the place from scene to scene and the dialogue felt like it was rambling too much there just seemed to be so much story this movie wanted to tell and so many characters they wanted to introduce that i think this would have been much better suited to being a mini series rather than a 3 hour movie that felt like it was never going to end i also wasn’t a fan of the constant time skipping at least if it was a mini series it could have been paced out better and able to tell all of the story and the actual bomb scene did not have the impact i was expecting or hoping for

i’m glad to see so many people enjoyed this film but for me i was just glad it was finally over with",2023-07-21 16:32:05
"this movie felt like a masturbatory slog it really comes across like nolan thinks hes an absolute genius and it got in the way of a making a better movie

the constant changes in aspect ratio were distracting some of the prosthetic makeup was distractingly bad the explosion was unimpressive i saw it on imax and i think audiences are confusing loud with good great example of how some well restrained but carefully executed cgi can have a big impact by the time the bomb exploded my partner and i were ready for the movie to be over but then it felt like they pulled the sheet off and were like surprise youve been watching a much more boring movie this whole time and it slogged along for another miserable hour a guy a couple rows back from where i was sitting let out a groaning jesus finally when the credits rolled

most of the performances themselves were top tier though and the photography was somewhere between beautiful and consistently competent the score was good but at no point did it seem like it knew what act of the movie it was in i might would have thought it was the best movie id ever seen had it come out when i was 17

i dont think it came anywhere near meeting the hype its been getting imax was unnecessary and i suspect that i might have left with a generally more positive impression of the film had i watched it at home where i could actually sit comfortably stop to go to the bathroom and get snacks periodically and sporadically engage in commentary before getting back into it",2023-07-25 04:00:44
i just saw the movie and i am baffled that it gets so much praise the best way to put it why it was bad is because you can’t have dramatic scenes if every scene is dramatic we get 3 hours of overly dramatic music and dialog we only got 30 seconds of quiet time before the explosion the way the story was presented might have been interesting if it was more coherent we didn’t really get to know the main character or his moral dilemma in some parts it is personal drama story then it shifts to political drama not that you can’t have both but not in this way also what was the deal with his first communist love affair this could have been very interesting to see something personal to him and also to see how america viewed communism instead we got a  scene where the girl got of from him reading some ancient script and then she kills herself because he is no longer available to her and he is deeply scared but for like 2 minutes before completely forgetting about it they could have saved at least 20 minutes not including her at all and we would not have missed much sorry guys but the movie is far from what it should have been,2023-07-26 22:08:37
"this movie was a 6 or 7 way too long way too selfimportant and the horrific droning musical score was awful and made hearing the dialogue next to impossible sorry the nonlinear script was the wrong approach here total needless distraction this movie should have been directed by someone like a clint eastwood somebody who understands character development this movie was a cold arthouse project and while technically impressive a bore and a slog

i wasn’t even that impressed with cillian who showcased a very narrow range and please with the needless  scenes that served no purpose whatsoever and were just awkward dropins",2023-07-27 07:54:12
i cannot wait to rewatch this movie with subtitles,2023-07-21 02:49:47
very underwhelmed by the actual bomb scene,2023-07-21 05:53:56
"with early praise being so high the reactions will surely flip in the coming weeksmonths discourse is going to be insufferable soon enough worse than tenet probably i’m just going to live on my own island of enjoying these two movies and mostly ignoring oppenheimer discussion for the next year probably 

masterpiece btw jenniferludwighoyte are all bringing their absolute best and it really sets this movie over the top for me possibly nolan’s finest work even if it might not being my favoritemost rewatched in the long run he’s certainly refined his craft into something truly powerful",2023-07-21 16:13:34
did the constant music really annoy anyone else apart from the few times it worked it took the stakes and emotion out of every scene,2023-07-21 17:22:44
"i don’t even have the words to describe how incredible of an experience that was i’m sure everyone has said all the praise possible for it but this movie is unreal literally the culmination of all of nolan’s previous works— an exhausting emotional sensoryoverload of genius onscreen imax is absolutely the way to go and i’m surprised my ears are still working do not waste your time if you’re waiting for streaming this has to be seen on the big screen preferably a premium format 1010

"ive been a diehard nolan fanboy since watching batman begins in cinemas as a kid and this was the first one ive left feelingwhelmed

its a beautiful film with some fantastic performances but you could have definitely cut out 4045 mins of it and still had the overall tone and meaning behind it retained cillian murphy was incredible as oppenheimer though i feel greatly for florence pugh who finally got that call to be in a nolan film and was essentially relegated to two  scenes with little to no plot reasoning

still a good film but without a doubt my least favourite nolan film",2023-07-22 08:02:22

holy  reddit got some bad takes on this movie,2023-07-22 22:42:42
it just felt like a mishmash of great scenes put together i think nolan leaned into his nolanisms a bit too much in this movie emily blunt was literally a placeholder until one great scene at the end maybe i didnt get this one but atleast his other movies flowed better if that makes sense even tenet the actors were great the bhagvad gita  scene just felt overindulgent the explosion and the sound design for this movie was also excellent the bomb scene was perfect i never doubted that at all the absolute best scene for me was the speech he gives after the bombs have been dropped maybe ill warm up to this on a rewatch,2023-07-23 12:08:35
honestly no way to sugar coat it this is a really bad movie it isn’t interesting at all it’s dialogue in a room for 90 of the 3 hours extremely underwhelming 310 only for good music and acting,2023-07-21 07:13:51
if im being honest this movie is a bang 610 cinematography is beautiful acting all good however after the bombing and after the 2 hour mark it is very draining and dull nothing to keep me engaged as to the first two hours,2023-07-21 18:09:41
apologies for the unpopular opinion but this wasnt a good movie like at all technically  its amazingi dont expect anything less from nolan hes a great technical director but this movie wasnt good nothing about it really hit me on an emotional level,2023-07-22 00:36:27
i feel like everyone who’s talking about this movie watched a completely different movie than me i don’t know what’s wrong with me but this has to be one of the most boring and uninteresting movies i’ve seen in my life i guess i just had the wrong expectations going into it but there was just nothing going on in it but endless back and forth dialogue that meant nothing to me there were a few cool parts but nothing to justify a 3 hour runtime downvote me if you want i guess i just had to get this out there,2023-07-22 14:33:44
"so the whole movie was about lewis having a petty grudge against oppenheimer the stakes being a cabinet position and a security clearance like thats the actual climax of the movie that oppenheimer looses his clearance and lewis looses a senate vote
its structured in a way that it only comes together how petty the whole thing is at the very end
they spend more time on communists and unionization than the bomb but even that is boring because nobody has anything interesting to say about it we dont know why oppenheimer is a fellow traveler its just repeated as a circumstance again and again so never about communism its just about people being communists 

and sure the movie is oppenheimer not nuclear weapons but this movie is only concerned with nukes is to get trailer footage and insofar its related to the investigation its ridiculous how they hyped it up as a movie that make you terrified of mad but they almost purposefully dont show anything that doesnt directly effect oppenheimer

i kinda expected to see how recklessly the feds tried to figure out nuclear strategy see  like operation crossroads or at least hiroshima they even have a scene where someone is showing pictures of hiroshima burn marks and we are purposefully facing away from the pictures like he is taunting us
and they tried to flip it positively with the no cgi  of course you dont have to when you only show trinity  real operation crossroads footage is more impressive than what they show in the film

this movie is just not on that scale its about arguing about who is a communist in a small room for three hours",2023-07-22 15:31:56
the movie played like a trailer for the entire 3 hour run time it started off the same way and before i knew it we were half way through and it felt like it never slowed down i dont think there is a scene in the entire movie that lasts more than 2 minsill even say 1 before moving onto another way way to fast also the scene with florence pugh was so out of pocket it felt like a fan made edit and did not fit the movies tone whatsoever idk what nolan told himself there but that should have hit the cutting room floor regardless of her attractiveness,2023-07-23 00:15:02
"to long slow pacing boring over dramatic courtroom drama too much talking underwhelming bomb explosion but the lead up to the bang was good also really quaint period furniture architecture costumes style cars etc which was cool im a nolan and artsy film fan normally but this aint it

should have gone to see barbie instead",2023-07-23 05:12:45
it was too long for no reasoni was falling asleep multiple times and idk if its the cinema where i been but many conversations were difficult to understand  it was just mumbling too many characters and keep switching on the timeline were very confusing  310,2023-07-23 05:32:01
"as a physics degree holder boy am i sad with how much i hated this movie really was looking forward to it and expected to love it

in the first 30m i was giddy with the parade 
of all the historical physics juggernauts feeling like the movie was gearing up for something really special only to be confused and disoriented by an unnecessarily convoluted timeline and equally unintelligible dialog that is punctuated by a build up to an almost comically impotent bomb blast that unquestionably should have been cgi

the majority of this movie being a confusing board room hearing makes it feel like the most pointless imax movie ever made

i did not pick up on the bw shots indicating the timeline so maybe that makes me the  idk i really had no clue what was going on for a huge majority of the movie

by the third act i kinda felt like i started to get what was going on but was already so worn out i was just waiting to be set free by the credits 

loved the last scene with albert

i am hoping i will like this one better when it streams with subtitles but i feel pretty bummed about it on first watch",2023-08-03 05:00:02
"the entirety of rdjs confirmation hearing should have been cut or reduced to a textual epilogue at the end of the movie absolutely unnecessary to show all that

also there was really no need for so many time jumps  back and forth back and forth it was dizzying at times i know its kinda nolans shtick to  around with flashbacks and flashforwards but it really felt it was pointless here could have just told the same story mostly chronologically and probably shaved an hour from the runtime in the process 

and why the  did einstein react that way to oppenheimers words at the end it really wasnt that deep as if einstein didnt already know what having such a power unleashed could mean for the world",2023-07-25 03:28:22
shallow did not get into the humanity the physics the moral dilemmas or anything else of interest outside of a very superficial treatment  over the top effects and scenes that were meant to be artsy but failed to actually achieve anything typical modern nolan and a formula that works brilliantly on the masses so expect mass approval of this one just like all his others,2023-07-26 03:39:09
"i wanted to walk out

im a nolan fanboy and dont mind a biopic but oppenheimer just drags on for what feels like forever the cast is incredible the shots are nice but its just a really boring movie even they raved about not using cgi but the shots of the bomb werent really that amazing anyway 

still glad i saw it i guess but this will be the first nolan movie i wont rewatch religiously",2023-07-30 05:34:57
i feel like i’m living on a different planet or something this is the most boring film i’ve seen in quite a long time and it was actually painful to sit through the entire thing  also why are there jump scares and nudity in a film about a  physicist  this was the worst nolan film i have seen and it isn’t remotely close,2023-07-21 07:09:21
just got back from seeing it not what i expected and not in a good way i thought it would be more technical and scientific but it was mostly politics and inquisition imaxplf doesnt really serve a purpose in this film believe it or not,2023-07-21 20:48:06
"just saw this

i was hyping this up for a year considering i love nolan and everything he has done so far

it was a good film but unfortunately far from the masterpiece i expected it to be and what the trailers indicated it was going to be

it focuses way too much on the political court room drama stuff strauss scenes and not enough on the scientific stuff happening with the creation of the bomb at los alamos the last hour especially drags the whole film down by at least 2 points with all the names they drop and jumps between timelines

brilliantly acted by cillian and all the supporting cast and beautiful on a visual sound and production design level but i dont think it was worth the imax shooting efforts just for a 7 minute detonation scene including the build up the entirety of the rest of the film was just dialogues not worth to be seen in that format as its mostly closeups

and about the detonation scene its the first time i wish nolan had actually used some cgi to enhance it as it looked way too small and like they stacked couple of hundreds of kilos of tnt and blew them up

it looks very underwhelming compared to the real restored hd footage on yt and nolan and hoyte tried to mask it with a few closeup shots

i hope you enjoy it more than i did i am seeing it again imax in a week and i hope i appreciate it more on a second watch

currently id give it a 710",2023-07-21 22:45:04

"its not boring its not distasteful its not bad but is sooooo  long easily the longest feeling movie i think ive ever seen sat down in the theatre at 720pm and didnt stand up and leave until 1055pm was i physically uncomfortable no but by the time we cut back to the grey hearing for the 5th time after the second act i started checking my phone for the time frankly the cutting back and forth does the movie no favors when the best part of the movie is pretty  linear and easy to follow and frankly the all practical explosion was lacklustre a nuke is extraordinary cg would do this justice a practical explosion left me wanting it did not look like a nuclear explosion this is footage of the real trinity test i do not think the movie even begins to match the intensity and scale of this 

oh and that one reviewer who said the imagined sight of a womans head getting blown off by a nuke was disturbing needs to go watch literally every other  movie with a nuke in it t2 is still etched in my brain for the  no reaction i had to sarahs dream this was frankly pathetic it looked like pva glue flakes being blown by a hairdryer",2023-07-22 22:58:39

i really didn’t care at all about the strauss side of things there was so little texture to rdj‘s character i simply didn’t care about him the black and white scenes just annoyed me and i wanted to get back to oppi desperately i also don’t think this movie needs to be watched in cinema it did very little in the way of spectacular set pieces initially they had some very nice effects that oppenheimer was imagining but they dropped that entirely after the 50 mark the explosion was also quite underwhelming to be honest i liked the movie but it didn’t earn my numb butt in the seat,2023-07-23 19:07:36
"was expecting something as spectacular as the imitation game but this one came up a bit short for me definitely did not need to be 3 hours the blueish grey and white was bothersome for me…should have just shown us his story chronologically leading up to the hearingstrauss’ betrayals in present 

i also felt there were many unexplored angles  einstein with joseph goebbels the paradox of jews working with the nazis would have been interesting to delve into that more 

i have more input to offer but others have said things along the same vein so i’ll leave it short for now oh and would have loved to see what happened to oppenheimer kitty strauss hill etc precredits did some googling myself but enjoy when those facts are included at the end

the atom bomb test scene was pretty spectacular though i must say",2023-07-23 19:20:13
"imho this movie is wasted on the big screen its a cerebral movie not an action movie the dialogue is more important than anything else other than the big boom theres nothing of importance that is better on the biggest screens not like interstellar avatar or gravity films which were definitely better on the biggest screens

i also feel like the whole father of the atomic bomb thing was kind of rushed and they didnt really go into much detail about the actual engineering of the bomb or challenges they faced i get that its a movie about oppenheimer not necessarily about the atomic bomb but the two are so closely tied together that it felt like they really rushed that part and instead decided to focus more on what happened after the atomic bomb",2023-07-24 05:13:21

"i  loved this movie im going to be a  and say its not for everyone its nor a popcorn flick this isnt a bio pic its not elvis or forest gump its not a best of of americas nuclear program and its not a war movie this is a meditation on the sacrifice of humanity it takes to transcend it an exploration of the oppenheimers failing mental state the biggest take away is  he was wrong that the bomb should of never been made and he was a fool to make it how someone so small could become so large it was an exploration in foolishness and pride leading all involved to deeply regret their actions on either side our favorite germen metaphysician was really the lynchpin i dont know if he was really so above it all in reality im aware of his letter however i couldnt help but to feel he was the only sane one in the picture

edit a reflection shows me the analogies between him and prometheus in my stifled analysis i view them as contrasting figures in our time at least maybe thats the true message we have been given a fire we are not worthy to wield",2023-07-26 01:35:12
"not sure how to feel about the movie 

i think nolan’s recent obsession with messing with narrative timelines hinders this movie as someone who doesn’t know anything about oppenheimer i had no context to why a hearing was being held about oppenheimer its a nice narrative framework but i had no idea he was being interrogated for being a suspected communist so for 80 of the movie i wasnt sure what he was trying to prove or disprove through this narrative conceit i had no idea we were supposed to be suspecting that anyone in particular was responsible for trying to tear him down either i just tossed it up to mccartheism and the red scare i didn’t know we were supposed to be suspecting some mastermind among the large cast of characters i also had no idea what the black and white scenes meant this in addition to the jarring jumps back and forth in time confused me even more there is just too many narrative gimmicks going on with too many names and events for me to understand what was going on i get the broad strokes but not understanding the finer details of things made it hard to be invested or satisfied by the movie

if the narrative were told more linearly in a conventional manner i think it would be better as it is this movie feels like you need to go in already knowing the cliffnotes of his life to even follow the film",2023-07-27 07:05:56

movie was frustrating because i couldnt hear much of the dialogue needs subtitles,2023-07-27 09:27:03
"ok so here comes a bit of an effort post with all of my thoughts on this

im a huge nolan fan my favorite films by him are dunkirk inception interstellar and the prestige like all of his films i eagerly awaited this for years

i read a lot of history books anyway so i decided 6 months ago to read american prometheus the book that this film is based on it might have been a mistake to read this before seeing this film

having already read the fantastic the making of the atomic bomb i figured that american prometheus would be somewhat similar they were not similar i noticed that a full half of the book was spent on the political witchhunting that plagued oppenheimer for so much of his life i thought to myself how will nolan handle this in the film clearly a 3 hour epic about the father of the atomic bomb would be a tad boring for most people if it spends half of the film on this political stuff

so i began to worry about this but was still onboard for seeing the film of course christopher nolan could release a film of a blank wall for 2 hours with no sound and i would probably buy a ticket for it he is one of the few maybe 3 or 4 directors who have carte blanche with me to buy a ticket to whatever they put out in the theater

so i finally saw it here are my initial thoughts

710 overall score

matt damon was continually distracting i was always aware that i was watching an actor named matt damon although he did somewhat embody the character as described in the book

this story seems like it would be incredibly hard to follow for someone who hadnt read the book its almost as if this film is just an ad for the book because you will need to read the book afterwards to understand everything you just saw i found the film confusing and i have read the book recently

the film assumes that the audience knows a lot about all of the characters already especially a lot about oppenheimer i dont feel that the film adequately explained oppie and his charactermotivations we just hit the ground running with this guy that we barely know

cillian murphy will get a best actor nomination for this role and he deserves to win the oscar for this role

robert downey jr will get a best supporting actor nomination for this role and he also deserves to win

random note almost everyone in the theater was male which disappointed me as a female there were maybe 46 women in the entire theater and 2 of them spent the entire film on their cell phones texting and looking at clothes anyway i thought that was interesting

final note i think nolan should have adapted the making of the atomic bomb instead of american prometheus

tl dr version my initial vote is 710 which might change with time",2023-07-27 15:16:23
i felt the movie was ok but the last hour or so after the test detonation seemed to be without a point,2023-07-31 14:23:47
"well i enjoyed this one i tend to be a big nolan detractor but this film avoided most of his major pitfalls 

i do feel the the film falls off a bit in the third act and overstays its welcome in terms of runtime but that might just be me ive soured on longer run times as of late its interesting to see a historical biopic thats constructed like an action film but its clear that its a winning formula for nolan dont think theres anything wrong with editing the film that way and given the circumstances surrounding the development of the bomb it heightened the sense of urgency to see the creation of bomb to completion 

i will say that im a bit split on the roles of both emily blunt and florence pugh i find it refreshing that the film included blunt as a strong three dimensional character but on the flipside has pugh plays the typical enigmatic and frustratingly emotional female archetype that so often plagues his female character im hardly offended by nudity in films but it seemed completely unnecessary in this one pughs character seems to hate clothes as much as she hates flowers 

i think people are mislabeling this as a nonlinear film it does do some things out of order but its fairly linear strausss senate confirmation is mostly used as a framing device to tell the story 

otherwise wasnt super blown away by any of the lead performances necessarily other than murphy i think cillian murphy did a great job disappearing into the role but rdj and damon are both so recognizable that its difficult to see them as anyone but rdj or damon i do give this film a lot of credit for casting a bevy of upandcoming young actors though like jack quaid or alden ehrenreich even if their parts were relatively small in general it was the smaller roles that really carried this film for me jason clark and macon blair were both fantastic as the prosecution and defense david krumholtz was also great in this 

the soundtrack is a real stand out here at times its overbearing and almost comical in how intense it can be but nolan tends to make music a big part of his films its beautiful on its own though ive been listening to it since i watched it on sunday 

at the end of the day id say that between barbie and oppenheimer id rate barbie as the superior film at the very least the more interesting film but this is far and above my favorite nolan film good to see him bounce back after tenet",2023-07-31 18:55:49
"this movie was great but im not sure it was good

there was too much in it  it suffered from the two plot lines and one of the plot lines is a hearing about a clearance  rdj was essentially a cartoon villain in an otherwise realistic movie  and dont get me started on the outofplaceness of the i have become death line in a  scenepeople literally laughed out loud in the theater

but the acting was amazing the cast was amazing the visuals were relentlessly amazing

i really enjoyed it but i dont think it is the tourdeforce people seem to think it is",2023-08-03 04:46:43
"so dull

it starts ok then totally gets bogged down and lost up its own backside 

given nolans previous 2 efforts then oppenheimer doesnt surprise me

his days of inspiration brilliance and innovative appear to be sadly over

even hitchcock ran out of ideas

oppenheimer isnt worth the effort  of course its well made

this is a film that any competent director could have made

given his lineage thats a bad sign for nolan he made films nobody else could make

now hes joined the ordinary club

fans of the subject should watch a kiss before dying with ralph meeker",2023-11-17 06:54:59
"couldnt even finish it with the jumpy disjointed cuts in the beginning that are all over the place and the dialogue being drier than me nans christmas turkey  
i dunno i really disliked the little bit that i did see",2024-01-09 16:13:40
it makes me mad that this movie is so highly rated its awful matt damons was the only likeable character cuz hes matt damon,2024-03-03 05:27:00
"quite a few great scenes in there but as a whole i thought the movie was an utter mess extremely fast pacing frenetic cutting between 3 different story lines dialogue thats yet again hard to hear over the background music a  load of characters accompanied by numerous name drops i could go on 

the scenes i did like were the ones that lasted more than 30 seconds had discernable dialogue had a focused story beat and just had the  time to breathe examples the trinity test the meeting where they decided where to drop the bombs oppy meeting truman the last conversation between oppy and einstein",2023-07-23 08:20:17
"i’m getting that a lot of people were watching this movie a biopic for…the bomb and that’s where a lot of the negative viewpoints are coming from the bomb wasn’t good enough all the silly dialogue after the bomb scene was boring any plot points outside of the bomb were excessive and could have been cut it makes me chuckle so some of you really just wanted to watch him scribble theory on a chalkboard build the bomb test the bomb have an amazing cgi mushroom cloud and then end with the bombings on japan some destruction  maybe a side note about how he grappled with a guilty conscience or something to add a bit of theme to the movie and call it a day

i much prefer the version of the film that we got the bomb was a big part of his story and everything in the movie does ultimately tie to the manhattan project still however the accusations against him his excolleagues boardroom depositions on his character his political associations kitty’s deposition loved that scene this was all much more interesting to me than the very simple movie i described above which i think many of the negative reviewers would have preferred the version we got shows oppenheimer as a complex individual for example strauss wasn’t wrong about a lot of what he said about oppenheimer however we also were showed that oppenheimer was against the hbomb because he was genuinely scared for humanity i would understand if the biopic was about someone extremely dull but i’d say j robert oppenheimer had a pretty interesting life 

editing to add the nonlinear timeline also threw people off because i guess it does require more attention to follow i know nolan is sort of known for using this method now but i did love it here i think telling his story in a nonlinear way and bouncing back and forth really just made the film more interesting to watch for me biopics inherently can be on the dry side and nolan’s touch with the timeline jumping just made it that much more of an exciting cinema experience for me 

910 from me  point docked for sound mixing",2023-07-23 08:57:32
"people are making this out to be his magnum opus

its not not even close

memento and the dark knight are vastly superior in craft and thematic impact and why the  does nolan prefer us to not hear the dialogue in his movies now",2023-07-24 00:40:08
am i the only one who thinks this should have been a tv show and not a movie there are so many tangents that could have been explored further and a 3 hour movie was absolute torture to sit through,2023-08-14 03:39:56
it didnt have any plot or protagonists chased its own wagging tail it accomplished nothing in x4 the amount of time it needed 410,2023-11-21 00:09:27

imagine making a film about the creation of the atom bomb basing your entire marketing campaign around an explosion filming in imax and then have the actual explosion scene be the most anticlimactic thing ever  what a waste,2023-07-25 01:51:36
"honestly it felt like 12angry men mixed with some action sequences im a bit dissapointed  i think court dramas are utterly boring

the movie did not have to be shot on imax and i feel nolans nocgi policy made this movie worse it made the atomic bomb feel small

the use of soundtrack after the trinity test was ridiculous nolan only added this because without the classic nolan suspense soundtrack something is happening soon  the last hour would feel like 4hours

i feel like this nolans weakest work  although is not a bad movie but the movie would be 10x more impactful if nolan had cross cutted the oppenheimer story with a story from hiroshima i know its a biopic and character study but it felt rushed and the movie did not move me at all i did not feel we were at war and the atomic bomb felt like a upscale new years rocket

the editing is also weak at times 1second reaction shot no time to dwell on the characters",2023-07-21 14:07:19
honestly i’ve never seen a movie so boring a ten minute read on wikipedia about the whole los alamos and his rise to fame and they managed to make 3 hours out of it and bored everyone to death walked out an hour 15mins before it finished,2023-07-22 20:37:32
nolan again doesn’t give a single  about you hearing or understanding the dialogue this made worse on a movie that is 95 dialogue,2023-07-23 00:24:20
an other movie held back by nolans reluctance to use cg it was jarring to see dunkirk with a whopping 200 extras and a bunch of modern buildings in the background both of which could have been fixed in post and now the trinity bomb test just felt like a bunch of pyrotechnics in someones backyard  heres the real footage the scale is not even remotely comparable,2023-08-03 20:42:23
"the best way i could could describe this film  

it has a lot of boners that go soft so many missed opportunities 

you’re building the biggest weapon on earth to stop  we find out from a nonamer that  is dead in the middle of a conversation 

the final exchanges between downey jr and ehrenreich felt so badly wasted ehrenreich didnt even rub it in his face it kept building and building and boom he opens a door and we see camera flashing thats the “i really showed him moment” 
if it wasnt for the booming sounds and strobe light editing we would have all fell asleep in this film 

not one person on earth feels sorry for pugh’s character we met her as a mysterious outsider and she stays that way the whole film not one quality to admire just out of frame  thats it

there’s just really nothing that feels like a pay off in this film we see cameras flashing on robert downey jr at the end… is this nolan’s idea of a payoff we get zero satisfaction out of what happens with him 

the closeups on murphy were too close and so distracting and what’s with all the cold sores the camera practically ended up down his throat by the end 

some of the makeup they did to make people look hideous did not look believable at all it looked like josh peck’s skin was sliding off his face like he was d’onofrio in men in black

i feel like they originally intended for a linear timeline realized what a boring movie they had on their hands and then mixed it all up with kabooms and disco strobe lighting we often walk into a scene not knowing what year it is and how high the stakes are",2023-08-01 08:12:16

"ill make this brief

im sorry i dont see this being nolans ticket to the oscars put aside his everpresent issues with women he gets a lot of the history wrong there are some scenes that had me laughing unintentionally dont tell me strauss was unfamiliar with kennedy bad dutch famous quote during  and it lacks an emotional center for me to grab on the aspect ratio shifts were annoying the alist cameos were distracting especially oldmans the sound design is as incompetent as his recent flicks i did like the cinematography the score and murphy but other than that its a disappointment 

410",2023-07-25 23:49:39
"no country for old men shows how to do tension correctly in a movie it’s about a serial killer after his latest victim when someone’s fighting for their life there are no bombastic horns or drums in the background it’s just deathly silent it was haunting to me how much the tension was allowed to breathe organically it felt more authentic than anything i’ve ever seen on screen 

compare that to this movie where they lay the music on so heavy that you can barely hear people speak excessive use of music just screams “i’m trying to add emotion to a scene that i’m worried doesn’t earn it organically” and it feels disingenuous like they’re trying to sell you something 

this movie also drags on way way too long no one cares if oppenheimer loses his security clearance why are we on this for the literally over an hour to end the movie i saw people leaving the theater and i wanted to join them eventually that’s something that should have been done in 10 minutes then cut to credits 

seeing josh peck detonate the first nuclear bomb was the redeeming grace of the film",2023-08-03 10:45:12
it definitely has something but i feel like it would have benefitted from a linear timeline swapping between different time periods with so many characters and events was somewhat confusing i got most of it but kinda struggled to understand why strauss was behaving as he did and the trial seemed to repeat things and could’ve been greatly cut down,2023-07-21 09:21:34
great movie i went in super  and lost track of names a few times but honestly having alisters in all important roles helped,2023-07-21 14:03:33
first time robert downey jrs done a movie for adults since the judge easy to forget how good he is,2023-07-21 16:15:30
"absolutely beautiful epic although confusing and hard to follow at times due to its nonlinear story

i loved it but feel like i’ll appreciate it more once i get to rewatch it with subtitles the score is beautiful grand and epic but it also overpowered quite a bit of the dialogue imo",2023-07-21 19:07:03
"i can see theres no general consensus here but for me it was definitely a hit  wouldnt say its nolans best but hes made some of my favorite movies so thats a high bar to clear  i do have a hard time thinking of a biographical movie ive enjoyed more  

i do enjoy history and this is a topic i didnt know that much about as far as the intricate details  after this movie i felt like i learned a lot if accurate of course  any complaints about hard to understand dialogue are absent here  every word was crystal clear  this while still having the usual top notch nolan sound direction  the tension in this movie was also incredible and really paid homage to the seriousness of the topic  the trinity test scene was just chefs kissreally edge of your seat stuff

so yeah overall i thought it was pretty  good  i understood what nolan tried to achieve here and thought he was quite successful at it",2023-07-21 23:07:22

for example i love matt damon and casey affleck but i don’t think either of them fit their roles here and they could have been supplanted by other actors to create a more unique memorable experience the castings feel shoehorned based on popularity and dealings by their agents",2023-07-22 18:17:48
"loved the movie  

i know oppenheimers ridicule after the bombing is an important part of his life but they could have trimmed about half an hour out of that part  the bomb dropping should have been closer to 23 or 34 the way into the movie not half",2023-07-22 19:16:51

otherwise good movie but is it just me or did anyone else not really see a difference with imax in the city i live in theres a local theater chain most people go to but i went to an amc for the first time in a decade for the imax experience this was soheavily marketed on i feel like i could have gone to harkins and had the same viewing experience with less cramped seating and possibly not the fidgety bored kid",2023-07-23 00:02:38

i was looking forward to many of the mainstream summer movies this year while none of them were really big disappointments yet none of them really stayed with me as i left the theatre i finally watched oppenheimer on imax 70mm and it exceeded all my expectations the direction the acting the visual the score the editing sound design everything was as close to perfect as i have seen in a while it was talky cerebral political emotionally heightened and ultimately a great character study with nolan’s audio visual flair probably one of the best movies i have seen in years this is christopher nolan’s magnum opus as i have heard few times already but it is dense in content theme and ask some unsettling questions about humanity and it’s future and it is not for everyone rating ,2023-07-24 14:37:27
"i saw it saturday been sitting on it for the past 2 days trying to condense what i think about it fair warning i knew quite a bit about the manhattan project going in and had at least a passing familiarity with most names mentioned in the movie 

first off its a masterpiece ill be watching it again before it leaves theatres

the choice of using music so aggressively is a risky one but i think it mostly pays off the constant incessant score evolves with the movie and really helps in ramping up the tension i just wish there were a few more scenes where actors would be allowed to act without music but its a minor complaint overall

i like the mixed timelines it keeps setting up plot point after plot point each adding to the tension and the format means that they could be resolved rapid fire like dominos falling into place

cinematography was stellar i can rave about plenty of shots in the movie but the trinity test going off was easily one of the best movie going experiences ive had my theatre was dead quiet during the seconds preceding the blast and you could feel the tension

having the entire movie minus the bw scenes be from oppenheimers perspective was great too it also really drove home certain points like him not even knowing when the bomb he created was being used  we all learned about it on the radio like everyone else

one criticism i saw a few times was the  scenes i think they were tastefully done and contributed meaningfully to the plot i will agree that jean bringing him the sanskrit book and opening it straight to the quote was too much on the nose however

the final conversation the movie ends on between oppenheimer and einstein was the perfect ending to the movie the kind that stuck with me for a few days

overall the movie feels like a 25 hour anxiety attack i was drained by the end of it and i loved every moment i dont see any other movies this year topping this one for me",2023-07-24 15:43:40
i loved this movie but i noticed why i don’t watch a lot of nolan   his movies always have a puzzle quality  yes there’s payoff there’s meaning  i respect it  but not my taste,2023-07-25 17:22:10
and also like  hughie from the boys was there for literally just the purpose of being there i dont get why he needed to be there,2023-07-27 02:20:46
movie was cool relied on acting prowess for sure not sure what the movie was exactly a drama centering around oppenheimer or a film around oppenheimers life nolan movies imo are great and fun but never exactly masterclass i also got lost during the trials on who was who again also the trinity explosion couldve been more,2023-07-28 04:51:13
i did not care for the non linear story telling the only thing that brought down the movie imo,2023-08-08 23:15:32
"it was as good a movie as you’d expect from the arguably best filmmaker working today  i think he does a very good job presenting oppenheimer as a complicated and realistic character without strongly choosing a side

there are so many levels to read the story on  the idea of a brilliant scientist and engineer trying to leverage his well earned esteem into a career in the world of geopolitics where he is clearly incompetent is the most interesting to me  it is an example of the peter principle at work  the story of a man outside his depth who stuck around longer than he was useful

we’ve had a messy 70 years but there was no stopping the development of our current weapons and the fact that nobody has ended up using them yet seems to be fairly consistent with what one would expect from any reasonably rational actors nuclear weapons can only really serve a defensive purpose to counter those who already have them  in this light oppenheimer’s objections to the use of his work seem quite naive and silly  this is very well highlighted in the scene with truman where oppenheimer makes a fool of himself",2023-08-21 11:55:28
"no a movie with clips jumping without transition i dont understand what im even watching tried it a while back 10 mins in im out tried again as it won 7 oscars 40 mins in im out again

lotta love for this movie in here but i gotta say not my cup of tea didn’t really care about the whole strauss v oppenheimer rivalry by the time it came up good acting liked the einstein piece but i wish i could have that 3 hours back boring could have easily been under two hours,2023-07-21 02:54:29
" it is an extremely over engineered movie you are trying to follow whats happening but at all times artificial complexity makes it impossible to do so   

in the first hour the narrative has a premise  howcan they build the bomb there is a logical progression in that arc you understand what were going toward and why its important  

however the movie already has its signature absurd complexity so its still hard to follow  
they say that the story is built in three times the script the shooting and production and the editing  

in the script the story probably makes sense in this first act we have a clear premise so we can try to hold on to the script its an inherently difficult story i am sure but in three hours they had the time to lay it clearly if they had wanted to  

the production is very impressive but is it very good of course it looks good its well directed well acted blablabla we get it you got all the best actors of course it looks good
  
the money shots are okay just okay imo nothing like interstellar space sequences but there arent even many of them you really only get one smaller scale explosion and thats it call me shallow but part of why i went is for the grand spectacle and i feel like i didnt get it  

the imax dolby in my case technology is completely unnecessary for that reason the vast majority of the movie is in a small room with dialogue editing avatar completely justified its technology almost all of it looked amazing this looks amazing for like 3min out of 3 hours those who didnt get their premium technology ticket wont miss out on much  


the editing is where they truly took the script and then put it in a blender pressed the turbo destruction button and served us the result it is such a mess it is so impossible to follow that you just feel bad for those who had to do it   


first of all the entire movie is in a cross editing format meaning that different scenes get presented together this is the style of editing that they use for example if in a cop movie you see the bank robbers leaving and the cops leaving the station in their cars and it keeps cutting between those two scenes happening at the same time  

in oppenheimer the cross editing occurs between 4 or 5 different time periods of course this already makes it harder to follow than editing between different places at the same time  
some periods also have different visual identities with one being black and white because 

the periods also refer to each other since some are trials or some not trials idk like a hearing or whatever i never understood that clearly  

so that is the macro structure of the movie in how it presents its narration cross editing between 45 time periods  

now on a sequence scale which is smaller we keep cutting between scenes all the time as fast as possible there is a complex subject of discussion being discussed very fast and i never had time to finish understanding a sequence before we moved on to the next very fast sequence  

there are almost no pauses in the movie it moves so fast you dont have time to blink if you want to have a chance at understanding it 

by the end of the building the bomb act i had forgotten what was happening in the other timelines which are the subject of the next acts when i left the cinema i had forgotten robert downey jrs role how he got into the movie and story and why   

i could not tell you right now what the story is about past the first hour except for a very vague its oppenheimers trial about if what he did was right or not but if you asked me about the exact characters the exacts sequence of events i would have literally no idea  

 it all becomes a word soup and at some point i just gave up on understanding it im sure i could understand it if it was presented it clearly but the never ending stream of words cut music sound effects visual effects just start to hurt the brain
   
on a scene scale i dont think ive ever seen such fast dialogues the movie is 3 hours long but there are so many words to fit in every dialogue has to be edited as fast as possible before moving on to the next one this is how current celebrity vloggers edit their videos about going shopping why does a historical movie with very complex subjects need to be edited in the same style

some of the techniques used are actually interesting for example at one point there is a flashback of two characters talking but we dont need to actually know what they said so as the second character responds he gets cut mid sentence which i liked   

but it is the extreme density of it that completely spoils the creativity  

i dont know what to say anymore if people say its great and perfectly understandable then id challenge them to write 10 lines clearly presenting the story characters and events in a chronological manner because i dont think its possible",2023-07-22 16:13:34
people are afraid to say that this movie was underwhelming,2023-07-24 20:51:52
i enjoyed dungeons and dragons and  and boots more than this and i like historical and drama movies but this was kind of boring  i didnt really care about anyone because they spent so little time on everyone i feel like i didnt even learn much about oppenheimer himself,2023-07-24 11:26:52
i really wish this movie was an hour shorter it dragged so much i kept checking my watch every fifteen minutes once we got to the trinity test,2023-07-27 00:53:04
"average id rate it a 510 but only because i really enjoyed being able to see so many great scientific minds portrayed on screen 


the pacing was insane it felt like i was scrolling through tiktok honestly no scene lasted more than 60 seconds characters were never allowed to sit with their feels it was all just this rapid fire barrage of events 


the two plots are both fine on their own but one needed to be secondary to the other as it stands theyre both given equal screen time which considering its 3 hours long just made it feels like this was two movies cut together 


but overall i liked it all the performances were fantastic

this movie was so stuffy and boring to me i got tricked by the trailer leading me to think that the movie was going to be more action packed and focusing on the science of the atomic bomb as someone super into physics and chemistry silly me though having read the book i should have known it was going to be a 3 hour boring film switching flashbacks and arguments and conversations every 5 minutes the only entertaining shot of the bomb exploding which wasnt even over hiroshima lasted what like 5 minutes i really wanted something like interstellar or the imitation game but instead i got 3 hours that i will never get back,2023-07-22 19:02:20
are people insisting this movie blew them away and that you have to see it in imax trolling or did i watch a completely different movie more than half of the movie is literally dialogue in a room i actually hope someone does a time analysis of this to prove how absurd it is to say thats how it needs to be seen this was the most unimpressive movie ive ever watched in imax and ive seen a lot,2023-07-23 06:40:41

"i really enjoyed the movie but i feel slightly cheated with the previews of the bomb detonation and what was on film i kept anticipating that scene and then the movie was over it kind of distracted me the last 30 minutes or so 

that said there are no other issues with the movie for me great acting across the board i got to need out with the level of details being historical record great  there were a few good jokes but the audience was too in tune with the feeling of the movie so those jokes didnt land in my viewing

i actually loved the pace of the film i am one of those who felt like it barely seemed like 2 hours the music was great at building tension with a lot of music literally sounding like a ticking time bomb visuals were good at satisfying but a little cgi sprinkled in would have gone a long way hats off on what they got on film though

"i just saw it on imax an what an experience

few comments i have
thought the editing was weird at the beginning of the movie we were shown all the events that lead to the trinity test and all the consequences of it regarding the h bomb for the latter some in bw and some in color but the test happened at the end of the second act leaving the third only with the consequences but now showing in color some scenes that were previously bw
part of the appeal for me at the beginning of the movie was feeling everything was connected to the test and wouldve preferred it if it happened at the very end

the explosion didnt look that menacing everything in that scene was perfect tho

the nudity was a bit unnecesary 

3 hours was too long

i think i bought too much into the hype and i wish i wouldve gone into this with a more level head ive always loved nolans movies loved thembut thisthis just never connected with me i cant explain it either which is the most frustrating part maybe when i rewatch it things will change but for now im disappointed,2023-07-28 00:08:15
very good movie but feel like it wasnt as well crafted as nolans other works and suffers for it at times felt like two movies tied together and he didnt quite nail it good performances though and i think ill appreciate it more on a second viewing,2023-07-29 20:44:07
one thing i didnt get was what the senate hearing with strauss was about what did the senators vote on and in which way did strauss lose in the end it probably was stated in the movie but i probably missed it or forgot among all the other plotlines and time jumps,2023-08-05 09:49:27
i really can’t believe so many people here are praising it like it was some masterpiece it was well made but def not a 1010 movie it just wasn’t that entertaining imo was much more of a political drama than anything solid movie but just such a slow burn i think i enjoyed tetris much more,2023-07-21 04:16:10
"i may be the only one here but i really disliked this movie i thought the dialogue for the first couple hours was just impossible felt like i was watching something on 15 speed with no more than a 3 second scene cut to catch a breathe or take in what was going on i understand there was a lot to pack in there but the speed itself was a bit much the exposition was so dry for me 

the scene with florence was cringe and every scene after with her was cringe i get that they had to build her into the story as part of oppies demise for his broken heart and the connection to the communist but it was not hitting for me

the bomb scene was a big buildup to something not so grand the gym scene was the best scene in the movie but nothing was gripping me even then but i am glad they tried to include some terror with it but they could have went a lot deeper with the shame and guilt 

i felt this movie was a hollow autistic reading of a long wikipedia article that attempted to humanize and give a story to oppenheimers character through a hyperamericanism they could have focused a little more on the guilt and terror for the japanese people instead of the political brawl that felt almost adam mckay style at times this wasn’t a huge cabinet position they made it out to be to be fighting for

the score was beautiful the acting was incredible especially by emily blunt and murphy the costuming was beautiful as well 
the albert scenes were a bit corny to me but the last scene was the best one 

as someone who spent many years studying the war i just didn’t like the narrow portrayal of this story 

410 from this peanut gallery",2023-07-21 05:58:35
am i the only one that didnt like it what is this a lawyer movie everything was well put together but cmon man half an image of a nuke kinda confusing with all the time lines 610,2023-07-21 06:29:34
1010 christopher nolan you’ve done it again cillian murphy rdj emily blunt and ludwig göranssons score are the stand outs,2023-07-21 10:20:58
florence pugh anyone see it in 4k imax you could see her back hair lol,2023-07-21 11:24:01
the movie didn’t have to be 3 hours long pacing was somehow super fast and so slow at the same time so many characters to keep track of especially at the end with the drawn out court scene he just became the destroyer of worlds and we’re supposed to care that his security clearance isn’t getting renewed i get that it’s his reputation but he just changed the world someone please explain this to me,2023-07-21 14:43:32
the whole last act with strauss was a total dud for me and honestly did not care for his inclusion of the movie at all it felt like a total drag and i wanted more of oppenheimer dealing with the aftermath of what he created,2023-07-22 01:03:46
"am i the only one who didn’t really like it acting was amazing but i could barely even follow the movie jumping back from different points of time so often it didn’t really feel like it had a focused plot either like the conflict and goals kept changing 

then the bomb part came and i was like oh yeah bomb time it was cool but nothing crazy and i kept thinking about drake and josh for some reason then the big twist about who the bad guy is because oppy hurt his feelings then another hour of political stuff and the end i really wanted to like it but it was just sooooo long i feel like the chernobyl mini series is like what i hoped this would be with how they handled the court stuff explaining reactors and radiation action etc anyway just my 2 cents",2023-07-22 05:23:04
one of the best films i’ve ever seen,2023-07-24 03:54:22
"good movie the  scenes were unnecessary imo

also sucks i got spoiled that they nuked japan",2023-07-24 05:00:30
"i would give it a 710 and ill just paste in my thoughts from another sub

it needed a good 30 minutes cut off it primarily off the beginning distracting editing decisions the jumping around in time i just dont get the point or decision in making parts in black and white its mostly the future stuff with rdj and i just dont get it if it were everything in the flash forward scenes fine if it were of every scene in the future with just rdj then fine if it were only the most distant past scenes fine but it isnt its just random it felt like

and another inconsistency about it if you start off the movie with this artsy fartsy this is how his mind works this is how he thinks abstract imagery shaky lines and circles and stars moving around even if i find that sort of stuff personally annoying and pointlessly artsy for artsy sake if you are going to do it then be consistent with it if this is how you show how he thinks then show it the whole time show it overwhelming him during the points in time when you know he was thinking the most under the most pressure while as head of the project when figuring out the science etc but its just randomly at the beginning and then pops up again a little towards the end

also there is no need to see this in imax like its been advertised

where was the conclusion you made us sit through the overall pointless early stuff in the movie about his life but we dont get even text on screen at the end telling us so and so went on to  and died in 19 there are  nuclear weapons in the world today many of which are capable of  megatons etc etc that sort of thing after all that it somehow felt like it ended without a conclusion

and last and what im sure will get me the most flak and admittedly maybe its just me being very specific but if ever there was a need for the use of cgi for something that you just cant pull off with practical effects the trinity  one of them there is actual video of the test seen it all my life most of you probably have too we know historically and factually what the explosion looked like he uses an im sorry but some slow motion close up shot of a small explosion that was probably just a gas can blowing up and passes that off as a nuclear test no just no

yet it was a good movie well two thirds of it was a good movie wouldnt watch it again id rather just watch a good documentary on him and the subject again seen lots of those already",2023-07-24 22:58:59
"after 3 hours did i really get a sense of what made oppenheimer tick and how he felt about being part of such a momentous part of history sort of but not really i got some impressive sound mixing a few truly gripping sequences of cinema and about 2 hours of middle aged men having an hr review 

nolan’s best not even in his top 5",2023-07-27 08:49:12
"i just got back from seeing it loved everything focused on the science and development of the bomb and the ethical implications

i strongly disliked the remaining biopic elements about ops communist connections and the subsequent harassment this makes it feel like two films woven into one and i feel that the most interesting elements which could have been explored were sacrificed for the mundane biographical themes

i was also expecting the tension after the trinity tests to lead into an impressive technical hiroshima scene perhaps imagined by oppenheimer not sure where this expectation came from but i just felt it needed a bigger punch",2023-07-29 20:45:29
"it was visually beautiful but i had a few issues with the movie

1 there was very limited discussion of science and the dialogue that was there was very poor for instance“i read your paper on molecules” really molecules i would have preferred if it felt more like we really watching real scientists and not soap opera characters for a movie about one of the biggest scientific discoveries of all time it didn’t really teach me anything about science

2 the tone of the movie was so melodramatic and silly the whole tortured genius thing at the beginning the swirling lights in his mind the scene where he first met his wife felt so unreal like no two humans would every speak like that

none of these things are really issues and many movies could take on this tone to good effect but given the subject matter of this movie i think it was a poor choice and detracted from my enjoyment of it a lot i thought the overall plot was interesting and i did like the editing choices but i just wish the movie had a bit more realism",2023-07-31 04:00:06
"i just watched it and im unsure of whether i liked it or not its too long very heavily dialogue driven and as with every nolan movie the sound is mixed in a way that makes much of the dialogue difficult to discern theres also almost no point of watching it in imax except for maybe that one scene or a few topographic shots here and there

but i was absolutely blown away by the performance of the cast some of the notable standouts to me where robert downey matt damon florence pugh benny safdie and of course cillian murphy 

i feel like i need to rewatch every nolan movie at home with subtitles to determine my opinion of it and this one is no exception",2023-07-21 08:48:46
"its a shame they had to butcher real history to make oppenheimer more likable  he never picked the poisoned apple up and tossed it the teacher simply didnt eat it somehow people found out and he was nearly expelled he was saved by his parents who gave money to the school

another scene is the discussion of criticality or chain reaction originally it was oppenheimers acquaintance who told him about a test that was successful oppenheimer dismissed it as impossible and only upon seeing it did he realize how it worked",2023-07-22 23:20:50
the movie was hard to follow i got the general gist of the plot but couldnt pick out the details because of the poor sound mixing at some parts especially the beginning i had a hard time hearing what the characters were actually saying you would think nolan would make it easy to make out what the characters are saying in such a dialogue heavy movie but i guess not i still admired the acting cinematography and music but it was a bit dull i wish the courtroom scene played a more minor role in the story because i found those parts very boring and hard to follow,2023-07-23 08:55:05
"movie could have been shorter acting was good 

its a movie i would have rather watched at home",2023-07-23 20:31:01
its really weird so many people now  call interstellar a masterpiece and his best work when it was released they were really nitpicking it and making it out to be a film full of flaws incredible to witness the cult following it gained and how good it aged i feel the same thing will happen to oppenheimer though it has few flaws it will be classic in the near future,2023-07-27 14:52:14
should of been a mini series like chernobyl,2023-07-27 19:01:51
i found the film to be exciting for 20 minutes and then boring for the next 20 on a constant loop the nonlinearity added nothing to the film apart from revealing what oppy said to einstein at the end i also found that there was unnecessary attention on oppenheimers personal life that added nothing to the movie beautifully shot and acted though,2023-07-27 23:25:17
this was nolans best film some real substance and some challenging questions for the audience perhaps not so friendly to streaming audiences,2023-07-28 00:02:28
"so the ironman was there only as villain of the story that gave oppie  by extension the audience a win at the last right also ironmans aide was clearly team oppie all the way in rdj killed it though

despite the fact that oppie knew that makers of the bomb dont have any say in how it is used and truman telling oppie that no one cares who made the bomb when they know the guy who dropped it both men knew exactly what they did  signed up for but wanted to be reassured by people around them that they did their duty now the beauty of moral conundrums is it can drag on for life 

was oppie a player because florence pughs character didnt make sense to me it was very much like forrest gumps girlfriend only for nerds 

i loved the touch they did with einstein i also loved how what oppie  albert talked about was far more important than some senator because they are too smart to talk about politics

nolan has ability to pull your focus in and he did better than tenet 

nothing great about music theres no segment thats like no time for caution or other interstellar or inception themes 

genius is not wisdom is such a powerful line oppie is a scientific genius who almost killed a guy because he was annoyed by him

a good movie",2023-07-29 17:18:56

theres literally no point in seeing this in imax the movie was solid but felt like a big opportunity for visuals in testingdeveloping the bomb overally pretty disappointed ngl,2023-07-22 06:05:07
the actual trinity explosion felt so underwhelming when the whole movie has been building up to it i enjoyed the movie but to me it felt like if in titanic it only showed the ship scraping the iceberg and then the rest of the movie focuses on old lady rose,2023-07-22 08:28:01
"i love nolan and was excited about this film i gave it an 810 in the poll and id definitely recommend people go see it the acting was superb and seeing it in a theater will blow you away with the sound alone this film should win oscars and it likely will


that being said this is not the best nolan film ive ever seen and i definitely have some issues with it


the biggest problem is a lack of focus this couldshould have been a film about the manhattan project theres more than enough story there to fill an entire television series instead we get a very long convoluted story about a cabinet appointment of a character who isnt central to the manhattan project at all the atomic bomb explosion happens with about an hour left that shouldve been the climax of the film not the end of the 2nd act on top of that there are a lot of characters in this film and a lot of them are unnecessary and serve to make the plot overly complicated


but yeah visually stunning and very impressive sounding with great acting by everyone if you havent seen it yet i think youll have a good time if you temper your expectations a bit


downvote away",2023-07-22 19:49:20
this movie was honestly pretty mid i would have walked out if i had gone by myself the politicalcourtroom rivalry was the worst part of the movie for me and they chose to spend what time they had there instead of oppenheimer as a man and his personal relationships with other characters which was much more interesting also i wanted to know about the actual creation of the bomb which felt completely glossed over i dont care about his political believes or his reputation,2023-07-22 04:59:10
"went for the barbie  oppenheimer combo today oppenheimer man what a bust thats kind of it i was falling asleep at certain points not because i was tired more because i was bored

im aware what this kind of movie is but it ventures into ground and breaks so surface level that i cant actually get hooked in its going all over the place all the time the time jumps skips unsure what period youre in its a mess honestly at a point i found there were so many characters and people in the background that i wasnt quite sure who was who at certain points it reminds me of the chaotic nature of uncut gems but it doesnt need to be

im in the minority reddit and the film community absolutely adore this film i need more from a film than wow actor is good and the camera direction is fantastic 

what i dont accept is more time spent on a  unneeded  scene than there was in the entire film even mentioning radiation it was such a glossed over topic i coulda sworn that guy running out the bunker to get a raw look would have resulted in something happening but nothing happened this was the vibe throughout much of the film pearl harbour had about 3 seconds dedicated to it i know this is about the main man but come on can we explain a bit about the background its a three hour film for  sake",2023-07-23 00:15:51
"as someone that read the first handful of chapters of american prometheus and is generally interested in the subject matter this was pretty disappointing for me unfortunately  

i constantly felt like every scene was a missed opportunity 

i never felt like it truly came together and overall i think to me this felt lesser than the sum of its parts 

good acting for the most part scenes were well shot if it truly had zero cgi that’s impressive all good 

that said given the man and given the deadly serious subject matter this movie felt like it soft balled everything 

to me this movie ironically felt like a very pop sci clickbait kind of adaptation 

which is funny given the framing device and the whole conflict between the government’s concerns about oppenheimer’s words and actions that the movie itself would also sort of hold back on the horrors and gravitas in its retelling 

it just kind of felt more like a ron howard movie than nolan to me like obviously his style is here and in the end i’m glad he a nonamerican made this movie instead of an american director

they might’ve gone even softer on portraying the us government in a nicer light or something so i’m still glad this is nolan i just think the story never came together well enough for me and i didn’t find it very interesting in terms of cinematography

i’ve also never liked ludwig goransson’s music so that was almost a complete miss for me i’m overall glad that zimmer is on dune but i’ve really missed him in nolan’s last two projects 

i’ll definitely watch it again when my girlfriend and our friends do a barbenheinmer double feature but on a first watch i felt kind of disappointed and dissatisfied with a lot of the choices and for me it never really came together as a story or movie very well which sucks because i want to love every movie i ever watch but especially those i already am primed to enjoy like this one with subject matter i’m interested in and a director i usually mostly enjoy 

maybe i’ll have different thoughts as i sit with it longer and when i watch it again but for now i think i’ll say i found it mostly unsatisfying wanting it to tap into untapped potential but overall glad it exists and appreciative of the craft and performances 

wish i’d enjoyed it more",2023-07-23 22:20:51
"poor characterization and pacing nolan really cant build an interesting character other than the joker to save his life 

he relies way too much on talented actors on that front hes good at making plots but in this case he was limited because he was trying to be historically faithful",2023-07-28 04:14:14
this movie couldve been way better if they just get rid of the strauss plotline and just focus entirely on the creation and detonation of abomb as a result the movie felt very unfocused with most scenes not allowed to breath the movie felt less drama and way more thriller with how its edited,2023-08-05 18:10:14
"this film has me kind of in a knot really i really want to like it but it is messy i think the 3 narratives aspect was good on paper but just messy in execution because the films flow is chaotic 

i like cillian murphy but he is not a main lead in a movie kinda guy because i think a different actor would have done more i know part of his character line was he was a martyr but murphy does not really do presence well i think he gets kind of cucked by his peers in this film especially against rdj who dominates this film in a good way

if rdj was not in this film it would be unbearable honestly because he is the best actor in this film though the supporting cast was very strong murphy just feels weak so the supporting cast actually raise him up a bit

its too long and honestly i was expecting more existential crisis but barbie had me covered at that",2023-07-21 21:16:43
"first movie i watched in cinema this year that i would give a bad rating 

it just feels like the movie doesnt know what it wants to be and so it drags on for 3 hours if it is the story of building the atom bomb then great leave out the entire hearing and court sections afterwards if it is a political thriller then do it the other way around if it is about the life of oppenheimer then include his past and later life more and cut down on the rdj plotline  

the music was irritating the whole way through it just wont stop can it quiet down please",2023-07-27 22:23:54
i’m a huge christopher nolan fan but this movie was a huge masturabatory circle  as is this thread and all the downvotes and ostracizing when someone is saying anything remotely critical shame on this thread and this sub it should be a safe and honest place to discuss cinema and instead it’s a firing squad for anyone that’s not willing to come and grab their ,2023-08-25 20:59:46
the bomb scene is so dissapointing you can even see huge sparks around it like its a miniature fire filmed with a big lens no sense of scale nothing like the actual footage on youtube which is 100x more impressive if theres one thing we were expecting from nolan is that for sure the big explosion scene would be badass it was 5 seconds of underwhelming close up gasoline explosion,2023-07-25 20:57:41
incredibly boring movie very underwhelming hardly any scenes building the bombs dont bother going to imax because 99 of it is people arguing in rooms,2023-07-28 04:14:51
"initially as soon as i heard about the films production i wanted to see it  
i really wanted to see the movie not because its directed by nolan although i did like interstellar but because i like biopics  


apparently it was a mistake to think that this was either a biopic about oppenheimer or a story about the manhattan project  
if its a film about oppenheimer why doesnt it show his childhood and teenage years up until his death  
if its a film about nuclear weapons why not show more of the technicalscientific challenges we see almost nothing about the bomb itself  
i think it would be better to call it the oppenheimer hearing because apparently in this film the main point is this safety hearing  
and even if the film was called that they never explained what that audition was about why its important what possibilitiesroles this security clearance gives the person who has it  
another point that i didnt liked is the constant flashbacks normally i dont have a problem with multiple flashbacks but here i couldnt find any logic behind it normally when there are flashbacks its just after a discussion between two characters that calls up something in the past a moment when the character is thinking about a past moment  
here the scenes have nothing to do with each other we see oppenheimer filling glasses with marbles and then we go on to the trial with no connection whatsoever

x200b

last week i went to see barbie i said then wow this was not a great movie i am sure that oppenheimer will be much better

now that i have seen both movies i take back my words barbie is better than oppenheimer",2023-07-28 14:52:45
"not impressed at all there was so much going on that at times it was hard to follow and nothing felt like it was told well to me this would have perfectly if it was a 6 partner mini series like chernobyl it only got good with the twist in the senate hearing

"i can’t be the only one who was dissappointed by this movie it’s pretty great but in interviews people were talking about it like it was the film of the century and… it was kinda bland imho bit of a letdown 


especially the trinity test we’ve been hearing for months how nolan refused to use cgi we all joked he was gonna detonate a real bomb 1015 min prior tensions starts to build then the  finally about to happen i’m on the edge of my seat i turn to my friend and say “this is it” aaaand… meh i paid imax tickets for this honestly i don’t think i would’ve missed much if i’d seen it in a regular screen


also was anyone else weirded out by the pacing at the beginning felt like i was watching a really long trailer just bits and pieces of footage instead of the actual full scene 


it’s a really great flick cillian murohy kills it obviously as does damon definitely going to see it again and maybe my opinion changes then but it’s not on my top 3 nolan movies of all time not even my top 5",2023-07-21 07:13:05
"watched this in belgium in english i think the opinions between american viewers and the rest of the world are going to be stark near the end there were people actually leaving before the movie ended because i assume they were bored from the amount of dialogue and politics that the movie finishes with 

i think the movie has been totally overhyped oversold and misrepresented in a way the memes and marketing might lead people to expect a different sort of film while it is an objectively amazing piece of film i think people not familiar or in tune with american politics might get left behind 

mind you i think nolan did a stellar job managing to tell such a complex story in a relatively short 3 hours there were so many different characters coming in and out all with their own hidden agendas popping into the past and the future all the time its actually quite remarkable that the audience is able to keep up at all",2023-07-21 10:00:11
"i really disliked the movie got more knowledge about the dangers of atomic weapons from metal gear solid ngl
they did florence pugh’s character dirty i think it was odd how they left out the fact that oppenheimer proposed to her twice during their relationship instead of the very real connection to her that irl oppy had we instead see him have 2 one night stands with her then 2 hours later she’s brought up during the interrogation as if his connection to her was damning but we never see this in the film
a lot of the writing was kinda cringe the “i am become death” thing in the middle of the trinity test
rdj should’ve been petting a white cat towards the end he literally rubs his hands together like dr doofenshmirtz when he’s revealed to be the ‘villain’ of the story not to mention the “maybe oppy  einstein were talking ab things more important than you” line that one guy said to rdj’s character in the last few minutes felt like dialogue in a tumblr story where everybody claps at the end all 2 women have zero screen time  only serve the story insofar as they have  w oppenheimer emily blunts character unironically goes from ‘ wife out of a boomer comic stripfinally supports oppenheimer when he creates the bomb’ i have more to say but jesus what a disappointment this movie was for me i didn’t see any real character study or anything else that other ppl got out of this movie  i feel like i’m missing out on smth fundamental ab it last thing oppy in the first act as a student dreams of the atom no joke he just dreams  sees atoms  string theory bc he’s j super super smart ig so cringe also the nonstop scenes of ppl just spewing exposition like the guy interviewing rdj “and then what happened rdj how did that make our main cast feel what did they do about it” okay i’m finished thanks for reading",2023-07-21 20:16:16

"just out of oppenheimer and i hated it i seem to be in the minority though just thought the whole thing was a self indulgent mess   
  
its confusingly shot in that some scenes are out of sequence for what reason i dont know  other than its nolans thing but then he makes rdjs scenes black and white for some reason which at first makes you think its the past but his scenes are actually in the future its just that they use black and white for his perspective for whatever reason and combined with the non linear telling is ugh  
  
every piece of dialogue is exposition and spoken like they are on fast forward and rushing to get to the next scene if it isnt exposition its sexposition with him saying the destroyer of worlds line in a cringey  scene with florence pugh who is for some reason  for 90 of her screen time including a weird scene in a deposition where she feels really out of place  
  
the two women in the film feel borderline extraneous the film never stops long enough to explore things it raises like why the dynamics in his relationships were weird  
  
they didnt do a good job building the tension between rdj and oppenheimer because at the end of the movie i was still vaguely confused about why their beef was so deep other than oppenheimer made a joke about isotopes and he thought he said something to einstein about him i didnt really know there was much of an issue at all until rdj went into full saturday morning cartoon soliloquy then the weird wink at the camera moment when they mentioned jfk like they were teasing a future avengers movement or something  
  
it didnt feel like it had anything new to say it was barely a biopic and more a collection of intellectual conversations in different rooms at breakneck speed",2023-07-23 15:16:33
"i would just begin with saying that maybe the movie was a bit too overhyped for what it actually is and if you disagree you should probably stop reading
  
the plot feels too mixed up showing so many different points at the same time it feels like were watching a different story while at the same time it doesnt it was particularly a bit difficult to understand what exactly was going on in a few scenes along with who exactly were a few people were  
  
from a cinema point of view it accomplishes a lot of things from beautiful cinematography and actingetc but in terms of enjoyability its just not quite there the long runtime doesnt really help either it just falls a bit apart in the story telling department or maybe thats just me it just feels like a movie that i would enjoy a lot of more when watching it at home at my own leisure contrary to what nolan and some people have to say now you would probably argue that its necessary to watch it in the cinema for the bomb testing but i feel like that part was pretty underwhelming but once again maybe thats just me maybe my experience  turned a bit sour having to hold in the urge to  until the interval but it wasnt quite fun afterwards either  
  
its a good movie no doubt but theres just too much stuff going on which can lead to confusion and being confused isnt really all that fun i might just watch it again when its available digitally to compare it to the theatrical experience  
  
i would just like to add on it by saying that the movie managed to show just how terrifying the bomb is and how terrified the people were but at the same time it just feels like theres something missing for the whole thing which was present in a few moments and ofcourse the actual quote given by oppenheimer in real life which just gives me the chills  
            
we knew the world would not be the same a few people laughed a few people cried most people were silent i remembered the line from the hindu scripture the bhagavadgita vishnu is trying to persuade the prince that he should do his duty and to impress him takes on his multiarmed form and says now i am become death the destroyer of worlds i suppose we all thought that one way or another",2023-07-23 15:59:05

if the entire 3 hours of dialogue was actually engaging and there was zero bomb scene i could have loved it the dialogue was so boring that they constantly had to have music playing behind every word that sounded like it was building up to some grand revelation after every sentence the words had no meaning or impact on their own and were even worse once you noticed the one dimensional trick they used all movie trying to make you feel something with music instead of characters good story and dialogue

i absolutely love well made movies with just dialogue did a movie like before sunrise need to have music playing the entire time to feel emotion and a connection to the characters",2023-07-24 19:09:30
cant believe people fail to pay an ounce of attention to the movie get confused and then conclude that its a bad movie,2023-07-27 12:24:15
"it’s wild people are calling this boring but it makes sense in an environment where we have like ten fast and the furious movies
 
 
 
 
this was like half historical biopic half an episode of house of cards 
 
 
 
some of the story was a bit disjoined but overall it was an interesting and well made film",2023-07-30 19:07:09
"as much as i love pretty much all nolan films this was my worst experience at cinemas ever felt unbearable dialogs just didnt stop for a second which contributes to make the film feel like it was never going to end and it actually didnt 3 hours that in my mind felt like 4 or 5 by the trial i was completely exhausted
worst of all i expected something of hiroshima and nagasaki other than just more dialog about it the only detonation was an underwealming explosion that looked like 90 special effects
im not trying to be a dck about this i reallly expected oppie to blow my mind like other nolan films but this was just painful wanted to walk out of the theater but my gf who was also bored to death told me not to later i found out she thought i was enjoying it so refused to leave just for me",2023-08-19 22:56:55
christopher nolan really needs to get back with collaborating with other writers his directing cinematography and acting is all on point but damnit his movies feel like mash potato storytelling also christ the man cant write romance to save his life,2023-08-23 00:06:55
it  i learned nothing scientific i wasn’t entertained and the explosion was  i didn’t even get to see his  as i thought i would,2023-07-27 23:31:01
"lots to say 

overall the movie was good 

the entire third act with west wing style drama was overdramatized and boring 

cillian was great 

emily blunt was great at times overacting in others  

matt damon should stop doing southern accents 

the little side stores with the first wife and the physicists were great 

casey affeck  unnecessary distraction 
rami malek  unnecessary distraction 

6510",2023-07-21 04:52:57
510 too long,2023-07-21 16:07:52
movie was boring they summarized the climax by saying they dropped the nukes on telephone—if nolan would’ve actually shown the explosionimpact of it oppenheimer’s actions would’ve been significantly more impactful after instead we get a phone call… on one of the most impactful explosions of human civilization…,2023-07-21 19:51:56
"disliked this a lot im quite invested in the history of this era and i cant believe how dirty nolan has done so many people everyone rattled off exposition and surfacelevel history constantly for the first 2 hours then we rush through the trinity preparation to get to the massively underwhelming explosion you can go watch trinity test footage it looks much grander than what nolan achieved here i guess you start to understand the difference between 25kt of tnt vs however many 0000something kt nolan could use it just wasnt impressive even if the silence was just reading about the test and accounts from those there will give a more true and impressive mental image of how it actually looked

beyond that we get to a boggeddown finale in a rivalry thats hard to care about because the film spends so much time jumping between timelines from the beginning that we never get to dwell on why exactly the straussoppenheimer rivalry is so important to both ok its about one getting a cabinet position and the other not being convicted of being a commie but do we really care about that we dont get to know their history at all beyond the hbomb talks and half of that is spent trying to set up the thinly strung relationships oppie had with others dr hills support for oppie also seems to come from nowhere given how little time we spend with him but its like nolan has selfinserted here he immediately starts with oppie as a visionary who sees what he feels and is burdened by visions of the hidden world of quantum mechanics but abandons it quickly nolan sees a great man but im not sure he knows why oppenheimer not anyone elese involved was as great as they were if he did we wouldnt brush over some of the most incredible achievements of 20thcentury physics and have them play 2nd fiddle to oppie every time they come up if you read quotes from that time youll also find that people were saying things far more profound and insightful and human than nolans stiff unnatural dialogue

fundamentally i hope someone comes along and does a miniseries about the manhattan project so we can get a much more faithful much grander display of what actually went down theres too much to explore in a 3hour film that also wants to mainly be about one man

and thats the other issue oppenheimers demons were numerous but he also had a much depper and much more troubled heart than the film even begins to cut into he grew up sickly and depressed and it haunted him but barring the one scene after jean dies we dont really see how he dragged his own selfburden along with him much before the bomb was used also we dont see how enthusiastic he was about using radiation as a weapon

details matter in history lots of little things add up and cant just be treated as namedrops for those with surfacelevel knowledge the deep cuts cut deep and let a lot out a really good biopic like first man knows this and takes the time to develop those little details possibly the only time oppenheimer achieves this is when he has a vision of the auditorium being bombed while cutting it with a patriotic speech that sort of duality feels like it should have been much more present throughout

oppenheimer fizzed as a film it didnt live up to its own promise and it seems nolan cant uncouple his own idea of a great man from himself and once hes read and absorbed something at a surface level he wants to lecture you on it he has characters who speak in ultrabasic physics because he himself isnt a scientist but likes to imagine that all it takes is knowing that little bit and magicking exposition out of thin air to explain everything but reality doesnt work like that and its the insightful and personally deep conversations and the messes and accidents and fumbles that keep things interesting a waste of a good cast maybe next time",2023-07-21 23:51:40
"as someone who has deep dived on the trinity test the nuclear arms race archive footage etc this movie was a huge disappointment i was told i needed to shell out 18 for a ticket to see it in large format and then i got a biopic why cant a biopic show the scale and gravity of the explosion anyways wouldnt it make the seriousness of it more understandable to casual audiences 

i dont want to hear this no cgi purity  either what about interstellar and inception you could even argue those movies perfectly prepared nolan to do the explosion justice show the hydrogen bomb too while youre at it show how far nuclear arms evolved alongside the growing guilt oppenheimer felt as he got older 

the entire straus storyline felt entirely pointless too me they couldve cut every single black and white scene and the movie wouldve lost nothing its almost like nolan didnt get the budget or access to archive footage he wanted so he had to pivot to the political story to fill the gaps idk this movie was maybe an 810 for me but the blatant false marketing about how i had to see it on a massive screen brings it down to a 610",2023-07-25 03:24:12
"theres a line in this movie where one of the characters says youre not selfimportant youre actually important this line stuck with me because i think this is how the movie actually sees itself oppenheimer is an important person and nukes are serious business so any movie about oppenheimer and nukes is allowed to be as bloated and selfimportant as it wants

this movie was not good none of the drama was compelling even after three hours of watching this tripe i didnt feel like i knew or understood any of these characters on a deep or familiar level

the movie barely even tries to make the audience connect with oppenheimer oppenheimers sympathies with the communist party are barely explored oppenheimers romantic relationships are barely explored oppenheimers attempt to poison his professor is glossed over oppenheimers guilt over the nuke is used to bludgeon the audience over the head but not in a way that actually teaches anybody anything i know he feels remorse but in real life remorse tends to be a nuanced emotion oppenheimers remorse is presented to the audience in the form of ear  and unexpected nudity

when truman called oppenheimer a crybaby i shouldve been outraged instead i was like yo this dudes got a point this wouldve been impossible had nolan actually given me any reason to connect with oppenheimers character

bad movie 410",2023-07-25 07:25:14
"some moments in the film that were supposed to be very deep just had me rolling my eyes for example in the last scene the i believe we did line didnt need to be so delayed it was already obvious he was going to say that honestly a cringeworthy way to end the film

nolans batman banter type of humor didnt really fit

the timeline with the flashbacks etc wasnt entirely clear

the whole things about his wivesgirlfriends is a bit rushed why didnt the first one want flowers why did the second one agree to leave her husband 5 seconds after meeting oppenheimer 

the purpose of the hearings wasnt entirely clear either but not sure if that was because i lost focus

good film apart from that",2023-07-25 22:53:42
"watched in a 1570mm imax theater with 1431 resolution cant be the only one that thought this format was completely unnecessary for what was basically a mccarthy era legal drama

presenting everything from oppenheimers pov felt a bit gimmicky the movie could have really done more with the trinity test show us some cgi atom fission and at least shown us the hiroshima bombing and civilian casualties cgi aerial shots of a nuked city etc",2023-07-27 13:29:12
"  
technically excellent movie however it became a chore to watch and was overhyped imo it wasnt a particularly intriguing or even gripping movie the last hour was simply a yelling and argument simulator that made the same point ad nauseam and for the most part was redundant 

the marketing hype insisting it needs to be watched on imax presumably for the big trinity explosion fooled us all again a technically excellent scene however would have been perfectly fine on a regular screen

acting was very good throughout however i cant shake the feeling matt damon was a misstep in casting  he just didnt suit the role for me",2023-07-29 07:49:44
i gotta be honest it was a good movie but i like i’m sure many others bought tickets to be wowed by the nuclear bomb test personally i thought it was underwhelming all the hype and build up and i just couldn’t help but feel disappointed i had to go back to the actual footage it’s incredible and it still gives me chills left me thinking why couldn’t they match it imo maybe if they used cgi they could have really put it into perspective how powerfulmassive it actually was,2023-08-19 02:54:02
"people talking in imax

i thought this was just generally dull and a different director might have chosen to put something more interesting in front of their 70mm 15 perf camera than men in suits talking apparently thats how they built the atomic bomb they just talked about whether oppenheimer was a communist or not for hours and then poof there is a bomb but how do you cinematically show the scale of destruction and the horror unleashed you have the main character learn about it while listening to the radio  chris seriously why is it an interesting question whether this one guy is good or gasp even a communist what about the thousands and thousands of people who died holy  i had no idea the atom bomb could be so boring",2023-08-20 02:48:49
just watching this movie now and definitely disappointed considering the hype choppy poor character development not a movie i would watch again,2023-11-27 01:22:16
"obviously nolan should stick to his own fictional creations because his idea of an interesting story from history isnt as interesting as he thinks it is

knowing the subject matter i was expecting it to make for a rather dull movie but it was perhaps more dull than i expected

many of the actors looked so weird that it was distracting no idea what was going on in the makeup department for this film

amazingly i felt they did a poor job of developing oppenheimers character its never really shown why people revere him so much prebomb they just keep saying they do over and over that doesnt work",2023-11-28 05:19:07
eh  i walked out after 2 hours  what a boring movie,2023-07-21 04:35:39
its a good not great film ive also learned watching a nolan film on opening day is the worst way to experience it,2023-07-21 10:26:59
"oppenheimer has received polarized reactions from viewers american audiences seem more receptive to the complex dialogueheavy plot dealing with the development of the atomic bomb however viewers outside the us appear less engaged with some even leaving the theater before the ending due to the heavy emphasis on american politics and history  
  
while the marketing created great anticipation the actual film differs from expectations the trailers promised a different kind of movie than the cerebral conceptual biopic nolan delivered though an impressive cinematic achievement oppenheimer challenges audiences unfamiliar with mid20th century us politics and world war ii  
  
in just three hours nolan ambitiously weaves together numerous historical figures and intertwining storylines across past and present its remarkable that audiences can follow such a convoluted plot at all but the films sophistication may frustrate viewers hoping for a more straightforward drama about the creation of the atomic bomb  


i strongly believe it would have made a really great 3 episodes 1h30 each show",2023-07-21 10:38:32
"it was very mediocre imo 

i love everything nolan had every directed but this was just…meh 

i was expecting more i guess",2023-07-21 15:15:09
too long and the the final hour was an absolute mess,2023-07-21 21:41:41
i cannot believe i’d ever say that i found a barbie movie superior to a nolan movie but here i am,2023-07-22 01:31:31
"that is probably the last christopher nolan film i go out of my way to see 

im glad i didnt go through with my original plan of travelling 15 hrs to see it in imax

3 hours wideeyed close ups",2023-07-22 12:08:40
"it was great but i honestly had higher expectations i wanted to see the bombings and every aftermath aspect from it i also think it was unnecessary to focus that much on the trial with rdjr other aspects could have been touched
also the trinity test bomb was underwhelming didnt resemble atomic bombs at all
i dont get why im being downvoted i seriously wanted myself to love this but it was kind of a let down i remember working on middle school presentations about these events and when years later i saw the teaser i was extremely hyped now mildly disappointed",2023-07-23 04:21:52
"too loud for me standard imax el dorado hills california im thinking something went wrong as other people also complained

only other disappointment was the explosion it was small and unimpressive all that black soot is a tell tale sign of a gasoline or other liquid fuel explosion
please nolan you got to know when cgi is needed",2023-08-11 02:21:40
nolans script felt like it was written by aaron sorkin or any other fast paced screenwriter and props to nolan for not utilizing his intersecting timeline and give us an authentic historical biopic thriller,2023-07-21 04:03:40
i am bummed out that nolan decided not to show anything regarding the actual bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki i wanted to leave the theater shocked to my core with the horrors that the innocent people there have been subjected to it would have been more impactful and make the people in my theater leave speechless and not talking like they did i know its about oppenheimer himself  but there were scenes of him imagining the bomb going off around him with only a really fast shot of a girls face somewhat peeled and a burned corpse not enough to really make us grasp truly  the  on earth that the bomb unleashed on hundreds of thousands of japanese civilians also im done seeing movies on opening week just cant cope with people talking around me such a mood killer overall a great movie 85 for me not as good as interstellar for me,2023-07-21 05:38:40
i just can’t get over hughie playing the bongos the morning after the trinity explosion,2023-07-21 08:56:32
my 90yearold grandmother wants to see this with me today im not sure thats a good idea,2023-07-21 13:43:25
nolan outdid himself now i cant stop thinking about one thing when someone did an enthusiastic postscreening selfie reaction saying if  history decided to go for a serious reboot and started gunning for oscars thats oppenheimer for ya,2023-07-21 14:46:46
"oppenheimer was initially educated at alcuin preparatory school in 1911 he entered the ethical culture society school which had been founded by felix adler to promote training based on the ethical culture movement whose motto was deed before creed

cillian murphy is oscar worthy as oppenheimer,2023-07-21 18:57:42
sadly only 19 us theaters have the ability to show the film in 70mm,2023-07-21 21:39:24
the sound design and soundtrack can’t be praised enough i was tense and gripping my seat each time waiting for the boom and i love how it hit for the big one all the preceding trial runs had a delayed sound compared to the visual explosion foreshadowing how the actual bomb would play out finally during the scenes of oppenheimer addressing the audience with the lights flashing we as the audience also know that a large sound is coming and we are enveloped with anticipation,2023-07-22 00:36:15
i loved everything about this especially the scene where oppenheimer speaks to the crowd and goes through a panic attack of some kind as he hallucinates the room getting bombed but i had such a hard time understanding the dialogue it might be my issue or the theater’s issue but it sounded like a lot of the dialogue was muffled or people were talking in a low volume i wish i watched it with captions lol,2023-07-22 03:36:35
"enjoyed this immensely i will have to watch dunkirk insomnia and the following as they are three nolan films i havent seen and rewatch the others but if i had to rank the nolan filmography off memory for the ones ive seen id say

1 the dark knight
2 inception
3 the prestige
4 oppenheimer
5 memento
6 interstellar
7 the dark knight rises
8 tenet
9 batman begins

its kinda hard to rank but oppenheimer might have nolans best score this needs a rewatch forsure also since my theaters 70mm projector broke so they refunded us and played the digitial film  


side note i always thought the internets overhyping of a nonfictional story was a bit weird and people just overhyped it for no reason i enjoyed it for what it was and how nolan crafted and executed the tone of these real eventspeople

with that being said i hope nolans next film and future films will mostly be fictional stories because i love his takes on scifi and reality bending stories im already sad that tarantinos last film is confirmed to be a nonfictional story again akin to once upon a time i thought once upon a time was good but is not worthy of rewatching more than once other than for the final actsequence i also love leo and brad pitt and felt like a fictional story would have been more interesting to watch for the duo",2023-07-22 08:56:17
well now i’m in an extensional crisis,2023-07-22 09:29:05
"nolan is really into that whole atmospheric ignition concept huh  i guess it also shows how hypocritical oppenheimer was or maybe complex is the better word  he knew it has the chance to end the world yet went with it anyway  but somehow hydrogen bomb is too much  
hey im not judging  i dont think oppenheimer is guilty at all for creating a bomb tbh  just that he is a bit weird and always changing his views",2023-07-22 14:30:26
"the wind rises is another film that i felt was similar to this

didnt like the stuff towards the end just after the test but as it progressed was as engrossed as i was at the start

the first 30 minutes or so are absolutely magical",2023-07-22 16:25:37
"great movie imo well paced with good dialogue loved the effects work music and sound was incredible it did feel a little “lully” right after the detonation but it was probably just cuz i knew there was still an hour but the refreshing twist to political stuff kinda refreshed it a bit

what was the last line oppenheimer said tho about the math i couldn’t make it out i only saw it on 70mm but the sound was overpowering the whole movie so i missed lines here and there",2023-07-23 00:31:09
incredible movie the trinity test scene i’ll never forget also shout out to the actors from the boys and you and also tenet lol why’s he always in the movies about destroying worlds ,2023-07-23 02:19:22
"saw it last night 

 set volume to deaf  it was a bone shaking filling rattling chest punching assault on not just me ears but my body and my soul  and i absolutely loved it  i’m somewhat amazed they did that however a lawsuit will happen rest assured when are they going to put speakers and motors into theater chairs
 it was basically two movies  first movie assemble the team build the gadget test the gadget solid 8 second movie oppy is on trial but not a trial to keep his q clearance  too many characters hard to follow  but maybe i was tired  6 but only adults
 seeing it in a packed theater made it better
   always a bonus when chesticles make an appearance
 i would have appreciated an intermission",2023-07-23 04:07:27
b r a v o n o l a n,2023-07-23 05:50:25
i’d love to see nolan do a film with a female lead  perhaps he would use florence or emily again,2023-07-24 07:06:36
"i enjoyed the film i saw another claim that the film holds your hand for the majority of its runtime while this is an exaggeration there definitely are times that nolan goes too far he uses the briefly showing the same shot again to establish who this person is trick a couple of times unnecessarily

the worst is the  jean writhing on oppenheimers lap which caused snickering around me not me but i did want to groan the later oppenheimer in the bomber that borden saw the v2 rocket in but now seeing multiple missiles makes sense from storytelling and thematic perspectives his seeing people getting their skin melted off is so clichéd that it circles around and becomes almost not quite but almost worthwhile using  but maybe just once  jean making out with oppenheimer during the hearing nolan is the cinematic genius and im a nobody but ill still tell him any day of the week that that just does not work especially when kitty is already glaring at him why not just have oppenheimer wear a im incredibly ashamed and humiliated in case you cant tell sign around his neck",2023-07-25 06:12:30
i know this is a  minor thing but can it be that cillian murphy actually never really smokes in the film towards the end of the film i noticed he‘s basically just only holding a cigarette or maybe stuck between his lips but he‘s never actually smoking i‘m asking because that would actually be a neat trick for an actor playing a chainsmoker without having to actually smoke not even fake cigarettes,2023-07-25 18:25:49
saw it last night and absolutely loved it  favourite film in years i had quite an interest in the history so was already very invested music was unreal listening to the score on repeat and the countdown sequence  i nearly had a panic attack best cinematic experience in years especially in imax,2023-07-28 11:15:52
"man i really liked the film i sitting around 75 to 8 out of 10 voted 8 since there is no half points in the poll
the best scen is the build up to the trinity test with that music composed with geiger sensor as an instrument it was awesome the tension until the countdown to the test was amazing
but the explosion itself was kinda disappointing i feel he did not do a good job depicting the scale of the explosion i was expecting more angles around the explosion showing more destruction and the scale of it all felt like it was just a lot of zoomed in photos of fire the actual trinity test footage looks way better scale depiction

i loved all the famous scientists depicted i was giggling when each new one appeared after the other i wish we saw more of them

seeing teller already thinking about the h bomb while the other were thinking about the a bomb was awesome too we just need a small a bomb to trigger it loved that dialog

i really liked the scene where they are calculating the possibilty of burning the whole atmosphere with an unstoppable reaction

the famous destroyer of worlds quote being used during a  scene felt weird kinda lame i also feel off on the start of the movie way too fast paced jumping around timeline and showing a bomb right off the start kinda killed the suspense for me

i wanted to see way more of the actual process of the bomb being built i expected way more competence  given nolan loves his hard science interstellar it would have been cool to see more of heinsenberg too and some hints about the idea he intentionally sabotaged the bomb for the nazis

i expected to see the demon core accident depicted or at least mentioned

but i understand the movie is called oppenheimer and not the bomb but still you would expect the movie to focus more on his magnum opus and the actual process of building it

still really liked it overall but at the same time i too feel it could have been so much more

edit  look at this that i wanted to see that initial sun like plasma ball of fire depicted  in full scale he actually used footage like that at the beginning of the film but not the actual test i dont know why they did that",2023-07-29 01:19:36
if i just went through a traumatizing life experience do you think oppenheimer is too intense to watch i really want to see it but have been warned that it might be too much,2023-08-17 17:11:41
what do people think about mini scenes like the halifax explosion or nuclear warheads  cockpit scene pretty cool to replay a few time wishing the scene was longer,2023-12-03 04:44:16
in the previews it shows the event being filmed with an imax camera  imax hadnt been invented yet  now i am considering not watching the movie  i was lead to believe it was an accurate film about the tense times surrounding oppenheimer as well as his turmoil,2023-12-22 12:41:49
cant believe murphy won oscar for this movie ,2024-03-11 02:54:22
i was really hoping this would change my opinion on christopher nolan it reinforced it,2023-07-22 00:41:54
"echo what some have been saying i have no idea what people here were expecting but this was billed as a trueenoughtoreality biopic and it certainly delivered its funny because none of the wannabe critics here would have expected michael bay production out of the theory of everything or the imitation game so why did they expect it here

the film delivered yes i think the trinity test section was a bit clumsy  the countdown was incredible 1010 but the actual explosion hit the mark only about 710 and the courtroom act at the end felt a bit rushed but this was still a great biopic",2023-07-22 01:49:51
a lot of people in this thread have a lot of amazing analysis and perspective on the film so i don’t have anything to contribute other than this for a three hour film it felt like there was no filler every scene felt relevant to the story or connected to a large themeidea,2023-07-22 03:35:31
"i love the fact that strausss scenes were in black and white his world and the way he sees it is black and white  anyone that does anything to slight me must be my enemy einstein didnt look at me therefore he must be my enemy so nolan visualises strausss world view also it helps the audience tell his scenes apart from oppenheimers 

i dunno if i am the first to have this observation i am not digging through 6000 comments to find out",2023-07-22 17:59:48
"when there’s just a string of too many cameo appearances they start to seem like a joke 

rami malek randomly saving the court room was so  random i just did not care by that point i was so glued inside my head thinking  is rami malek still doing here and was there any plot prior to this to lead him into giving a sht about oppy’s hearing  

i wish it was just less of an identifiable quirky actor",2023-07-24 21:36:15
"i think ive come to the conclusion late stage nolan isnt for me

the prestige will continue to be one of my favorite movies of all time and dark knight will continue to be my favorite superhero flick but i just cant with modern nolan

i feel like his nonlinearly storytelling is at this point just smoke and mirrors to obscure a really simple plot his treatment of women as objects that only exist as a memory is a pattern and not one im a fan of like tenet i felt like oppenheimer was made to highlight a bunch of cool set pieces and special effects hed rigged with little substance and a lot of noise

im happy a lot of people loved it im genuinely disappointed i didnt",2023-07-26 02:20:09
"not a big fan of nolans work in general the movie had great moments but overall the disjointed story telling was difficult to follow if you were not already somewhat familiar with oppenheimers story my wife who knew of oppenheimer but not his story was lost a lot during the movie this is also a typical nolan approach that never works for me

the opening sequence of oppenheimer seeing the motions of atomic particles etc was overblown and too long  

the dialogue was cold and emotionless really only a few moments with damons character brought any warmth to the movie

cyllian spent most of the movie walking around with wide eyes and a blank  haunted look in his eyesotherwise not a wide ranging performance

the nudity was unnecessary as it usually is in mainstream movies was just used for a shock moment during the security clearance hearing 

the movie was swamped with loud sounds that overwhelmed too much of the dialogue this was hampered by amc theater having seen this is spinal tap far too many times and thought that turning up the volume to 11 was better than 8much of the effects were just white noise

finally i thought the actual moment of the test was disappointing",2023-07-31 22:55:50
"i do not get whats so good about this movie

it is just an average boring biopic it felt like a crammed log of events from a biography or wikipedia with not much developed themes personal doubts or dilemmas on communism or guilt from being used or  what have i we done come across as a comic book caricature

a few good cuts during the interrogation sequences feeling  are the only good directorial moves the rest seems pretty nice filmed but pretty schematic and as expected no drama anywhere trivial pop culture memes on physics and equally trivial particle animationwhodunnit of academia backstabbing is  boring to me at least 

being betrayed by everyone would be dramatic if we had an idea of the main characters character which we do not as he comes across as pensive but bland

the story of trinity the manhattan project chasing heisenberg and general quantum physics and progress vs selfdestruction conundrums are good material  maybe someone will make something out of it the chilling and weird now i have become death quote is still better to watch in the original archive video 

i dont know if anyone who does not know the cast of characters made of the most famous reallife physicist stars einstein heisenberg fermi feynman szilard teller bohr even has any grasp of what is going on in this story 

a heavy bass soundtrack and excellent cinematography do not make a good movie 

cinema seems to have evolved into a stage where production techniques are perfected to nth degree technology advances so much that anyone can film a perfectlooking and sounding take almost without effort

however ideas and script remain the most challenging bit in filmmaking  the parts where the brain and pen and paper are the required technology

it wont be solved with chatgpt",2023-08-26 13:02:57
disappointing not worth seeing in imax at all,2023-07-23 18:13:34
"technically its as good as it gets but i think the screenplay was wrong basing this on the hearings is not a good idea since the manhattan project gets sidelined and i have no interest about the political games against oppenheimer furthermore the ending seemed completely pointless to me einsteins speech about everyone applauding oppenheimer in the end being a selfish act didnt have much connection to the rest of the film and the film tried to make it look like that was the whole point it wasnt

its a technically good film based on an average screenplay saying absolutely nothing about the man himself in the end

also oppenheimer is not einstein he wasnt a leading physicist at any point so why the movie tried to paint his early years like a physics genius is beyond me",2023-07-26 06:06:24
"maybe im just really slow but i didnt know that rdj was the antagonist until it was basically being rubbed on my face like way later than i think i was supposed to acknowledge

i felt it was very jumpy and the dialogue hints were too subtle or couldnt really understand the beginning was especially confusing and was trying to find out which timeline im in by looking at cillian or rdjs hair loss in the first hour",2023-07-22 07:27:37
"fantastic film murphy and downey should get oscars as should nolan i really liked the structure with the bw parts about strauss being interjected how they were i felt they added a different context to the scenes from oppenheimer’s viewpoint while also making a compelling narrative beyond the traditional biopic structure and i never once had trouble following it

man was it heavy you can feel the knowledge of the destructive power he unleashed weighing on murphy",2023-07-22 20:58:26
i enjoyed most of the film and it was after the bomb sequence that i felt the script went down the hill the last 40 minutes were so painful to watch because it was a lot of dialogue and context that i didn’t have that i just wanted the movie to end,2023-07-23 07:50:32
in my opinion  this is nolans best movie so far and i really really love interstellar the intensity  of this movie is something i havent experienced in a while i did see if on imax so that may have added to the experience the sound and vx are just out of this world my favorite parts are the interrogation and speech scenes,2023-07-23 09:13:34
"the cinematography was great but nothing will beat 1917 one of the best movies i’ve seen  

overall it wasn’t as great as i expected given the hype maybe i’ll need to do some historical research about oppenheimer’s circle and rewatch the movie again perhaps after that it will grow on me",2023-07-24 05:34:23
im definitely looking forward to one of those videos  on youtube where they perfect a scene from a movie for oppenheimer it has to be the trinity test scene the explosion itself in particular it didnt look that impressive considering it was meant to be the climax of a 2h story but all in all a great film,2023-07-25 18:41:14
"1010 obviously what an intense movie for a movie thats mostly dialogue and credit to nolan for actually mixing it properly you could actually hear every word spoken in this movie and the cast too stacked to even talk about everyone just everyone absolutely killed it cant say enough  
  
i did not see it in imax myself but i can see why people would recommend imax if possible and i too would recommend it if you can manage it",2023-07-27 14:46:22
"that was a really really good movie

did anyone else feel that the ending shots with all the nukes and apocalyptic explosions and the atmosphere burning was a slight nod to the ending of dr strangelove or is that a stretch",2023-07-28 05:23:22
"the sound design for the film was so amazing it was blaring loud and felt like the speakers are in full throttle the way the tension is built throughout the film is choice loved the cuts to what looked kind of like abstract shapes to demonstrate quantum mechanics the shockwave when the sound kicks in after the trinity test was pretty cool

the ending kind of dragged imo but overall great film",2023-07-30 06:23:00
"i thought it was good but not great as some have said

technically amazing film and the acting is superb from most but i just didnt feel any tension dread in what is supposed to be a movie about this absolutely horrible creation

i mean i know it was a biopic about oppenheimer but i just wished it had focuses on the actual ramifications of the bomb than the whole commie storyline",2023-07-31 03:07:05
i rate oppenheimer citizen kane and lincoln as my top most boring movies i have watched i was expecting something like the imitation game with a little nolan over the top flare for the atomic bombings but it was just mind numbingly boring,2023-07-22 21:12:12
florence pugh  were the best thing about the movie,2023-07-24 11:44:32
"columbus day of biopics

how profound a morally corrupt politician vs a hearteyed scientist what could possibly be more important in this tale aside the hundreds of thousands of people who lost their lives amidst this time

the least important story thats ever been told to me about the violent and heartless motions of a governing body this movie communicates that heartlessness momentarily before swiftly turning back to the flaws of american infrastructure groundbreaking america is violencepower and water is wet take notes yall dont come to this movie to get away from the hotbed of modern politics come here to see a three hour explanation of why the american people are paranoid untrusting and fearful but come see it shown with no more wit to it than we see in modern broadcast news

the buildup and surprise reveal follow the music of emily blunt being capable indicates that the audience should expect less of her since nolan geniusly showed her as a struggling mother alcoholic and side piece of a genius thats quite the moment wow girl become capable florence pugh is a muse but only seen peripherally this three hour conversation between white ivy league graduates definitely makes her importance quite clear

cant wait for two years from now when people can talk about this movie without parroting its marketing would do just about anything to get these three hours back but my regret and sorrow about my decisions does not a good story make",2023-07-24 22:55:25
"honestly this movie   so much talk hard to understand who is playing what role 3houes is way too long for a n all talk movie  
i don’t watch movies for the director so everyone here is saying this is another hit for the director but that doesn’t apply since i don’t follow movies just based of directors

anyway so much talk that i fell asleep at 245 with minutes left   the last hour the talking and up close face shots increased 3x and i was getting very anxious how much longer do people talking is going to go on for  the  scene he was imagining was pointless what was the point of that

i wish they gave you a context of when their was happening because not everyone knows history well enough to know that the  got bombs when there was more talking in the movie  i didn’t even realize this was happening at the same time  now if you know history that’s great but the movie should’ve presented the timeline of events better than having to have you do a ww2 cram session before you see the movie  

no way jose from me",2023-08-05 12:55:57
"it was fine im not sure where all the hype for this movie came from nolan has become synonymous with event films i guess as i was watching it unfold i kept thinking back to paul schraders comments about this being the best most important film of this century and i was like no its just another biopic its wellmade its wellacted its got some cool visual effects and a bombastic score but it didnt do much for me on a personal level not a bad movie but i thought the whole thing was overblown to be honest

oh yeah and

 florence pugh has really nice bewbs

whoooooooooooooooooo thats been waiting to explode out of me for the past 6 hours shes got nice  baby yeah

remember when we were led to believe by the media that there was a twohour full frontal scene in this film where all the actors are just lounging around  instead it was just two short intimate scenes completely blown out of proportion because people are so outraged by the human body nowadays and honestly all i kept thinking about after those scenes was that all i really care about are womens  i dont care about anything else i dont care about atomic bombs i dont care about commies i dont care about long drawn out congressional hearings or artistic uses of bw and color or chris nolan fanboys downvoting this post just 

anyway onto barbie",2023-07-21 09:00:23
as i walked out of the theater after it ended the only thing i really thought about was how much i will enjoy south park ripping on it the constant super epic music slowly picking up as a totally normal conversation is happening made me roll my eyes in the theater it was just okay as someone who is usually a fan of boring movies i thought this was boring,2023-07-26 23:29:02
"i went into this movie expecting to like it and it is good but its not perfect

pros

it is a gorgeous looking world the set design costumes of the oppenheimer world are incredible it looks great easily the most impressive and best aspect of the film but it also has great performances 

the performances were really good at conveying these characters that live in this oppenheimer world 

cons

you have to accept the fact that this is basically a commercial the informercial aspect of it is a little jarring it does take you out of it

you have to accept that its heavy handed commentary it doesnt shy away from talking about nuclear capability it does poke fun at nuclear capability but its not complete villification its just a tease you have to be able to laugh at yourself 

verdict

if you can look past that theres a lot to like here it seems like we have a crowd pleaser people in my showing i overheard thought it was so good and they cant wait to see it again",2023-07-22 03:27:32
is this comment thread comprised completely of people who love this kind of film i feel like a lot of people in my theater were probably bored or let down by the film being a 3 hour dialogue heavy biopic theres so much praise for this movie with little criticism when i feel like it was pretty stuffed with characters and dialogue that couldve been trimmed to better serve the impact save for the trinity and speech scene it was so heavy handed with exposition and dialogue in rooms i feel like its not a widely lovable movie and the chris nolan stamp and star studded cast just makes people attempt to appreciate it more thats my hot take i was excited to see it but bored actually watching it unfortunately,2023-07-21 07:17:39
i don’t know if anyone else had this experience but this movie felt long to me there were like five points where i thought the movie was ending because it felt like three hours already but wasn’t even close absolutely draining but in a good way it was an amazing film but i have zero intentions of watching it again because it was so draining to me with the heaviness of the subject matter and intensity of the film itself,2023-07-21 13:52:41

"my minor gripe with this film is that i really wanted to see the nuclear bomb itself the trinity sequence was astounding for what its supposed to do but i was under the impression that nolan was gonna show us the actual event that defined oppenheimer  the world like immediately after the final dialogue with einstein an explosion that builds up on the trinity sequence in every conceivable way 


that being said someone needs to get ludwig göransson an oscar for the score alone those violin orchestrations alone when building up a climax were just phenomenal out of this world i need to listen to those musical scores again hans zimmer should be proud",2023-07-22 18:16:50
"
theres a moment in oppenheimer where they write out the expected yield of the bombers being thousands to millions of tons and oppenheimer literally says im not saying that how about kilotons

i know what that is

youre a dilettante a womanizer unstable theatrical neurotic

 hes literally me


i did not think the  scene was weird even though apparently everyone else does and im now questioning various things

the actual atomic bomb scene was some other worldly horror that literally froze the entire audience

the guy who invented the concept of an icbm is portrayed as like a real psycho and creep which i dont know if its true but its kind of hilarious he talks about watching v2s land on the city he was hiding out in and describes how hed dreamed of putting an atomic bomb on top of one of those missiles


also when you add in the neurosis the womanizing the sort of underlying uncertainty over whether hes a horrendous criminal with a guilt complex or a good and noble man and the cool cillian murphy behavior i think weve just got another literally me that people will be making youtube edits of for years thats gonna be weird



i loved the subtle rumbling noises they had playing right as in the scene where they recreated the neutron capture and chain reaction at the accelerator its like that was the moment when the whole world subtly flipped and they realized oh  theres endless energy down there isnt there and its like your perspective flips and suddenly the entire world is rigged to explode if only you can find the right trigger",2023-07-23 09:26:10
"very much enjoyed the first two acts but the third act dragged on for too long

that said the performances were stunning i loved the choice to go with silence for the test explosion surreal experience in the theatre some of the new mexico landscapes were breathtaking and i thought the music was excellent

im oscillating between a 7 and an 8 out of 10 the performances probably lift it to an 8 the third hour drags it down to a 7 maybe a 75 i suppose",2023-07-24 05:32:15
"just saw it

was feeling numb for a couple of hours before i gathered my thoughts 

i agreed with some of you guys here that too much focus was on the trialhearing it pulled the pace  down drastically  

i found the los alamos scenes more compelling and i felt the film worked best when the other physicists were in the scenes together discussing the bomb  

this might be an unpopular opinion but i found cillian’s portrayal a little flat whereas rdj really shined and had much more emotional depth and range  he is a definite for an oscar nomination for supporting actor    

regarding cillian’s acting maybe that’s how the real oppenheimer was more subdued and thoughtful i’m not sure i wanted to see more out of his range come out 

someone also commented they wanted to see the immediate fallout after the bombs were dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki i disagree because it would have taken away from the main movie storyline  the whole thing about the aftermath of the bombs is an entire movie on its own altogether and putting it in this film would have majorly extended the 3 hour running time or lost its focus 

as a biopic it’s refreshing to see it in a sea of summer action movies or superhero movies we need more of these

in closing walking out of this movie it really nails it home that if nothing the atomic age reminds us that we’re all one bright flash away from extinction and honest to  i hope no one on earth will have to experience another atomic bombing",2023-07-25 20:42:35
"this is a top two christopher nolan movie for me and i have more or less seen almost all of his movies that he has directed  i put this close to the dark knight batman 2 but its hard to say which movie i like more

i never knew cillian murphy had this type of acting in him his was a decent actor in his past movies but nothing at this level this was oscar quality acting from cillian murphy although the oscars are a long way off so its unknown what other movies and whatever leading male actor roles will pop up between now and the oscars  but for a typical oscar year i would nominate cillian murphy for an oscar imho every time cillian murphy was on screen he was just a magnet his outward demeanor was always calm but when you looked at his eyes you could feel he had chaos and turmoil inside his mind all the time

and robert downie jr was marvelous  havent seen him in such a good performance for some time  the acting directing story music everything was good and i love how christopher nolan explores the themes and morality of nuclear weapons  tempted to watch this a second time",2023-07-29 16:52:48
"easily the best historic biopic ive ever seen

ive seen imitation game the pianist and this is in my opinion the best  it had by far the best acting cinematography tension editing barring the usual nolan dialogue issues but it wasnt bad for most of the film  but the thing is that it is poignant as   that ending is incredibly haunting  and you know whats actually genius  the entire time strauss thinks that oppenheimer insulted him to einstein and in a literal sense he didnt but if you think about what the message is he actually kind of did

i love the grey areas that the movie tackles and the hard truths that the characters try to ignore then deal with after the fact

i think for me as someone whos a huge physics nerd i would have liked more about the science behind the trinity test but thats minor  and the bomb scene i think could have been a bit better as well

if across the spiderverse didnt come out this would be my movie of the year but ive actually gotta settle on it  definitely 2 at least",2023-07-21 06:02:13

"i was gripped for the first hour then it fell into a lull for the second hour until the trinity test once that hit i was full in again dealing with all the sadness of what oppenheimer unleashed knowingly and unknowingly 

i can’t say it’s nolan’s masterpiece like some have put out there it’s a very engaging story with some odd choices the nudity struck me as unneeded in any scene it occurred in particularly kitty’s “vision” 

downey’s performance was a good way for him to stretch beyond stark holmes and sigh dolittle and he did extremely well with the complex part 

i’ll see it again but don’t plan to do it in the theater

eta i don’t have a problem with the lack of bomb shots with hiroshima or nagasaki or even that there wasn’t enough focus on it oppenheimer didn’t see those events and it was pretty well tied to his pov and some of strauss’ so i didn’t need a zoom over to japan bit the horrors of it imagined and seen after were well reflected in what was in the film the lull in the second hour was more just a bunch of tablesetting for the final round of reveals which may or may not have been needed 

and honestly without seeing it again i’m not sure what pugh’s character contributed in terms of the story we got he dated her left her had an affair with her and then died and it shook him for a bit but then just kinda stopped mattering once his wife told him to snap out of it his wife knew of the affair but that didn’t seem to cause near as much tension as his unwillingness to fight the people trying to bring him down if pugh were excised from the film i’m not sure what thematically would be lost since the rest of the film showed his mental state and possible martyr complex in other regards",2023-07-21 21:33:07

towards the end of the movie when he is in the kangaroo court to get his security clearance back there was a shot from the back of the room behind those old men looking at oppenheimer through the window on the left side of the frame you can pretty clearly see modern vehicles in the parking lot did anyone else notice that,2023-07-22 05:59:52
i love nolan but my real attraction to the film was cilian and the character oppenheimer obviously for me it wasnt about the bomb it was the character thats one of the main reasons as to why i enjoyed the film idk if people who were interested mainly about the work behind the bomb felt differently,2023-07-22 07:28:21
"i really dont know if oppenheimer deserved to be forgiven or not before i watched the film…

but …

i really feel sorry for the guy by the time the film ended…

"i believe this might be nolan’s magnum opus  i watched it early sunday morning and i can’t stop thinking about it  many scenes have resonated especially during the scene where everyones face is melting off in silence to a detonation

ludwig did phenomenal on scoring the whole film  it almost gave me a slight blend of dunkirk and phantom thread but much more haunting

knowing this is sourced from something that only happened less than 100 years ago makes it that much more haunting  

i do agree with some commenters though  i got some serious memento throwback",2023-07-24 10:51:12
im suprised with all the hate here i loved this movie im a diehard nolan fan and see this one as top five for him its absolutely better than tenet dkr dunkirk insomnia and memento i want to see it a few more times to truly rank it though some of his movies like memento and dunkirk i love on first watch and then with every consecutive one feel less and less strongly about it while i love interstellar and inception more with each rewatch,2023-07-24 21:03:18

i loved the movie and cannot express how sad it made me feel still now it didnt hit me at first but after going to sleep and waking up at 5 am from a nightmare all i could do was think about his relationship with jean and how her life ended i did some research and that just made me feel worse her suicide note is heartbreaking and to make things worse i think i had a moment of déjà vu and for the rest of the day i was just trying to figure out where had i read a similar suicide note after searching for hours i couldnt find it so it must have been a false positive caused by the impression the notes words made in me,2023-08-07 01:57:11
"very prepared for the nolan disciples to get upset at this but here goes

im 90mins into this thing and cannot fathom how it was even nominated for a single academy award let alone won any of them 

 ive spent the entire film adjusting the volume 
 theres been about 15 seconds of dialogue that wasnt accompaniedoverridden by the insufferable score
 nolans incapable of telling a coherent story and relies on these neverending cuts and timeshifts to create an artificial interest
 the acting is about as ham  as a high school play

i dont know if i should turn it off or keep watching just to see if it can actually get worse than it already is if this was released 25 years ago people wouldve walked out of the premier after half an hour",2024-04-08 11:47:07
im in shock at how bad this movie was imo ive never ever fallen asleep during a cinema movie before i fell asleep three times during oppenheimer and the music is played over the top of the dialog in virtually every scene crazy so shocked,2023-07-21 06:02:56
i felt like i couldn’t enjoy it because the cut scenes were jarring and confusing it felt like i was constantly trying to work out when what happened and who was who too many people with no introduction and like i was just meant to know who they were and what part they played,2023-07-21 15:31:43
"what a profoundly amazing film   so many things to gush about  i’m profoundly amazed that a 3 hour long rrated talky drama was a enthralling as it was… and that it’s drawing the audience it is   but that just speaks to the care in the craft nolan puts into his projects not a minute of that 3 hours is wasted every single line of dialogue important   so… there really isn’t a good time to get up and  at all  

and holy  were the performances just outstanding give murphy and downey jr all the awards",2023-07-21 18:48:19
it bothered me that not only were the actresses underused but that florence pugh had  scenes for no good reason why just reminds me in general of the hollywood double standard about showing men’s and women’s bodies at least in foreign films showing either  fully  is not a big deal if done,2023-07-21 20:55:11
"this movie is amazing i absolutely loved it and im shocked that some people didnt and found it boring  seriously how can this movie be boring and regarding the explosionit was fantastic people seriously need to check their hype level here they have these super high expectations which cant be met 

i may be just biased because im a history buff but i can see nothing wrong with this movie also people might have gotten confused if it was more focused on technical aspects of making the bomb read richard rhodes making of the atomic bomb for that than the characters and what happened the second half was part thriller too 

so this movie blew my expectations it might be nolans best work yet",2023-07-21 23:10:53
didn’t know much about oppenheimer before the movie besides his involvement in building the nuclear bomb so i was a bit taken aback by the heavy politics involved in the movie honestly thought it would be a movie simply about building the bomb and the war the sound effects were great and the buildup before they detonated the bomb was my favorite part the actual detonation was kinda anti climatic for me tbh also they didn’t show much about the war at all the movie can also feel a little all over the place sometimes overall it was kinda meh…if i knew what this movie is like i’m not sure if i would go see it in the first place,2023-07-21 23:21:20
"it is an ok fillm

i feel nolan feels the need to mix up timelines because of inception 

it gives no time for character development you leave thinking why was everything in the first 13 shown 

i watched a documentary forget the name before watching it i was left wondering what the  is going on 

nolan since inception relates to nobody i love him i support him in his out of familiarity of cinema but when it comes down to it

i didnt even know what oppenheimer himself felt about the h bomb a man of complexity such as oppie was endearing enough instead we get a cut here cut there cut back to here nolan experience

all in all i am disappointed because i saw the potential in a character driven time period piece about a man coming to grips with the world he created through physics 

this is a drawnout over elaborate time continuum meltdown by a director that was let loose on brilliantly talented actors 

i wouldnt watch it a second time and i would refrain from asking a friend to watch it 

have a lovely day ",2023-07-21 23:47:44
i found myself checking my watch in barbie and didn’t check once in oppenheimer  incredible pacing for a 3 hour movie about people talking the tension nolan is able to keep throughout the runtime is absolutely outstanding,2023-07-22 04:39:23
"well where to begin

i know that this movie is not going to be for everyone  that there are many people looking for a summer blockbuster that are going to be disappointed or at the very least stricken differently than they anticipated

i am not one of those people

i admit i have only taken a casual interest in j robert oppenheimer until now  when i first saw the trailers i immediately knew it was something i wanted to see but the experience of it has left me with so so many thoughts  

i wrote something as i left the theater and i think it begins to encapsulate what im feeling now  

war is started by people who feel and then inevitably learn to think  
war is ended by people who think and then inevitably learn to feel

i expected some form of commentary on world war ii its merits and obviously did we need to drop any bombs in the first place much less two

what i got instead took that idea and set it in the backseat like a child spoken to by a parent  war is the worst of conflicts but by no means the only

ive always been a person that lives by the idea to never rise at the expense of another but that idea is grayed when you cannot see the paths your choices will pave  

well take it from here

the duality in this movie is captured beautifully  both internally ofself externally from those you both have influence on with awareness and those that you arent aware of  and trust the bomb may be the least exemplary illustration of that in the whole movie  why do we make the choices we do  why dont we make the choices we dont  how much control do we really have to the course of our own life when such feelings as vindictiveness remorse foresight guide not only our hands but the hands of others for better or for worse  

i found myself asking beforehand was oppenheimer a hero a villain or somewhere inbetween  the latter proves to be where i stand but i was carried there in waves of hindsight anger malaise  how is one to judge a life except when most of that life is behind them or as we who sit in the theater others who observe  what motivations do we carry when we ask a question so contrived and instead  by putting ourselves in certain shoes  arrive at an answer more organically  

relationships erode  careers erode  fires are lit and then doused  we ask not for the rain yet it falls  we live with wants needs desires feelings and over the course of our lives they blend together in this concoction that manifests itself as regret from certainly the choices that weve made but moreover the choices that we didnt know weve made   until we ourselves become death certainly the destroyer of one world but  if were unlucky  the destroyer of many  

i walked out with so many ideas so many thoughts theories  

buttheory will only get you so far  

verdict  a work of brilliance even if it is only left to the eye of the beholder",2023-07-22 06:16:36
"i felt like the trinity explosion was a let down all the tension leading up to it was great but the actual blast could have been much better

also i felt like they missed a trick by not showing the mushroom cloud hanging around in the background during the celebration scene it would have worked perfectly to be in the background with the us flag when oppie is lifting into the air",2023-07-22 10:15:55
"wow just wow its difficult to articulate how successful this film was at portraying the dread and forboding nature of the subject matter somehow nolan made a 3hour historical biopic that never dragged or slowed down from its beginning to the end it was riverting with each actor giving the best performances of their entire career easily one of his greatest films 

i thought he also did a phenomenal job at encapsulating the feeling of anxiety  its loud claustrophobic and unrelenting the final scene with einstein and the scene in the auditorium will leave a lasting impression on me for years delighted to have witnessed this masterpiece",2023-07-22 14:59:06
"i liked the movie but i wasnt engrossed in it truth be told i found it boring in a lot of parts

also i feel like the nonlinear format and like someone else said in this thread the editing actually hurt it rather than help it also the third act wasnt necessary that could have been cut down to about 1015 minutes for instance the shocks of 1949 could have been told after building the bomb and not during the whole movie and so could most of his trial 

i hate to say this but maybe nolan wasnt the person for this movie correct me if im wrong but this is nolans first bipoic and maybe it needed someone whos more familiar with that style of directing to take it to its final form

on the other hand cillian murphy was fantastic in this so was emily blunt and i appreciate that it was a look at oppenheimers whole life and not just the manhattan project

however i do wish more focus was given to the project and what life was like in los alamos

overall 810

edit also the sound design jesus christ nolan get over yourself and get an actually good sound mixer",2023-07-22 18:17:26
the movie was too loud the best example of quiet whispers loud explosions ever this will be unwatchable at home you will have to have your hand on the volume the entire time you will wake up your neighbors or roommates 110,2023-07-26 19:04:57
"movie was a dud cutting between multiple timelines every 15 seconds for 3 hours didnt serve this movie well i didnt care at all about any of the characters even the bomb explosion was a dudvery anticlimactic looked way better in the intro of the movie than it did at the big moment the actors gave it their all though stellar performances let down by directingediting i went in understanding and prepared for a biopic that doesnt have much spectacle i was ready for that but it still didnt deliver 

oh well will still look forward to nolans next project

side note dolby atmos theater was definitely the right move really glad i didnt road trip to see it in 70mm imax",2023-07-27 04:38:42
"i disliked the movie although im encouraged now to study more about this time period on my own i did learn about oppenheimer but the larger effort of the bomb itself as well as the manhattan project was confusing

from what i gather the movie structure involved three different segments oppenheimers life his work on the manhattan project and the political problems before and after ww2 with his communist relationships they jump from one segment to another which is a style that i havent enjoyed that much in a movie except ironically with the prestige another nolan movie however i think the prestige was easier to follow because it focuses on the two magicians but rarely at the same time so when it switches from angier you get borden and vice versa in oppenheimer it jumps all the way around and becomes murkier in the political scenes involving straus maybe they shouldve let those out considering straus was the focus for the last chunk of the movie anyway

some other random thoughts i wished that they showed more effort of building los alamos as well as the manhattan project in general i wanted to see some epic montages of big machines and scientists puzzling over math problems i wanted to see some effort and struggle instead the bomb merely appears when the movie decides that its ready the soundtrack was amazing but totally wasted i listened to some of the soundtrack a week before i saw the movie and my favorite track so far is fusion in my head i could imagine this music playing while some epic graphic shows atoms breaking and neutrons flying around while the scientists struggle getting certain problems worked out but in the movie this track plays while characters have conversations what the  thats a total waste when the bomb finally makes its appearance it feels way to easy they missed a huge opportunity to build some excitement here sure it mightve been a little hollywood and not realistic but come on give me some entertainment

in the lead up to my viewing i also felt some disappointment that i couldnt experience the real movie in its 70 mm imax epicness but while i watched the movie at my local plebe theater i kept thinking how the  is this an imax movie 95 of the movie involves indoor scenes what benefit does imax give you its odd that they made such a big deal about that",2023-07-30 04:40:35
the 2nd act was awesome them showing how they are building the bomb and the struggles going along with it the explosion itself and lack of sound all that i loved after the explosion it completely took me out of the movie what the  do i care if oppy gets his security clearance back who the  is strauss they give no details of his background who he is it was such a reach trying to turn that into a thing and then the huge buildup of what oppy said to einsteinbasically nuclear bombs are going to end humanity its been 80 years and that hasnt happened so i dont understand the shock or the people claiming wow what a gripping ending and thought that was what you didnt think before nuclear bombs could end humanity,2023-08-02 20:34:44
so many criticism i see here are just some minor nitpicks i remember interstellar getting this kind of gripes but is now considered his best work nolan movies usually needs to be watched again to appreciate it more i see it no exception with this one too the truth is this is one of the best movies to come out of in the last few years way better than most of the  big studios are now releasing this will be a cult classic in few years time l,2023-08-08 05:14:57
"shouldnt have it been better if nolan also use actually trinity footage

i actually love the quantum demonstration and the trinity explosion close up shot christopher nolan made in his movie but the wide shot is to me just under expectation shouldnd it be more powerful more impactful and more groundshaking

i thought he could have done a better recreation or maybe even used a bit of mixing between the recreation and real footage

in dr strangelove and how i learn to love the bomb stanley kubrick actually used real nuclear bomb drop footage not the trinity but other drop and it has impressed me ever since

is it just me or",2023-08-13 02:55:43
so what’s everyone’s thoughts on which was the worst  unnecessary nolan name drop  jfk in this or robin in rises,2023-08-13 09:43:16
just left the cinema actors performance was amazing but i was soooo bored for most of the movie felt like nothing was happening,2023-08-19 18:05:49
this might sound crazy but i feel like the movie could have been another hour or so longer it felt like the beginning was a bit rushed but everything else was fantastic,2023-11-18 07:27:25
7 at bestdramatic boring lengthy kinda knew biopics r like that still went for nolan movie had no thrilling element cheapest explosion and did not show any aftereffects of the explosion,2023-12-29 05:37:21
"ryan gosling was so good in this movie  
  
edit i may have made a mistake",2023-07-21 03:34:32
barbie was better wasnt expecting that tbh,2023-07-21 07:52:48
"i loved the first 23 the last 13 was an eternity and i got bored at points the editing got more frantic as it bounced between the flashback and framework narratives and got messy near the final panel 

overall i liked it but it was just too oddly paced in the end 810 overall because outside of the editingruntime issue it was basically perfectly executed i just didn’t really love it andor enjoy myself to give it higher",2023-07-21 13:25:28
"it was a great movie but the same gripes i have with almost all of nolans films reappear once again 

i swear this dude cannot mix dialogue audio worth anything i couldnt catch a third of it because it was so quiet and i needed subtitles already with a lot of things but this movie took the cake my man make that dialogue more pronounced of something

there were so many characters running in and out that i couldnt remember them all when they started revealing twists like who the spy was who sent the folder i was like  oh who uh who was that guy again my boyfriend and i had to talk about it on the way home because we both missed something or forgot someone and had to ask the other who tf that was 

this was essentially a courtroom drama and political espionage when it should have been focused more on the bomb and oppenheimers aftermath guilt i did learn a lot but i also expected the second half to be angsty emo oppenheimer and not angsty self obsessed strauss 

nolan could have cut an hour and narrowed it down a lot it would have markedly improved the film but it was a great film and superior acting",2023-07-21 15:13:07
"hopefully this is a turning point for nolan

obviously hes an amazing filmmaker but lets be honest hes become a parody of himself in recent years much like shamalayan falling too deep into the i have to mess with time concept incomprehensible audio remixes that he claims are intentional generally hurting the accessibility of the stories hes trying to tell

here we have a movie where i can actually make out all the dialogue a score thats constantly present but doesnt interfere with my ability to understand what is happening or miss crucial exposition a movie with just enough time manipulation to service the telling of the story but not drive the story itself unlike tenet the story isnt about time theres no inuniverse gimmick

i dont know if it was universal stepping in over warner brothers or the fact that this is a biopic rather than a fictional story but its wonderful to have  the craft of nolan but with all his excessiveness pared back",2023-07-21 16:49:19
i dont think i fully understood what was going on i got confused by all the white mens names and who was trustworthy and who was prosecuting who i understood the bomb going off and the sciencey stuff in the beginning was okay plus albert einstein had some cute moments but golly i couldnt tell you what was the significance of the  man who fed oppenheimer bread on the train or what were the repurcussions of the brit guy in the team being a soviet spy i need to do some homework to understand this thing,2023-07-21 21:58:07
cillian murphy did a great job playing oppenheimer i also enjoyed matt damon’s scenes i agree that the trinity test wasn’t that impressive nolan maybe could’ve tried to use actual footage of the test instead  scenes aren’t needed all they really needed to show was when he met jean going back to meet her in chicago then her suicide and how it effected oppenheimer imo the dialogue is hard to hear but maybe it’s better in 70mm idk i guess i wanted to see more of oppenheimer himself working on the bomb leading his team going thru the different ideas they had the stress he was under to finish before the germans almost quitting i believe he wanted to and believing he they couldn’t do it at first i didn’t feel they showed enough of his depression and regret afterward it was said he would be walking around muttering things but i don’t think we got any of that even tho it was three hours overall i’ll give it a 5510 i think maybe it would’ve been better as a mini series,2023-07-22 15:45:04
i love nolan and i thought oppenheimer was terrible what was the point of all the hype that you have to see it in imax when half of the movie is in a room with people talking i love going to see movies in imax but i felt like i could have watched this at home and gotten the same experience the only good part of the movie for me was the 20 minutes testing the bomb and even that was just okay the constant musical score in the background of every piece of dialogue was so overused and annoying like some grand reveal was going to happen every second of the movie jumping between timelines made it hard to follow and i had zero emotional connection with any character the entire movie felt like watching a trailer with random clips stitched together and music id rate it a 410 and i would never want to watch it again reading reviews of people that loved it makes me feel like im taking crazy pills and watched an entirely different movie,2023-07-23 04:56:09
i like biopics but nolan’s moviemaking skills don’t suit the genre so many cinematic and musical crescendos that build to halfhearted reveals i hear a lot is made of the how visually stunning this movie is which is misleading and betrays the fact that this movie is 90 actors talking in conference rooms not that this is a bad thing but the visualcinema muscles of nolan and co are only really flexed once or twice in the film don’t go into the movie expecting jaw dropping effects it’s far more understated as a whole the movie should’ve ended after the speech oppy gives after the successful bomb test at trinity the court drama that ensues really overstays it’s welcome 6510 overcooked and oversold imo,2023-07-23 21:45:38
man the bomb test disappointed me so bad that i spent the rest of the film wondering if that was a red herring like they’d come back to it as if the first go was actually a smaller version of the test that they they imagined it would be didn’t want entertainment from this i wanted a couple generations to get a healthy dose of fear this film almost does the opposite yes the dialogue is good enough to achieve the same but only for people with attention spans and enough intelligence  thoughtfulness to fully grasp the grave nature of the atomic age moot point because those types likely already get it never thought i’d say this but i wish he went partly cgi with it and left the sound on wth that decision made sense and was very effective in interstellar it just  all the impact out of the scene here even the aftershock just looked like a few high powered fans flicked on for a second it made nukes look not so bad i thought he’d show glimpses of his practical explosion but rely on a long stream of closeups similar to the snippets shown throughout the trailer and beginning of the film he made an absolutely phenomenal biopic it’s just disappointing to have that scene botched the nudity too was a giant miss for me and i’m no  at all why make a film like this less accessible in any fashion,2023-07-24 03:16:42
"my dear nolan give the scene some breathing time to fully grasp the context and weight of the event

the fast paced editing and jumping from scene to scene and timeline look stylish keeps on edge of seat tbh but there are some scenes that require context especially for nonus audiences",2023-07-24 05:06:54
"honestly i did not like it and i wanted to i thought they focused too much on his personal life and not enough on the bombwar there was no action at all we never really see the devastation that bomb caused i just couldn’t believe the highlight of the whole film was the testing of the bomb they don’t even show anything about the aftermath of nagasaki or hiroshima your average person seeing this movie if they aren’t into history they might still not even know the devastation it inflicted on people for months and years after it dropped a couple of lines and one image of a woman in his mind having her skin melt off is all you see

i was so bored in the last 45 minutes i couldn’t wait for it to be over and i’m a history buff who loves nolan this movie did nothing for me and i was very disappointed it was the first movie i saw in theaters this year

also the scene where  florence pugh straddles him while he reads the ‘i am become death’ line was so cringey my eyes rolled out of my head",2023-07-25 14:08:11
"emily blunt wasnt in it much but she and kitty in real life had the best scene in the whole movie she better at least be nominated for best actress 




ps we did the barbenheimer meme and this movie was 10x better at feminism than the movie designed to be about feminism",2023-07-25 22:43:10
"acting great script writing typical nolan for better or worse  


special effects fantastic  


editing adhd and jarring scene length 5 seconds per scene tops  


honestly i would rather have just watched a couple of oppenheimer documentaries instead maybe a double feature with a manhattan project focused doc followed by an oppenheimer specific focused documentary   


like inception this one just didnt do it for me",2023-07-27 22:11:55
boring as  and a waste of an imax ticket,2023-09-24 12:55:00
people nowadays have been so numbed by simple to follow high on mindless action movies that they want even real life stories to have action just to keep them in i have not seen any biopic which is this fast paced and yet people are focussed on showing of more bombing movie is called oppenheimer not atomic bomb,2023-07-22 12:24:04
watched it last night and honestly didn’t like it that much i respect the movie as technically very good but i have a few problems with it that just being it down a few pegs,2023-07-21 13:25:17
"this film is an absolute triumph cillian murphy gave one of the most haunting and perfect performances i’ve ever seen this film truly portrayed the human toll and terrifying consequences that sometimes accompany human innovation the ending scene that final conversation with einstein left me speechless 
this film is completely worthy of sweeping everything at the oscars and it should it is my opinion that this movie told oppenheimer story on such a scale that his story should never be told again after this nolan crafted the greatest version of his story that can be told",2023-07-22 03:49:02
"i loved every aspect of the  movie except if i had to be really nitpicky the fact that i knew the explosion was practical felt like it reduced my enjoyment of it somehow i realised that it was some drums  of gasoline exploding that nolan shot  cleverly to make it seem bigger it was genius from a film making perspective but maybe i would have liked finding that out after the movie was released  but i was unable to as this was the one thing that dominated my social media feedas the amount of the number of  about nolan detonating an actual nuke was insanely high

also the final scene was totally cgi where oppenheimer was dreaming about the end of the world",2023-07-22 15:56:10
"absolutely  dreadful dreadful and anxiety inducing and devastating but a film for the ages i think this is nolans magnum opus the trinity test scene left my heart racing the absolute decimation that surrounded this bomb but yet the beauty of seeing what you created be possible in a weird way the movie reminded me of mary shelley’s frankenstein with oppenheimer being victor and the bomb being the creature or even with the roles reversed tbh an overarching theme of frankstein is loneliness and oppenheimer is burdened with the knowledge of what he has created and what implications it has for the rest of time “satan had his companions fellow devils to admire and encourage him but i am solitary and abhorred”

oppenheimer was extremely smart who seeked knowledge but at what point does the knowledge become deadly he was a man ruled by ego and he never intended for this bomb to be a weapon of mass destruction but that does not negate the responsibility he must take for creating a weapon like this i found the scene where they’re picking what japanese city to bomb to be the most jarring saying that he crossed off kyoto because it’s a culturally important city and because him and wife vacationed there the contrast of the absolute decimation that the bombs caused over the casual tone of them picking a city that would be best to bomb

a visually stunning film with all of nolans directing choices adding on the film than taking away from it probably wouldn’t watch again for a hot minute because it was draining in the best way but easily a 475 for me",2023-07-22 23:07:38
"watching this at 10pm was a mistake when you incorporate how bad the sound mixing was and the movie all dialogue last hour was hard to get through found myself almost falling asleep even though i tried my hardest to focus the speed of the dialogue and how it jumps from scenes to scene was hard to follow the pacing felt completely off to me 

i think i need to watch it one more time at home with subtitles to really digest this movie properly",2023-07-23 14:57:34
"i found this boring and pretentious with the way the film was shot endless dialogue scenes of exposition and witty remarks and ‘intelligent’ conversation while the camera slowly zooms in the person talking as the music swells it felt like a 3 hour long trailer

the film also felt very cramped both in the speed of the pacing and in the composition of the shots this is partly due to the nature of the film being that it is mainly comprised of characters talking to each other but there were hardly any interesting or visually exciting shots

this may be my own personal taste but i just felt like there was something off about the dialogue everything seemed too perfect characters could always come up with the snarkiest wittiest thing to say to whoever was antagonising them to me it felt like a ‘high art’ marvel movie

the bomb test was incredibly overhyped as well it did not at all look like a convincing nuclear explosion and again the camera was so zoomed in for most of the explosion and the focus was too heavily put on the characters reactions that i hardly even felt a sense of scale or grandiose but again this may be due to my own personal taste

also the film’s big moments for example the bomb test rami malek’s character exposing strauss did not feel earned despite its long runtime the film felt rushed and therefore i felt as if these moments didn’t hit as hard as they should have

my only real positives of the film was that the acting was on the whole superb and despite my criticisms of the cinematography it certainly looked better than the majority of films coming out recently

overall i would recommend it to someone who is a fan of nolan and this genre as i feel like it is a film you should probably see however i do not think i will be rewatching it any time soon",2023-07-25 10:33:12
i really truly think that this movie will get 10 oscar wins next year,2023-07-25 23:01:52
"i am genuinely still in awe 

i honestly think it is unbelievable how much of a masterpiece nolan has made this latest project 

i saw it in the imax a few days ago and im still thinking about it days later from the score to the actors to the cinematography to the overall way it was shot… just absolutely incredible definitely one of nolans finest projects to date

just to give you an idea of what the atmosphere in my screening was like you could literally feel every single emotion in the audience throughout every single scene and i dont think ive experienced something like that in a very long time it just shows you the beauty of christopher nolan and his ability to project such a beautiful vision for us all to see what a time to be alive",2023-07-27 23:34:40
best movie i have seen in the last 20 years imo,2023-08-08 05:17:19
the movie was terrible extremely long and jumps around in the timeline so much that its annoying to follow,2023-08-12 03:04:46
"this brings to mind the story from the krishnas kino about the princess who gazed upon christopher nolan as he readied himself to write a woman he spoke “you are become death destroyer of my worlds” yeah i know she died in real life dont  me

there were 2 good movies here and 1 really awful one couldnt stand how goofy the first forty minutes were young oppie traveling the world never committing to anything pugh and blunt had zero to do the one scene where blunt finds him in the woods was weak nothing could breathe in this movie that jumped between so many tones with no through line

i really felt cillian got lost in the noise albeit with some great scenes mostly just the silent speech he gives with the baby cry in the background brutal

benny safdie proves again hes the greatest actor in hollywood edward teller stole the movie for me i bet he loved putting on oily sunscreen and sunglasses and staring into the darkness

also shoutout to the dozen people that checked their phones every 30 seconds recorded the entire trinity sequence and had us hear text alerts every 10 minutes they didn’t deserve the 70mm print we got film is dead not even nolan can make an excellent movie anymore i was hoping tenet was a fluke

edit also did everyone die from cancerradiation poisoning i saw chernobyl and that was a lot of graphite",2023-07-21 08:02:37
overrated for me,2023-07-21 13:16:55
"it’s great but it’s too long and had no business being in imax it was essentially a courtroom drama i don’t see why it cost 100m either sure ok the cast i must have a massively underestimated idea of what actors earn i thought 10m for a lead was pretty good but apparently it’s a ridiculously tiny amount 

now that i’m on the bus home i’ll give some more thoughts 

i loved the score very abrasive and thumpy and kinetic cillian murphy was excellent i feel like robert downy jr and stanley tucci could play brothers the explosion was fine a little bit underwhelming though given the amount of press behind it the lack of cgi was welcome if obvious  the abstract use of miniatures or whatever practical element it was looked ok but seemed oddly out of place at times i found florence pugh being  for basically every scene very jarring and totally unnecessary  despite being happy about it 

overall i think it was very good  i didn’t enjoy it as much as i was hoping it feels  to say it was a 710  it feels like a 1010 but the length was uncomfortable and after the 2 hour mark i did start to feel a little impatient so i struggle to give it a higher rating even if basically everything was essentially perfectly executed",2023-07-21 15:04:39
3 hours with nolans sound mixing ill watch it at home with subtitles,2023-07-21 22:22:39
i thought this movie was fine but plagued by the classic christopher nolan downfalls couldn’t care less about the characters and the dialogue is choppy and unnatural not much heart to the movie and it was overly long but further than that it was a cool story and it looked amazing on the 70mm imax screen,2023-07-22 01:33:36
"it’s a good movie it’s 30min to an hour too long you could argue that there is no reason for robert downey jr to be in the movie but to setup the last scene that last scene is tremendous but if the whole movie was setup for the last scene then what was like half the movie 

florence pugh is great has like 5 lines but loooks great except that one scene which was why that even crosses a persons mind 

i think nolan got stuck with robert downey jr and couldn’t get him to the nv set or film with a lot of other actors so he had to set up the whole movie around that real life problem 

rdj is good but he sucks the point out of the movie what is the movie named 

i feel like there was a lot of other big names in this movie as cameos that i wasn’t  expecting but i don’t think they took away from the story overall

framing the movie that way telling oppenheimer’s story that way… why",2023-07-22 05:31:49
 florence pugh has great ,2023-07-22 07:28:13
"big time nolan fan interstellar and dark knight are probably my most watched movies but this this was disappointing and boring

i was hoping for some ominous b29 heading to japan scenes dunkirk style we get none of that

also we don’t get the true scale of power of the bomb most unaware people will think  it’s just a big bomb equivalent to 20000 tons of tnt with no reference

they quickly mention radioactivity but not much they should have shown the true atrocities of what that bomb did and how it also impacts nature etc the women having her face melting while clapping looked like some cheap plastic tape  makeup i’ve seen it done better on tv shows with less budget

the trinity test was very underwhelming it looks like a barrel of gasoline explosion with black smoke go check the real remastered video on youtube to see what it really looked like and how scary it is

i think they really should have used the r rating to show more aftermath instead of florence pugh  which were unnecessary for the plot but i guess good eye candy for the audience otherwise they easily could have avoided that and just get a pg13 rating for more ticket sales

the movie focused more on his security clearance and downey jr strauss character would have been better if they explained nuclear fission in detail and more physics and einstein stuff 

at some point you got some dialogue back and forth with black white imagery and you get quick cuts of the bomb being built like a puzzle by dropping the pieces in place 

also movie has some unnecessary jumpscares

but the acting was excellent and the charisma of the actors kept me listening but still disappointed as the movie felt too long while focusing on issues that weren’t really interesting",2023-07-22 13:43:07
"the movie was fine overall but i was pretty disappointed with it i understand the significance of the material but it was still long still and boring theres no reason for it to be over 3 hours or in imax i wouldnt recommend this movie to people unless they are history buffs

watching oppenheimer is like watching a 3h trailer of oppenheimer",2023-07-22 14:34:00
"the amount of people who are upset that the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki arent in the film is asinine the film is much better off not including them  its completely irrelevant to show that

i maintain that the meme of barbenhiemer is bringing people to see this film that dont have the capacity or patience to accept this film for what it is 

but the we want more splosions crowd being out in full force is tremendously odd",2023-07-22 19:27:13
bold move to release a film that does not pass the bechdel test on the same day barbie releases lol,2023-07-23 05:23:22
"love reading these comments for adrenaline junkies who can’t fathom that movies with no “action” can warrant such high praise

go get off to more mid marvel films if you want your nonstop meh action sequences absurdly sad to see how dopamine addicted so many people are that they chose to see a movie a biopic about a  scientist and are blatantly disappointed that nukes weren’t going off every 5 minutes lol",2023-07-23 06:58:49
"a bit ago i watched that elvis movie that movie was so choppy and not a single scene lasted for more than 45 seconds they were trying to compact 40 years into three hours

oppenheimer is essentially doing the same thing and because of that it was super choppy and disjointing since nolan likes to needlessly befuddle the timelines around it made even more so choppy and disjointing you have some of the greatest actors in modern cinema and you’re just going to have them repeat lines you’re not going to let them stew on a scene and play into it for a few minutes 

i wanted this movie to be about the race to make the bomb including the politics of whether or not they should devote the resources the testing of the bomb and the moral ramifications of what oppenheimer did he was trying to save the world and instead he might’ve doomed it that is an excellent movie we did not get that movie

the bomb explosion occurred two hours into the movie meaning there was a whole hour left taking into account that a lot of that first two hours was actually post hiroshima and nagasaki less than half of the movie was a movie i wanted to see instead we got this whole communist spy american loyalty court drama and i did not want that was it good it could have been if it was edited by someone who’s seen a movie before and the music volume was cut down by half i couldn’t hear perhaps a fifth of the dialogue and the only reason it was that low is because i’ve read a book about oppenheimer and i was able to guess what the actors were saying for half the movie 

nolan makes movies that should be good on paper but in execution that fall short of what they promise i expected a great film i got an okay one instead if it was edited so it was less choppy and the music was quieter i could say it was good",2023-07-23 07:15:28
without going into too much detail  i was disappointed this was not the block buster that i thought i was going to get,2023-07-23 11:20:54
"best i can say about this movie is that even though it was 3 hours long it didn’t feel a minute over 4

seriously i’ve never seen something that felt both so overstuffed and excruciatingly long",2023-07-23 15:04:16
"after making the rounds through all the socials i can definitely say that oppenheimer would not have done as well without barbie barbie gave this movie a big boost

i thought it was really boring it felt like nolan made this movie exclusively for people who already have a solid grasp of the events depicted in the film for someone with minimal background knowledge on the story the nonlinear storytelling and often unintelligible dialogue made this film very hard to follow,2023-07-23 23:48:56
didnt understand half of it was robert downey jr a bad man i also thought the bomb was lackluster and thought there was no need for any of the  scenes no mention of ernest rutherford and the music was too loud maybe im just old haha  kinda disappointed 610,2023-07-24 05:46:44
that explosion was really  underwhelming even in imax,2023-07-24 22:12:25
"if it werent for my 3 buddies i wouldve left the theater even with the good performances the tedious and dull court room hearings were painfully boring
 
i wasnt expecting a spectacle filled blockbuster but i was expecting something engaging and gripping this was the most boring experience ive had at the movies in a while 

chris nolan peaked at inception for me and each subsequent film of his has let me down more and more

 im glad a drama like this is doing so well because its great for big movies to have variety and not all be cgi popcorn fests with that being said i have no desire to revisit oppenheimer i wanted to love this movie unfortunately i was greatly disappointed",2023-07-27 07:15:42
"i really dont get the praise for this the first third was paced like scrolling through tiktok second third got a little interesting but the test was disappointing the last third is when i felt more invested and interested 

i havent read the book and i am definitely no nolan but had the thought that centering the story telling around the clearance hearing and flashing back through different questions would might have solved the pacing",2023-07-27 16:21:38
"the story was very difficult to follow it is interesting in itself but it is told in a confusing manner jumping from one year to the other with no way to distinguish what is happening when there isnt even a change in the protagonists appearance

the fact that so many people dont acknowdlege this makes me hate the movie even more",2023-07-31 22:33:14
i waited for over a month to watch this movie on an imax screen at perfect seating position i felt this movie didn’t need imax screen as it had 90 percent of closeups and only few grand shots this would be the only nolan movie which i wouldn’t be watching again i felt nudity was unnecessary which didn’t add any value to the plot or performance showing nolan has decided to pivot from his usual way of film making he was successful in showing that people and politics are more complex and powerful than quantum mechanics,2023-08-21 01:55:38
i dont understand people saying that they didnt know who was who when watching the movie and then reviewing it based on that its not a documentary where you learn about that stuff its a movie based on a 700 pages biopic so it was clear that you have to have somewhat of a knowledge about some people going into the movie its not the movies fault if people dont know who certain characters are,2023-07-21 11:16:24
awful terrible worst film ive seen with a 100 million budget in a long time,2023-07-22 18:04:53
i paid extra to see this in imax and sit in less comfortable chairs for 3 hours and all i got was one lousy test explosion seriously underwhelming great acting and was surprised they managed to keep up the pace but its just long and boring and it cant make up for it feel bad for bringing my girlfriend to see this  seriously and the music would build to very loud levels for seemingly no reason when very little it happening on screen it was over done,2023-07-30 06:46:12
"the movie was great overall i was just a bit underwhelmed by the trinity test explosion 

it felt like they detonated a bag of gasoline

and the  was a little too hollywood unnecessary 

and it focused too much of the accusations part instead of the excitement of physics science discovery etc in this regard interstelar was a bit better

they focused a little too much on trials his fence hopping  give me the deep need  the labs the people refining uranium i didnt come in to see florence pughs parts

i expected more especially after such hyping and of course interstelar 
but worth watching and better than that barbie ",2023-08-09 21:43:41
maybe i missed the point but i found the writing and acting in the film too dramatic over played for the historical context of the movie too much of a focus on oppenheimer having an affair too many big names cast in the movie i could not disassociate rodrick from that one actor that played him in diary of a wimpy kid and post the scene where oppenhemier walks outside and this actor is puking on the lawn or whatever also josh from drake and josh hitting the detonation button… just made the whole film feel way too cheesy in relation to the context borderline offensive not gonna lie and i usually don’t care went in kind of expecting to feel something bigger and kept asking myself throughout the entire movie “this film is about the bombs that incinerated japanese people on impact right” felt weird leaving the theater wouldn’t go see again,2023-08-26 19:04:09
i expected a lot more honestly it was a good movie yes but imo it was too sensational and glorified than a movie about the atom bomb needed to be also very long with very little substance,2023-07-21 18:27:40
so many character without proper intro to invest any characters oppenheimer portrayed as non emotional and suddenly he becomes felt fear and guilt i am lost mid way and no feelings towards any of the characters and the non linear fashion anybody explain them to me,2023-07-21 19:19:10
very average,2023-07-22 01:20:07
"i just saw it about an hour ago and i have to say i have some complaints

1 the trailers need to do the movie justice the trailers lead the viewers into believing that its going to be a movie about only building the bomb and not about oppenheimers full life story honestly i thought this too and going into the movie i kept asking myself if this was really the movie
2 the movie seems really hard to follow when one arc or plot line is about to reach its climax it seems to jump to something else it almost felt like you had to read a biography on oppenheimers life before watching the movie even to understand what was happening and in the scene where oppenheimer is being followed by what i think was the fbi he goes and has  for no reason at all i thought there would be some crazy standoff between these two men with greatly differing social and political views but no he goes and has  and i do understand its about his life but cmon 
3 the buildup was not worth the payoff christopher nolan spends two and a half hours of buildup to what was supposed to be and advertised like the big finale of the movie only to show a 20second clip of a bomb that honestly wasnt that spectacular
4 this whole idea of oppenheimer struggling with stress is in my opinion pretty well portrayed through the stomping feet that lead up to a pretty halfassed speech but in some cases feels overdone and not needed in certain scenes 
5 the  scenes are just  like when oppenheimer whispers destroyer of worlds while having  like  also theres a whole scene with them chilling  which seemed unneeded 

all in all though i didnt think the movie was that bad if youre going in with the intent of being a biopic about oppenheimers life but if you think its going to be a movie fully about the creation of the atomic bomb think again cause this is not what it is",2023-07-22 03:55:02
"boring and hard to keep up with since it kept switching around past  present  future i can see what he was going for but i literally fell asleep towards the end of the movie

the bomb and scenes were really dope though",2023-07-22 07:07:52
"i must be in the complete minority but i thought the film was terrible actors were great and the score was beautiful but it was so so boring we left the cinema with over an hour to go 

it’s a fascinating story but there was no need for that to be 3 hours it felt like it just kept building into nothing",2023-07-22 08:44:01
i liked the movie but man that bomb was such a disappointment,2023-07-22 12:15:07
was anyone else bothered by how basically no one talks like its the 40s all the dialogue sounded completely modern to me,2023-07-22 16:06:19
im easily impressed but this movie was a let down really bad pacing unnecessary black and white skipped over the physics glossed over physicists didnt make the politics interesting or engrossing or captivating uninteresting twist 3 hours long,2023-07-22 21:11:46
boring this is what happens when 1hr documentary is made into 3hr movie,2023-07-23 08:47:31
"i left cinema kinda not satisfied from trailer i simply expected different kind of movie this was more something like political drama which is not what i expected from the trailer

i know people liked it but since i am big fan of atomic energy and atomichydrogen bombs i know almost any atomic test footage that there is the conventional explosion they used for their practical effects sadly didnt do it justice for me it was too obvious that its not atomic explosion for me  atomic explosion doesnt look like  fire ffs i wish so mush nolan choose to use cgi here it would simply be so much better to basically just take the old test footage and recreate it in imax quality totally missed opportunity just because of nolan wanting it to be practical and thus totally not what it needed to be the explosion was close to 90s action movie more than anything else slowed down gas explosion

i really hated the constant over the top bass rambling over everything",2023-07-25 07:25:47
you have to see it in imax if not just for that one scene where they did math at the chalkboard for 8 seconds and then randomly switched to another point in his life for 12 seconds after it so riveting never seen anything like it crime if it doesnt sweep the oscars,2023-07-25 19:07:57
it should have shown the actual bombs dropped on japan both of them,2023-07-24 05:33:26
"there were two girls maybe 12 years old tops sitting next to me couldn’t believe they sat through the entire 3 hour movie without going on their phones once and had to think to myself what brought them there or how they got into a rated r film in the first place there was no way they were entertained by this lol

least favorite nolan film to date by the way  something was missing here for me and i think it’s the way nolan’s dialogue comes across  for a 3 hour movie that consists of mostly people talking there wasn’t any energy suspense or even urgency to the conversations that were taking place to get me emotionally involved  i know a lot of the talk performance wise is regarding cillian murphy and rdj but i thought matt damon was great in this especially after how out of place he seemed to be in his scenes shown in the trailers",2023-07-26 00:52:27
"it’s been a week since i saw it and i think i’m ready to leave my review

oppenheimer is not a good movie very ambitious and it tries to do a lot which should be lauded but it doesn’t hit most of the marks it needed to the pacing of much of the movie was breakneck the score was absolutely  relentless conversations were edited in a way i can only describe as “weird” the dialogue was at times unintelligible and the nonlinear editing adds very little to the story outside of a couple memorable scenes half the time i felt like i was watching a trailer instead of a feature film nolan refused to let a single moment in this film breathe outside of like the immediate aftermath of the trinity test 

i really liked interstellar and dunkirk and while i wasn’t crazy about it i “got” inception this isn’t that it just wasn’t good",2023-08-02 23:34:42
i’m so frustrated i want to see this in true imax and live in kentucky but i swear i can’t figure out how to find true imax locations as opposed to the amc or cinemark fake imax,2023-07-21 02:26:19
christopher nolan wonderfully brought to life reading the oppenheimermanhattan project wikipedia page at 3am and i really don’t know if i could give anything higher praise than that,2023-07-21 02:30:02
absolutely loved it although i think christopher nolan might expect a bit much from the everyday audience being familiar with the people involved historically i had no issue but i have to think some might get lost in the rapid change of context between oppenheimers deposition and strausss hearing which the second half leans focuses on heavily,2023-07-21 02:57:51
did anyone else think cillian murphy sounded like robin williams,2023-07-21 03:07:38
jack quaid cast as young richard feynman was spot on,2023-07-21 03:46:52
can someone who has seen the movie please tell me if the bhagavad gita scene is in it,2023-07-21 03:59:14
my  i heard the last scene would have you thinking i knew something earthshattering was coming but even at that the way its tied together throughout the whole movie to culminate into that last exchange i was shook to my core,2023-07-21 04:14:42
did the guy who left the ignition room and took off his glasses live without consequences i thought the news they give about the spy was news that that scientist died of radiation or blindness or something,2023-07-21 04:17:30
i was not expecting that cast holy  there’s so many well known actors in this,2023-07-21 04:23:43
saw it in regular imaxthe 70mm version isnt available where i live it was incredible last podcast on the left recently did a sixepisode series about the manhattan project i highly recommend it,2023-07-21 04:37:40
i loved that scene and i think it ties back to a theme of the film which is “you dont get to commit a sin and expect the world to weep for you” which is something along the lines of what his wife said to him,2023-07-21 04:43:38

is this a must in 70mm imax,2023-07-21 05:08:59
fantastic movie probably top 3 nolan for me other than the dark knight and interstellar perfectly deals with the morality of the bomb and the performances were fantastic,2023-07-21 05:20:27
the scene where an audience of people including oppenheimer where shown slides of the horror that the bomb did to the japanese people every slide people were visually wincing and looking away powerful cinema how could anyone not feel morally culpable,2023-07-21 05:29:50
"murphy rdj oldman and matt damon were phenomenal i loved the rag tag group of scientists and learning who they seen what they specialize in forgot that einstein and bohr were alive during this time 

the rest of the cast was a lot of “oh i’ve seen that face somewhere” but unnecessary to get that known of an actoractress teller the attorney that was grilling him in the small room the first american scientist that offers him food all the time that was in 10 things i hate about you the “judge” in the small room i think the kid from valerian etc  

it makes me think about nationalistic pride then — the concerns of labeling someone fascist or communist maybe being an antiwar hippie during viet nam… and now we use the same nationalistic fear today to mark certain people bad or evil 


my main question is  was florence pugh’s purpose",2023-07-21 05:33:33
einstein appearing out of nowhere after the taxi left got a huge laugh out of my theater loved the movie can’t wait to see it again in imax,2023-07-21 05:41:59

shoutout to my boy neils bohr for telling the 100 true story of how he passed out on a plane and played it off like he did it on purpose,2023-07-21 06:02:57
"is oppenheimer having a huge ego a fair takeaway from this i know rdj’s character basically believe that in a way and he’s the antagonist of the film but he’s sorta right in my eyes

oppenheimer cheated on his wife and ex girlfriend multiple times and then even before stepping into the office where they were grilling him he bragged about how a husband couldn’t of possibly died of a broken heart from finding out about his wife’s affair with opp because he never found out

there’s obviously better examples like how he talks to some people but his constant cheating was the main thing i remember",2023-07-21 06:10:59

"please respond without spoiling 

is the explosion scene extremely loud in oppenheimer especially in imax im a little sensitive when it comes to loud noise and i dont want to end up with a traumatic experience  

like if its just a shade louder than action sequences or explosions in other movies thatd be fine but if its something that is unbelievable like a thunder clap for lightning strike right near you then i might rethink",2023-07-21 07:18:47

okay old cillian murphy looks like micheal keaton what the,2023-07-21 20:35:52
absolutely incredible movie but on a super random note i got so weak inside when máté haumann’s character appears when they go to that lab in chicago while oppenheimer is in the middle of getting his security clearance idk what he said with that one line but he just seemed like a ridiculous villain you’d see in a 70s movie,2023-07-22 01:29:52
im going to be honest i had no idea who jason clarke was and i thought roger robb was played by matthew perry at first until i looked it up after the movie ,2023-07-22 03:24:41

imax tickets are like 3x more expensive where i am and i honestly havent actually watched an imax movie before also i have very terrible eyesight along with poor peripheral vision so not sure if it affects the experience just not sure what imax actually brings to the table and if i with my terrible eyesight can actually get anything out of it with such a huge price difference 

would you think this is worth an imax experience for me or should i just go for a normal viewing oh its just a normal imax too not 70mm no 70mm anywhere even remotely close",2023-07-23 03:35:01

the imax 70 mm option at lincoln square nyc is virtually sold out im not sitting in the front row  and yes i feel like a  for not getting a ticket the day they came available i  up

but i can easily get tickets where i live to see oppenheimer in imax digital not sure if its laser or xenon im thinking about seeing it on standard imax first and then seeing it a second time in imax 70 mm at linc sq if more showings are added for future dates 

do people think seeing regular imax first might lessen the funimpact of imax 70 mm and therefore i should wait and hope more viewings are added

"best nolan film since interstellar or even since inception thrilling all the way through even with the timelines jumping around and a huge cast you never really got confused or bored it was made to be seen in a theatre

my guesses are that cillian murphy emily blund and rdj all get nominated for academy awards and the movie itself in almost every category idk if it will win that much though the academy will probably complain about the lack of diversity",2023-07-22 06:31:02
without a doubt in my mind nolans greatest work since interstellar the very definition of a true mustsee cinematic experience from cinematographer hoyte van hoytemas breathtaking visual imagery — some of which may very well be the most jawdropping of nolans career — to ruth de jongs astoundingly authentic period production design from nolan and jennifer lames audaciously experimental editing choices to ludwig göranssons gorgeous yet utterly bonechilling musical score id be grossly amiss not to mention cillian murphys spectacular performance,2023-07-23 04:20:14
"what an absolutely immense breathtaking film easily nolans best since interstellar  perhaps better 100 watching it again in imax 70mm this time  i watched on imax digital and while the size and sound were appropriately huge i got the clear sense that the movie was designed to see everything in maximum resolution  particularly the characters skin textures as well as oppenheimers various visions all of which were visually stunning and struck the right balance of beauty and terror

every single actor brought their agame and it seemed nolan crammed the cast with famous faces simply because of the sheer number of people involved in the story  having recognizable actors helps keep track of whos who and nearly all of them got at least one memorable scene the scenes between murphy and damon were definitely my favorites but rdj owned every single moment he was in this is the first time ive seen him not merely play himself and its such a leap seeing him go from playing tony stark  the man everyone wants to be  to this pathetic vindictive resentful guy who feels sidelined by the superstar scientist they should cast him as an antagonist more often he was absolutely superb as strauss i also loved how nolan used color for oppenheimers pov and black and white for strauss which to me seemed to communicate how strauss vision of the world  seen through a lens of envy resentment and cynicism  is gray lifeless and limited whereas oppenheimers world is bursting with the vibrant color of bottomless curiosity and ambition 

as for the other supporting cast blunt and pugh were enchanting in their relatively limited roles jason clarke was a background presence until he suddenly got to revel in playing an  in the final third and i absolutely loved josh hartnett as well hes fresh off of an intense spellbinding performance on black mirror dude can really act rami malek meanwhile was a distracting presence in that trial scene for a number of reasons mainly because i feel like he shows his limitation as an actor with every role since mr robot it always just feels like elliot straining to speak and emote i also found the casting of jack quaid as the famously charismatic richard feynman hilarious given that he has all the charisma of a wet paper bag on the boys i think he had more bongo than dialogue in this film anyway benny safdie as edward teller getting that much screentime was another surprise but he did well with a role that couldve become a caricature same with branagh as nils bohr not sure why hes so obsessed with doing accents but it felt significantly less corny here than in tenet

the trinity test no words literally i had it spoiled that the scene would be soundfree and after that scene in the last jedi the technique didnt feel quite as novel but the effect it had was undeniable the scene with the crowd afterwards was in some ways even more striking and certainly more horrifying

i mainly want to rewatch because this was one long complicated movie that refused to hold your hand and absolutely requires repeat viewings to fully grasp and appreciate the first third was definitely my favorite because of how alive and kinetic it felt  that can you hear the music scene at the beginning was jawdropping and the mix of nolans frenetic crosscutting between timelines goranssons unrelenting music and the training montage thrill of watching oppenheimer quickly rise in stature was mesmerizing the sections after the trinity test werent nearly as tedious as some reviews made it out to be but they were definitely the most dense talky portion of the film and the key reason why it should be viewed multiple times

i just love it when films revisit flashbacks and expand upon them in tidbits to gradually reveal the bigger picture and this movie utilized this device repeatedly especially during that devious scene revealing how far strauss went to sabotage oppenheimer but the real  of geniuses was the way nolan ended the movie with that oppenheimereinstein conversation the movie ended with that same note of intrigue and religious terror that it began with also hilarious that they were indeed talking about something more important than strauss who is now relegated to a blurry figure approaching them out of focus

in many ways this movie reminded me heavily of the dr manhattan chapters of alan moores watchmen between the constant jumping in time the tone being both intellectual and melancholic and of course the character of a depressed morally anguished womanizing genius scientist who has unearthedharnessed otherworldly power id be very surprised if the dr manhattan character wasnt at least partly inspired by oppenheimer",2023-07-23 12:04:16

being a non american movie does very poor explaining of actual events before name dropping it which made it very confusing to follow the screenplay,2023-07-22 19:28:36
"people have pointed out their problems with the film in this thread much more eloquently than i could so im only talking about the ending

to be completely honest the supposedly gut punching ending didnt get much of a reaction out of me 

it shows that a nuclear apocalypse is always on the horizon which im already well aware of and the fact that hasnt materialised nearly 80 years later kind of put a damper on the point also people have come up with and been using numerous more ways to  other peopledamage the planet since then

some say its meant to be more general about pushing the boundaries without considering the consequences and stuff like ai but the images used were exclusively oppenheimer riding the bomber plane and nuclear weapons going off imo it would have been better if those scenes were cut and we only had the shot of oppenheimer looking at the pond let the audience think what his words mean for themselves",2023-07-22 22:20:05
"growing up “jfk” was one of my all time favorite movies with one of the greatest casts ever assembled 

the historical accuracy of that film is obv probably not great but that’s besides the point 

this reminded me of jfk with a much better more technically skilled director 

this is gonna be best picture i don’t think there’s any chance it doesn’t win 510 oscars at least 

everything about it was incredible 

and nolan finally got the sound mix right as well there were only like two occasions i had trouble understanding the dialogue 

i haven’t seen him get a ton of pub from this but casey affleck was  terrifying 

everyone was so good and nobody really jammed it up i thought 

every shot was so sumptuous and technically proficient 

the editing was also fantastic all that jumping around could have been a hot mess but it worked 

top 10 movie for me the past 1020 years 

def one of the all time great technical achievements for what is ostensibly just bunch of people sitting around talking for 95 of the movie 

every single shot was just so technically proficient 

it’s kinda wild to see a drama that is almost all just dialogue with nearly no action be shot in imax with what must have been absolutely insane amounts of time spent on setups 

this is an all time great film and technical achievement 

every aspect of the sound design and mix was so technically perfect i think the audio was the most impressive thing

i really hope this starts a revival in big budget talkie dramas like this 

this is one of those movies that will be a fixture in film schools forever",2023-07-24 11:08:02
"just saw it last night first half i really enjoyed i was fascinated by the science and team work behind creating the bomb i dont understand why the  scenes were necessary especially the imaginary one in the hearing was a bit ridiculous but i was still invested in the creation of the bomb the last hour or so it drags on the movie never properly explains who strauss is or helps convey why strauss is so mad at oppenheimer i only know his story because i read about it before and everytime you think the movie is about to end it keeps going i think the problem is that everyone came for the bomb and the build up and tension to the bomb is so incredible that its just insanely boring afterwards to watch an hr of politics i understand why they showed his trials and how they made him fade away from the public eye but its done in such a way that i wouldnt be surprised if most people went for a nap for the last hr of the movie i almost dosed off 

i think other people pointed out its hard to understand why oppenheimer had such a moral dilemma afterwards when were never really given any idea of how horrific and devastating the bombs were were just shown the test explosion and in the next scene the bombs are sent off and the next scene is the truman announcing the dropped them on nagasaki and hiroshima the whole point of the second part of the movie is showing oppies resentment of such an invention used to destroy cities and yet in three  hr movie it doesnt even give 2 mins of headlines or showing the aftermath of the bombs 

overall 35 from me its good but certainly not the best cillian is incredible though throughout the movie",2023-07-30 06:31:38
the criticism nolan gets is hilarious man some people here are just nitpicking for just hating his work it seems saw one guy here saying this movie is bad because the way his presentation of women is how a man would look at women in a old fashioned way without any direction like tipical nolan lead women and got a tons of upvotes this is a post world war 1 movie like what did they expect him to rewrite history and have a barbie cameo and tell  that war is bad in the middle of the movie,2023-07-22 01:35:11
one of the more underwhelming scores of nolan’s films,2023-07-21 04:54:54
what an absolutely incredible movie  one thing i took away from it and specifically from our main character murphy btw  jaw dropping acting is how all jro wanted to do was work and create from  his amazing talents with how he understood the world   like an artist who just needs to paint  he and his mind were above the fray of the world  unfortunately the world dragged him down and ultimately consumed him  an incredible opportunity that he could not pass up ultimately gave him heavy cancerous guilt  one we cannot even imagine   nolan brilliantly keeps every single event including the trinity test just below the most important one  jro,2023-07-21 21:34:40

almost needed to go see mission impossible again after this just to get my dopamine fix in,2023-07-23 19:12:57
"just saw it in imax  it was  good to ok  i was immersed throughout the movie good  for the less good the story telling felt off to me  it wasnt really about the science or process of building the bomb that was sort of background  there were few challenges to overcome  it was kinda about his personal life although critical background info never was really there  and it almost seemed to be a series of snap shots progressively of his life  it was kinda about his internal struggle but again not really a full picture

it was pretty well filmed and entertaining but afterwards i find it surprisingly empty  its not going to be a movie people watch over and over i think  to that end its going to be more of oliver stones jfk than like say a a beautiful mind or the imitation game",2023-07-31 15:47:31
just saw it a second time and its shot up to top 3 on my nolan ranking what a fantastic movie,2023-08-03 23:01:09
"its easily the best nolan film to date  not perfect i had a few gripes with its pacing especially in the first hour or so

many of the anecdotes in the movie are stories that every stem undergrad has heard a million times from people in the physics department  such as kurt godel and einstein enjoying walks together  this movie will be popular amongst those types of people

i was pleasantly surprised at how much the movie went into oppenheimers leftwing views

definite thumbs up",2023-07-21 14:30:29
"really not sure what i thought of it the test bomb scene was maybe the best cinema experience i’ve ever had the build up was perfect and my palms were getting all sweaty i felt like i was going to have to hold onto my seat the first hour and third hour showcased some phenomenal acting but i still feel a bit meh about it it may be his most ambitious project but i think to say it’s nolan’s best is a big overstatement 

funnily enough i felt more emotion when margot robbie cried in barbie than when cillian murphy cried emily blunt deserves her oscar but i can very much see leo and kotfm taking best actor and best picture",2023-07-21 18:08:59
" near perfect film casey afflecks part was my only gripethat was legit some of the worst acting ive ever seen in a major film he seemed to just be reading the script and nothing else it was so bad that it took me out of the film for a bit surprising since hes been fantastic in plenty of other films thankfully he wasnt on screen for very long

cillian murphy emily blunt and pretty much the rest of the cast did a stellar job

the explosion scene was really captivating and the movie was paced beautifully",2023-07-21 22:48:46
i just think you cant give this film a final score without watching it again so many things happen that even 3 hours felt it wasnt enough to fully grasp of what we watched like the dialogues and names were extremely complicated to follow through without having prior knowledge about physics and oppenheimere life on a surface level it was a courtroom drama but beneath that there was a lot more going on from quantum mechanics to oppenheimers complex life if i was a aspiring physicist then i feel this would have been my marvels end game,2023-07-22 03:10:08

wait that was it that was the main build up i expected more i know they cant exactly have warcrimes being shown on screen but come on they skipped over the attack of japan like it was nothing that was the dumbest skip ive ever seen like the whole time i kept asking wait has it already happened like  they couldve atleast shown the preparation of the attack the confirmation of the president the japanese generals reaction or maybe even just the japanese officials surrendering that was the worst time skip ive ever seen in any movies ever 3 hours and for that extremely underwhelming build up i was left dissatisfied i dont wannt say it but its a bit overhyped and overrated,2023-07-27 02:14:18
i have not seen this yet with all the glowing praise can someone tell me the negative points  of the movie im sick of all the fawning,2023-07-22 12:27:17
the movie was brilliant but i lost a little respect for christopher nolan over the bhagavad gita being used for a kink that’s an entire people’s religious text and shouldn’t have been used so flippantly not to mention a ridiculous first mention of his trademark quote,2023-07-23 04:40:53
have to be in the absolute minority here didnt like it on so many levels for me already one of the most overhyped movies ever,2023-07-31 11:37:16
"next thread that pops up that asks what people pretend to like ill say oppenheimer im only half serious but this movie was very flawed and the amount of praise its getting is suspicious ive been guilty of this wilful blindness in the past when a longawaited space fantasy movie came out in 1999 i saw that movie 11 times in theater and today i cant explain why i went through it because i always knew from the first viewing that despite all its qualities the phantom menace wasnt a good satisfying movie 

but at least it had a few memorable sequences",2023-08-22 16:07:58
"overhyped way too long boring extremely loud wow what an incredible disappointment

i might be in the minority here but… the movie was too  loud i purposely didn’t watch it in imax so i could save my hearing but the dolby didn’t spare me i am an hour removed from watching it and i still hear ringing,2023-07-21 05:42:24
"most of my thoughts so far have already been mentioned by others fantastic film everyone  killed it in their roles and the trinity and speech scenes were a step above didnt see it in 70mm but im glad i saw it nonetheless 

did notice one thing that stuck out to me in the third act when oppenheimer and his lawyer whose name i dont recall are in the hallway waiting on kitty to arrive theyre having a conversation nolan breaks the 180° rule during this conversation having both oppenheimer and his lawyer fill the same space in frame for each cut 

generally the 180° rule is a given for maintaining visual continuity so if you break it its either a rookie mistake or a deliberate choice given nolans experience i cant help but feel it has to be deliberate however i didnt see any reason why hed break that rule did anyone pick up on that",2023-07-21 09:22:30
i heard this movie was the bomb,2023-07-21 09:25:36
for someone who seems otherwise to be very good at casting why does nolan insist on putting exnhler sean avery in his movies now and in very distracting roles near the climax he’s not a good actor and was so jarring to see pop up during the trinity test scene,2023-07-21 11:56:53
"good movie overall 810 more like a 7510 but murphys acting and nolans effects team make it oscarworthy

i definitely felt that runtime like everyone is saying it gets a bit rough after the bomb is dropped i honestly was a bit underwhelmed but mostly because i thought the movie would focus less on the politics of the bomb and oppenheimers security clearance denial was expecting something more along the lines of interstellar focusing more on the physics and ethics aspects but overall not disappointed

will be seeing it again sunday to unpack it a bit more 3 hours is a commitment especially on a week day",2023-07-21 13:49:22
this quest into the human psyche is no less than a very spiritual experience to me this is the most emotionally dense film that nolan has ever made that it is recorded history just adds an unbelievable amount of weight to the whole ordeal impeccably acted by cillian murphy and rdj in particular the post trinity test sequences especially the last scene between oppie and albert are some of the most haunting scenes ever put to film the aaron sorkinesque dialogue the editing and the score  none of these things should coexist successfully in a character study such as this but nolan makes it fit like it was just meant to be i only wish that the symbolism of the gita was explored a bit more  it perhaps wouldve given the film even more gravitas but even in its current form it merits multiple watches what a masterpiece lots to chew on,2023-07-21 15:49:50
"i’m confused as to why einstein was cold to strauss 

from what i understand is it that oppenheimer’s conversation with einstein allowed him to understand the destruction that could come with freely developing atomic weapons hence he shrugged off strauss because of his proproliferation views",2023-07-21 18:17:29
i expected to see more scenes about how and from where they were gathering uranium and plutonium rather than cillian just putting marbels in the bowl,2023-07-21 18:31:41
"really liked it but didnt love it

the test explosion was one of the most powerful and terrifying portrayals i have ever seen of a nuclear bomb in a movie however i found myself really wishing for the movie to be shorter the last halfhour of the three hours i watched i was somewhat hoping for the movie to be ending a little bit sooner than it did there was a  ton of dialogue and although thats 50 of the movie my interest in oppenheimer losing his security didnt matter that much personally at the end

the music however man that was  brilliant i was immediately sold and immersed in the first 20 minutes of the movie and was kept engaged until the last hour afterwards it  wasnt that engaging",2023-07-21 20:43:13
"i like nolans work even if not everything he has made was great but this one was really great nolan continues to prove himself to be a great filmmaker as his writing direction and style remains strong the narrative about oppenheimer and the dramatic elements happening around his creation and the people was tight and engaging with strong performances from every cast members beautiful camerawork and score and a really good pacing interactions between characters were wellwritten and never once felt bored seeing it the explosion sequence and speech scene was just absolutely stellar 

the sound design is great although there were certain moments that the sound design that were really loud that made it a little difficult to hear some of the dialogue and a particular  hallucination that was pretty cringeworthy but overall its a really great film

the movie is 1010 but i was a little upset with the projection of this i saw it in 70mm non imax but i feel like the theater didnt know how to work film because the film was so dirty like an ungodly amount of burn marks and splice cuts and it just didnt look clean maybe the imax cut looked cleaner but i was lowkey disappointed with how the theater handled the film again this is nothing to do with the film that was amazing just a grip i had,2023-07-22 03:23:32

the way i didnt even want to watch this movie and only watched it bc of the hype im so glad i did this is easily one of the best movies ive seen and this was such an oscar powerhouse in so many different aspects cinema at its peak,2023-07-24 13:00:43
i don’t think lewis strauss deserved as negative of a depiction as he got also it’s pretty clear that christopher nolan views j robert oppenheimer as the christopher nolan of a different era,2023-07-25 03:26:18
"so i went to watch the much publicised oppenheimer last night and whew did this movie blow my mind  
  
the use of shooting of both black and white and color to tell different stories i thought was done really effectively the acting from cillian murphy and rdj was breathtaking and felt real and the way that nolan and his cast managed to make what was essentially two very wordy interrogations so fascinating and gripping just goes to show that filmmaking when done properly does not need a green screen and visual effects to hold the viewers attention  
  
the issue of oppenheimer on the one hand heading the project that developed the atomic bomb and on the other his opposition to the development of the super which is oppenheimers main struggle during the movie was compelling and as enigmatic as the man himself  
  
rdjs portrayal of strauss as a confident back stabber who remembers little slights and takes his time getting his own back was a strong storyline which was fascinating and some of the best acting from rdj i can remember  
  
my favorite part of the movie was the sweat inducing scene in which boris pash the man responsible for security at los alamos is questioning oppenheimer at berkeley and oppy is trying as best as he can to not name the name of his friend the acting and editing in this scene was unbelievable",2023-07-25 06:15:27
quick question about the film have not seen it does nolan using the sound of the geiger counter as background noise for a large part of the film  i know he has used similar audio effects in other movies and i just personally find them distracting,2023-07-26 17:09:25
saw it in imax waaaaay to loud but them im old so maybe thats it bring ear plugs,2023-07-27 06:54:03
great movie technically lots of scientific jargons too much haggling between past and present scenes too many characters to keep track of the dialogues arent so loud emily blunt felt irritating there is a scene where oppenheimer says he and his wife went through fire she was supporting him when his mistress died goddamnall those felt really unecessary great movie but not recommended to the avg movie goer,2023-07-29 18:46:16
ive loved all of his movies before i didnt feel great about this one not sure why ill probs stream it someday,2023-07-30 01:45:07
"action movie fans will seriously hate this movie to death it is a lot of dialogue that are delivered at break neck speed and the later half of the movie dials all of that to 11 if you are not fan of history or dont enjoy court room dramas or like things to be dumb down a tiny bit or get restless until a big action set piece thing happens you will hate this movie

personally i felt like the movie executed everything perfectly i loved the black  white to color transitions nonlinear narrative was the right choice to tell this story and i absolutely loved the trinity test sequence it was such tension inducing moment even though you know they will push that button i loved the imagery of the explosion which i am not sure can be captured that well using cgi",2023-07-21 20:52:21
"the more i think about this movie the more disgusted i feel and the more brainwashed i feel

this movie was truly excellent i understand it’s not for everyone but people out here really calling this 410 make no sense to me it was outstanding,2023-07-21 14:23:05
its a good one but not necessarily a big screen experience as imho its more of a dialogue driven one rather then graphical one ipad and a good pair of headphones should be enough to enjoy this,2023-07-21 16:02:04
"a lot of people saying this movie is really good i think we all had been exposed to bad to mid movies in these past few years that anything close to decent will exceed everyones expectations its a good movie dont get me wrong but personally i think it is not rewatchable generally you want to see what you cant read in a biopic yes it has excellent performance from the actors but what really dissapoints me is the bomb testing scene it is very underwhelming for such a build up id rather see an accurate look of a cgi bomb showing its grand scale why no cgi nothing bad with cgi he literally made a cgi blackhole before and its glorious i get it nolan wants to show oppenheimers expression but i want to see the bomb too not a zoomed pityass fireball if this is the case id rather not see the bomb at all because what the characters say about it is more terrifying than what is shown lol on the other hand though i also think its the first comedy take from christopher nolan so many genuinely really funny scenes with a small hint of horror now i really want to see nolans take on pure horror genre

"this film reminded me of a funny joke by frankie boyle about how americans will bomb and invade your country and about twenty years later will make a movie about how bombing you made them sad

first the acting performances ranged from great to mystifying cillian murphy gave a very solemn dignified performance as oppenheimer which paired well with emily blunts lady macbeth matt damon is good in everything hes in but he has too much of a babyface to portray a ww2 commanding officer rdj was mystifying hes supposed to play an elder statesman in the higher echelon of govt but much like his movie the judge he cant reign his eccentric tone in when the movie requires it benny safdie felt like a poor parody while jason clark and josh harnett were competent 

the florence pugh subplot felt completely shoehorned in as was oppenheimers general womanizing more than a few people cringed in the theatre at that scene in the trial and it felt completely out of place and something oliver stone would do in the 90s 

the best parts were seeing the town being assembled and the scientists working together the worst parts were his supposed communist activities ie dinner parties unionizing as well as his guilt trip fetish nolan doesnt seem like he has anything interesting to say about his politics except that he was cagey and noncommittal to them when it came time to his career advancement 

nolan wants us to know oppenheimer felt real guilt but hes never been able to explain why its important for us to know about it and thats the central problem with an otherwise well executed film you need to have a compelling character at the centre of this movie and you dont really have one just someone incapable of committing to anything not to his wife his children his friends his work or his beliefs",2023-07-21 04:12:59
"eh  einstein was cool  loved the jfk drop  damons character seemed good

issues

1 nolan should have cgi the trinity test because a small c4 explosion and camera flash wasnt real enough to the source  if he didnt want cgi im sure he could have found old footage of the trinity test and edited it in

2 all the congressional hearings i felt were dry and made the film drag on  fbi investigation was okay  

3 wasnt anything about his family life which i think his wife was abusive to their kids  only thing they had was take the kid to brothers house when they cried  

4 im surprised nolan didnt show the hiroshima footage  show slight reaction from oppenheimer  even though he tells truman he has blood on his hands he doesnt act like it but when the fling suicide he gets paranoid and the wife has to tell him to pull his  together  so what im trying to say is nolan could have added a bit more like he loses sleep over nightmares or something  i just feel like this wasnt good enough

5 feels like without nolan and the famous cast this would have been a netflix series  i went to it thinking itd be awesome because of the names tied to the project but i feel like it didnt deliver for me  saw the trailer for barbie and it looks like grease but with will ferrell  feel like money and time would have been better spent",2023-07-21 08:11:11
"wow genuinely one of the most incredible movies ive ever experienced in imax cinema and ive seen avengers endgame and avatar in imax

cillian in my personal opinion this was his 2nd best ever performance first being thomas shelby peaky blinders he was a mix of emotional and incredible

nolan has outdone himself once again",2023-07-21 16:02:34
"i didnt really have much empathy for oppenheimer  the strauss conflict came together decently but i didnt exactly view strauss as a bad guy despite the movie wanting me too    

i also wanted more scenes like the one with truman  oppenheimer thought it was all about him as if truman didnt have his own moral struggles to deal with  

i wish nolan would learn to record dialogue in a way that can be understood  i felt that half the conversations were almost impossible to understand   

movie was decentgood  i give it a b",2023-07-21 18:58:32

was anyone else bothered by the fact that the score was unnecessarily noticable during many of the dialogue scenes i often felt like they shouldve just let the actors do their thing and have the performances speak for themselves rather than having an overlydramatic soundtrack play over them this also made the movie feel even more like a 3 hour hectic montage than it already did and imo removed quite a bit of depth and gravitas that couldve been there,2023-07-21 06:03:33

 incredible incredible movie what do you think was the significance of showing the “current day” scenes of the trial in black and white usually flashbacks are in black and white but this was opposite to me i think because the politicians wanted all of their answers in black and white and assumed no grey area,2023-07-22 05:14:37
saw the film last night a little bit hard for my brain to follow at times terrible with names and faces but it was really good i could feel the explosions in my body  the sound was that loud it was truly terrifying at times it was interesting to see the other side of the bombs the perspective of the people who built it i watched grave of the fireflies when i was a kid which is the kind of film that sticks to you and i think this one will stick with me too the ending was brilliant the haunted look in his eyes will stay with me i think,2023-07-22 08:59:04
why did oppenheimer support the continued production of the bomb after hitlers death was he on the side of the people who believed dropping it on nagasaki and hiroshima was justified to end the war in japan and stop emperor hirohitos plans in the region,2023-07-22 14:10:21
"very good movie

i’m left feeling like it could have been two movies one about the building of the bomb and the other about the hearings 

not sure if that would make each part better or worse though",2023-07-22 16:47:52
amazing experience and a movie worth going to the theatres for while not nolans best work it is arguably his most soul searching the performances were superb and apart from the brilliant cilian murphy i loved robert downey jrs turn as well while it has a lot of scientific terms brandied about dont thing for once they were incomprehensible to anyone watching hopefully gets nolan a well deserved oscar,2023-07-22 19:54:41
the bomb was a farty little thing,2023-07-22 23:01:41
i can’t help but ask myself if the director wasn’t nolan how would i feel about it well it’d certainly go down as a great film… but as it’s nolan… it goes down as brilliant for me strange ,2023-07-23 01:26:18
 masterpiece,2023-07-23 02:36:11
can someone please quote the intro text about prometheus writing a review and don’t want to paraphrase,2023-07-23 05:57:14
very enjoyable i found the score way to active and intense for the first 45ish of the movie  scene was so corny amazing filmmaker but i don’t dig his story telling dark knight will always be my favorite of his,2023-07-23 14:19:11
i think nolan gets a lot of flak and sometimes deservedly so for how cold and almost inhuman way he comes to writing particularly dialogue including my son but man this was perhaps his most human movie yet i havent been able to stop thinking about since i left the theater absolutely remarkable,2023-07-23 19:16:26
might be a dumb q but are they not allowed to depict nagasakihiroshima in movies anymore after the test i expected to see the actual bombings and then the horror at what they had done afterwards,2023-07-23 20:22:14
i don’t agree with y’all on the mixing choices i’m slightly hard of hearing and could understand the dialogue despite it being lower the rest of it seems like a defensible artistic choice to drive the chaotic suspense leading up to trinity,2023-07-24 16:51:26
anyone else find it ridiculous some people wore welders glasses and some wore generic sunglasses when the bomb went off,2023-07-24 22:26:08
"so i have watched oppenheimer twice and saw couple of things why for me it was a standout and i will list them down below 

1 despite a lot of events to be covered the screenplay never failed to put oppenheimer out of the viewpoint the character here still was squarely important and we were traversing the fim from his viewpoint one great scene was when oppenheimer was delivering his thanks and the background becomes shaky unsettled almost rushing out of the lens of the camera depicting the oppenheimer slow realisation immediately after that he imagined the audience of the speech to be good burned down in the atomic bomb absolutely brilliant scripting and far more effective than showing lets say japanese facing the same outcome the scene alone in itself established two different viewpoints one the breakdown of oppenheimer and the tragedy of impact of the blast


2 i absolutely loved the inspiration from the social network  the structure of the social network movie rooted in the interrogation and moving back and forth putting up a sense of urgency for me is masterfully adapted the hard cuts of the nolan which is he is known for complimented the scripting so well as movie switches to high gear and moves back and forth across three different scenes this is the movie that i feel will grow the audience so well on repeat viewing


3 this point is direct expansion ot the above that for me one of the absolute pleasure i can derive from celluloid when the dialogue gives you feeling of pleasurable rush i absolutely live for these scene and i remember again social network did this segment particularly well when mark was in the interrogation room with twins  


wonderful wonderful stuff and it reminded me why i love screenwriting so much its not so much about the story but how story was presented in celluiliod thats what matters would love to hear you all opinion",2023-07-26 09:53:42
"from the archives robert oppenheimer in 1965 on if the bomb was necessary

",2023-07-29 16:35:41
very ‘interstellar’ vibes i loved it not the biggest nolan fan but this was incredible and i love the gravity with which the subject matter was handled it felt heavy as it should it was extremely well casted and the cinematography the quote in the beginning the final line movies like this come around every few years for me i’m going to be thinking about it for a while,2023-08-07 02:53:23
"wife and i saw it last night my father is a wwii buff i’m in my midlate 40s now so he remembers a lot of this stuff from his youth as it happened i knew about oppenheimer since i was around 10 years old and was fascinated on the topic of how the bomb came to be

what i stand by now and then is oppenheimer knew what the bomb would do he knew it would  hundreds of thousands and maybe more in the future yet he still created it then felt remorse later how is that supposed to garner sympathy this wasn’t a bomb that would only take the life’s of soldiers this took women children pets and everything living he knew this and went forward 

his scientist tried to rationalize in the film that since germany surrendered when  died they should abort however they still would’ve killed people in the camps too if germany was the target 

i loved the film technically and it was very well acted there will be a lot of oscar noms for this but nolan trying to “humanize” robert and his scientist just didn’t work for me and i wouldn’t be surprised at all if most of their remorse was fabricated",2023-07-21 12:55:12
"i am a huge nolan fan the movie was technically excellent in almost every way the acting was great across the board with exception of damon i thought

but the payoff wasn’t all that good in my opinion i felt like oppenheimer’s character was underdeveloped was i suppose to feel empathy see him as bipolar manic a puppet

those were my initial feelings i left the cinema questioning how i should feel while acknowledging that the movie was a technical masterpiece",2023-07-21 16:10:16
i was very excited to see this film but it just didnt do it for me should have known given that i havent really been crazy about a nolan film since the prestige great effects amazing acting but a rather lackluster script ive never been a fan of nolans use of music in his movies either overall i prefer barbie,2023-07-21 19:10:04
"this movie was good but far from great thematically i can see why nolan was interested in the oppenheimer story and he largely succeeds at making us leave the movie with some really mind bending questions about human civilization ambition morality and our capacity for destruction but the movie itself is riddled with enough problems that it detracts from the wonderful testing scenes and the excellent ending scenes i agree with others who have said the first hour of the movie feels way too rushed the dialogue is not as crisp as others have said so much obvious exposition and everybody happens to have a great oneliner under their belt i also think the movie is plagued by the typical nolan playing loud music over characters talking issue that has been present in all his films dude sometimes you have to let people speak the truman scene was great of course

i think two other things deflated my experience robert downey jr and albert einsteins almost comical appearance people complained about matt damon but you guys are fine with downey jr i couldnt shake tony starkironman out of my head every time he appeared on screen on top of that he had the same cadencemanner of speak as tony stark and his makeup was  awful and to the guy who played einsteinsuch unnecessary caricaturing the audience i was with literally laughed when he popped on the screen

these issues took me outand they took me out in the sense of i was reminded that im watching a movie that was made rather than the engrossing experience that was supposed to make me transcend the fact that im watching a film pros were cillian murphy who was fantastic and the middle to final act",2023-07-22 00:48:43
david fincher wouldve been a better bigtime director for this movie,2023-07-22 03:31:55
"pretty good movie badly done vfx nolan is really trying to stretch that practical effects only route but it just feels off

the trinity bomb test shouldve felt grand dont get me wrong i dont want it to look amazing or cool but could the explosion at least look horrifying

no doubt the sound design was on point on the scene but that practical effects explosion hardly demonstrated the power of nuclear weapons",2023-07-22 14:49:21
"the most miserable theater experience ever the movie just kept going when did oppenheimer even get recruited felt like i was just watching a series of events with the occasional sound flare up 

i honestly think nolan is useless without david s goyer or his brother",2023-07-22 20:55:13
"anyone else feel they should of shown the hiroshima bombing i felt the whole moives was slow building to it then they just have a phone call about it

it really could of been the dramatic climax of the film i imagine they could of done a long take shot following a normal person going about their day eating breakfast petting their dog walking to work really show the victims were humans not a number then boom  wasteland charred buildings roads people screaming and devastation

i genuinely feel it could of been one of the most intense moments in cinema the moive was excellently crafted but i dont think the plot or script was",2023-07-22 22:50:28
this movie  wayyyyy overrated i was so disappointed,2023-07-23 04:39:59
"urh something has happened to nolan with both this and tenet  both movies were kind of 

1overscored’  over use of build up music with even 2 characters just talking to each other early conversations in the movie even have a tension build up score  awful 

2 awful romance aspect  both in tenet and i’m sorry in oppenheimer as well i just did not care why makes us not gas about his wife at the start if she’d start becoming semiintegral to the court room plot at the end i didn’t care for any of it similar to tenets washington romance plot nolan sucks at this it was laughable when he came home to her  cause i forgot this character even existed

3 weird scene chopping speeds and audio mixing  absolutely all the wrong speeds and volume",2023-07-23 05:50:23
"finally saw it last night at a soldout 70mm screening after reading the terrific riveting tome that is american prometheus last month in preparation for this i had as high expectations one could ever have for oppenheimer  and it met if not shattered them all an impossibly magnificent adaptation from nolan that is the stunning culmination of everything hes ever achieved so far as a writerdirector 

like 95 of whats covered in prometheus is in the film which is impressive on its own given how dense the material is but how nolan ambitiously separates all the main story and character threads intertwines and intersects them then unravels them before distinctly converging all of them again in the final hour is nothing short of a cinematic miracle in my mind and his few major changesenhancements beyond what prometheus did were  well executed as well easily the best film adaptation of this century alongside what spielberg and kushner did with lincoln and all the crafts are superlative as well from the imax cinematography to the prolific but surgical editing to ludwig goranssons score to the sound design

murphy was pitch perfect casting for oppenheimer so my expectations were high  but he surpassed them all with a towering performance that captures all of the complexities and idiosyncrasies of a generational intellect with a preternatural ability to synthesize turned scientific prophet turned political martyr  all while showing that oppie was a very flawed person with certain vulnerabilities that resulted in his downfall matching him every step of the way is rdj who somehow managed to humanize the otherwise reprehensible lewis strauss and make him a three dimensional pathetically vainglorious antagonist instead of a cartoon supervillain brutally machiavellian in his quest for power but also pitiable in his need for validation the way rdj and nolan peel back strauss over the length of the film is nothing short of complete mastery 

the very large supporting ensemble is very strong as well with so many great performances from damon whom i would not have chosen to portray leslie groves krumholtz hartnett ehrenreich safdie branagh and yes even blunt and pugh  who absolutely did the most they could with their characters 

for me i have no hesitation saying oppenheimer is the pinnacle achievement of nolan’s career — a dense intellectually probing and existentially challenging work that is one of the greatest cinematic accomplishments of the past decade it certainly is the the best film of 2023 for me",2023-07-23 18:53:32
"1010 cinematography 810 acting 510 story telling 710 message

i did not understand at all the reason to include his cheating scenes especially nudity other than the fact to illustrate how he might be questioned for being a commie and how morally conflicted he is nolan said in an interview oppenheimers relation with women is a huge part of his identity but i didnt necessarily get that message through the film i also didnt understand why a third of the movie was about strauss

another complaint i have is how stale and 1d emily blunt and matt damons character were

beside that solid historical movie did really well to depict oppenheimers moral dillema",2023-07-23 23:41:47
i think it was kinda mid for the hype dunkirk is a better film,2023-07-24 00:41:30
i feel like i’m the only one who thought the movie was mediocre outside of a few good scenes i thought the music was unnecessary at times underneath just dialogue scenes and everyone was too pretentious and halfdeveloped for me to care by the end,2023-07-24 18:50:34

very based

also the jfk name drop near the end it felt like he was hinting towards that strauss somehow played a part of his assassination or something wild like that",2023-08-09 02:19:42
great until the trinity test then there’s another hour that’s incredibly hard to follow and boring i looked at my watch thinking it was about to wrap up and still had 45 minutes left the older people in the crowd around me were getting restless and mad by the end,2023-07-21 19:54:11
i should have seen barbie,2023-07-22 00:39:52
man i did not care about the second half of this movie at all,2023-07-22 04:55:38
movie was good but there were to much switching back and forth if you think about how many times did it switch back and forth between present and past how many times did it show random explosions and fire balls etc it does this every few minutes also 3 hours was way to long for me,2023-07-22 11:50:24
"big nolan fanboy

i didn’t expect inception or interstellar

i did expect science

i got politics

good movie not good enough to justify 56 hours including travel time",2023-07-22 14:21:04
"this movie suffered from having too much to say in such little time  the middle section was so fast paced that there wasnt much time to breathe and reflect on what you are watching which reduced the impact it had   oftentimes scenes would last only a minute and that was quite frustrating after two hours this movie would have been much better as a limited series allowing for more time to be spent on the making of the atomic bomb which i personally find fascinating given what i have read in richard rhodes classic book

the sound mixing was awful which isnt surprising given that it is nolan  i dont understand why you need loud music in a movie that can be classified more as a courtroom drama than an action movie  i am not saying i dislike the courtroom drama the hearings were interesting to me but why the need for loud music  does anyone remember loud  music being played in movies like a few good men nolan should have watched that movie before embarking on creating this one

the bomb was fairly underwhelming to me  it is odd that nolan is so focused on showing oppenheimers perspective yet most of the explosion is a closeup shot  you could tell these were practical effects  i think the biggest reason why it had such limited impact was because the archival footage is scary enough  the archival footage could have been utilized to maximize the impact and it is more representative of what oppenheimer and the scientists would have seen 20 miles away

the ending also had almost no impact on me but i have a fairly nuanced view of nuclear weapons  while they have the capacity to cause genocide they have created around 70 years of peace between the superpower nations  there is no guarantee that that will last but i think it is worth noting  honestly a more reliable costeffective gmd program that can counteract icbms could have a more negative impact in making superpower nations much less hesitant to make war with another but it would safeguard nations from the annihilation so once again there is some nuance there

overall it was an 810  this is definitely not nolans masterpiece  i rank tdk inception and the prestige higher than this movie",2023-07-23 15:16:45
"my partner hated how chaotic the first act felt rapidly pinballing from scene to scene with little room to breathe or process what was happening he said it felt like they were trying to cram a lot of information into a set amount of time

i disagree i saw it as a manifestation of the abomb’s mechanism of many fissions  smaller “explosions” in different parts of his life that quickly ricocheted off of each other causing a domino effect of life choices that culminated in a “fusion” with the trial towards the end maybe this is obvious or maybe i’m reading to much into it but i thought it was fun to think about phenomenal piece",2023-07-24 00:10:51
"what part about oppenheimer being a biography means it cant portray the appearance and scale of nuclear bombs accurately especially when the consequences of that power existing in human hands is the entire theme of the movie

it just feels so pretentious to shoot a biopic about oppenheimer on imax cameras but not even show the bomb",2023-07-25 07:35:17
"great movies have at least 1 scene that completely resonantes with you the one you keep talking about afterwards for me this film lacked that there are a lot of good things in there and all the performances were on point but the entirety of it just didnt blow me away pun intended

it starts out with a pretty big mistake when oppenheimer gives a lecture in dutch i am dutch its my native language and i had no clue what he was trying to say 

when youre trying to sell that a character is a genius who can easily learn languages commit to it or mention it in passing so no audience member can check it the only proper dutch ive seen a hollywood actor speak was matt damon in the first bourne movie he only says a few things but his pronunciation is absolutely spot on despite damon having no proficiency in the language 

some other viewers were bored by all the talking but i didnt mind it the actors involved were good enough to keep things flowing but as a result nothing really stands out 

also feel free to call me a  but the nudity didnt add anything to the film at all it was just uncomfortable to watch because it felt so off compared to everything else i honestly dont get what nolan was trying to achieve with that other than increasing the rating florence pughs character was in my opinion completely wasted not her fault shes a decent actress but nolan gave her zilch to work with

a similar complaint can be made about kitty but emily blunt acted her  off in a way that hinted at there being much more to this woman than what we were shown

also what was up with oppie attempting to poison his professor that he later admitted to actually liking that was never really explained 

robert downey jr was a standout as strauss super refreshing to see him do something so different 

cillian was magnificent i just wish the movie was better than it was the bomb scene was disappointing of all the times nolan wanted to focus on practical effects this was not the scene to do it 

anyway overall i did like it but i dont think ill ever rewatch it",2023-07-25 15:40:21
maga people real conflicted right now if they just learned that jews built the bomb,2023-07-25 18:51:50
"unpopular opinion i think nolans choice to use practical effects for the trinity was a terrible idea

first of they didnt even use enough explosives what was that like 1 ton of tnt with gasoline tanks on top it was pathetic

a nuke isnt fiery in the conventional sense so those closeups of what looks like a typical movie explosions where absolutely terrible

the representation of the flash and then then shockwave where good but th explosion itself couldnt even be compared to something like the beirut explosion i mean just look at that its like 5 of the energy of the trinity test then go look back at the explosion of the film

x200b

just no some things require proper cg",2023-07-27 22:02:49
extremely overhyped imo could have been way shorter while youd expect the sciencey parts to be the most technically intense bit about watching this movie i found very little was shown about that for a subject like this found the two timelines very confusing and dialogue was very difficult to understand did not enjoy,2023-07-30 03:09:48
"have to say i was disappointed by this movie maybe it was because of all the hype and therefore i overhyped it myself but i just didnt enjoy it overall in fact had i been at the cinema alone i probably would have gone home at the interval as i was so bored 

second half of the movie is much more interesting so was at least glad i stayed to see the test etc i like intellectually stimulating movies but this was a bit overkill so much talking like non stop it was back and forth and very fast paced i dont know how non native english speakers can keep up with it 

then the time jumps etc wow was that sometimes very confusing i know nolans movies always have a full circle and a climax but this had so many little circles constantly going that you had to keep up with that i just didnt care anymore i feel like this movie could have been much simpler and still as effective 

glad i saw it but will definitely not watch it again

on a positive note  the acting was unreal i dont think there was a single bad performance  id say everyone was incredible",2023-07-31 12:47:41
movie felt very underwhelming for me even for a nolan film if i had seen this movie in 5 years knowing nothing about it i would’ve struggled to accept it was a nolan film,2023-07-23 00:30:44
for the people who loved oppenheimer what do you think is nolan’s worst film for me inception is best and oppenheimer is worst,2023-07-23 22:48:08
just saw it and my  this might be one of the best films i’ve saw just hand cillian murphy the best actor oscar and oppenheimer best picture already lol does anyone know the name of the book nolan was given that inspired him to make this,2023-07-28 21:57:47
i thought oppenheimer was incredible amazing filmmaking and casting on nolan’s part i’m usually very critical of movies and i’d give it a full 10,2023-08-03 18:00:23
"pughs plot overstayed its welcome couldve cut 3 mins there the opener was probably 10 minutes too long of oppie is a genius who sees lights and ripples 

otherwise pretty phenomenal",2023-07-31 19:22:40
"its fine probably the highlights would be the two explosions the trinity test and the prosecutions interrogation the trinity test has to be seen in theaters to be fully appreciated the scenes leading up to it and the eventual explosion are incredible to see 

but im not a fan of florence pughs scenes her making oppie read that line is ridiculous i felt no attachment to any of the characters at all even the revelation of rdjs betrayal didnt have any impact because the movie felt oddly paced 

still i enjoyed my time with it its a lot better than tenet at the very least",2023-07-21 07:19:02
it was just alright for me i really like the physics part and how a lot of influential scienctists were portrayed in it how they built the bomb and executed it and his trauma over it and but didnt really like the communist part and lot of the american names mentioned flew over my head the last act with the court room and strauss character was confusing af i am a diehard nolan fanboy and had high hopes but kinda disappointed ngl ,2023-07-21 18:31:51
"great great great movie

saw it in gardenvariety imax not 70mm film purposely sat in back row so sound would not wallop me  the scenes of new mexico scenery were amazing get a great perspective from the back row although next time i might move 15 rows down and wear light earplugs

dialog all clear for me unclear dialog might be from sound mixing in the middle of theaters

overwhelmingly amazing is the sympathetic portrait of just about everyone even pash and nichols but least so  it is easy to demonize teller and strauss and to some extent lawrence and groves but nolan kept everyone incredibly human well the actors get huge credit too downey in particular

amazing too that in todays adhd age held my interest because the script and direction was so condensed while sympathetic  remarkable achievement

although strauss loses in the movie the subtext is that he teller lawrence groves among others really won while the acting of oldman as truman was great that moment was a little bit of a lost opportunity  the democratic leaders in wwii churchill and truman and all their deputies knew full well that they were ordering millions to die and were imo psychologically sophisticated in their handling of the trauma from those decisions

i thought the script made truman too shallow  better would have been instead of portraying truman as shallow portray him as having struggled with all the same things oppenheimer struggled with but just couldnt handle his top scientist laying more guilt on everyone",2023-07-21 19:49:34
this movie is phenomenal,2023-07-22 05:01:52
"im left feeling that of all the fascinating questions to ask about nuclear weapons this film didnt ask anything that interesting

for everyone saying they were so haunted by the ending i kind of want to ask why isnt the reality that the invention of the nuclear weapon perhaps set of a chain reaction that would end the world obvious would you really expect oppenheimer to not be aware of that is that really that profound of a thing for him to reveal he believes 

the invention of the bomb pretty much objectively had the potential to destory the world why should i be stunned that oppenheimer recognised that

theres more interesting questions to me about the nuclear bomb that id hoped the film would explore more questions like has the nuclear bomb ultimately saved lives and prevented great wars pakistan and india is the only time two nuclear armed states have gone to war

to me taking all this history and just asking  wouldnt the guy who constructed what could be our total destruction feel guilty about that isnt that interesting because i meanduh",2023-07-22 14:16:02

i’ve been stewing on this all day and can’t quite get my head around the tragic poetry of strauss dooming himself by taking out oppenheimer,2023-07-25 14:00:07
why did the movie spend so much time on strauss but then conclude by saying that strauss and his political games are insignificant compared to nuclear proliferation,2023-07-31 03:48:39

"i’m a bit of an oppenheimer nerd having watched and rewatched sam waterston play him in the 1980 bbc produced sevenpart series and then deepdiving the trinity test and other documentary footage available on youtube as well as reading on the subject  i wanted to like the nolan version but ultimately was disappointed  i snorted and rolled my eyes at my friends at the love scene where he recites the famous “i am death the destroyer of worlds“—which oppie said went through his mind when the test explosion occurred  the whole thing with the robert downey jr as lewis strauss had too many inaccuracies to cite here eg einsteinoppenheimer whispering something to each other was not the reason strauss wanted oppenheimer‘s security clearance revoked  i was bracing myself for some astounding special fx but was underwhelmed from what i read about the trinity blast was that even though it was 530 am and still dark the initial flash lit up the sky like high noon for miles around  oppenheimer was never a communist—he certainly had associations who were especially during his berkeley days as were most young intellectuals during the great depression  he was indeed a womanizer—he was a charismatic l lover of music literatue and the arts  there’s more i could say but i’m not a writer as such  i suggest catching the geekynerdy version of this remarkable pivotal time in world history the quality isn’t the best but i did a search and it looks like someone is in the process of digitizing it

i have recently watched the movie and overall i liked it but this question haunts my mind oppenheimer a  his wife a  the woman who he cheats on his wife with a  the general who runs the place a  ede teller a  strauss a  oppies teacher at uni a  80 of all the characters are insufferable rude disrespectful jerks for no good reason is everything okay at home hollywood in my experience its the opposite 80 of people are decent kind and at least courteous if they have a bad day does everyone in the film industry or california behave like that so writers think its how reality is were they trying to convey the inner tension and moral dilemmas of making the atombomb by having the people throw shade for no reason help me understand",2023-08-21 12:16:11
"saw it in 70mm today in nyc first nolan movie i really liked expertly crafted and paced great acting and photography trinity test didnt bother me because thats not really what the film is about i thought it was handled artfully

only flaws i wasnt always in love with the aggressive sound design including yet another ludwig soundtrack ive been tired of his style for a long time nolan cant resist letting the soundtrack swell and overcome everything and then drop out suddenly feels cliche robert downey jr with a career high performance harry truman actor a nice surprise and a perfect cameo

that and also lets just show pughs  a few times including during the most generic  scene imaginable  seriously it even has the im inserting your  physical acting that always strikes me funny after she grabs the book and gets back on",2023-07-21 22:33:05
saw it last night in imax and loved it but i do think the film wouldve significantly benefited if we would actually see the bombs being dropped on nagasaki and hiroshima and see how horrifying it was and how much destruction it did,2023-07-22 08:59:54
"disappointing that most of the reviews are like amazing rdj needs an oscar for that performance

is it a performative movie at its best my hope was youd watch and walk out with new questions or a new perspective",2023-07-22 19:05:50
"nolan stans can get their  in a bunch but nolan’s rapid editing  music early on made it feel like a lame artsy film if any director other than nolan did it these simps would be complaining over it  not to mention the movie felt like it had music nonstop other than during the explosion scene it’s okay to just let people talk you don’t need music blaring over it 

overall a good movie held back by lame decisions 

downey is probably the oscar favorite cillian deserves a nod for sure",2023-07-22 20:42:38
fizzles not sizzles murphy was outstanding though movie way way waaaay too long for no apparent reason 75 rating,2023-07-23 06:50:54

"loved this movie i’m hearing a few criticisms here that don’t make too much sense 

a big one i’m hearing is that the explosion wasn’t good enough people wanted to see a massive explosion instead that’s just not what happened though the trinity  a small bomb compared to what we’ve done since it’s just not a massive bomb by modern standards 

another one is that there is no room to breathe in the film that’s because that was oppenheimer’s life jumping from one thing to the next every time he tried to process things and reflect he didn’t get the chance",2023-07-24 02:14:00
"movie was alright but holy  was it way too loud like my ears were in physical pain walking out of the theater and i wouldnt be surprised if i gave myself some sort of hearing damage from this thing

idk if it was just my theater or if other people experienced the same thing but they really need to cut that  out made it really difficult for me to actually enjoy the movie",2023-07-25 04:14:59
gripping movie from start to finish unfortunately mired by nolans  stance on audio mixing that makes some of the dialogue unintelligible,2023-07-21 08:12:55
the first i am become death was so bizarre and random but i thought it was funny,2023-07-21 09:44:43
first act of movie is very nolanesc his nonlinear approach always amazes me in the end of second actoh boy the horror i felt after the trinity test was something ive never felt at cinema before thank  christopher nolan is great storyteller cuz third act gave me the huge satisfaction after the horror i felt it was really moving murphy and rdj killed it benny and jason clark were something man loved emily blunt at the end a nolan magnum opus for sure atleast for me,2023-07-21 16:20:42
taking an edible before seeing this in imax seems the best decision ever had the  best trip ever,2023-07-22 06:13:26
"just saw it a second time i was pretty confused the first goaround and honestly it negatively affected my viewing experience but this time knowing what was going on i thought it was amazing it became my favorite nolan and my favorite movie of the year

the girl next to me was cackling when kitty snubbed teller i could tell it was very cathartic for her lol",2023-07-22 08:11:54
"i absolutely loved it 

i agree with some reviewers saying its nolans best film",2023-07-22 08:33:30
i dont think the soundtrack worked for me the way it has for others i liked ludwigs work on tenet a lot more,2023-07-22 09:03:55
"saw this last night and slept on it before writing my thoughts

pro

 cillian murphy was dr oppenheimer  great great performance  i have been wanting to see cillian murphy in a lead role and this delivered to my expectations which were sky high to begin with  imho murphys cerebral performance fit well with nolans penchant for directing movies with such content

 the dramatic takes balanced between adding sensation and thus excitement to the movie without going off the rails with creative license  i can understand peoples gripes with the sanskrit scene and seemingly unnecessary nudity but imho it played very well in the security clearance screening when his relations with the pugh character became a sore spot  i mean security clearance screenings are supposed to be very boring lol

 i liked how the bomb scenes were handled  it is indeed not supposed to immediately have soundthe shockwave and the concomitant rumbling and debris is when the sound comes into play and the contrast with the silence and the shockwave was very well done

 similarly the gym scene and that it was louder than the bomb scene resonated with the notion that the true impact and scope of the bomb was less than that of wwii and more that it became a far larger phenomenon and changed everything about war itself  

 i thought the moral implications were well handled  yes the people at los alamos cheering the bombs being dropped was historically significant given these scientists had devoted several years of their life to developing a weapon to ending the war and there was indeed a lot of antijapanese sentiment in america during the time  that such hate culminated in the gym scene and oppenheimer having a crisis of conscience as he saw peoples faces peeling off in front of him was well done  there was significant discussion in the movie about exactly how horrific the weapon oppenheimer had helped to develop was in practice versus the theoretical challenges and the thrill of discovery involved in developing such a weapon in the first place

cons

 rdj and the strauss character felt like a second movie attached to oppenheimer  perhaps this was the intent to highlight the ego of one man and how it threatened to alter the discourse about the bomb but imho that plays way too much into the iron man mystique and felt wholly unnecessary  i was rolling my eyes in the final act when they had to tell strauss that the chain of events in the movie wasnt about him  they could have demonstrated the same by simple removing the character entirely from the movie  that there were greater forces at play antagonistic to oppenheimer could have been suggested without introducing strauss at all  this would have cut 3045 minutes off the movie and made it better

 minor gripe but not sure what rami maleks role was in this movie  didnt even know he was a phd until he was introduced in the final hour in the movie in front of the senate hearingi thought he was at best a lab tech and was wondering why they gave him any screen time at all  this probably follows from the fact that his significance was tied to the strauss character which i also felt was wholly unnecessary

 another minor gripe did not understand how teller was interpreted as antagonistic  i get that the blunt character didnt like himi must have missed exactly why



overall i thought this was a great biopic and liked how nolan handled the material  i find it difficult to compare to nolans other movies which were works of imagination and fictional storytelling  imho oppenheimer fits more with dunkirk except that not being british i must confess i didnt even know of its historical significance until i saw the trailer for dunkirk  i was more interested in the subject matter of oppenheimer and thus was more satisfied with the story

edit  grammar",2023-07-22 12:59:18
they didnt include his interview where he says his famous line thats a crime on its own and i dont consider the two other times i needed to hear him announce to the word how badly he thought we all just cockd up,2023-07-23 23:21:25
i loved it,2023-07-24 02:00:45
i got to see it in 35mm and wow this movie was way more immersive than i thought it could be the detonation scene gave me chills because how real it felt i knew it was gonna work but the countdown made me fell like i was there waiting for the world to possibly end,2023-07-24 05:32:47
i was lucky enough to experience it in imax 70mm and it was one of my most immersive theater screenings ever christopher nolan arguably made some of the best films of the 21st century but his last two films were disappointing to me when it came to how he handled the characters oppenheimer puts him back in his prime it’s dialogueheavy but the airtight pace keeps me engaged cillian murphy gave his greatest performance an oscar nom guaranteed the fact that all the actors involved did not phone it in even for those alisters with only one scene shows their dedication but also nolan’s intelligence in choosing the right faces i really loved it,2023-07-24 06:40:36
"i felt the movie was pretty  good considering 99 of it was just dialogue there were a lot of scenes that were kind of confusing due to the nature of telling the story kind of out of order as well as a few scenes where contextually it felt like their explanation was glossed over especially if you were like me and know the history of the project but arent an expert ie when they go under the football stadium or all the talks about the hydrogen bombs before the story has even moved past the original bomb etc the sound mixing was also a bit off in some scenes causing the dialogue to be really muffled but that may have just been the theaters fault

i also found florence pughs character kind of pointless other than to demonstrate that oppenheimers relationship with his wife was kind of rocky i dont think of myself as a  but it just seemed so out of place every time the movie granted only twice just flashed to her  and the jumps that reintroduced her character added to an already frustrating sequencing of events not to mention that in the tail end they suggest that he had also been seeing the blonde woman the whole time too 

also how did rami malek get all of that information for the hearing that we as the audience just found out strauss had kept so covert it suggests that strausss aide alden ehrenreich may have leaked the information to him but doesnt actually confirm it and i dont know why they wouldnt unless its made up for the sake of the movie

it was also fun to keep finding more familiar actors in small roles here or there otherwise it fills the runtime it only started feeling really long towards the end because i had to  like a racehorse at which point i had my own anxietydriven stadium moment like oppenheimer as i sprinted from the theater when the end title came up",2023-07-24 12:25:46
okay so did nolan definitely say there were zero cgi shots used in the movie at all because if thats the case then id really wanna know how they achieved those ones during the end,2023-07-24 15:18:24
"i loved the movie but have a few questions i feel like i missed
 1 what did bring in the sheets mean when openheimer would say it to his wife
2 who was the one that leaked secrets to the soviets was it the one the wife refused to shake hands with

any answers would be greatly appreciated",2023-07-27 11:40:14
it was a good and interesting watch but definitely not as good as threads 1984,2023-07-29 19:46:56
"i loved it i thought it was going to be good but i didn’t expect to love it as much as i did i saw barbie last week and i personally much prefer oppenheimer 

go see it in imax",2023-08-03 02:43:34
when oppenheimer talked to einstein at the pond wasnt that supposed to be when oppenheimer first started teaching there were two scenes one in the beginning and one at the end the first scene oppenheimer started his teaching career at berkley and he talked to einstein at the pond this was before he made the bomb in the second scene we find out that oppenheimer told einstein that he believes the world will be destroyed implying the pond scene was after the creation of the bomb is this just a plothole,2023-08-06 03:30:54
in that last scene what were those white lights flying overhead in the sky while oppenheimer was in the plane  foo fighters ufos ,2023-08-06 04:50:47
that nuclear war scene is chilling with what’s happening in ukraine right now,2023-07-21 22:18:48
"indiana jones would make for a good parallel

imagine one of those movies but instead of the adventure  or whatever exploratory  he does  being the main plot its merely part of the background with the main focus being on indianas anxiety over what the ramifications might be over taking some treasure and whether he really is an archeologist 

also all that wouldve been the first half of the movie the second half of the movie would be about indiana defending his doctorate or research or whatever against the evil board of the university

thats oppenheimer",2023-07-23 13:13:27
"i genuinely think this is possibly the greatest example of storytelling that has ever been told whilst the plot and acting are obviously brilliant  it’s hard to rate those aspects compared to other equally brilliant films or shows 
however the storytelling  only appropriate emoji lol and the overarching metaphors in this film are both subtle and immense from the beginning of the film we are thrown in at the deep end with differing scenes occurring in courtrooms laboratories  in colour and black and white  and the narrative seems somewhat scrambled and confused i found myself worrying we were in for another  from nolan then as the film progressed the ideas and narrative seemed to condense and the pinnacle of this seems to arrive at the point of the creation of the bomb itself the trinity test where we have effectively the longest unbroken scene of the entire film ie minimal jumping around in the timeline etc i believe this initial condensing of the storyline itself to be almost a direct metaphor to the ideas in oppenheimer’s brain  specifically in regards to the bomb itself as more ideas are churned through at los alamos the film continues to find itself narrowing in direction until the precipice is reached with the bombs inception pardon the pun 
then following the nuclear test the film branches into many sects  following the hearing trial aftermath oppenheimer’s mental state and his relationships all at the same time the chaos almost begins to ensue  this chaos bares a remarkable similarity to the chain reaction involving the neutrons referred to multiple times in the film  the world ending version of the nuclear explosion then during the climax of the film it is revealed that oppenheimer himself realised that the bomb was never truly the evil but it was those who were willing to use it who were creating almost this ironic plot twist that whilst there was an “almost zero” chance the bomb would lead to the end of the world due to the physical aspects of it there was nearly an “almost certain” chance the world would be brought to its knees as a result of the political and power grabbing plays that are a part of human nature  in effect replacing the neutrons responsible for the chain reaction with people

the idea a director big chris was able to convey these levels of detail through an overarching narrative is absolutely bonkers i’ve seen films where directors may have managed it for a scene or two to convey basic feelings of fear or amusement etc  but never have i seen it portrayed on as grand a scale as oppenheimer 


i know that some people will talk about how emily and florence as characters should have been explored more but i disagree primarily for the reason that the coloured scenes were supposed to be first person from oppenheimer’s perspective he was described as a womaniser and insubordinate and therefore i believe the representation of those women on screen was probably in line with how oppenheimer saw them himself


i think this is probably one of the single best films i have ever seen in my life and would urge anyone to go and watch it",2023-07-25 03:15:52
kinda surprised by the fact that i like indiana jones 5 better than this one i love many of nolans movie but somehow he managed to make a movie about the atomic bombs too long confusing pshycick  and imo boring and this is comming from someone who usually prefers the longer cuts of movies and like dialogue oppenheimer just didnt work for me,2023-08-08 18:59:00

"i really dont understand the tension build up and revelation of casey afflecks part  casey the actor is not a star the person he portrayed wasnt einstein or jfk  quite puzzling

i like matt damon but i thought he overactedforcedunnatural in his portrayal of the general officer  also matt using the word wicked i kept wondering if that was meant to be a jokereference to good will hunting and his bostonian roots  just seemed out of place",2023-07-22 00:00:58
honestly didn’t really like it not a christopher nolan movie tbh,2023-07-23 22:47:41
oppenheimer would rather daydream about  with florence pugh then sit in a stuffy boring board room discussing the ethical nature of building a weapon of mass destruction to nuke an entire population,2023-07-26 01:45:12
"lol people here complaining that the movie was too lengthy as an indian were used to that shizz ya knowlonger movies 
however in this case the 3hour duration of the movie is entirely justified there is not a single moment where you feel bored or experience any lags its definitely worth every penny spent",2023-07-21 21:49:08
okay am i reading into things too much or is nolan implying that strauss had something to do with jfks assassination  or did he actually and i missed that in history,2023-07-22 04:10:00

"even in oppenheimer nolan needs to use over the top score and sounds to make dramadialogue more engaging which should otherwise come off naturally as a product of well written script

performances were solid murphy and robert downey jr were particularly great but their characters werent really compelling at all to me

flow of the narrative was terrible but some people like that nonlinear approach

sound design was great  i could almost feel shock wave hitting my chest

overall pretty good biopic but massively overhyped",2023-07-22 18:23:51

"i enjoyed the movie but it was quite boring in a good way sorta

however i absolutely despised the sound mixing i couldnt hear a  thing the characters were saying with so much music playing in nearly every scene i havent seen tenet but ive seen people complain about not being able to hear the dialogue properly in that film as well

just the overall fast cuts during dialogue coupled with the obnoxiously loud music soured myself on the film",2023-07-22 05:23:33

while it was kind of funny seeing so many well known actors in this movie i feel they just distracted me from the seriousness of it none of the roles played by these actors truly needed them if that makes sense felt the casting was a bit lazy on nolan’s part",2023-07-27 10:19:42
"it feels like we got 13 of two really good movies smashed together and called a whole could have taken most of the manhattan project out and had a movie about the postwar witch hunt or taken the witch hunt out and just had the project both of those movies could have ended at the same lake scene

edit to be fair i was glued to the screen for the 3 hours and likely would be for the 9 hour supercut of what we could have gotten with the potential material i didnt read the book though so maybe the book glosses over alot of what is missing from the historical timeline",2023-07-27 12:51:30

so many great cameos

tad disappointed not to get a bit more from the visualsound effects

couldve cut the movie by 1520 min 

saw it in 70mm not sure if this was a specific amc issue but there was flickering in the bright scenes which was distracting

didnt really get the hype for regular 70mm id have preferred to watch it in the dolby theater if i had to redo it",2023-07-22 19:52:59

did anyone catch the gi joe crossover post credits stinger,2023-07-25 00:43:26
my buddy and i just sat in silence for 5 mins when it ended what a  gut punch ending magnificent filmmaking from nolan who i think has just peaked,2023-07-25 10:21:10
the editing here is the best weve seen in a nolan movie for a while if nolan went full nolan with tenet then i felt like he dialed it back a bit the exposition and plot points were handled far better this time around,2023-07-26 03:55:09
is anyone kind of confused about this movie selling out theaters after two weeks its a great movie but i wouldnt have expected it to this kind of mass appeal,2023-08-07 01:32:29
watched on 70mm imax screen absolutely incredible i feel like the film was split into 3 acts and it delivered on all of them the last hour was great in stitching together the different story threads and also the weight of creating the potential destruction of humanity cillian murphy nailed on for the oscar,2023-07-23 19:06:41
"the movie had a profound impact on me i loved it from the beginning it started so tense and never let up 

all that to say  as a geek who loves ufo lore i absolutely loved all of the los alamos stuff and there were four or five different times where i thought “come on man give us a ufo in the background never addressed”

thank  he’s too good for any of that schlack but it gave me a good chuckle a couple of times when i really needed one 

loved every minute",2023-07-24 00:17:10
"i thought it was a great drama definitely not an action packed movie youd expect to get from nolan ive read american prometheus so i understood his growing up professor years assembling the project dilemma of dropping or not and then the political aftermath but still it can be hard to follow in the beginning i thought everyone did a great job murphy was excellent 

my only dislikes it was hyped up way too much for imax movie maybe for the sound but for the visuals was not that impressed could have easily seen this in a regular digital showing do i even want to try for a 70mm imax showing to compare

also why the unnecessary nudity could easily have had  scenes without straight nudity if that was the reason for the r rating kind of pitiful i dont even remember that much language in the film",2023-07-24 20:17:50
this movie broke me such an experience 1010,2023-07-22 05:06:38
"i am not a huge nolan fan  a lot of the famously nolanlike traits of a movie i actively dislike but this movie was really good  it didnt feel like a nolan movie at all  sure there was nonlinear storytelling but it was done in a fairly conventional biopic kind of way  no weird literary device pushing the jumps through time  and i could hear all the dialogue

i was also going to say that there werent a lot of exposition dumps but maybe it just felt like there wasnt because the plot was so simple and mostly 100 talking  so basically the whole movie was an exposition dump and there was no convoluted incomprehensible plot to explain to the audience  i appreciated that

the only point that i didnt really like was the use of rami maleks character  he comes out at the end as this surprise witness and it seems like there should have been a reason for that or some connection maybe to strausss aide or something  it seemed weird and convenient that this guy showed up to save the day for no reason

overall though it was very enjoyable  nothing special  i dont think its going to be a cornerstone of cinema like the dark knight or inception are but nolan is clearly very talented and i think his talent works great on a straightforward historical movie like this  matt damon and cillian murphy definitely carried more than their weight in this though",2023-07-23 01:50:03
"gary oldman was just unnecessary  small part  big star  prosthetics took me out of the movie for that scene felt the same about casey affleck but for the different reasons youd be shocked to see him in a big film like this if the last thing you remember about him was the me too movement matt damon worked hard but he seemed a little out of his depth with the performances turned in by the rest of the cast not a mark on him being the worst player on an all star team is still its own accomplishment

these are the tiniest of nits i had to pick about the film otherwise it was 3 hours well spent and thoroughly enjoyed",2023-07-24 19:14:55
"the whole film i kept thinking that this was a subpar score from hans zimmer then during the credits i saw that the score was actually by ludwig göransson instead presumably because zimmer is scoring dune part 2 instead

a topnotch zimmer score alone would have added a solid 1 or 2 points out of 10 to my rating",2023-07-25 20:23:33

"upon further reflection i think this movie would have been better if it were broken up it seems that nolan wanted to tell the story of oppies life and trial which is perfectly fine so i think this movie would have been far better off as an arthouse a24 type of flick that could focus on his trial and life with flashbacks to the project rather than trying to fit it into being a blockbuster type of film


or nolan should have made a movie about life on los alamos making the bomb the scientists involved and the urgency and desperation they had to finish this thing the could be a little bit more actiony in a sense",2023-07-25 07:11:02
watched it today to me a 7 oscars winner movie  seemed way too boring and didnt even enjoy a bit overhyped and overrated movie,2024-03-23 07:39:28
"its 9510 from me there is still so much to process the only part that was underwhelming was the trinity test but tbh i knew the movie wasnt going to be all about it as the trailers advertised 
apart from technical aspects i loved all the artistic choices nolan made especially not showing direct things like bombings but oppenheimers experience right after it 

the best scene was the gymnasium scene by far although im not from america i did read about his life to some degree so i wasnt completely in the dark but general audiences would definitely be bored because of not understanding his story after the bomb had to be shown though its a biopic not a movie about the manhattan project",2023-07-21 12:06:49

historical biographies typically arent too exciting  i hope that movies like this enlighten my understanding of the subject and provide details that arent in every history book to that extent i think the movie was underwhelming i didnt learn much i would have been more interested in some of this other work more pre manhattan project stuff and less of the stuff afterwards  the message that the effort will probably lead to the end of the world some day wasnt all that new or interesting,2024-02-17 21:48:48

havent seen the movie yet but i took a class on the cold war last year and we went super in depth on oppenheimers life and details of the manhattan project can a history nerd let me know how accurateinaccurate it is i understand its a movie and creative liberties will be taken but i’d like to know going in so i have the proper expectations because otherwise it’ll annoy me lol,2023-07-22 20:29:09
i’m still hesitant to call it movie of the year but it’ll definitely be in my top 3 i think nolan did a great job on how to address the issues presented by nuclear weapons in a way that doesn’t come off as pandering or preachy really challenged my views on oppenheimer as a man,2023-07-22 21:18:27

"movie critique aside i wish imax had previews

is it convention at other imax theaters for the film to start exactly on time i recall them not having previews in the past here

they also didn’t do the big imax intro thing which they used to

saw it at metreon in san francisco the auditorium had a steady flow of traffic and cell phone flash lights 30 minutes into the movie

i’m easily distracted and get to movies 30m ahead of time to settle in immersion was blown for a while

just an interesting observation for what a small change like that can cause for such a cinematic experience",2023-07-28 14:06:48
hi i saw oppenheimer the the other day they made several references to a prior historical event that i was unfamiliar with throughout the film it seemed like knowledge about the event would add a lot of context to the scenes unfortunately i forgot what the event was and it’s literally impossible to look up because of seo can anyone remember what it was so i can do a little bit of research before i see it again thank you if this is too vague i think it must have been something ussrrelated since that’s definitely my weak spot in ww2 history,2023-07-29 23:53:15
i think its his best film outside of interstellar and matt damon similarly stands out like a sore thumb,2023-07-31 14:54:47
"oppenheimer
ill start with the bad and then what i like about it
bad oppenheimer is not a good movie it felt like i was watching a 3 hour movie trailer it didnt feel like… a movie the entire movie was hans zimmer brilliant score btw playing awkwardly over people talking there are no “scenes” in this movie every “scene” is just 20 seconds of people talking so unnaturally and then skipping to the next scene of people talking like this no scene has its time to flesh out or be at all intriguing the movie does a poor job and showing what is happening and when for example the part at the beginning with the apple the first conflict in the movie lasts literally 2 minutes and it ends awkwardly not intentionally awkward like it was trying to show an awkward moment but because the whole dialogue is messy and just put together over the random score not compelling this movie is just constantly boring there were so many “important” characters and big actors in this movie but i bet most people couldnt leave the theater and name anyone other than oppenheimer and einstein maybe strause maybe kitty cuz they say them both soooooo much i dont care about any of the characters not at all there was the scene where oppenheimer has a breakdown next to a tree after florence pugh’s character dies dk her name his wife confronts him and it looks like its going to be a very evoking scene so much that can be taken from this so much that can be done with both cillian and emily’s characters theres emotions of guilt remourse anger shown through the suicide of this character and betrayal that oppenheimer made and yet it just gets skipped like many scenes in this movie and guess what i doesnt make me care at all thats my biggest problems there are other things too like the  dialogue

good its christopher nolan so it looks great the visuals i loved so unique i know that he did a lot of these no cgi and some of them aspecially the ones at the beginning id like to know which are and are not cgi its not until the grouo starts experimenting with the bombs that i start enjoying this film becuase its the first time in the movie that it feels like a movie and not a legit movie trailer the entire scene where they detonate the bomb is great it builds it takes its time and it puts the audience in the scene unlike the rest of the movie the scene with oppenheimer speaking to the room of happy people as he sees them all explode is also another one of these scenes i loved and i loved this part of the movie just spectacular i was almost brought to tears with how well this scene moved me but it doesnt stay well for much after also its worth mentioning i respect that the movie is trying to give justice to what really happened but then again left out a lot of important details 


wrote all this dont feel like finishing lmk how u feel",2023-08-02 02:02:32
"i think this is the first movie i saw in the cinemas after the pandemic absolutely worth the ticket price if i knew i would have spent extra i wasnt even planning on watching this because i have a barbie date with my family but after oppenheimer im no longer interested everything was just so finessed that this would ruin other movies after it

this is such an actor showcase type of film cillian as oppenheimer was so seductive in this sexually and intellectually an angle that was kind of unexpected rdj as strauss felt like a quiet cameo that crescendos to something fantastic so many performances in this  familiar faces that made me go like this rami malek tony goldwyn jack quaid james remar james darcy josh peck  even the music being done by ludwig gorranson who scored the nbc show community",2023-07-21 12:07:57

i am totally cool with 3 and 3 12 hour movies but i sure wish directors would bring back the intermission  i had to  finally went but was so scared about missing something",2023-07-21 04:53:39
i saw a few reviews saying this had no emotion in it i have to admit complete opposite to me when the bomb was about to go off and oppenheimer was looking over it my stomach churned the end with his talk with einstein just pain and emotional flew over me how can you not have some sort of emotional feeling over this whew what a film,2023-07-21 05:09:51

"seems the screenwriting is a big point of criticism with nolan even though the critics really seem to like this one  i agree he should probably have a cowriter at least  

that and the intercutting time jumps  a linear project may be more boring at first glance but there are other ways of making the story interesting  just seems onenote in creativity  although its cool that its kind of like a trademark",2023-07-21 20:19:25

i didnt see it was it a joke",2023-07-22 04:56:17

without spoiling can someone tell me if the bombing of hiroshima and nagaski is handled in a tasteful manner i want to see the film but am heistant bc of how awful and how many innocnet lives were killed is the film glossing over it or acting as if the guy is some sort of hero,2023-07-21 09:07:20

410",2023-07-26 03:58:57
"what do the raindrops stand for
in the first scene of the movie we see him intently watching raindrops hit a puddle so with the film opening like this you would think it has a greater importance
later in the movie atleast to me it seems clear that the drops and the ripples are a metaphor for bombs covering the earth
but when oppenheimer looked at them at the start this metaphor doesnt work because he didnt know of the bomb  infact didnt believe it was possible to make one 
we know he was scared of the potential of the atom but that was shown in a different way

so what does it stand for 
if its just forshadowing i think its a bit cheap and nonsensical",2023-07-29 09:34:12

me and my gf fell asleep for 2 mins in the first half maybe i didnt have my evening coffee the show was at 630 pm good movie overall but not best of nolan for sure imo great message but story takes a sharp turn here and there,2023-07-21 23:44:52
"i’ll start off with what i like
as always nolan has amazing cinematography especially for showing the force of the bomb
murphy gave a great performance and rdj struggled at first to lose some of the tony stark mannerisms but the scene where it revealed that it was him who  over oppenheimer reminded me that he can act
my frustration comes from nolan still going with the “troubled genius” trope he favors over what could have been an excellent thriller i read day of trinity and i enjoyed it more than the movie in terms of story
did not appreciate the casey affleck casting either",2023-07-22 07:05:49
just finished watching the movie its another great masterpiece by christopher nolan however as others have noted its a little too conversationally heavy which made it hard to pay attention especially through the thick accents not the fault of the movie as its trying to be as realistic as possible but its enough to warrant a 910 instead of the 1010 it feels like it really deserves,2023-07-22 18:51:22
perhaps it was due to rdjs charisma but i dont really get why we are supposed to hate strauss he respected ro at the start and ros insulting of strauss during the hearing was uncalled for also developing the hbomb in hindsight was the correct thing to do,2023-07-23 05:51:43
i really enjoyed this movie best movie ive seen in the theater in years i was a little tepid on nolan after hating tenet so much but nolan proves he is still a brilliant filmmaker,2023-07-24 01:36:58
just watched it easily my favorite movie of the last 10 years,2023-07-24 01:59:11
to be honest with you they missed the big main point of why oppenheimer is so relevant yeah big boooms missing for me imo not hating enjoyed the movie,2023-07-26 22:30:40
i like how scientists are making complex predictions and getting all stuck in the science of x and y yet in the movie they cant seem to figure out that smoking every 03 seconds is probably not that great for your lungs,2023-07-31 03:41:09
the movie was great i think it’s movie of the year imo but some gripes i had was the beginning was very fast paced it moved scene to scene with little to no context on who is who and why they’re important i also think the  scenes were not needed at all in the film but terrific acting performances music and cinematography 910,2023-08-23 05:00:06
i was surprised when i paused to  and saw i was an hour in and still had 2 of them to go they tried to put too much in 1 movie  did i mention it is 3 hours if 3 hours is not enough to cover what you want to cover and do it well make it a series every scene felt like it was 3 lines of dialogue and each line of dialogue felt like it was meant to blow your mind except it didnt this made it feel pretentious not the physics or the politics but the dialogue and cinematography are what made it feel almost insufferably pretentious shame to have taken such an important piece of global history and have presented it so poorly,2024-04-05 21:37:10

was the implication that the fbi killed jfk in part because of straus’ anger at oppenheimer something that i made up or something directly from the movie,2023-07-24 07:11:45
how do you spoil a movie based on true events,2023-07-27 09:04:54
was the sound off for anyone when the characters would screamraise their voice it was very loud and high pitched to the point where you couldn’t understand what was being said i was really bothered by that because there were numerous times characters were shouting something and i had no idea what they said,2023-07-31 05:50:03
"i missed like10 of the dialogue i though strauss was being played by jeff goldblum literally until they rolled the credits and i completely lost track of names after the first 15 minutes 1010 totally worth paying for imax will go see again with my boyfriend 

side note i would commit war crimes to have benny safdies eyelashes",2023-07-21 09:10:07
"not gifted enough to write a good critique but while i thought it was decent still felt too long despite what seemed like a very fast pace the whole way through also i know its his thing but the blasting score or sound effects sometimes during dialogue became too much for me works better on say interstellarinception not so much a courtroom or study hall but thats just meat least dialogue was largely audible this time i dont remember his earlier movies doing this memento and insomnia the bomb scene coulda used some cgi enhancement the real footage is incredible

only listed negative but at the same time everything technical was top notch as you would expect from nolan interesting historical plot and story told well great acting star studded

probably one of those movies that i wont watch again but 7 or 810",2023-07-22 14:33:08
this movie had the same issue as dead reckoning there’s about 2030 min that couldve been cut or atleast trimmed down,2023-07-22 19:50:08
"just got back from 70mm imax and i’m floored  fantastic film beginning to end and nolan’s and van hoytema use of the large format is both masterful and breathtaking  the clarity and depth allow for incredible immersion  i don’t know that the movie has quite the same level of impact in a smaller format and i’d encourage anyone who can to see it this way  that being said if you only do imax for big special effects movies and don’t care about stunning vistas clarity of the minutest of details in frame or depth you might be disappointed  nolan and van hoytema use the 70mm format the way it was originally used in semiwide distribution and they do it in a way that few can master   

perhaps shockingly after his last two movies the sound engineering was incredibly well done and i’ll be shocked if anything comes along that steal the oscars for mixing editing and design  the cast did an excellent job which one would expect with a cast of this caliber and with nolan at the helm  

my only criticism after an initial view and these are quibbles 

1 too often logistical problems encountered on the manhattan project were resolved instantly by a guy sitting in the room  it was necessary because the actual work would have been tremendously dull and because the movie already had a 3 hour run time but it happened enough that it took me out of the movie for a second  better to have one or two of those problems and the fact that they had been solved mentioned in conversations where a subordinate is reporting on progress to oppenheimer

2 blunt was used a little poorly in a few places specifically when she would berate oppenheimer for not sticking up for himself and letting people walk all over him and when she’s  about straus  her delivery in those instances were a little too melodramatic compared to everything else in the film  i don’t think nolan intended to make me laugh at how preposterous she seemed but that’s what happened",2023-07-30 03:16:18
if i have oppenheimer at 345pm and barbie scheduled for 7pm will i be able to pull off barbenheimer i scheduled movie tickets for amc to watch oppenheimer with my friends at 345 pm and barbie at 7 i would’ve pushed back the time for barbie but there were no other movie times oppenheimer is exactly 180 minutes long but actually it’s around 175 minutes without credits i predict there to be about 1520 minutes worth of trailers at the beginning which makes its end time around 7 with there to be an expected 20 minutes of trailers before barbie this gives us some leeway do you think we can pull it off,2023-08-04 05:45:51
greatest movie ive seen in a long long while and best i think i will have seen for a while to come,2023-07-22 11:46:36

"i literally want to tell every person i meet to go see this movie in imax best movie going experience i’ve had in my life

every actor i enjoy was in it even david dalmachian a favorite of dv josh hartnett is the most handsome man i’ve ever seen in my life florence pugh is physically perfect and intense oh and matt damon is literally hilarious like laugh out loud every time he bursts onto the screen 

the final scene is worth every minute the 3rd act is dragged through with the confrontation with rdj oh and when the bomb does go off it’s worth every penny you pay in imax was i on shrooms and an edible yes and i recommend you are too my dad who is 70 and a former history teacher enjoyed it immensely bring your dad not your gf trust me",2023-07-21 16:27:57

cinematically epic i guess it can come of as a little pretentious as it does have a lot of great minds in each of their fields for example sound editing cinematography acting and direction these guys are like masterminds to me though it stood as a great biopic the nonlinear timeline is difficult to understand but its nothing a second watch cant solve its impressive i think i would put it in nolans top 5 not his best work in terms of entertainment but its a biopic of a theoretical physicist you cant expect entertainment like the wolf of wall street,2024-04-05 00:24:19

how was the sound mixing in this movie i want to see it but i refuse to see this in theatres if ill find myself struggling to hear the dialogue,2023-07-22 07:38:00
"as a canadian i didnt learn much about the aec and what happened with nuclear energy after wwii  it was the manhattan project then dropping the bombs on japan then the cold war and mutually assured destruction with russia those scenes fell short for me just because we had such high stakes with the atomic bombs and thenof course old white men bickering about their political positions and deciding the fate of nations in back room meetings 

i came out of the movie wanting more kitty to see more of how she felt being in the position she was in the 40s and 50s as a woman she obviously felt powerless and had to choose the role of housewife or scientist the movie showed us she was very intelligent and it was frustrating to have her relegated to washing sheets 

enjoyed the los alamos scenes the most and was invested in the manhattan project stuff not so much oppenheimer himself

from the technical side i feel like nolan heard the criticisms of the sound mixing in tenet and went fine you want to hear it  have it dialed up to 11 my poor ears",2023-07-25 14:09:41
the trailers make it seem like a normal structured movie and ruin expectations almost every scene of the movie is in the trailers,2023-07-27 06:43:30

"this is an amazing movie a technical marvel  but i think nolan went too deep into the facts of history stories like this often need simplification because its hard to keep track of 11 different physicists who were mostly interchangeable i would have shortenedquickened the first half set uphistory and lengthened the second half ethical ramifications still great and impressive film

florence pugh being a blip in this film was such a surprise to me some fun facts like the jfk shoutout were giving hamilton

saw this at 1130pm after barbie and i wouldnt change it for the world best movie day ever",2023-07-21 07:33:21

im going to see it when i can get childcare but just wondering does the bomb go off in the middle or the end of the movie im hoping its not the end because im intrigued to see how aftermath of the strike is portrayed both politically and morally as i know very little of this part of history and the way it is dealt with morally is what intrigues me the most about this movie,2023-07-21 15:17:01
how is this movie for sudden loud noises it doesn’t seem like that kind of movie but as someone who startles easily and is going to see this in rpx has a speaker in the seat i just wanna know what i’m getting into ,2023-07-21 15:26:16
while im disappointed we didnt get to see the nukes dropped on japan it makes sense within the context of the film so i cant be mad it was a good movie but at the same time i wish it was told in a linear manner rather than cuts to various points in time which imo would have made it flow better stories that are told through various perspectives in time are only really satisficing if the conclusion to the story is otherwise it just makes a narrative feel jumbled,2023-07-22 00:30:41
why did the scientists scuff at edward tellers proposal of making a hydrogen bomb instead,2023-07-22 04:47:22
anyone else waited for a scene where they drop the bombs ,2023-07-22 05:53:36

"i’d like to open the discussion to his obviously sentimental consideration of vishnu’s “now i am become death the destroyer of worlds”

to start this discussion you need to consider 2 things

1 age of sanskrit and considerationspossible bias of the teacher that taught him sanskrit considering he was brought up under judaism and vishnu was a  of hinduism we can all assume translation of one language to another by an organized religion may introduce bias 

2 it has been said that “death” also translates from sanskrit as “world destroying time” so this fundamentally changes the true foundation of dr oppenheimer’s moral dilemma no matter how he took it to heart “i am become death” vs “i am become world destroying time” one insinuates he is prometheus giving man fire the other insinuates that timethe gods would destroy world regardless as somehow they’d get fire i think this has strong parallels to his opinion on the h bomb invented by us vs russia the inevitable is inevitable",2023-07-23 05:27:45
i loved the last hour it wasnt about the trinity test it was about oppenheimer and his legacy one that was largely defined not by the test itself but by the events that followed it,2023-07-23 14:27:29

 with the top comments in this thread how is copying and pasting dialogue bits a discussion,2023-07-24 17:44:36
"i went to see a barbenheimer screening with oppenheimer being showed first and i felt that made sense the only complaint i have about it is that it didnt give you much time to sit in it you just rushed to the toilet and then for the shop to refill for the next movie i have teenaged boys so i felt like this was a great opportunity for us to go to the movies together especially because i never would have made them see a movie named barbie otherwise 



all in all i loved the movie i didnt see any trailers or anything beforehand i only knew cicilian murphy and florence pugh were in it was pleasantly surprised by all the great actors especially robert downey jr his performance was phenomenal as was murphys however i heard some buzz about pughs performance but i felt her character lacked substance which is probably for the lack of writing 



i especially liked that this wasnt a one dimensional portrayal of oppenheimer but showed his complexity brilliance and flaws i thought the sound was maybe the theatres problem but after reading some reviews i agree that it was flawed i was very thankful for the subtitles especially in the first act because otherwise i wouldnt have cought the dialogue 



in my opinion the pacing was good and i was totally invested in the trial both of oppenheimer and strauss i didnt know much about the history other than ive listened to some podcast discussions about the ethical questions for making the bomb and oppenheimers change of heart i thought the movie did a good job portraying that emily blunts performance was also excellent and i loved the scene where she takes the stand that being almost exactly as his actual wife said if the comments i read are to be believed just adds to the joy of having watched that scene 



my boys were overall happy that we went but their qualms about the movie were too long and complicated and not enough bomb which i find ironic that is the biggest complaint from those who didnt like it my younger one actually preferred the barbie movie but i think it was mostly because john cena was in it we didnt know 



i will probably do some historical digging and then watch it again someday for what its worth these two movies got me in theatre which i havent been to since i saw once upon a time in hollywood",2023-07-25 10:48:03

"i am utterly speechless oppenheimer is arguably christopher nolan’s greatest achievement from a pure filmmaking perspective and the film of the year by far for me really an amazing piece of filmmaking you need to see this in dolby atmos to really get the true weight of the sound design film of the year for me 

full review",2023-07-21 04:27:48
"oppenheimer is among the top three nolan films for me and i think it displaces the dark knight from the top three

i was fascinated by the meditative nature of the film and the character study of oppenheimer this is definitely different to a lot of nolan’s most recent films in that it’s more characterdriven than his others

cillian murphy was spectacular in his restrained and engaging performance as the titular physicist and it was really exciting to see him step up to a lead role in a nolan film and a film in general after being a fan of his supporting roles for many years the rest of the cast is rounded out well particularly robert downey jnr florence pugh matt damon emily blunt and even gary oldman in his small role as president truman

the scene depicting the first test at los alamos was brilliantly done with the suspense building up to it and with the accurate depiction of light versus sound speed and i loved as well seeing the army trucks carrying the crates which we all know were carrying  boy and little boy which while would end wwii would drastically bring the world into the cold war and the nuclear age

for me this is among one of nolan’s best films and one of the year’s best films

is it not a little insensitive to have them reading hindu scripture during  in general i thought that scene was the worst of an otherwise great film,2023-07-21 05:40:04
can someone explain what was going on when ernest lawrence josh hartnett showed up for the board hearing oppenheimers lawyer looked at him and he went away oppenheimer had his head in his hands and asked who was there i think i missed the significance because i have no idea what its pointing to,2023-07-22 00:34:28

"less of a discussion post and more of a question do the scenes when the accept ratio changes from 2201 to 1431 mean anything

earlier today i saw a tweet explaining that nolan used the black and white scenes in oppenheimer were nonfictional and the scenes in color were subjective so could the change in ratio mean anything as well  

i noticed that these changes happened a few times throughout the movie so if anyone has any answersideas as to why let me know im super curious",2023-07-22 05:24:43

overall solid acting though murphy was very one note which is too bad nolan still needs to get some help writing dialogue  some was good but some was trite and expository it’s technically a good movie that didn’t leave me feeling moved,2023-07-23 12:12:56

"i cant even comprehend how someone couldnt love or at least like this movie

“bomb bad……but…”

i just left the theater and it’s the first time ever that i’ve seen an audience left audibly speechless no applause or cheers or discussion just the sound of people leaving the room one of the best movies i’ve ever seen it left me in awe and despite knowing that atom bombs are dangerous beforehand this movie really put into perspective of what humanity has truly created a divine weapon that’ll eventually  us all,2023-07-22 19:06:22
dont read the comments about the movie youll just get frustrated by all the people who say the movie was boring if you have at least surface knowledge about project manhattan oppenheimer and state of the world during that time this movie is absolutely outstanding shame that itll most likely go over peoples heads cuz muh action and unexpected plot twists its absolutely worthy of being called a masterpiece,2023-07-23 06:50:18
this was a snoozefest,2023-07-29 19:43:33
"what a longwinded self important blabla fest this movie was great for the first hour with great acting and an accurate depiction on what it feels like to be working in science but then when the absolutely anticlimactic poof happens blink it or youll miss it it rapidly goes downhill 

the movie is almost an hour too long and should have focussed on the lead up to trinity and maybe beyond all the stuff about strauss and oppenheimers security clearance was  irrelevant

nolan needs supervision the movie felt like a very bad directors cut and could have profitted from rigorous cutting",2023-08-05 05:55:12

"oppenheimer isnt that bad as people make it out to be  christopher nolan made this movie about oppenheimer not the manhattan project some may think the trailer is misleading because they though it was only a bomb based movie but also the same about barbie it was not what i expected but thats fine  
  
and i dont ever think that one would make an all talk no action film this interesting to me and people fail to understand if you make a movie about the atomic bomb its going to be a rant about all the physics that some would never understand or learned so this is the right way in my honest opinion im not gonna listen to the radiation physics and chemistry like im in school again but if there is a movie about manhattan ill be interest to see how they will not make it boring as the school lecture so nolan pulled out some drama and tension to make the 3 hours play time doesnt feel like 3 hours  
  
so ill conclude that people who doesnt like this film doesnt like fast pace the music score on the conversation the cut not about the physics on the bomb and how they create the bomb drama people who just dont know who oppenheimer is  people who dont know physics and people who like action movies  
  
but still give it a try maybe you like it maybe you dont like it theres not many movie coming out this year might as well embrace it and tell me your opinions later  
  
as for me i love it 3 maybe because i use to be a stem student although im now in languages department but i can understand how some people doesnt like it i suggest go watch mission impossible or barbie but dont bring your kid to barbie seriously",2023-07-24 19:16:23
"great movie really enjoyed myself

i think the pre bomb of the movie was definitely stronger than the more sit down serious stuff

also i was a bit underwhelmed with robert downey juniors performance tbh",2023-08-05 21:23:35
let me start right away with the ratingperfect 10 i honestly cant find any fault the movie will win best picture best actor and actress that hearing scene from her was spectacular guaranteed it will have a nomination in every major category with the director being next likely to win you could practically nominate 3 or more guys in the supporting role jr may very well take it and though short his crazy first love could be nominated for supporting actress i gotta say talk about a new dream activated that  scene  though totally unnecessary  was hot as  i will be stopping by the bookstore to get a book on sanskrit  display prominently the music was outstanding the sets the costumes  the cinematography the effects were spot on i cant find a single acting flaw if there was a movie to point to say the academy needs an ensemble award this is it this movie is the best movie i have scene in a very long time,2023-07-21 19:02:19
its not good its an hour and a half too long there isnt even a scene of the actual bombing theres way too many characters too much overacting this is important from matt damon and other characters theres too much sympathizing with oppy the final 40 minutes save it from being an outright mediocre movie but i cant give it more than a 510 because of how painfully boring those first two hours were they focused too much on the melodrama of his personal life instead of the bomb and the aftereffects,2023-07-22 20:03:47
i was very disappointed by this movie not a fan slow uniformative pacing was all over the place 310,2023-07-25 17:29:27
"i thought it was a bit mid

i didnt care that iron man was betraying oppenheimer

their relationship during the primary timeline of building the bomb was not very important

i still enjoyed the backroom trial scenes but the whole will iron man win drama at the end had me checking my watch the whole time i dont care that the guy who offered him a job years afte the good stuff turned out to bewhat a political climber and the stakes are like nothing ok whatever

the backroom examination would have been engaging on its own emotionally but if context and some sort of bad guy needed to be given then ok

i get that the movie is literally called oppenheimer so if technically the movie is about oppenheimers whole life and what was important in it the trial probably should be there

but functionally speaking for the audience the movie is about the making of the bomb and the moral stress along that journey if the movie ended with his speech where hes hyping everyone up while feeling bad inside it would be 95 of the benefit of the movie ",2023-07-29 07:01:47

"i am so baffled by how much praise this films gets oppenheimer is literally unwatchable in my opinion i dont even know where to begin it felt like a three hour long movie trailer directed by an aderall  its one big indecipherable projectile  of 5 second jump cuts a revolving door with no character development a constant barrage of largely inaudible poor dialogs 

and no lessons were learnt after the sound flop with tennet 

so monotonous so confusing so anticlimatic so boring so much wasted potential this isnt a good film by any stretch of the imagination",2023-07-26 23:38:53

clearly the fedoras are on too tight today to get the point there is a difference between not enjoying a movie and people burning it to the ground as the worst film experience they have ever had

"the switching aspect ratios and film stock simply did not work i dont know why he didnt stick to full imax 70mm the whole time  idk if it was to indicate timelines  but it was so distracting in a film that cut back and forth so much 

or did he just not have the budget to do it all on full frame stock 

as much as i dont care for nolan i was kinda hopping this would be good but in a lot of ways it worse than i could have imagined  in that it biopicd harder than any biopic since the mid 00s

that entire third act focusing on iron man was so weird like i get where we land but it was mnt worth the pointless journey 
 
the film also focusing on the tragedy and destruction of those weapons from the pov of the white man who invented them was a choice 

the movie never touches the moral quandry of its bad when  does it but ok when you do it  that there was no oppenhitler comparison was weird were they so different 

this was nolans best female characters since insomnia and they were still  

like all nolan movies  moments of brilliance abound in between tedium",2023-08-05 09:18:09

i havent felt this disappointed by hype since joker thanks nolan,2023-07-23 20:32:10
"was kinda disappointed after seeing oppenheimer this weekend lots and lots of dialogue and barely any bomb or action i feel kinda misled by the marketing for the movie because i thought it would be more of a drama and instead it was more like lincoln biopic just hours of dialogue with nothing really going on on screen the bomb was cool but it looked kinda fake and was only like a few minutes of the movie 

and they didn’t show the actual bombings total bait and switch imo


i could tell everyone in the theater after was pretty drained as well as most people high tailed it out of there right at the first sign of the credits lady next to me fell asleep with like 40 min left

imax version was such a let down waste of money watched law and order on imax,2023-07-30 23:49:42
"at the end of this movie i don’t have a sense of who christopher nolan thinks oppenheimer is and as a viewer i found that extremely frustrating 

the perfect example to me of this is when strauss makes the point that oppenheimer doesn’t have remorse for the damage he is responsible for causing to the japanese i think we the audience are supposed to disagree with his assertion yet when oppy sees visions of the radiation damage it’s not of the japanese people but only of the largely white people that are around him which to me comes off as proving strauss’ point 

i think if nolan’s view is that oppenheimer is a complicated individual that’s all well and good but with how poor i found the writing and underdeveloped i found most of the performances i think this movie services less of a  purpose than what a documentary would provide",2023-08-08 20:35:48

ive said this before but the whole movie felt like tenet and inception very unfitting for the style they chose,2023-07-21 21:39:32
quite clearly a much better movie than barbie despite the latter being decent cant believe people actually thought it was a competition in the first place,2023-07-22 06:51:56
3 hours the first and third hour are some of the worst in nolans career but the second hour might be his best he once again showed that he can still make visually stunning movies but still cannot write characters to save his life both this and barbie are 75s for me but oppenheimer is marginally better,2023-07-22 22:43:45
the actual bomb scene was super underwhelming i thought the trinity test had failed so i was confused when they started celebrating  the build up to it was great though i looked up footage of the actual trinity test and its insane i recommend anyone who is interested check that out to see what it really looked like i think the movie overall could have been trimmed a bit pacing was odd,2023-07-22 23:08:42

"thematically oppenheimer is a rousing success by the end of the film i was literally begging for russia to drop an hbomb on the theater i had been chained to for the previous 3 hours the movie is somehow the worst of all of nolans ambitions rolled into on a peter jacksonian bloatfest it somehow takes the confusion of memento the bland characterizations of the prestige the punishing historical accuracy of dunkirk and the soundtrack of dark knight rises and tenet that is simultaneously unintelligible when it comes to dialogue and punishingly loud when it comes to its overbloated ambient score cillian murphy disappears into a historical figure that none of us can recognize   great we get to see robert downey jr without a dye job whoa this movie isnt bad because the subject matter is worth the consideration and the script this movie is painful to watch because christopher nolan left his handprints all over a history that needed to be told 

i may have enjoyed this film more had i viewed it in my living room with subtitles on over the course of three nights

i will never pay to see a christopher nolan film in a theater ever again after this movie",2023-07-28 05:36:13

i mean this with absolutely no disrespect to barbie im sure it is a great film and i will see it at the end of this film i didnt want to go watch  barbie people are going to go into that film having full on existential meltdowns,2023-07-21 03:41:57
boring as  fell asleep for a bit it’s just a loud  movie with very little actually going on the bomb explosion was cool everything else was meh i went in curious to see if the hype was real but nah good acting and what not but at 3 hrs long it’s dreadful,2023-08-13 19:17:05
great movie i’m going back to see it for florence pugh,2023-07-22 23:13:33
the only good thing about it was the acting,2023-07-23 00:08:50
can anyone explain the end of oppenheimer the world exploded but how and why,2023-07-26 18:46:12
this movie is just a pain in the ears and eyes even if i pause the movie for every single dialog my brain still cant process those too many characters dialogue and all down to nothing  for me  as much as oppenheimer needs his brother in the movie chris needs his brother johnathan one thing sure this is not a the way biopic should be made idk what is the need of imax if i am just going to watch group of people speaking just to create hype and loot money,2023-07-21 15:28:30
"the film makers did a poor job making this story digestable for your average audience

the triple time povs were not done well

besides matt damons character rdjs performance and florences rack which was completely unnecessary i didnt enjoy this movie and man was it long",2023-07-22 04:00:38
 that was a  terrible movie,2023-07-22 22:37:25
this is just chernobyl but written worse general and scientists team up to do something for their government with being labeled as dissidents it needed a better writer it needed a longer run time and it needed not to be a movie and ends in trial,2023-07-23 07:54:30
"this really did nothing for me the pacing was all of the place the performances were one note and i can’t describe it better than this but awardbaity
the sound design  all tension out of the second act as it just bombarded you with jump scares rather than build organically 

i honestly don’t see anything in this runtime that warrants praise especially the third act which drags and seems like it a totally different movie",2023-07-23 22:28:42
cant believe i spent 22  dollars to see this in imax what a waste of money 610 acting was good but i learned more about oppenheimer from tik tok videos than i did from this movie i was very glad when it ended,2023-07-25 23:02:31
it was just a  movie lol it was a grind to sit through it cillian murphy’s acting was so one dimensional  we get told he’s this womanising  but we don’t see any personality through his character the portrayal of pugh’s character was dismal the nonlinear timeline was just unnecessary and annoying to follow the entire film was sequences of muffled conversation set to clanging irritating music nolan tries way way too hard to be intellectual then people think it makes them an intellectual for liking it ,2023-07-28 15:31:06
well it  fought for consiousness the entire movie longest 3 hrs of my life,2023-07-31 03:57:57
anyone else find this film a little confusing with several time periods all mixed in together  furthermore why didnt we see the atomic bomb dropped in hiroshima and nagasaki  instead we got boring depositions,2023-07-22 19:17:28
by writing such a convoluted screenplay that is only manageable through herculean editing christopher nolan manages to take the story of oppenheimer and make it about himself,2023-07-23 19:17:26
"this is the direct quote from bhagavad gita the supreme lord said i am mighty time the source of destruction that comes forth to annihilate the worlds even without your participation the warriors arrayed in the opposing army shall cease to exist

so essentially oppie was saying ehh those  were gonna die anyway with or without japmelter 3000 megaladon ultrakill lol and justifying his work even when he seems to look sad and moping about it  i dont know how this wasnt discussed more

also nolan putting the quote in flo  scene is just see world i can do sexy ",2023-08-04 21:32:23
"too long

apart from that absolutely brilliant",2023-07-21 21:29:17
"1 the scene where he steps on the mummified japanese woman was very powerful 
2 i don’t believe truman was that much of an  as depicted here if anyone has some literature they can direct me to i would be more than happy to read it
3 the plot was way too focused on mccarthy witchhunts than the actual story of oppenheimer and the building of the bomb they should retitle the movie red scare

i was entertained but underwhelmed dunkirk was a way better film from nolan imo",2023-07-21 02:17:51
the movie wasnt that good honestly an average good movie 710 definetely you dont need to watch in imax,2023-07-25 21:39:24
one of the most boring films ive ever seen,2023-08-06 22:28:12
"i thought this movie was tremendous but felt like nolan tried too hard the trinity scene was underwhelming and the movie could have been shortened by 45 minutes we all came for the atomic explosion so why have it in the middle poor structuring imo 

ill stand up and say it and i think i speak for most people we wanted to see the hiroshima and nagasaki explosions recreated in cgi",2023-07-21 21:00:19
"if you convince yourself hard enough that a movie is good because the critics have said its good and because its socially expected of you to say its good youll end up enjoying it thats the only way i can make sense of all the gushing reviews here

this was a mediocre movie if not an outright bad film",2023-07-24 06:36:10
perhaps heat of the moment but i think this is one of nolan’s best films and i’m a huge nolan fanboy it was incredible tense heart wrenching thought provoking and unsettling so many great performances particularly from murphyrdjdamonblunt i’ve been looking forward to this movie forever and it lives up to the hype imo didn’t notice the three hour run time whatsoever hard to find anything negative to say about the film what an experience in imax the auditorium scene the ending scene “the medal will be for them not for you” the trinity test scene really haunting,2023-07-21 04:25:43
"so uh…

nolan  did it i thought dunkirk was pretty solid and i was concerned this would just be “pretty solid”  

this was stunning honestly the bass in the theaters just does it such justice…

the scene when he walks up to deliver a speech after the bomb drops has to be one of the most powerful and well done scenes i’ve witnessed in theaters

 nolan  killed it",2023-07-21 04:53:05
the only reason i think the movie is a 9 is because you can tell its a nolan film so fast from a directing perspective i was a little underwhelmed but it was an amazing film overall,2023-07-21 12:42:14
great movie especially compared to other movies opening the same week,2023-07-22 23:19:32
overall a decent nolan movie i wouldnt consider it his best movie personally like inception more but nevertheless a good movie to watch my only problem with it was all the random blasts of explosive sound like a scene would be quiet then just an explosion the start just constantly ear  you with the amount of explosive noise,2023-07-23 00:11:49
me and my bf literally left early because it was so boring 3 hours drawn out while they’re just talking and talking about nothing i have never dozed off in theatre but i did w this one  i feel like i didn’t even learn anything and there was like no action at all not what i thought it was going to be i didn’t look into it much though idk why so many people are hyping it up bc i seen half the theatre either falling asleep or looking around and so many people left early,2023-08-01 19:57:05
bombed harder than the actual bomb,2023-07-22 00:12:28
this is an unpopular opinion but i hated emily blunts performance in this movie she was just angry all the time and i didnt understand why also it was very hard to believe that she was a woman living in the 40s with all that botox,2023-07-22 18:14:24
"many people can better articulate how great the movie is  

i just want to state i cant believe some of the mistakes made we watched it on imax in branson which probably made some more noticeable 

during the interrogation that happens throughout the film if you look closely out the windows sometimes youll see modern vehicles i quite clearly saw the front of a newer chevy truck 

during a scene with writing on a chalk board you can see they had to redraw it several times while shooting as the circles and letters never match 100 

just the small things that can break immersion",2023-07-23 01:23:16
"are you people serious this movie was long and boring

the 3rd houract was just some trump get accused of colluding with the russians and is railroaded by a kangaroo court only to be defended by a kennedy allegory 

waste of money for imax unless you are into staring at every pore on cillian murphys face during the waytoomany closeups",2023-07-25 12:33:05
"i believe this is a hate letter from nolan to the superhero movies he regrets making it more popular with the dark knight trilogy

 there is a suit up scene and an assembling of a team
 trinity test as a reference to the dark knight trilogy that ends with an atomic explosion
 robert downey jr as a guy who wants to manufacture weapons",2023-07-27 11:05:17
music playing in the background of scene made for some incredibly cheesy looking dialogue also why was every line delivered like it was a live action play very weird not just the timeline jumps but each scene seemed to be a completely different genre no idea what this movie was going for but people will convince themselves to love it just because its christopher nolan who is brilliant legit his worst film by a mile if you have to overly explain why its good its not good,2023-07-28 02:53:42
"i noticed that in oppenheimer there were two different pronunciations of hiroshima hirohshima and hirosheema i think rdj used the former and the defense secretary used the latter but i could be wrong about who said what ive been unaccountably interested in this for years seems like when i was a kid we learned it as hirosheema but the hirohshima pronunciation gained fashion amongst people who wanted to sound smarter

  
i settled this in my own mind once and for all in japan several years ago we took the train to the actual city and they announced our arrival over the pa — a japanese person on the japanese train — as hirosheema

  
case closed",2023-07-30 20:58:48
"explosion was very underwhelming didnt look anything like a nuke

overall as i left the theater with my brother we were a bit speechless as in not too many great things to talk about when it comes to the movie  somewhat of a letdown in that sense super random and loud flash cuts in the middle of quiet moments were annoying too

i think the hype and expectation set it up perfectly to be a bit of a letdown",2023-08-11 11:30:08
"this is nolans best movie

and im not even a nolan fan boy",2023-07-21 03:48:04

this thread is divided between people who are praising the emperors new clothes and those who are pointing out the obvious contrary notion those who drank the koolaid and those who didnt,2023-07-22 18:09:46
"can we talk about nolans depiction of womenlove interests in his films why are they all dark energies with violent outbursts whether thats against the protagonist or direct self harm the prestige inception dark knight rises tenet now this  like dude is your home life okay emma thomas seems lovely whats going on real talk he needs to work on that trauma let go of the emotionally unavailable guys in suits while were at it too so we can all just move on anyway

first hour had the amazing pace and excitement of an early nolan film 810 second hour lost me a bit with casey afflecks sequence wasnt exactly sure what was going on there but the test scene is here so 710 then the movie just completely lost me in the final hour and i didnt care nor want to know anything more at that point kinda reminded me of babylon in that sense where its like alright shows over lets go home now yeah barbie suffers an oddly similar fate by giving us way too long of a resolution but this movie doubles that i really wanted to like it and cillian knocked it out of the park but i dont see myself watching this in full again its at least better than dunkirk i know hot take and tenet less of a hot take so i was satisfied in that regard

just seen it in imax 2 hours longer than it should have been a political and relationship melodrama talk show with little to no screen time of the bomb or the japan it was just a pure boring documentary nolans worst movie and i want my 15 eur for the ticket back also my 3 hour of life i never get back ,2023-08-06 23:46:05

"what a terrible movie first 1 hour is a complete mess with random out of place loud effects for no reason at all when oppen is thinking

then it jumped back and forth between 5 or 6 different scenes all at different times and with different characters nobody can keep up with all that specially people that dont understand or care about politics

the bomb was weak af no massive explosion or destruction just a big pillar of fire

after the bomb it was probably the longest 1 hour ive spent in a cinema a tedious and unnecessary trial where they are constantly attacking the main actor for no good reason nobody enjoyed that

a complete mess of a movie i wouldve done it better myself 110",2023-07-21 12:09:37

so do they show the bombs dropping on japan ,2023-07-21 03:48:08

"so this was a supremely high quality thoroughly enjoyable film as is to be expected with nolan but im not sure i would call it the masterpiece that i went into expecting  


did anyone else find the 3rd act a little bit tricky to give the respect they deserved dont get me wrong i was wholly engaged in the stories being told as the dialogue and narrative were superb but it almost felt like a long extended epilogue rather than the emotional climax i think it was going for after the success of the bomb the stakes really didnt feel as high watching the story of 2 mens reputationscareers in jeopardy maybe im asking too much of a biopic theyre of course restricted by their source material but at least to me the third act felt a little unnecessarily drawn out i think i mightve cut strausss confirmation at the very least oppenheimers security clearance review is obviously very relevant",2023-07-21 07:44:16

rewatch i loved this movie the first time but was even more blown away the second lol the thing i love about this movie is it’s more than a movie power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely do you think the long term is more important than the actual moment knowing how this all plays out 80ish years later it’s hard to imagine what would have happened if they stopped building the bomb or built it and never used it on the  this movie whether it was 100 historically accurate or not makes me think just how scary knowledge is when used against ourselves,2024-04-05 05:41:50

i liked the movie showing the man oppenheimer with morality and feelings about innocent victims men  women and children who died in deconds while the war was ending and us was winning anyway but how  us must show the world who is the  here  the vanished two big cities in asia americans are brutal they are liars they pretending to be democratic with high and mighty after their victory they went after those scientists who were really humans but not americans so most of them spent years in jail for no reason really just because they said once being red better than being dead really what a movie from nolan and what a truth,2023-07-21 12:57:53
above average movie the first two hours train wreck 3rd hour that drags on and couldve been done in 15 minutes robert downey jr is in terrible old age make up and the entire 3rd hour is spent on him scheming against oppenheimer when you really have no idea why it matters and who rdj is even playing giving nolan final cut was a huge mistake,2023-07-24 23:55:31

"why did oppenheimer need an excessive amount of nudity and  scenes

i watched it yesterday it is a fantastic movie there are several things that i enjoyed  the quality of acting from actors how multiple timelines were intertwined together cinematography and quality of scenes movie did a good job of moving around the central element of oppenheimer work on the atomic bomb while he was haunted by his past however what i dont understand is why there was a need for a  scene and nudity what do they add to the movie  and nudity feels like nolans desire to add some superb spice to his cooking that does nothing but further confuses people was it meant to show that oppenheimer is a victim of his human emotions that he is a womanizer a mortal human why",2023-08-02 17:27:24

"very well made film one of nolan’s “tighter” movies script wise

i just really disliked the portrayal of oppenheimer most people are going to come away with the idea that he was a martyr he wasn’t prometheus he was a human being who participated in a collaborative effort 

truman and strauss are correct about their perspective on oppenheimer’s self importance but they’re portrayed as cartoon villains who are just petty",2023-07-21 17:19:21
the actions of the germans and japanese were openly criticized clearly portraying them as the antagonists which was appropriate however the actions of the us were never condemned instead they were portrayed as heroic the usa in 1945 despite being a democratic nation exhibited same level of cruelty compared to that of authoritarian regimes in germany and japan,2023-07-22 07:09:59

"i felt the movie could have ended when truman kicked oppenheimer out of his office the story of the bomb is drama enough for the big screen but to tell the story of the development of the bomb is a purely mechanical function  something a history channel writer could do to make a drama about the lives of the people involved in the bomb is to assert oneself as a hollywood artist when the movie kept going i sat forward on my chair because the director was about to reveal his vision of the film 

its important we understand what biases are motivating our storytellers because the stories that we believe in are the stories that become real 

nolan included the part about the trial of oppenheimer because he wanted to make his mark as a big important artistic director yet only achieved a permanent archive of himself as wholly prey to the spell of the patriarchy in relief to greta thunbergs film we can see oppenheimer for what it is ken in a nutshell unwilling to deal with his male woundedness and when offered the illusion of control through his ability to look big and scary and important he seized it like the big mediocre babyinamansbody he is to me the movie exists only to increase the impact and urgency of barbie in that it emphasizes the imperative of understanding the patriarchy and mechanisms by which it exerts its control the sooner we remove the investment of our belief into the patriachy and its progenitors in our elected offices and vote into office feminist representatives as barbie encourages us to do the more likely we are to avert the kind of destruction oppenheimer reminds us the patriarchy will be helpless to preventing itself from committing",2023-08-21 01:39:49
i just tried watching this on video i chose a random point towards the beginning of the movie to test out the audio and subtitles in those 5 minutes i saw 2 things the justification of this genocidal bomb and murphy slipping into an irish accent i can only imagine how bad the rest of it is i will not bother finding out i knew it would be american militarist drivel and i was right its an agonizing decision but a necessary one etc murphy and nolan shouldve gotten him to do a proper american accent,2023-11-12 20:11:42

great movie but i feel like the score was too much at times like the impact of the silence when the bomb goes off not having a score would’ve emphasized certain moments more it felt like nolan was worried that he’d lose the audience if he didn’t have music pulsing thoughout  simply being able to clearly hear the dialogue n watch the incredible acting would sold the importance of what was going on too,2023-07-21 06:07:47

they really should have stressed oppenheimers moral dilemma more through the movie and made more about that we also didn’t actually get a real “i have become death destroyer of worlds” moment with oppenheimers cold eyes great acting but story was flat and was a mid movie nolan’s worst imo,2023-07-21 06:41:27

what made the framing device in elvis work is that its from the  perspective of someone who won in this you can not only feel the slime off rdjs character off the jump you can also smell a loser the camera is never in his control nolan couldt land the memento kickflip here and i honestly think it might be or at least a major contributing factor might be because he replaced the phone from memento with a guy with a punchable face that actually has lines and backtalks rdj

 also the lack of smoke is  criminal this is a hard r movie about a guy who dies of cancer not from the radiation like some people he hired to actually build the bomb but from throat cancer from his constant smoking he should look super cool and die in pain and anguish like a dog

"i feel like a lot of people who had a problem with the pacing didnt fully grasp the idea of the movie
to me the pacing perfectly matches the way oppenheimer probably viewed his experience during the era which is what makes this movie really standout to me 
from a young student traveling through europe meeting all these great people to his rapid involvement in the manhattan project to being just as quickly cast aside which slams home the last point einstein made at the end of the movie
it couldve been a wonder story or a much darker one but that would twist reality
oppenheimer is a gray story where right and wrong is supposed to be muddied and we simply get a view of the way oppenheimer experienced it all
8510 movie for me not perfect but i dont think it couldve been done told much better without wandering off from reality too far",2023-07-22 12:38:58

this movie was absolutely awful i’ve seen a lot of  movies but this one blows them out of the water the bomb was the most anticlimactic thing i’ve ever witnessed i have seen a grease fire that was more intense it appeared nothing like an atomic bomb the dialogue was cluttered chaotic and uninteresting the story could have been condensed to an hour and a half there were several times i considered walking out of the theatre but i kept holding out hope i have never been so regretful about seeing a movie this was my first and my last christopher nolan film even seeing that name is making me irritated after having been put through that 3 hours of my life down the drain,2023-08-03 02:47:52

not so sure about this film shocked to see that christopher nolan of course directed and was a producer of the movie but he was also in fact the screenwriter for this film he sure took some liberties on his interpretation of the time this is a world war 2 movie yet made zero mention of the terms “axis and allies” which i’m not sure how you make a movie about that time without using those terms who was fighting who the allies were the uk us and the soviet union yet he made the whole movie about communist russia which wasn’t even a thing then or even called that at that point and the problem was with germany japan  italy axis countries it was the soviet and they were a us ally shocked there was no showing in the entire movie of japan they couldn’t even say a little blurb at the end about the 200000 people who were killed by this bomb i’m sure japan as our friends now must love that our biggest grossing film is glorifying one of their saddest days without any mention of their people the movie even admits it was unnecessary to do that to japan and really shoud’ve been made in time to bomb germanyhitler instead that movie was a mess of characters who the audience is unsure exactly who each random scientist and politician is exactly nolan spent the wrong amount of time on the wrong subjects of this film on dr oppenheimer,2023-07-24 04:35:10

edit i didnt show up late other people did when they shuffled to their seats i missed a bunch of the beginning funny how people thought i was late if i was late i wouldve said i was late or i missed the beginning how could i see some of the beginning but missed parts of it also if i was late how would i know the movie started on time and dived straight into the plot",2023-07-22 01:30:30

well that was something you dont see everyday there was no other possible way you could have made a film about robert oppenheimer it was over the top messy beautiful flawed and mesmerizing it was perfectly imperfect and thats what i enjoyed about it i feel like the pacing along with the run time will put a lot of folks off saw a few people walk out during my viewing with bored looks on their faces what i got out of it was a pure and raw cinematic experience that felt like a grandiose event rather than just going to the movies,2023-07-21 06:24:46

im wanted to take my oh to see it but he has sensitive hearing he had to leave the cinema during the last film we saw jurassic world dominion please dont judge lol because the background music was too loud in parts is that likely to be a problem for this film as well im told sound mixing isnt exactly one of nolans strengths after all",2023-07-25 15:05:08

this is my favorite scene followed by the convo with einstein right after i actually cried which was strange it hit me like a bag of bricks,2023-07-22 02:58:36
call out to alden ehrenreichs fantastic delivery,2023-07-22 22:28:01
that made audibly say oof in the theatre haha loved that part,2023-07-22 04:47:47
thing is they were talking about something more important and lewis strauss einstein hated the idea of tellers super and strauss greatly helped its development the side eyes are real,2023-07-23 12:44:42
alden ehrenreich was low key the standout performance for me rdj and murphy were the stars and they delivered oscar worthy performances but ehrenreich really stood out in a sea of talented ensemble performances and there were a lot of great performances in that ensemble i know his career stalled a little after solo but i’d love to see more of him,2023-07-24 20:26:00
looooved that line delivery so much rdj  alden played off each other so well,2023-07-23 05:33:54
narcism paranoia and hypocrisy are a contagious poison in our society… always seems like they go hand in hand with power,2023-07-26 14:11:56
can’t believe han solo told that to iron man crazy movie,2023-07-22 22:03:33
this is demonstrated throughout the entire movie with the color scheme oppenheimer saw the big picture the world in color strauss saw only his own ambition a world of black and white,2023-07-30 04:31:48
spelling it out and then showing it felt too repetitive and on the nose to me,2023-08-06 04:15:48
written and delivered with the skill of a high school kid’s english essay,2023-08-01 23:36:31
and they were a great prelude to the closing scene which was a great haymaker to make it all stick with you,2023-07-26 05:47:59
it was the wrong character to deliver that line imo it was a little jarring and unrealistic for an aide to just do a complete heel turn and  on the person he’s working for i get that characters are nuanced but it happened too quickly for it to be earned,2023-07-22 12:01:22
i was slightly confused by that scene because it was a flashback of the first time they met correct but oppenheimer referenced the calculations that said they may destroy the world but that didn’t happen until after they started working at los almos correct was it not a flashback are my timelines off,2023-07-23 23:15:50
rdj is pure brilliance,2023-07-23 00:16:42
i know it was meant like it but he spoke of albert never looking at him after that and other scientists being against him too was it mean to be just all imagined,2023-07-25 17:44:09
i knew he was in this movie but i didn’t know who he played it wasn’t until like his 5th time on screen before it hit me he disappeared in the role he’s so good,2023-08-10 16:34:18
i was listening to a podcast where they were saying that this story of a great man creating something that ended up destroying the world is kind of like christopher nolan making batman which started an era overrun with superhero movies so it’s funny to see christopher nolan put rdj in this role,2023-08-14 03:42:39
he was great but the last 10 mins or so with him pacing and wagging his finger like a pantomime villain were a little histrionic,2023-07-26 22:14:49
i loved that at the end as an even bigger  you i would’ve liked it if they didn’t actually show the scene it didn’t occur to me until the very end that all his spite came from him thinking that oppenheimer and einstein wear talking  about him he really is self important,2023-08-04 01:40:15
agreed,2023-07-23 01:48:55
some directors have that pull wes anderson and tarantino are the same just been in a nolan film even if its a 5 minute role is something as a actor you want to tick off the bucket list,2023-07-21 03:50:29
i thought casey affleck was riveting in his one major scene he looked like he wanted to rip oppenheimers skin off,2023-07-21 22:18:16
"gary oldman

for  sake i just found out he played truman that  chameleon keeps fooling me",2023-07-22 22:14:17
rami was perfect casting hes a born character actor such a jarring presence on screen steals the movie when he leans into stuff like this,2023-07-22 01:12:47
affleck nailed anticommunist freak he played  you can just see the boiling rage in his eyes,2023-07-23 01:28:19
not to mention kenneth branagh two oscar nominations two emmys and a bafta for acting,2023-07-22 20:18:00
casey affleck gave me so much anxiety in the few minutes he was used real strong killer energy,2023-07-23 06:56:46
it really shows not only the pull that nolan has but the ability to build great relationships with the crew that want to come back consistently the actors just know that nolan won’t waste their small amount of screen time but instead give them meaningful lines even if it’s only for a couple of minutes,2023-07-22 09:01:09
rami malek initially kinda stuck out but by the end i saw why he was cast the film does that with some of these characters even jason clarke’s role is initially a little dry but at the end it’s much more standout and pointed,2023-07-22 18:12:09
"gary oldman was in this

oh my  i didn’t recognize him at all as truman",2023-07-22 23:55:27
but they were very captivating in their scenes,2023-07-21 04:06:48
rami malek is in two scenes where he has no dialogue at all and then gets brought back at the end which i guess is kind of foreshadowing because why would you hire rami malek just to make him an extra,2023-07-23 08:54:23
holy  casey too at this point im wondering if ill be blessed with an interstellar reuinion,2023-07-21 04:14:16
affleck’s scenes were chilling,2023-07-23 02:10:33
"but every single part for them was important  sometimes it’s not how many scenes you get it’s the quality of the scene you do get 

props for malek too he looked like a bit character up until the board hearing g and then he puts strauss on full blast and eviscerates him publicly",2023-07-23 10:59:27
casey afflec was terrifying in this my ,2023-07-23 23:24:26
i never thought that casey  affleck would have me scared of him such a short scene but he owned the room and made me forget that oppenheimer wasn’t tortured because that dude definitely does some torturing,2023-07-26 14:35:36
rami maleks character was a  gem,2023-07-22 12:07:17
i felt like there were so many recognizable faces here dane dehaan and josh hartnett also  the bad guy from stranger things  one of the safdies  florence pugh  chris nolan can get whoever he wants for any size part,2023-07-26 02:25:04
and several actors prominent in the advertising had basically no dialog specifically i noticed josh peck and jack quarid have almost nothing to say outside of some simple yesno responses,2023-07-24 03:18:57
i was surprised to see rami malek and also jack quaid too the boys lower decks lots of well known actors for small roles in this movie,2023-07-24 20:02:48
"my thought was they need to have best actors now for lengths of time one screen

 under 15 mintues 

 15 to 30

 30 to 45

 45 to an hour 

 etc",2023-07-23 02:29:18
ex nhl enforcer sean avery had as much screen time ,2023-07-23 05:39:40
and rami killed it in that testimony scene here i was thinking that his character was just some kind of goofy fly on the wall and the he comes up and busts the nomination up for strauss,2023-07-24 03:30:34
wow once again i didn’t even realize that was gary oldman,2023-07-24 04:58:45
and remi especially hit it out of the park he played a crucial role in the film and drove it home beautifully,2023-07-26 16:10:22
aaand this is how i learned that oldman was not only in the film but that he played truman  he can really disappear into roles like no other,2023-07-28 16:09:11
diom waiters award,2023-07-22 14:38:09
wait where was gary at,2023-07-23 07:16:44
i kept waiting for the other shoe to drop with rami’s character especially after sean avery—arguably the biggest  in nhl history—got a few lines as the weather guy and malek had still not uttered a single word yet like how can avery get more lines than a literal oscar winner was pleased with the eventual reveal of his role at the hearing,2023-07-30 02:07:45
gary  oldman was truman  holy  i never would have recognized him lol,2023-08-06 06:17:03
all three did great in their small roles though,2023-07-23 19:05:41
florence pugh got like 510 minutes and a couple of reviews i saw said they wasted her by having most of her time in a  scene you look at the rest of the cast though and it’s impossible to make time for everyone,2023-08-01 01:23:39
wait casey  oldman was in the film,2023-08-02 13:18:45
as a big mr robot fan i was  when rami didn’t have any lines then bam he plays one of the biggest roles in the movie,2023-08-13 06:48:32
it also helps they though they werent on screen long they were all given absolutely critical and crucial moments to shine,2023-07-24 23:08:53
wait gary oldman was in this lol,2023-07-27 00:13:43
i didnt realize gary oldman was in the movie,2023-07-28 06:44:33
yeah and all of them are hidden beneath josh pecks enormous shadow,2023-07-29 06:19:30
i didn’t realize oldman was truman until the credits,2023-07-29 21:52:59
just realizing now that was gary oldman holy  that guy is a chameleon,2023-08-08 19:24:46
"to be fair all 3 were pretty pitch perfect in their roles  
oldman was an absolute delight when he showed up",2023-08-09 23:43:46
rami malek was literally featured extra until his senate hearing scene,2023-08-14 03:44:21
yea but then you get bum actors like sean avery former nhl player who have no acting skills at all,2023-08-15 20:36:57
  casey affelck,2023-07-24 02:08:19
maybe i’m in the minority but i dislike when movies have casts like this i find it to be more of a distraction than it’s worth to keep having big stars drop in for a couple minutes,2023-07-22 20:52:55
who did casey affleck play didnt recognise him,2023-07-29 21:59:40
probally filmed a ton more,2023-07-30 11:09:32
reminded me of the mainstream actors appearing in 1917,2023-08-04 09:13:59
raaaaami,2023-08-18 06:00:16
dude i know its been 49 days since your comment but  i absolutely loved casey affleck in this he didnt say much but he was so menacing great short performance,2023-09-08 16:21:52
well its nolan,2023-11-20 03:52:07
truman …,2023-07-22 01:45:39
"teller is like “i would  do it again”


",2023-07-23 17:03:59
safdie as teller might be the best performance in the film,2023-07-24 11:11:28
i made the decision to take a proactive  around 1 hour in i could tell there wasnt going to be a good time to go so i figured better earlier than later,2023-07-22 05:15:52
somebody in my theater missed the trinity test for the bathroom,2023-07-23 17:53:39
bring back the intermission,2023-07-23 08:45:38
gotta make sure not to consume too much liquid prior to long films will have to do the same once killers of the flower moon opens with its 35hrs,2023-07-23 04:43:57
i made it to 2h28 missed about two minutes no regrets,2023-07-22 20:38:30
in india we get a break at middle of the movie for 10 minutes to  and buy popcorn,2023-07-27 20:17:34
salty snacks and limited water,2023-07-23 01:46:45
i had an older couple beside me who had to talk or be on their phone the entire  time and elbow me every few minutes my theater was packed so i was stuck but now i have an excuse to see it in imax,2023-07-22 05:59:02
he should have use runpee,2023-07-23 14:55:16
some woman at my showing got up like right before the countdown for the trinity test and walked in front of me as the bomb was going off,2023-07-25 13:05:54
proud to tell that i made it those 3 hours and then also the 15 more mins walk back home,2023-07-26 07:10:01
i saw someone come back right after the trinity scene big goof,2023-07-23 18:38:34
the person next to me ducked out right after trinity i suspect she googled when to go beforehand,2023-07-29 21:56:53
about 2 hrs in i knew i was sitting there for the whole time having to ,2023-07-23 21:29:48
 this is why i dont eat or drink during the movies,2023-07-24 02:39:09
yall need to lobby for intermissions we get them even for 90 minute movies,2023-07-25 22:38:32
makes me think of interstellar i had to  once the rocket took off not i noticed something more like hey man you should go by the end of the movie my bladder was screaming at me foot shaking dance and all once the title popped on the screen i sprinted to the bathroom aint no  way im missing anything in a nolan film especially with this type of build up,2023-07-26 07:39:01
our showing literally blacked out in the court scene towards the end where oppenheimer was talking about the 2 scorpions fighting a solid 5 minutes of darkness and only the audio playing the perfect  break window,2023-07-26 12:44:40
im glad we have intermissionsintervals for every movie here in india no matter how long a 10min break for you to do whatever until the movie resumes,2023-08-12 07:09:06
i just got out of watching it i still haven’t went to the bathroom the line at the theater when it was over was stretching out to the other side of the room,2023-07-25 22:21:19
the runpee app is very useful for avoiding this,2023-07-29 02:03:58
that was me lol but i made it back before it ends,2023-08-01 11:39:56
y’all need to try the runpee app it’s easily the best thing for long movies and even comes multiple pre options and a timer that follows alongside the movie literally i’ll get a buzz on my phone and boom i got 230m to go to the restroom and i’ll even get a synopsis of what i missed it’s great for end credits too,2023-08-02 02:25:50
i left around that mark i thought the legal drama in the last hour was tedious and the stakes were maintaining a security clearance there was really nothing at that point that i felt i couldn’t find on wikipedia nolan can get so heavy handed with exposition i get exhausted each to their own loved 23rds of it,2023-08-02 19:06:49
some guy in front of me when for a bathroom break during the scene it shows what oppie and einstein really talked about there isnt really a good time to go in this movie but that was one of the most important parts of the 2nd half,2023-08-08 12:23:00
i didnt need to go before it started but i strained and forced a little out just to make sure it was completely empty,2023-08-12 06:17:55
this was 53 days ago but it was me just today,2023-09-13 03:09:45
people got weak bladders  either  before the movie starts or maybe don’t buy the 20oz drink if you can’t handle it,2023-08-18 00:05:45
recommend if anyone takes a  they do it during the hearing scenes important yeah but boring also yeah,2023-07-23 19:19:44
i went like 30 minutes in because i listened to the  on here that stated there would be no trailers at that the movie had a hard starting time there was 20 minutes of ads plus like a half hour of trailers my popcorn was all but gone and my bladder was full by the time einstein made his first appearance,2023-07-24 03:46:11
ehhh they could always just stream it later,2023-07-24 06:31:41
i almost did the same thing glad i held it out,2023-07-24 18:49:31
i had to use the bathroom at the scene after they build the new building,2023-07-25 04:38:30
he definitely could too his got a convincing russian accent,2023-07-21 16:30:25
surprised he was able to pull josh from drake and josh,2023-07-27 17:37:30
krumholtzs transformation surprised me cause im watching the deuce right now and in season 2 he suddenly loses a lot of weight and its addressed in the show,2023-07-23 00:00:27
the subtitle to the film should be i need to check imdb when this is over,2023-08-07 14:37:47
i feel like krumholtz has looked like that for a while now,2023-07-23 00:47:23
nolan definitely pulled strings to get the kid from  drive to come out of retirement for this haha,2023-07-26 04:30:59
krumholtz was inspired in this,2023-07-25 07:43:05
4 he needs clement atlee too,2023-07-24 19:19:15
"how all of the people…would be able to fit together

commenting late but that to me is what direction actually is you get maybe a few minutes of footage a day often in front of green screens and it’s the director who had to see the bigger picture",2023-08-17 02:04:35
hey there’s attlee too,2023-07-22 08:18:55
totally agree even matt damon’s character seems genuinely frightened of what he is capable of and casey nails it with his nonverbal acting and cillian nails the unnerved reaction fantastically tense scene,2023-07-22 02:44:31
funny part is if anyone else was playing oppenheimer i think that role would be locked in for cillian murphy,2023-07-22 21:22:06
the movie does an excellent job of showing what it’s like to be around these crazy military people and politicians,2023-07-24 22:44:35
i dont which one he was in the movie was he the one who interrogated oppie and was called as the guy who later genocided the bosheviks or something,2023-07-21 16:15:56
guy usually goes hard in anything hes in,2023-07-23 01:31:50
the guy he played was involved in cia wetworks after the war,2023-07-24 05:54:13
casey affleck was incredibly persuasive in demonstrating sociopathic ca vibes but nolan is a genius the way he made us believe that was by inserting scenes where oppenheimer and groves were discussing affleck’s character it’s chilling how nolan can manipulate our minds into believing what he wants us to believe,2023-07-26 22:58:07
he reminds me of the willem dafoe character in the grand budapest hotel haha,2023-07-21 15:04:40
hugo stiglitz energy,2023-07-22 14:39:04
he was similar to the kgb leader in chernobyl a general air of “i know more than you and i can  you at any time i want”,2023-07-23 02:38:14
he reminded me of daniel bruhls character in inglorious basterds affable probing charming then say the thing hes waiting to hear and hes shooting you,2023-07-25 16:51:25
i felt casey emily blunt and josh hartnett have aged a lot since we last saw them  even josh peck  i get that’s how time works but it really stood out to me,2023-07-26 04:52:08
equally intense as christopher waltz in inglorious bastards… i felt the same vibes,2023-07-27 22:59:43
he was definitely thinking “who do i need to ” as oppenheimer spoke,2023-07-29 21:54:39
he strangely kinda reminded me the fbi agent in season 3 of daredevil,2023-07-22 08:57:50
late to the party just watched it today and i kinda didnt really get why pash showed up in the first place like i only got some gist that there was some intermediary involved and hence he testified against oppie someone care to explain the whole premise more clearly,2023-07-29 20:17:27
it reminded me of the deleted scene in nixon with sam waterston,2023-07-22 21:14:41
i was having ‘jesse james’ thoughts watching casey pick apart oppie so tense like damon joked about ‘oh we’ll just  him’ but casey was prolly forreal,2023-08-01 01:53:03
its really uncanny how creepy he felt with very little over creepiness,2023-08-14 17:25:34
he was like hans landa with none of the charm,2023-09-04 23:57:55
it was fantastic also generals back in the day were way more badass than the ones today,2023-08-01 16:19:01
dude is def gonna get typecast,2023-07-23 06:22:49
"apparently he was even worse irl

he called oppenheimer a “crybaby scientist” and said “i dont want to see that son of a b–– in this office ever again”",2023-07-21 05:23:25
going from roosevelt to truman is such a crazy change in personalities not quite jfklbj but still,2023-07-25 04:44:43
bro him waving the handkerchief in front of oppenheimer became an instant inside joke between me and my buddy it was such a  move but it was so funny to us,2023-07-23 13:32:12
a near genocide on korea as well so i’d say yeah worst person in the movie,2023-07-25 07:18:49
"oppenheimer when he went into trumans office with dean acheson said to the latter wringing his handsi have blood on my hands truman later said to acheson never bring that  cretin in here again he didnt drop the bomb i did that kind of weepiness makes me sick

and frankly truman was right",2023-07-22 14:30:08
gary oldman is such a pro,2023-07-30 04:19:07
"projection at it’s finest

oppenheimer could have been the most painful reminder of his own conscious at that point",2023-07-26 14:46:59
"watch oliver stones untold history of the united states

truman  us all",2023-08-06 03:06:17
hes the  for ending the war right why are you prowar,2023-07-22 00:53:48
this was literally the avengers for theoretical physicists,2023-07-23 14:56:15
i like that they sneaked richard feynman in i mean who else would be playing the bongos at the first nuclear detonation,2023-07-23 23:05:17
wait gödel was in this,2023-07-22 03:30:55
the water motif in this movie was fantastic,2023-07-21 08:19:02
and the fact that it was a few in the first scene with a lot more in the final scene,2023-07-23 03:56:31
how whats the significance,2023-07-21 12:00:26
in my head i said what would be the final line the whole film had been leading up to destruction one way or another,2023-08-01 01:57:41
stop im going to detonate ,2023-07-21 10:20:05
i still cant believe nolan had oppenheimers most iconic quote introduced right after he was done nailing florence pugh what a madlad,2023-07-22 04:44:02
the internet said there would be  but i’ve seen the movie twice now and no  ,2023-07-23 02:10:27
it was so weird she “got off the horse ” talked about his books then got back on like who has  like that,2023-07-22 07:47:26
the destroyer of dicks,2023-07-21 18:45:26
oppie would have killed it as a redditor,2023-07-23 03:55:49
nolan’s biggest weakness is not is sound editing stuff it’s the lack of love chemistry and intimacy felt between characters in any of his movies,2023-07-22 03:05:53
jesus wept,2023-07-23 01:53:53
say that in sanskrit,2023-07-23 05:35:29
it was honestly out of place and corny,2023-07-23 06:23:12
that  went so hard,2023-07-22 06:32:04
“now i have become hard destroyer of ”,2023-07-24 20:48:27
i thought that scene was extremely cringey rolled my eyes out of my head when he started reading,2023-07-25 14:22:01
you asked me to comeand i came,2023-07-28 06:18:48
nolan turned that into oppenheimers safe word,2023-07-25 16:49:14

you dont get to commit the sin and then have the rest of us feel sorry for you for there being consequences,2023-07-22 02:34:34
what struck me about the line is it applied not only to the immediate turmoil but also the larger conflict within oppenheimer,2023-07-22 20:21:02
"it reminded me of a brilliant line for carmela in the sopranos

“you are putting me in a position to feel sorry for a  who  you”

very similar situation too tony’s goomar attempts suicide",2023-07-22 09:01:11
"sounds like something from bojack 

you cant keep doing  things and then feel bad about yourself like that makes it okay you need to be better bojack just stop you are all the things that are wrong with you its not the alcohol or the drugs or any of the  things that happened to you in your career or when you were a kid",2023-07-28 08:00:23
i liked the one where she said something like you thought that by letting them torture you in front of everyone else it would absolve you for what you did,2023-07-31 21:35:13
also what was that line at the end that kitty says after the hearing “did you think getting tarred and feathered would make up for what you’ve done” really felt like the point of the movie boiled down into one sentence,2023-08-14 11:25:02
interesting commentary on the mans life in general,2023-07-26 17:31:20
havent seen it yet so i dont know the context of this scene what is the sin she is referring to oppenheimers affair,2023-07-21 20:19:40
did she know he was cheating on her with jean because otherwise that was a horrible reaction to have to someone crying about someone in their life dying,2023-08-30 21:15:55
i think the quote is interesting but the way it played out in the movie was really awkward and uncomfortable imo lost a lot of its impact that way,2023-07-22 09:49:49
probably inspired by the sopranos moment when carmela says “you’re putting me in a position to feel sorry for a  who  you”,2023-07-25 15:15:21
i was absolutely sobbing uncontrollably when hes acknowledging the crowd that are cheering and saying how the only regret he has is not being able to use it earlier while internally everything is silent and he is contemplating the destruction of the bomb emotionally draining sequence right there one of the most memorable and deep emotional moment i have felt in a movie theater,2023-07-25 09:24:24
the trinity test sequence is incredible but that gymnasium scene is my favorite in the film gutwrenching having the two back to back makes for the best 2025 minutes youll have in a theater this year,2023-07-25 17:58:45
ive never seen a better representation for how insane and genocidal americans can be the imagery of the flags and basketball hoop juxtaposed with charred bodies and falling ash was so fitting,2023-08-02 04:36:23
i know sound has always been his thing but this one takes the cake the ensuing sound of the bomb after the long silence excellence sort of wish i had gone out of my way to see it in a bigger theatre,2023-08-09 11:21:04
"i would have liked to see the crowd actually turn to ash and bones in his hallucination though 

instead we got a chick with some paper glued to her face flapping about

movie had a lot of great ideas but just didnt push it far enough",2023-08-04 18:35:30
honestly this movie basically feels like who i imagined nolan would be after i watched memento back in the day instead that guy detoured into batman and big action thrillers and so they gave that guy 100 million to shoot this on imax film,2023-07-22 00:45:36
"ari aster like

yep it left me disturbed and i still need to unpack why exactly",2023-07-23 08:11:43
there was almost a jump scare moment there that reminded me of the mal moment in inception,2023-07-25 05:46:08
that part took me out of the movie a bit  flo pugh riding cillian during the hearing and almost breaking the fourth wall made me chuckle,2023-07-23 04:14:58
it was incredibly uncomfortable,2023-07-24 22:56:19
my wife and i were joking after we saw it last night that only nolan has the pull to get florence pugh to show up only to get  two times and have recent oscar winner rami malek be in a film for two minutes so many amazing cameos sprinkled throughout this film,2023-08-06 13:33:12
i wish there was an alternative version of this movie that had more scenes like that i could see someone else having a vision of the story with los alamos being the center of this insane realitybending nexus of world historical events and the world almost seeming to come apart at its seams,2023-07-27 04:57:44
had zero problem with the  part don’t know why everyone is complaining but her suddenly riding him in the hearing was laughably bad like being hit in the head with a wooden spoon,2023-08-18 21:10:07
it was so  i suspected that the nudity was going to be completely pointless and it was florence pugh is such a good actress she was wasted in this,2023-07-23 15:18:26
my gf thinks maybe she was murdered,2023-08-28 02:13:39
maybe because midsommar was fresh on my mind because i recently watched it but in some scenes i couldn’t help myself but seeing dani,2023-08-01 04:20:02
i felt it kinda clashed with hoytema’s realisticseeming cinematography,2023-07-24 06:38:10
it jumped the shark for me i straight up laughed when pugh started making hard eye contact with emily blunt,2023-08-09 13:16:22
the first  scene i was like “why’s everyone making a big deal about this” then later the other scene happened…,2023-08-24 02:59:37
"it was a little over the top for me lol

tbh i get it like its cool and flashy cinema but idk",2023-07-24 06:50:18
" it was almost ari aster like

the unexpected sequel midcummer",2023-11-11 18:31:01
it was a very “christopher nolan”  scene if that makes sense,2023-07-28 05:05:50
yeah there were moments in this movie that were a great mix of surreal and dark almost had more of a batman begins feel when the hallucinogenic gas is released,2023-08-18 00:17:32
a lesser biopic would have ended with the real oppenheimer’s “i am become death destroyer of worlds” speech that didn’t happen here,2023-07-22 01:21:52
a frightening scene that was needed it’s still shocking to me that a lot of people don’t understand that a nuclear warhead being used means we’re all absolutely ,2023-07-21 18:26:03
that scene gave me absolute chills once the movie ended my whole theater seemed to be a little shaken up by that especially a completely full theater that during the previews seemed ready to cheer and have reactions to the movie became dead silent because of how tense the movie was,2023-07-21 08:05:06
"and when einsteins expression drops when he realises great acting by tom conti

that line had the kind of weight that the i was disappointed that you tried line from inception boom",2023-07-23 13:40:26
it was i believe we did,2023-07-21 08:44:46
"i honestly felt like crying when it was over not even completely understanding why and i’m not one of these people that thinks oppenheimer is evil and that the us shouldn’t have undertaken the manhattan project 

i feel like because of human nature atomic weapons were an inevitability which in a way is even more sad no one stirs up complex emotional reactions quite like nolan at least for me",2023-07-22 02:31:01
while the whole movie felt like a documentary masterfully edited with lines that were said in real life used from actual transcripts the last line the scene at the lake which is most likely pure fiction made the movie very clever,2023-07-22 13:34:31
i thought it was a great scene and ending but i feel im in the minority that it wasnt so powerful and emotionally draining to me because it wasnt saying anything new ive already dealt with this realization doesnt make it any less sad but it wasnt profound or anything i hear about people leaving the theater devastated but it just wasnt there for me,2023-07-22 23:27:48
i know what you mean it felt absolutely devastating and it really makes you feel that oppenheimer understands that his greatest achievement devastated humanity,2023-07-22 07:04:39
"it made me tear up seeing those warheads the missiles streaking across the sky the pullback into orbit with rings of fire spreading out across the globe



were not going to make it are we people i mean

its in your nature to destroy yourselves",2023-07-26 06:27:39
what makes that scene more harrowing is we see oppenheimer directly after it whenever he gets a second alone he thinks about the chain reaction he might have caused i never thought nolan would beat the ending sequence to inception but this did it i had that thousand yard stare for the first twenty minutes of barbie they will study this film for years to come it’s every trick nolan has learned along the way masterfully put to use,2023-07-23 09:55:41
this is why barbie second is the right order,2023-07-25 04:29:09
this the twitter rhetoric made this movie seem soulless i think nolan pretty clearly imprinted the weight of the subject matter,2023-07-25 10:37:57
remind me  what scene was this in context of,2023-07-23 00:08:08
"it was such a powerful moment especially knowing it isnt some fiction but a reality we live in

we never know one day we suddenly live in a nuclear hellscape because of the  nations made one mistake and already know how much close encounters and false alarms in history where the us and ussrrussia almost exchanged nukes",2023-07-25 00:02:58
"just an absolutely stunning ending nothing more satisfying than being in the end of a film and knowing exactly the perfect ending one step ahead of what they’re showing that they’re setting up and watching them  nail it

people rail on nolan for incomprehensible dialogue or making movies that are explained more visually than logically but being on the same wavelength as what he’s doing is wonderful i don’t fault anyone for not jiving with it but i’m glad that i do",2023-08-13 05:02:44
it is stark but i found it not really scaring me since we’re driving ourselves to extinction with climate change and that killing is seems much much more likely and likely to happen much sooner,2023-07-22 22:49:12
in the beginning of the movie we started with just one ripple as einstein was throwing rocks in the water but at the end it was the entire pond as the rain fell,2023-07-22 03:30:13
i think the water ripples on the map appear shortly after someone says “we either drown in 10 feet of water or 10000 feet it makes no difference” not sure if it was intentional or not but cool detail,2023-07-22 04:40:40
i want a spinoff  einstein,2023-07-21 17:00:01
a bit of a stretch perhaps but various recordings of particle collisions and especially holography plates look like a pond with ripples in it i had the feeling nolan was referring to that and the particlewave duality of matter with the shot,2023-07-24 08:58:19
i also thought of it as a representation of the chain reaction at the heart of the bomb,2023-07-23 03:45:28
unrelated but you have the same pfp as my letterboxd ha,2023-07-22 00:14:05
i swear nolan fans are like english lit majors writing their theses grappling on to any imagery to draw wild interpretations in order to fill the pages,2023-08-01 23:49:44
did you think the orange they he eats is representative of the design of bomb,2023-08-06 03:50:03
when,2023-07-21 17:55:01
"the best part is its factually accurate whole parts of that scene were actual quotes

“chairman gray “would it be fair to say that dr oppenheimer’s contributions in the years as late as possibly 1942 meant that he had not stopped having anything to do with the communist party i don’t insist that you answer that yes or no you can answer that any way you wish”

 kitty oppenheimer “i know that thank you i don’t think that the question is properly phrased”

 chairman gray “do you understand what i am trying to get at”

 kitty “yes i do”

 chairman gray “why don’t you answer it that way”

 kitty “the reason i don’t like the phrase ‘stopped having anything to do with the communist party’    it is because i don’t think robert ever had anything to do with the communist party as such i know he gave money for spanish refugees i know he gave it through the communist party”



kitty did not give an inch not even robb could touch her calm and yet alert to every nuance she was undoubtedly a better witness than the husband she was defending

excerpt from american prometheus",2023-07-21 10:39:58
crowd was absolutely loving it at first it felt like a thankless role but she really comes to play in the second half i thought,2023-07-21 04:17:15
jason clarke plays a great weasel so it was even more satisfying to watch his character get completely dismantled pugh didn’t get much in this movie but blunt got that excellent scene along with the last hour of the movie,2023-07-21 15:46:10
one of the reviews said her character didn’t amount to much but i feel like this scene was one of the best payoffs of the movie,2023-07-21 16:45:11
i liked it too she had mostly been shown as an emotional  all movie and then eviscerated that man and completely redeemed her character in that scene and the remainder of the film i like that she didnt shake hands at the end either,2023-07-21 22:54:10
emily blunt is the textbook example of how to play a bad  a quiet place edge of tomorrow esc the lady can act,2023-07-21 09:30:47
i think this is the best scene in the movie,2023-07-21 14:39:13
the whole time i was wondering why they needed emily for this role until that scene,2023-07-23 09:15:46
that’s when i knew she deserved the oscar nomination,2023-07-21 12:33:12
she has easily become one of my favorites actors of the past couple years  and she married big tuna,2023-07-22 10:26:42
shame it was the only scene in the whole movie where a female character had something interesting to do or say,2023-07-21 10:00:53
i couldnt help but think yep thats probably going to get her a best supporting actress nomination when that scene played she was fantastic in it,2023-07-24 23:47:20
i loved the way she schooled him and the confidence oppenheimer had in her,2023-07-27 06:51:04
16 17 18,2023-07-26 01:01:14
facts she’s the goat,2023-07-22 03:38:07
i feel it could have done it even more,2023-07-25 17:38:49
with all the connections each character had with each other oh yeah oppys best friend is this extremely famous scientist who is the brother of this other famous scientist who was roommates with this senator who used to wait tables with this other extremely famous scientist i was half expecting robb to be one of kittys exhusbands and thats why he was assigned to the hearing,2023-07-26 04:45:18
one of the best scenes in the whole thing tbh every other scene she was in felt pretty standard but that was the one sequence where she really shined,2023-09-04 05:26:58
though i dont like if movies feel the need to tell me how to feel about a scene,2023-07-21 16:18:51
why was she  at the other dude,2023-07-22 08:22:55
i didn’t realize that was emily blunt until afterwards and i really didn’t like her portrayal of kitty for some reason i’m not quite sure why,2023-07-22 08:14:16
eh i didn’t like it particularly i don’t think it achieved its aim maybe that’s how exactly it happened they have the transcripts but i don’t think they really did a great job of making us give an ounce of  about her character,2023-07-22 07:10:02
seemed really shoehorned in there,2023-07-21 12:17:12
by far her best scene in the movie i was worried she wasn’t getting enough screen time in,2023-07-26 01:59:08
fucck robb i hate that guy,2023-08-24 17:16:53
and by being damning it was even more humanizing in the best and most complex way awesome stuff it feels reductive to even categorize this as biopic but as biopics go this already has to be one of the most compelling smart and sensitive,2023-07-22 03:38:54
 i like her character a lot more after reading your comment i felt like she didn’t get to be much of a character compared to someone like janet armstrong in first man but i like your read on her thank you so much,2023-07-23 12:16:24
this is a fantastic point and i have no idea why people all over tiktok etc are complaining that the women are one dimensional like what,2023-07-27 01:21:50
idk i was expecting the film to be more damning based on all the reddit comments i found it to be very sympathetic towards him almost to the point of glorifying him which i wouldn’t be surprised is the main takeaway of most audiences ie not versed in media literacy,2023-07-29 21:17:47
reminded me of when the boom hit everyone at the trinity test the delay of being in the moment and having the realization of reality hitting you and boom,2023-07-22 00:19:50
my movie theater went silent it was noticeable it was silent before but people were moving in their seat eating popcorndrinking and it felt like time stopped for that minute really weird and amazing feeling at the same time,2023-07-21 13:22:08
i had visited the peace museum at hiroshima with this scene alone i can understand if japan decided not to approve the movie to be showed on cinema its so sad on how ones celebratory was anothers catastrophe,2023-07-26 14:43:00
probably my favorite scene such an odd sensation,2023-07-22 04:27:48
i had a woman next to me start crying and the guy next me just white knuckling his hands together overall very tense and emotional,2023-07-24 01:31:11
i got chills from it very surreal perspectives change over time,2023-07-24 06:27:31
"they solved the problem of their day its up to us to solve the problems of our day and nolan is painting huge neon signs about those in his last 2 movies

climate change and nuclear weapons are two things that we have to act on today or we will lose a lot",2023-08-04 06:01:24
totally out of body feeling,2023-07-22 05:16:16
i think i had an anxiety attack along with the slow riser before they push the button,2023-07-27 00:25:09
there’s a scene in barry that resembles this scene very closely talking about the first time he killed someone and soldiers were cheering instead of being sad,2023-08-05 21:44:50
yeah it was chilling but also a really cool out of body experience where i could almost feel what those scientists felt back then i was thinking to myself watching that scene that this is probably the closest we may ever get to seeing and experiencing what it would have been like at the bomb test to see how people who were at a moment 80 years ago may have reacted is an interesting part of history that i have never really experienced before and then the celebrations afterwards i honestly felt somewhat relieved too like i was glad on the scientists behalf that all this hard work they were putting in came to fruition even if they had just designed a nuclear bomb i guess what im trying to say is its pretty cool to be able to experience the past like another bystander at the bomb test through a movie,2023-07-29 06:09:53
i was proud sad it’ll be used to  innocent people but the japanese need only blame their government for not heading our warning,2023-07-25 03:31:26
that may have been the most accurate part of the movie though very few americans had any reservations,2023-08-12 14:48:34

"nolan has such a weird relationship with nuance and exposition he is often a filmmaker of incredible subtlety and aproaching subjects with delicate nuance but just as often he seems to distrust his audiences intelligence and drowns his scripts in exposition overexplaining concepts and motivations or hit you in the face with the most onthenose get it scenes possible

this film thankfully spent most of its time doing the former but that jfk shoutout was a weird drift into the wrong direction",2023-07-21 12:12:24

ill take that over the  initiative tease from the kings man,2023-07-21 09:09:53
the conspiracy i took from it is that strauss orchestrated oppenheimer’s downfall through other people to distance himself from it and that when he lost the nomination when it came to light he later went on to orchestrate the kennedy assassination through intermediaries just as he did with oppenheimer,2023-07-23 04:58:39

i watched it with a friend who said afterwards that the heavy jfk reveal felt more like a subtle implication that strauss orchestrated his  out of revenge,2023-07-22 02:36:56
it also doesnt make sense strausss nomination vote was in 1959 and hed been working in government for decades he definitely would have known who kennedy was,2023-07-23 08:32:16

obviously nolan believes struss was involved in the jfk assassination as revenge for voting against him ,2023-07-23 01:28:00
it was kind of funny the writing style of this i saw shadows of the dark knight and inception it had this epic superhero quality but it was a historical account it did make jfk seem like a foreshadowed superhero,2023-07-27 00:24:34
because jfk shows up in the end credit scene,2023-07-22 12:21:13

because nolan peaked at the batman movies and he knows it,2023-07-22 00:32:51
jfk gave him the fermi award but i agree felt weird,2023-07-21 12:47:23
i find it’s more similar to the robin reveal in rises,2023-07-22 03:18:31
old habits die hard,2023-07-23 06:59:44
setup for the cuban missile crisis sequel,2023-07-23 08:41:32
oppenheimer ii bigger boom boom,2023-07-23 19:55:53
"lol 

that’s what i thought too it would be fitting for nolan to have a sequel for this film but about jfk",2023-07-24 03:38:30
reminder me of the “robin” name drop,2023-07-24 05:17:48
 yeah,2023-07-24 23:58:29
maybe he is a bit of a jfk fan i feel he is overrated,2023-07-25 17:36:10
because he knew everyone would be all ,2023-08-03 04:08:46
aww it with a bunch of boomers in ma theater  erupted when he said that,2023-08-13 22:44:04
do you wanna know how i got these scars,2023-08-14 09:52:31
because strauss had jfk killed obviously,2023-08-21 12:45:36
i didnt even know he was a senator from massachussets and i immediately thought of him when they talked about a young politician trying to make a name for himself,2023-12-09 14:06:06
just watched it in theaters and someone clapped when they said his name,2024-01-27 05:39:59
idk about anyone else i absolutely love damon but i tend to always have trouble separating his characters from him like every time hes in any scene in any movie by brain wont stop saying hey look its matt damon lol  like hes a meme created by nature,2023-07-21 04:02:52
damon is so great and he usually is it’s amazing how good everyone else was that damon is taken for granted truth be told i’m amazed that he didn’t even come up in my discussion with my friends on the way out,2023-07-21 07:12:53
damon was on point… i just think his “really great” performance is gonna get lost amongst 23 “career defining” performances in this movie,2023-07-21 19:35:38
"he did an incredible job but it was a hilarious example of upping the attractiveness for a movie

leslie groves…did not look like that in any number of ways",2023-07-21 12:20:20
"i also hadnt heard him discussed so i assumed his role was a bit overshadowed after watching it i think he was one of my favorite characters 

strong direct focused honest and kept his word also after his interrogation when he was leaving the room oppenheimer looked the most emotional from his responses there is also that brief scene before the test where he jokes around with oppenheimer there was more depth shown here than the normal jarhead army guy we see",2023-07-21 23:10:05
matt damon has done his share of phoned in movies but he’s an incredibly good actor when he’s on  and he’s always best when he plays assholes and villains imo,2023-07-21 19:54:45
man i really wish matt damon and casey affleck shared a scenelike come on lol,2023-07-21 08:05:05
yeah he was great his role wasnt sad but he plays that general marvelously i liked his performance more than rdjs to be honest because it was a more complex role imo,2023-07-21 08:44:54
"for one of the biggest stars in the film his performance as leslie groves was great to watch
i initially expect him to play him as the typical no nonsense authority figure trope but i was pleasantly surprised how leslie even with his abrasive and brusque attitude he respects oppenheimer and the scientists’ efforts while giving them the resources needed 

another thing i like to add it’s always good and a joy to see matt damon in this continuing trend of playing a character that has to keep the character actor in check all while dealing with a european competitor",2023-07-21 17:45:14
" haven’t seen anyone talk about matt damon yet

damon was right its the best movie hes ever been in 

id also argue that its one of downeys best performances too",2023-07-22 05:11:35
he brought a much needed wholesomeness to the film,2023-07-21 09:24:28
i actually had a real hard time with matt damon in this film his presence as matt damon like he couldnt shake it off and act kept taking me out of the film and i kept thinking about matt damon in those scenes instead of the film i wish someone else had been cast overall i enjoyed the film but not one of nolans best,2023-07-22 02:34:28
dude was great not as corny as the trailer at all i felt the movie actually started when he walked on screen everything before that was borderline cringe and goofy,2023-07-21 07:59:21
same i think damon did amazing job and really escaped from being just him playing some other dude,2023-07-21 06:40:08
"ok i don’t know if it was just me but every time damon came on screen i was cracking up i think he was playing it up just screaming every time playing the stereotypical general but seemingly much like the man there was more to him and maybe all the yell and bluster was an act he was actually very effective when he was being

i felt kind of bad laughing so loud cause no one else was it reminded me of “vince it’s for the kids ” or his freak out in 30 rock when the plane is delayed and he’s playing the pilot",2023-07-21 13:14:01
he played a similar role to his other movies but it worked well here as he was well utilized,2023-07-21 19:09:15
i agree from the trailer i thought hed be kinda mid at best but he was actually really good,2023-07-21 21:15:45
matt damons delivery of i said allegedly was the best quip joke since there must be some sort of double standard for this in the french dispatch,2023-07-23 20:43:57
 were you  doing in chicago,2023-07-23 07:19:52
his brief line from the trailer about it being the most important thing in the history of the earth came off a lot better in the context of the scene  he’s being shown as a somewhat over the top guy and it’s followed by oppenheimer shrugging it off  i know that part of the trailer drew some criticism initially,2023-07-26 02:54:37
i thought damon was greet  however groves was a 250lbs 6”3’ man  damon was not that towering of a figure that groves was,2023-07-23 14:00:36
his scene when talking to jason clarke was great although it’s true other actors get more chance to shine than him,2023-07-22 05:16:26
i was nervous about his performance because it always feels like hes not playing the character hes playing himself however i think he did a fantastic job here,2023-07-22 19:53:08
maaaaaatttt daaaaaaaamooonn,2023-07-22 23:09:13
why wasnt he in uniform during the hearing,2023-07-25 13:31:06
from the trailer i thought hed be the only character to take me out of the movie i was wrong he did a great job,2023-07-26 03:29:03
i kept thinking that while matt damon was in the us working on the manhatton project matt damon was getting saved by tom hanks in france,2023-08-05 05:37:34
i was going to say i think everybody in this thread of going oh  i forgot about  preformence in this movie,2023-07-23 02:36:49
i agree rdj was fine for his part but nothing special acting wise his character was good for sure,2023-07-21 04:14:31
 i thought the line about the this is most important thing that ever happened was overacted a bit still great sound bite though,2023-07-23 16:31:09
hes often had roles where you know its matt damon but he really transformed into general groves that was a joy to watch and he handled the suspense of getting grilled over the clearance perfectly,2023-07-26 16:09:03
"the part where oppenheimer says he was intelligent because he went to mit my reaction
",2023-07-27 02:47:02
matt damon as jesse plemons playing leslie groves,2023-08-11 03:36:04
he was easily the best supporting performance imo,2023-08-12 05:33:25
brilliant ending,2023-07-22 07:10:11
whenever people say that the nuking of japan was justified because it arguably saved more lives than it caused if an invasion would have happened otherwise it always strikes me that they never consider how it increased the chance of all of humanity burning,2023-07-22 09:40:31
so simple so effective also love the disjointed nature of some of the scenes he showed einstein the drawing of the fallout after that meeting even though it was presented way before it it’s like a puzzle that all came together at the end,2023-07-23 03:04:06
what did oppie say to einstein,2023-07-21 12:01:30
"i’ve read several comments about the ending lines and i don’t know how that wasn’t the conclusion everyone had already made by the end i felt like i said the words right along with oppenheimer he opened pandora’s box

for me i thought the timing couldn’t be better with this last year and the fears of russia using nukes",2023-08-01 04:06:02
can somebody posts the dialogues or post a link please,2023-07-23 17:15:40
is chain reaction a metaphor for something,2023-07-22 11:45:03
yeah in the first act especially i couldn’t help thinking  the pacing is just ripping along for a 3 hour story,2023-07-22 21:18:26
so well said that first hour or so felt like the most chaotic of nolan’s career so many cuts so many 3090 second scenes no prolonged dialogues it just kept moving flying frankly,2023-07-29 01:38:52
i’m not joking when i say jennifer lame deserves an oscar for cutting this movie just incredible breathtaking editing work,2023-08-14 11:31:05
it really did feel like a tiny physical workout  nuking calories away,2023-08-18 01:34:28
that’s when i knew she had my vote for the oscar nomination i mean everyone just acted their assess off,2023-07-21 15:42:49
blunt carried her own weight in this movie when she was frustrated about oppenheimers naivete i felt that to my bone despite being an alcoholic her nose was razor sharp on the ,2023-07-22 01:31:09
i think a lot can be said about women in movies oftentimes their influence is judged by how much they say blunt’s character is heartbreaking in what’s not said she and oppenheimer never have the big blowout fight where all is laid bare bc 1 it didn’t happen in real life and 2 it was a wildly different world at the time but her presence is so strong in every scene she’s in,2023-07-22 23:36:08
i hope i didn’t imagine it but i thought i heard the sound of horse hooves in the moment between her maybe breaking down and then perking back up and standing her ground if i didn’t imagine it then it was a very cool sound choice and evoked that memory of when her and oppenheimer first got together and the foundation of their partnership,2023-07-23 01:04:39
im a week late here but there was a scene earlier in the movie where it shows the end of her interview and she drops her bag and a liquor container falls out i thought that was going to circle back but nothing really came of it,2023-07-28 02:49:24
i wish nolan hadnt punctuated that moment with a man verbally patting her on the back though that was literally the first scene in the movie where she did anything worthwhile,2023-07-21 08:38:42
blunt may have been the breakout for me i knew she was good but holy  she was amazing,2023-07-23 08:32:50
she is such a remarkable actress she makes so many simple choices to add special polish to her performances,2023-07-25 04:40:04
i found both female characters in the film to be the worst parts i don’t blame them though i blame nolan had you cut them out of the film completely it would have made almost zero difference to the plot the big thing is she didn’t shake the guys hand,2023-07-22 13:35:34
that was a perfect  you moment rami malek’s character coming in clutch at the senator’s hearing was fantastic,2023-07-24 03:58:15
that was one of the best moments revealing just how different the antagonist is from the protagonist,2023-07-21 15:05:55
i knew theyd use einstein for a big blow and not over use him,2023-07-23 04:41:49
probably takes over as my favorite of his films although it will be one of my least rewatched because yeesh,2023-07-25 04:41:18
einstein will return,2023-07-24 18:27:02
nolan’s best,2023-07-22 02:51:55
yes it’s ambiguous,2023-07-21 03:06:24
there are theories that she may have been murdered possibly by intelligence etc the movie makes it ambiguous,2023-07-21 09:19:02
to this day there are still questions about her death drowning oneself in a bathtub is a very unique way to go and because of her connections to oppenheimer and the communist party theories mention  rather than suicide,2023-07-21 13:27:27
yes it was suspected she was murdered,2023-07-21 02:58:12
yeah it was implied along with unsigned suicide note,2023-07-21 11:14:26
i think it was implied that the other army guy not matt damon had it done when he was investigating oppenheimer,2023-07-21 09:40:31
id so say the drowning being  while suspected could also be an allusion to how oppy felt he was the one that killed her by leaving,2023-07-22 18:43:51
i thought this was to be oppenheimer believing he caused her death and the hands were to represent his hands,2023-07-21 23:53:22
"every scene show how she killed hersf by drowning her head inside the bath tub

but i swear there’s 1 quick shot that show a hand with black gloves killing her",2023-07-22 12:09:04
thank you i noticed that too,2023-07-21 06:32:48
"dont put a space between the  in the first spoiler tag and the first letter

ie a",2023-07-21 07:39:59
the flower bit was pretty funny,2023-07-22 11:22:35
i get that its ambiguous historically but there is some element of oppenheimers imagination mixing in with reality throughout the film the hand killing her could be anyone or no one or  even him somehow,2023-07-25 04:36:55
have you seen jfk by oliver stone i think its pretty apparent watching oppenheimer that nolan is a big fan of that film because this borrows a lot from its editing cinematography and pacing style,2023-07-23 17:14:18
i knew i wasnt imagining the other hand,2023-07-23 08:44:31
it’s missing a sense of stone completing making  up,2023-07-23 23:40:06
i took that shot to be oppenheimer considering himself responsible as though he had murdered her himself by leaving,2023-07-25 06:14:17
yes that’s oppenheimer’s paranoia making him see thingsimagine things because he done ,2023-07-21 23:15:26
nixon is such an underrated film,2023-07-23 02:33:43
i took that shot to be oppenheimer considering himself responsible as though he had murdered her himself by leaving,2023-07-25 06:16:25
maybe a little too deep but i thought it was a metaphor he was imagining his own hands drowning her because it was his own actions that put her there,2023-07-28 08:06:30
i took it as emily blunt’s character picturing herself murdering her since we saw earlier that she pictures them having ,2023-07-27 07:05:49
ok so i was actually kind of confused because after that doesnt she show to testify and i dont mean the obviously imaginary  scene i thought i had understood something wrong and she had merely attempted suicide,2023-07-22 06:48:14
yeah it certainly looked in one scene where a gloved hand was leaving the frame,2023-07-22 09:57:11
yes came here looking for this i knew i saw a black glove for a second definitely implying that maybe she didnt  herself,2023-07-23 18:39:20
nixon is one of my favorite films and yes this reminded me a lot of nixion,2023-07-24 01:26:09
yeah i thought the same was ambiguous about her death,2023-07-24 11:09:00
glad i didnt imagine that,2023-07-24 12:51:19
yes i saw that basically we’ll never know if she was killed or not ,2023-07-24 22:54:23
yeah the film is like a cross between jfknixon and deniros the good shepard in a good way,2023-07-24 23:13:36
spoiler tag didnt work,2023-07-29 22:22:26
i just watched for the first time today and definitely saw a hand behind her head holding it under water,2023-11-19 05:10:14
i didn’t know half the cast was gonna be in it i went to a private screening with only some friends wednesday night and i swear every time someone showed up i’d just say “oh dane dehaan’s in this oh josh peck’s in this oh rodrick heffley’s in this”,2023-07-21 03:56:17
drake wheres the uranium,2023-07-25 23:22:31
"above all sharing the screen with cillian at one of the most crucial moments of the film props to him i thought he was going to be predominately featured in the background 

then again i feel like just about everyone got some scene to shine in even if it was brief",2023-07-22 06:20:04
laughed in the theater was so random like an snl skit,2023-07-21 05:28:48
my man josh peck  hits the big red button,2023-07-23 04:05:05
couldnt trust drake in the role he would have forgotten to cut the door hole in the abomb,2023-07-22 23:45:27
“push the button josh”,2023-07-24 00:12:35
"oppenheimer wheres the abort button

goes right there see i drew it with the magic marker

you were supposed to put it there so i could abort the explosion

dude im gonna

oh really so go place the abort button

t minus 10 seconds

i see the problem

oh do ya",2023-08-04 18:43:20
i’m sad he couldn’t call the demon core spherical “its spherical”,2023-07-26 05:19:14
and sean avery very surprising little cameo there,2023-07-22 08:13:34
and he got to press the big red button,2023-07-23 02:28:52
i had to stop myself from audibly saying is that josh  peck about to hit the button,2023-07-23 03:16:19
this threw me off a little bit lol,2023-07-23 07:09:31
seeing josh hartnett was a delight for me i hadn’t seen him act in anything since sin city,2023-07-24 03:41:22
they do say it’s gonna take some time to realise,2023-07-23 21:07:28
isn’t he a red pill  bro now,2023-07-29 21:33:24
from a young teenage boy getting bullied by his sister to the man to dropped the bomb at atomic bomb test,2023-08-21 12:48:25
he was terrible,2023-07-22 20:38:15
i can’t believe robe set off the nuke,2023-07-27 03:04:43
great ending,2023-07-21 16:37:39
music swells,2023-07-21 02:48:35
good moment though i guess he didn’t predict mad would become a thing which i don’t blame it is quite a mad doctrine,2023-07-21 03:46:22
the emotions felt during that final scene the man was haunted by what he had accomplished amazing cinema,2023-07-22 14:37:46
the shots of the giant…something’s were so puzzling until the final reveal and you see that it’s a line of nuclear weapons that made me trips balls,2023-07-21 07:07:19
"i just knew einstein would have a small but great impact on the film

id love to see the full conversation from the script",2023-07-23 02:09:28
barbie and oppenheimer win for best closing lines of the year,2023-07-23 03:18:07
incredible scene by the end i was ready to do the avenger’s meme reaction when they revealed the final einstein conversion,2023-07-21 05:13:42
my one little gripe there is that i would have preferred it is they panned to the rain falling on the lake and creating all of those little ripplesdetonations that they used earlier on,2023-07-22 04:31:46
is that what he said to einstein at the end i couldn’t make it out i thought he said i believe we’re dead,2023-07-21 13:46:55
so fkn good,2023-07-22 03:19:49
he regert ,2023-07-25 20:14:47
can you explain the last scene i still kinda confused about it,2023-07-21 09:01:39
and that man was albert einstein,2023-08-17 06:43:28
man that random scream while the clapping faded i thought i imagined that that was  haunting,2023-07-21 06:40:38
the sudden scream was it a scream really shooked me,2023-07-21 04:11:45
the vfx reminded me a lot of what nolan used with scarecrow funny enough,2023-07-21 03:17:58
love how it is it also follows the logic of how the bomb works in that the visuals are the first thing u see followed by the deafening sound like earlier in the trinity test,2023-07-21 19:09:50
i liked how unambiguously nolan stated yes what they did was terrible celebrating it is terrible and blood is on everyone’s hands,2023-07-22 11:04:56
it was staggering filmmaking,2023-07-21 03:36:29
i like how the cheers slowly become less distinguished and start to sound like the wails of the damned,2023-07-21 09:02:14
"the part of that scene where you could hear absolutely every minor detail and sound except the clapping and cheering was so abstract and offputting never seen anything like it 

really helped sell the mind implosion oppenheimer was experiencing at that moment ive never seen disassociation done so well in a film before",2023-07-23 15:15:12
the one dude emphatically clapping and smiling was insanely creepy,2023-07-22 01:23:20
i was thinking it kinda seemed like the people in  the background all blurred out had horribly disfigured distorted faces very subtle but absolutely added to the horror of the scene,2023-07-21 07:47:25
my fav part nothing like seeing the horrors you’ve created like stepping into a charred husk of what was once s person  broke my heart it was staged like a small town beatles concert and just  man that made me feel so gross,2023-07-22 07:45:47
absolute highlight of the movie for me,2023-07-21 15:35:27
bro the woman sitting next to me clapped in this bit,2023-07-21 19:14:47
and there’s a point as he’s walking away where you’re not sure if you’re hearing the cheers of los alamos or the screams of hiroshima  as much as i’ve maligned the sound mixing of nolan films ever watch batman begins on tv i was very impressed by that,2023-07-23 04:13:55
if this doesn’t win sound mixingediting then the oscar’s are on crack,2023-07-24 01:39:54
"i was waiting for the movie to show the bomb actually dropping in japan and burning people alive

im glad we got this instead what a scene",2023-07-22 09:05:08
when the sound finally came back i jumped so high in my seat lol,2023-07-21 19:43:02
that scene  that scene,2023-07-22 05:06:30
the isolated sound of the woman screaming gave me chills,2023-07-23 01:09:04
that was the best scene in the movie and honestly if it had ended right there i would have been ok personally i felt the last 30 minutes afterwards covered things that had way less stakes than that scene he could lose his clearance or be dragged through the mud professionally but his realization he created death is infinitely worse that was his own reality nuke,2023-07-23 12:04:51
this was the highlight of the movie for me honestly got me back into it,2023-07-22 04:23:17
especially when his foot gets stuck in the corpse it’s haunting,2023-07-22 08:15:17
my favorite part of the movie,2023-07-22 04:03:18
lynchian,2023-07-22 01:04:01
"highly highly recommend watching the hbo miniseries chernobyl it deals with the same sort of ideas personal responsibility for horrors an uncaring system eating people up and the almost biblical terror of nuclear power but in my opinion the way that they portray the effects of radiation on the people who work the disaster and such is so much more haunting and staying than what was portrayed here 

the most chilling image in my mind is a scene where one of the scientists working at the plant is sent by his incompetent uncaring supervisor to visually inspect the melted down core every man under his command knows that this is tantamount to a death sentence but so is defying him so he goes up to the roof of the command building slowly approaches the edge and looks down to the core 

its just this unholy mass of wires and twisted metal with a yellowgreen glow and a fire that is unlike anything on this earth it feels purely malevolent in the way that only uncontrollable natural phenomena do 

and then it cuts back to the workers face 

the despair on his face the unspoken symptoms of a lethal dose of radiation showing on his faceit says so much with such small and specific brush strokes i just think its a masterpiece",2023-07-23 05:00:03
why the  was there a basketball hoop on the fireplace how the  does that work,2023-07-22 23:17:27
it was amazing i kinda wish it had a bit more trauma post bombing for him but that probably would have made it a 35hr movie,2023-07-24 03:15:17
aronofsky vibes,2023-07-25 03:26:12
i was trying so hard not to cry during that scene preparing myself to see the aftermath of the bomb depicted by the film it doesn’t show it but we get a few glimpses and i almost lost it,2023-07-25 03:27:08
agree left a great impression on me,2023-07-22 11:45:47
and then accidentally standing in the charred body of a victim of the bombings,2023-07-24 10:14:09
stepping in the ashen corpse was also haunting,2023-07-24 05:59:12
if you told me david lynch was asked to direct that one scene i would’ve believed you without a doubt,2023-07-26 02:36:00
it seemed like a psilocybin experience,2023-07-26 02:54:15
of course rodrick was the one puking from alcohol poisoning,2023-07-29 05:04:31
my heart sank seeing that corpse turned to ashes that he stepped on,2023-07-24 07:02:58
i thought it intentionally imitated footage of ’s speeches,2023-07-30 16:10:41
that and the trinity test itself were probably my favorite bits,2023-07-30 23:32:18
i liked this film but didnt love it that being said this scene was one of the best things ive seen in a long time,2023-08-07 03:53:38
i cried in 2 parts the ending scene with einstein and this one so much of it was the music the sound design carried so much of this film,2023-08-28 14:09:26
such great visuals and how the whole thing is set up where oppenheimers eyes betrays the empty words he was spouting off  oof brilliant give cillian all the awards now,2023-11-15 08:07:43
im so happy that the unsettling feeling i had because more than a 100000 people were just killed and now everybody is happy and cheering was by intent,2023-07-24 12:45:12
i had to leave the theaters watching that scene lol i was high asf couldn’t handle it anymore,2023-07-22 12:17:06
movie didnt need to run for another hour after that,2023-07-21 16:19:22
i wish the film ended at that scene it would’ve felt way more impactful in my opinion i didn’t really understand why the third act was necessary note i am an average movie goer not a history buff,2023-07-21 15:53:15
missed chance to show horrified and disfigured victims of the bombings wandering and screaming to juxtapose the american cheers,2023-07-25 04:19:41
"they had one burnt corpse in that scene  in the whole movie such wasted potential nolan had the opportunity to be so creative here but just alternated between white people crying and screaming

one of many instances in this movie where nolan could have done something truly bold and impactful and went the easy more palatable route

edited for typo and to add that people seem to think that acknowledging the japanese victims in any form means that there had to be gorey afterbomb imagery 

but i agree that any creative subtleties like the shadow of a crying japanese woman or a singed kimono would probably have been beyond nolan",2023-07-22 00:31:49
"it was well done fits with the character of the man 

but man the concept that we should be more concerned about jingoism in todays america than the alternative oikophobia is just so so off the mark",2023-07-22 00:31:26
i wonder if he was religious,2023-07-26 14:44:31
i think it was like to show us what if we have been in the receiving end of the bomb,2023-07-27 20:35:47
stepping through the husk of a burnt human was insane,2023-08-01 16:15:48
how he stepped in that burnt corpse… chills,2023-08-20 23:42:24
a beautifully haunting and somber scene i got teary eyed after he took that “one step” i can only imagine the horror of being in those cities after the detonation this scene will stick with me for a while,2023-09-29 04:23:14
i was surprised he still stuck up for oppie after getting his communist advances spurned earlier lol,2023-07-22 08:00:45
i was surprised by gary oldman though it was 5 min but he made his presence felt,2023-07-21 14:36:18
he blew the doors off with his courtroom scene,2023-07-24 00:52:02
his scenes were really subtle but good i must say,2023-07-24 19:05:38
this was me with virtually everyone besides the core cast like every time someone new came on screen i was like hey thats gary oldman hey thats matthew modine hey thats josh peck hey thats tony goldwyn incredibly star studded,2023-07-24 23:37:02
this was me every other scene this cast is bananas nolan decided wes anderson needed to be put in his place,2023-07-25 04:43:02
"i thought he wasnt gonna speak but im glad he got an important scene eventually 

i was so surprised to see rodrick heffley and i knew dane dehaan was gonna be in it but it took me a while to recognize him dude disappeared into the role as for josh peck i kept debating whether it was actually him or nah",2023-08-09 11:31:39
"the music was my favorite part of the movie and everything else about the movie was so  perfect

amazing job from ludwig",2023-07-21 22:13:49
the geiger counter sounds incorporated into the score were so chilling and cool,2023-07-22 14:53:29
ludwig has come such a long way since community and new girl the best in the biz,2023-07-22 09:03:39
listened to “can you hear the music” after the movie at home i was tearing up the soundtrack was amazing,2023-07-21 21:33:07
some parts reminded me of jonny greenwood’s from twbb which is prob the last masterpiece i saw before this one i guess triangle of sadness and sicario are there too,2023-07-22 02:43:22
100 agreed  i made a note to myself to look out in the credits for who composed the score and as soon as i spotted his name all i could think of was redbone with childish gambino which he helped produce guys got range and talent overflowing,2023-07-22 15:53:10
"i agree eerie score but i felt the score was overused at times when only dialogue or diegetic sound would have had a bigger impact on scenes 
there were scenes without the score like in the interrogation room and felt that silence was needed more for emotional impact",2023-07-24 02:20:36
the score was  awesome really kept the film moving,2023-07-22 07:13:02
for me those have been my two favorite composers since 2017ish ludwig is quickly reaching legend status among others such as zimmer john williams howard shore and others,2023-07-22 22:58:30
it was an amazing score but lacked a definitive memorable theme or texture i would have loved to hear jonny greenwoods take on this film,2023-07-23 01:40:06
i liked the music i just felt it was too loud i couldn’t hear what many people were saying,2023-07-24 22:59:31
the strings in the score were phenomenal,2023-07-22 10:19:55
"i would be curious to know how goransson sees the music fitting into the film because i dont think hes comparable to zimmer in many ways like walking out of a movie scored by zimmer you have at least one if not multiple tunes you could sing to yourself im not a savant or anything but for eg after interstellar i was easily able to get to a piano and pluck out and harmonize the main theme thats how deep it sunk in over the course of the movie 

not so with tenet and oppenhiemer some really cool sounds and vibes the acid synth with the heavy lfo in this one was sick and the obligatory 8 french horn brown note but nothing to really bring home with you maybe thats ok but in my mind a noticeable choice",2023-07-21 21:42:02
best part of black panther 2,2023-07-22 20:02:25
this movie was over scored and bordered on annoying,2023-07-23 22:59:16
the music was amazing,2023-07-22 19:54:46
wow i thought it was hans zimmer while watching that’s impressive,2023-07-23 02:48:34
i thought it was zimmer at first until i looked him up he did a great job really interesting use of what sounded like accordion which worked really well to creat a very dramatic somber tone,2023-07-23 07:32:54
wasnt there geiger clicking in the score loved that,2023-07-29 22:20:37
him and ramin djawadi are the heirs to zimmer and williams,2023-07-31 21:54:06
every time i love a score i look it up and he’s the composer,2023-07-22 19:35:29
i kinda dig his work with nolan more than i did zimmer’s collabs don’t get me wrong hans’ body of work is pretty iconic but it kinda turned into a generic wall of sound for me göransson uses such a diverse soundscape and i think it compliments nolan’s style and subject matter more,2023-07-25 00:23:23
i could’ve sworn this was a zimmer score,2023-07-22 14:02:14
the credits music was spectacular i can’t stop listening to the violin,2023-07-24 01:30:33
according to imdb he didnt orchestrate it it was thomas kotcheff and abraham libbos who did the orchestrations,2023-07-26 08:52:06
unbelievable work the score was overwhelming but not distracting or in the way absolutely perfect i don’t even have the words to describe it i was on an emotional knifes edge almost the entire movie worked so perfectly with nolans visuals,2023-08-13 05:23:37
been rewatching community and listening to childish gambinos early work lately and its crazy to me where ludwig is now his score on this is probably the best one ive heard in years and to think this is all because zimmer is busy doing dune i hope nolan and goransson keep collaborating,2023-12-04 01:58:35
that had to be the most scored film of all time and coincidentally one of the best scored films of all time,2023-07-22 22:50:36
absolutely i sat there thinking the score made this movie an incredible experience,2023-07-23 05:00:56
i can’t believe i had to scroll down this far to see this without the score it would play like a by the numbers bbc procedural with adhd with the score it’s a fast paced and gripping thriller ,2024-03-27 12:15:34
has nolan said why he didnt use zimmer for the score i was surprised,2023-07-23 22:37:00
didn’t look it up prior but during the movie i assumed hans zimmer composed it,2023-07-25 07:14:53
ahh i was wondering if it was him or zimmer when watching i think zimmer still hits harder but this guy did a great job with tenet as well,2023-07-27 05:13:26
did the synth theme remind anyone else of the score at the end of hereditary,2023-07-28 14:39:14
towards the middle when they were putting together the bomb for testing there was a drilling kind of sound constantly in the background i thought that was from outside my theatre pretty cool,2023-08-09 11:27:33
legit i think he probably already has the portfolio and accolades to claim that status but the mad lad accomplished it all in such a short time frame that just intuitively it still feels to early to grant him legendgoatetc status,2023-08-30 21:37:53
all the bombs tested after the trinity test were significantly more powerful  the first link you posted is set off on or under water so you get a massive outward plume of just pure water vapor  also the fireball its self only lasts seconds onlookers regardless of eye protection would be slightly blinded so the remaining mushroom cloud would probably be quite hard to see in that dark early morning light,2023-07-21 06:53:05
"heres some footage of the actual trinity test

the film depicted it quite accurately and it was dark which really obscures its scale perhaps because i was watching in the cropped 70mm format albeit from 3rd row but i was also a bit underwhelmed and while there were some visually stunning shots most were extremely quick flashes i dont think enough to warrant a full 70mm imax screening",2023-07-21 23:54:56
only about 15 of the 239 pu actually went off during the actual test,2023-07-21 23:33:18
it felt tiny to me maybe also because it was night and there were no reference points i really expected something jaw dropping but it was underwhelming,2023-07-23 22:01:39
"the scale totally threw me off too but i was really also expecting something more to the explosion considering the abstract “slomo” depictions that played in the first few minutes of the movie where you could feel the power of it

i was honestly a little underwhelmed",2023-07-21 18:20:58
if you compare the first two links one could say man this just looks way way way bigger than in the movie and then you see your last link and it is basically exacly how it is shown in the movieodd since the last link looks like a simple gassstation explosion perhaps because the environment is so dry the 2020 israel port explostion was more holy  that this,2023-07-23 00:21:15
"i was really underwhelmed by it even the explosion sound wasnt particularly powerful in my theater the bleachers were way louder

id love to see a fanedit of this movie that puts in lynchs trinity ",2023-07-21 08:18:45
trinity was a tiny tiny tiny explosion compared to later nuclear tests it was like a firecracker in the grand scheme of nuclear explosions,2023-07-24 11:10:37
i always wondered how the cameras filming the destruction survived the destruction,2023-08-12 14:55:06
when it was announced that jack quaid was playing feynman i couldnt wait to see how they would portray him and i was excited for what im sure would be some hilarious scenes with him turns out hes barely in the movie and whenever he was he was just in the background playing bongos which is more hilarious actually,2023-07-23 13:15:28
explain the bongos to me,2023-07-21 14:55:20
i like how the bongo playing was not great i think it was a slight nod to feymans larger than life personality and the likelihood that he probably wasnt all that great at playing them but did it anyway,2023-07-22 23:30:23
if you go on his wikipedia page amongst many scientific theories and breakthroughs in his known for section is “playing the bongos” lol,2023-07-24 00:40:49
i cant believe i didnt make the connection but i had also forgotten he was involved at all,2023-07-25 04:47:02
i cackled everytime i see feynman,2023-08-01 11:56:11
i think that was important because jean tatlock was oppenheimers most intimate connection to death and suffering and his own responsibility for inflicting pain on others so its significant that he read that quote in a scene with her,2023-07-21 03:30:16
im in the middle east right now and they put a cgi dress on pugh during those scenes it was kinda funny,2023-07-21 17:36:56
say the line,2023-07-21 05:00:04
"“i am become death”

inserts 

“destroyer of worlds”",2023-07-22 04:21:45
i expected nay was promised full frontal nudity dammit,2023-07-22 07:40:39
"honestly both of those  scenes felt like they were written by a kid  having him read that line while shes gyrating on him  

also them just casually sitting buttnaked across from each other in chairs after  just felt so out of place and unrealistic  seemed like he couldnt figure out any other way to imply to audiences that theyd just had ",2023-07-28 19:44:31
i did find her simply being  in almost every scene she was in a bit odd especially in a nolan film felt super strange,2023-07-21 15:29:33
i get why its there thematically but i didnt really like that being there felt a little corny with that being like the quote people know from oppenheimer i think it took some of the weight away from it in the context of the blast,2023-07-21 14:49:56
people keep overlooking how this is framed within the idea of freuds eros and thanatos they literally talk about freund and jung right before,2023-07-22 18:49:41
that first  scene was beyond the beyond of cringe christopher nolan and female characters are just a  awful combination,2023-07-21 14:28:44
that scene went hard asf,2023-07-22 01:39:28
"the next time i listen to linkin park’s a thousand suns not just their greatest album but one of the greatest albums period i’m going to be thinking of florence pugh’s rack during oppenheimer’s quote in the intro

not that that’s a bad thing",2023-07-23 04:20:45
i am death the destroyer of ,2023-07-22 19:15:13
i remember hearing something about how death and  are interconnected and not sure if that related to this destroyer of worlds stuff at all but the premise is that its the complete circle of life we all start from an act of  and we all end with death,2023-07-23 01:53:38
and about as gratuitous as the  scenes in titanic,2023-07-27 02:55:57
why were people meming it lol,2023-07-21 07:05:12
i don’t think it’s that funny anymore looking back at it after jean killed herself later,2023-07-21 15:56:15
fr lmaoo,2023-07-22 03:37:37
nolan heavily implied throughout the film that they would go to any lengths to keep the project going and the secret in tact matt damon talking about casey afflecks character in detail hints at this as well also they show how strauss and the fbi were definitely capable of monstrous things tossing in jfk at the end is great foreshadowing as well,2023-07-22 03:39:40
its the two opposing characters and their views on where the nuclear program should go oppenheimer was content with continuing work on fission projects and didnt want to escalate to fusion weapons strauss was all about working on fusion the whole point of the kangaroo court at the end was showing that oppenheimer was sabotaging the fusion program because of possible communist sympathies the numbering at the beginning was to set up this dynamic and indicate that these two men and their opposing views are what drive the tension at the end,2023-07-22 02:50:38
"fission is oppenheimer’s story by definition it’s when a neutron slams into a larger atom  which i took as being oppenheimer getting involved with the military and the manhattan project  

fusion by definition is a reaction between two or more atomic nuclei  i take that as oppenheimer is “battling” or “reacting” to rdj and co

honestly just my opinion though i’d love to hear from nolan why we labeled them like that",2023-07-22 02:49:11
the fission was the development of the a bomb it was mostly in color fusion was post a bomb hydrogen bomb times,2023-07-22 02:50:42
"i assumed fission was how the a bomb worked and fusion was how the h bomb worked thus suggesting the two time periods 

but honestly i have no idea",2023-07-22 02:41:12
no idea why they did that,2023-07-22 02:39:43
"damnit i must’ve missed it was it early on i just left the theater and i was waiting for “2 fusion” and it never came 

i’m awestruck anyway brilliant and so glad i have some closure on this at least i was the only missing thing for me",2023-07-26 04:43:50
ive seen people point out what it means but i still think its a fairly uselessvery tiny choice,2023-07-25 04:59:36
i really hated him roger robb which is a testament to how well jason clarke played the role,2023-07-22 20:32:18
jason clarke is a brilliant actor  he’s just so good in everything,2023-07-22 23:26:34
legit thought that was matthew perry the whole time lol,2023-07-22 21:11:02
i also thought alden ehrenreich also was great as the aide calling out strauss’s bs was great as well,2023-07-30 00:19:30
"yup

i felt physically attacked by his  cold cynical and relentless interrogation",2023-07-28 09:18:56
he was incredible i love him in so many other films he was a treat,2023-07-24 04:10:21
he’s really lucked out with his two best roles in his career coming back to back this and jerry west,2023-07-24 11:22:21
absolutely his performance is going under the radar,2023-07-22 20:27:29
i was looking for the comment about jason clark and i had to scroll down for a long time i think he was the second best supporting actor in the film and nobody mentioned him,2023-09-01 06:48:07
i absolutely agree i thought the scene where they interrogated her might have stolen the movie for me she had me on a rope florence pugh i thought did fantastic as well,2023-07-22 04:54:43
"i loved how he showed the bomb explosion in full silence 

the movie is loud very loud yet one of the biggest bombs man has ever created goes off pure silence",2023-07-21 03:22:49
"saw it last night at a 70mm promo screening

this scene was jawdroppingly beautiful",2023-07-21 03:49:36
"we knew the world would not be the samea few people laughed a few people cried most people were silent i remembered the line from the hindu scripture the bhagavad gita vishnu is trying to persuade the prince that he should do his duty and to impress him takes on his multiarmed form and says now i am become death the destroyer of worlds i suppose we all thought that one way or another

edit the video",2023-07-21 02:47:17
same here you could hear a pin drop might as well have been in the theater by myself,2023-07-21 02:43:15
this is why theaters need to stay around is experiences like this you cant get  like that at home,2023-07-22 06:03:40
i keep seeing people talking about the silence are you referring to the crowd or the fact the movie itself was silent,2023-07-21 03:52:10
nah some dumb teenager had his ringer on i almost strapped his  to the bomb when it dropped,2023-07-21 04:43:37
jealous of you in my screening people just started making jokes and talk in that  tense moment and it just threw me off so much ugh like haha did they forgot the sound lol or maybe its a silent mode ahahaha  that really ruined that moment for me,2023-07-21 08:19:08
it was dead quiet in my theater it was just a fantastic movie throughout,2023-07-22 06:13:50
someones phone went off during the silence ,2023-07-21 06:32:57
i remember the music being more intense as it got nearer until the detonation and i remember sweating my butt off,2023-07-22 04:34:59
i mentioned it in my review but for all the quiet scenes i could hear the muffled sound of the shutter for the projector obviously not the same thing as a dead silent scene but it was still dope,2023-07-21 03:14:55
just got back from a late showing and somehow someone in the theater fell asleep and was snoring boggled my mind gym scene explosion scene nothing would wake him up,2023-07-21 07:03:37
people behind me thought the silence was an invitation for a chitchat,2023-07-21 22:31:59
i  you not someone in my theater had an alarm on their phone go off at the exact second this happened and they couldn’t find their phone to turn it off for a full minute i’m still irate,2023-07-22 01:49:36
it makes sense scientifically right sound waves will take time to reach to the observers,2023-07-21 07:48:10
i knew nolan was gonna try and jump scare all of us with the explosion sound,2023-07-21 08:59:23
some idiot  his gf the row behind me laughed at this exact moment like they thought it was a plot device  not how the sound would actually travel ,2023-07-21 23:06:13
this is a trick hes used before in interstellar right theres a scene in that with a massive explosion in space but we see it from afar so in a complete silent void,2023-07-21 23:13:13
yup seeing it in imax 70mm packed crowd yet i swear i could’ve heard a pin drop it was dead silent,2023-07-22 14:49:27
unfortunately that moment for me will forever be haunted by the random ringtone of the dude in the cinema that ringed the exact second the silence happened,2023-07-25 21:25:39
told rian johnson to hold his beer “holdo maneuver nah i got this”,2023-07-23 00:54:24
there was a child probably 6 or 7 a few rows in front of me talking though the scene i was going to lose my ,2023-07-23 23:23:36
some jack wagon was either legit asleep or making a loud snoring noise during this  if it would have been near me i would have done something about it,2023-07-24 04:45:47
pretty underwhelmed tbh,2023-07-24 22:13:27
funny you had that experience in my theatre some guy was shouting boom at the screen,2023-08-05 14:47:36
i will never forget the guy on my rigth munching on pop corn during the whole film and heavily breathing the rare time he didnt,2023-07-21 13:06:01
same… you could hear a mouse ,2023-07-21 19:21:09
i was quite literally forced back into my seat when the sound of the explosion finally came in  almost like the shockwave radiating out from the blast and finally hitting you has to be one of the most impactful moments ive ever had in a cinema,2023-07-22 21:17:48
i on the other hand had someone behind me coughing up a lung and blowing his nose like a trumpet every time there was a quiet scene just like going to the symphony,2023-07-24 01:03:21
it brought me back to some of the scenes during interstellar just seeing people physically move to the edge of their seats only nolan can do this he creates such an experience pleasure to watch,2023-07-24 10:27:30
there were not one but two babies making noise during that scene in my theater definitely took me out of it never understood why people cant just get babysitters,2023-07-24 22:42:25
youre right i didnt realize it at the time because i was so engrossed but there was perfect silence not a cough not a shuffle everyone was frozen what an amazing experience,2023-07-25 02:12:19
there was a soyjack in my theater that went “aaaahhhhh” when the film went silent… like yeah super funny dude,2023-08-01 06:50:53
the lady in front of me started sobbing and moaning had everyone looking at her…,2023-07-21 09:19:36
as soon as the dead silence happened someone’s phone went off in my theatre and they didn’t turn it off until the explosion sound went off so ,2023-07-23 04:42:12
"im  with people clapping or laughing at great moments but the trinity test just had people so silent in the local theater i watched it was so bizzare

i guess it hits differently when it is everybodys reality now",2023-07-25 00:00:27
someone brought a baby into my theatre and it kind of diminished the effect unfortunately ,2023-07-25 00:25:35
it would have been incredible  unfortunately my imax experience had a 10 year old talking to his dad during it,2023-07-31 00:18:48
i’ll never forget the one person clapping after the final credits and then reading the room and quickly stopping,2023-08-04 05:03:17
youre lucky there was somebody a few seats down from me eating candy out of the worlds loudest crinkliest wrapper and another person up in front trying to add commentary to that scene it was a reminder of why ive come to prefer just watching new movies at home since the pandemic,2023-07-23 01:48:37
"my friend had the unfortunate timing of needing to sneeze right when all sound vanished

still an incredibly jawdropping scene but i had to try not to laugh with that moment",2023-07-21 04:40:14
stunning and brave,2023-07-21 13:38:07
was your theater super loud before that,2023-07-22 09:11:01
the awe and terror and anxiety i felt during this scene is going to stay with me for a long time actually teared up during it,2023-07-22 11:10:40
"my theater was so  quiet during that scene i could hear my heart practically beating out of my chest then for the aftershock to roll through

what a masterpiece",2023-07-22 21:05:59
just watched the movie and had the same exact thought never heard a movie so silent,2023-07-25 03:42:16
i hope you mean the explosion is something you won’t forget and not that silence is so rare where you go to see films it’s unforgettable,2023-07-25 18:10:56
this is why i was so dead set on seeing it this week because i knew in my city i only had a few days to catch it on our only imax screen,2023-07-26 12:52:34
reminded me of the interstellar scene when cooper jumped into the blackhole,2023-07-27 03:35:52
very similar to when matt damons character blows up part of the endurance in interstellar completely quiet explosion was an amazing moment,2023-07-27 14:31:12
i watched in standard view sitting 4 rows away from the screen it did not feel like 3 hours and was comfortable watching it my question is about the explosion we’re people truly that close to the test site in reality would it not have exposed them even though it was not a full blown explosion any thoughts,2023-08-01 17:55:31
you go to the movies with a circus i can’t remember a single time silent parts of movies wouldn’t have been silent as everyone’s just watching the film but maybe that’s just finland,2023-08-02 00:05:04
just like in interstellar,2023-08-07 05:32:31
some  in front of me was on his phone just during that scene like what the  dude this is like the whole reason im here,2023-09-05 21:24:10
man a very similar thing to happened to me when i first saw interstellar except it happened right as they let dr mann out of the cryobed and just as we saw that it was matt damon the movie stopped i had to wait a week to finish it it was torture,2023-07-21 13:37:37
that would actually be kinda nice i had to take a strategic  break,2023-07-22 00:33:39
cineplex vaughan,2023-07-22 03:21:45
dude the 70 mm film got damaged today before my showing and they had to use the digital version it’ll be back up and running tomorrow and all of the showtimes are sold out for the remainder of the run ,2023-07-28 06:32:33
"in san antonio texas they canceled our showings no free tickets we planned a tripp there got an airbnb and lost a day of work

that  costs hundreds of dollar all to not watch the movie",2023-07-31 00:19:40
oh man our 70mm didn’t even start due to a brain wrap but was thinking how terrible if it got messed up in the middle of it,2023-07-30 22:26:18
those lightbulbs are no joke,2023-07-25 04:51:11
i want to go watch it again wish i knew how huge that a screen was i wasn’t that close but i was close enough still great movie,2023-08-11 04:42:44
"i had a hard time figuring out ramis character and why he was even relevant

it felt like he was in the background for a few minutes then suddenly was key to the whole exoneration  it just felt weird",2023-07-23 18:49:42
my buddy hates horror flicks he just sat and stared at his phone while the trailer was playing and afterwards goes  man they shouldnt be allowed to do that ,2023-07-21 04:27:28
dawg i don’t do scary movies and especially when they’re creepy children the final few frames of that trailer are gonna be burned in my mind for awhile,2023-07-21 04:49:56
it’s hilarious that one of the biggest blockbusters of the summer had a trailer for that paul giamatti movie that’s gonna sell 3 tickets,2023-07-21 05:52:48
i’m apparently in the minority here because i didn’t think it looked that good  a few people around me were whispering the same thing,2023-07-21 22:35:41
every single person in my theater seemed to have the same “okay wait this actually looks good” reaction to that trailer lol,2023-07-21 03:07:21
"do you know what trailer they played before my showing

the  movie all of us were seeing in the theater ",2023-07-21 04:52:06
a lady in her mid 50s to the left of me burst out laughing when she released it was an exorcist movie,2023-07-21 05:37:43
trailer looked surprisingly good super creepy,2023-07-21 02:40:48
"my theater didn’t play trailers  

it went straight from blank screen to nicole kidmans amc bit to the movie",2023-07-21 21:38:55
my wife was worried shed be tired during the 8 pm showing that trailer woke her  all the way up ,2023-07-22 05:09:18
"bro no hate  it looked great

i hope it turns out to be a decent october horror flick",2023-07-21 04:57:29
"i had to look down at my feet during that trailer i don’t have the stomach for that stuff

right as the trailer ended though my theater was silent and one guy just let out a loud “nope” which got a big laugh from everyone and cut the tension before the movie started",2023-07-22 23:36:05
hey better than the oppenheimer trailer that played before  oppenheimer in my theater lol,2023-07-22 00:25:45
my whole theater erupted in nervous laughter and murmuring it played right before the movie started too so it was a bit jarring,2023-07-22 02:16:50
the faces at the end of that   super creepy,2023-07-21 09:07:48
scared the  out of me,2023-07-21 06:07:34
bro that  was creepy af no thanks,2023-07-21 22:52:06
"same

edit i was kinda sad not to see dune part 2s new trailer on the big screen but also kind of glad it wasnt shown cause it shows literally every major plot point in the remainder of the book",2023-07-21 09:08:54
they played the trailer to new poirot film in ours and it looked like an exorcist film,2023-07-21 22:47:00
we got the strays trailer which felt unbelievably out of place,2023-07-23 20:22:12
same  looks good,2023-07-21 03:35:50
the exorcist piano key was marvelous i got so excited,2023-07-24 01:33:50
i saw that too although i felt like i saw the entire movie it showed way too much,2023-07-21 03:54:26
i thought the trailer looked good as did the group of people i was with however im a bit hesitant because all the exorcist movies outside of the original are not good imo,2023-07-21 05:05:23
my entire theater laughed so hard at the end of that trailer,2023-07-24 02:44:12
so is it  i am legitimately curious,2023-07-21 02:40:15
i knew what it was the moment it started because i had heard beforehand but it was great hearing the theater realize what it was and the chatter after the title haha,2023-07-24 01:45:33
oh wow i didnt get that in my theater thats a little disappointing does it look good,2023-07-21 05:36:41
the first 3 notes i knew what it was it actually looks terrifying it took me decades to get over the first one,2023-07-24 06:56:16
they really chose the most offputting young actresses in hollywood to play those girls,2023-07-24 11:12:26
man i cringed when they played that like why no one wants to see some child turn into a deformed possessed baby in full imax with the sound blaring,2023-07-31 07:43:41
i didnt appreciate it,2023-08-12 04:44:19
i was excited for the movie but the trailer looks dumb 2 kids possessed is kinda lame,2023-07-23 07:41:49
same looked very hacky,2023-07-23 11:41:15
same here lol,2023-07-21 23:26:40
i  hated that lol,2023-07-23 09:40:29
theatre i was at went crazy for that trailer big nope for me lol,2023-07-24 04:04:49
looked fun but a couple clips made me worry its going to be generic as ,2023-07-25 04:41:51
did not look great hopefully it was just a bad trailer,2023-07-29 15:20:50
what’s the joke here i thought it looked pretty scary i so hate the demon faces so guys next to me laughed about it i guess they’re too cool to be scared,2023-07-25 05:47:28
it was so  loud i had to plug in my ears almost the entire theater was turned off by it,2023-07-25 06:05:58
how does it look can’t see ope for a while because all the good seats are booked for ages and it hasn’t leaked online yet,2023-07-21 03:48:51
i feel like those loud screams and screeches during that exorcist trailer were way louder than anything during the oppenheimer movie i literally had to cover my ears towards the end of the trailer,2023-08-06 22:22:24
i saw oppenheimer today and got the exorcist believer trailer as well,2023-09-23 18:33:12
and deeply personal and isolating he seemed so isolated for the most of the film,2023-07-21 02:26:16
"i cannot explain how full of anxiety i was when i saw the countdown of the trinity test

even after i saw the movie i can’t imagine how  unbelievable is i mean i’m seeing a visual representation of an atomic bomb but man in real life is just unimaginable",2023-07-21 02:54:57
i never even thought about that until you mentioned it does indeed feel like that its disorienting like the brain cant properly process all the external stimuli cuz its already too busy,2023-07-21 07:57:39
he even captured the feeling of knowing there’s sound all over you but it feels so  silent and gone,2023-07-22 06:30:51
i literally had goosebumps and was partially covering my ears in anticipation of the aftershock boom from the testing the lengthy silence from the bomb going off was deafening and i could feel the anxiety build up inside me lol,2023-07-22 04:43:21
a big telling on me moment was when everyone was slapping 5s and dancing around  i’ve never felt more isolated with a character that  was perfect i’m so excited to have seen a something i can consider perfect,2023-07-22 07:49:54
i wonder if he got any tips from benny safdie who played teller hydrogen bomb guy and also directed uncut gems the most anxiety inducing film of all time,2023-07-23 00:01:59
what an excellent description,2023-07-22 03:35:43
yeah as someone with gad that  was accurate as  the scenes where he’s freaking out and hyperventilating during his speeches after the bombs are very similar,2023-07-25 20:34:25
i’ve been searching for the perfect word to express this film i kept coming back to “propulsive” i was wrong it’s there in your comment and it’s “unrelenting”,2023-07-22 01:06:25
when the bomb exploded and eveyrthing is silent and then the sound hit them amazing,2023-07-23 16:26:01
did you happen to see beau is afraid ari aster already did that haha,2023-07-21 04:51:04
every color scene in the movie is subjective and every black  white scene is objective as described by nolan himself,2023-07-23 12:22:43
kitty explains how vengeful people have the patience of saints and she’s absolutely right,2023-07-24 04:02:58
that last scene was such a revelation in so many ways,2023-07-21 16:53:31
"hello this is j robert oppenheimer

oppie i need you now

dr oppenheimer isnt here right now but if youd like to leave a message",2023-07-21 03:18:27
,2023-07-21 05:49:05
wat,2023-07-21 02:38:33
also eye rolling because…  i was feeling you of course i would say that i’ve said similar  to all my exes but if any of them called me i wouldn’t drop my wife and kids to go be with them you crazy,2023-07-21 14:32:30
i mentioned this in another comment but it struck me that cm could nail hosting a twilight zone reboot and now i really want this to happen,2023-07-22 17:44:10
and the final conversation makes real sense when youre on the cutting edge of a field your work is debated when you get lifetime achievement awards your work is old accepted and has likely been surpassed,2023-07-23 05:39:43
"he looked crazy at the beginning where he goes to  the professor just completely exhausted and out of his mind 

i liked the part where he says “things like this are  the heart” his treatment for the hearing against him was absolutely brutal and he goes through so much i don’t know that an average man could suffer so much and survive it like oppi did",2023-07-24 03:50:56
giving off the 1000 yard stare vibes,2023-07-22 18:08:56
"im honestly binging peaky blinders just because of cillian murphy even though i think the writing in that show is mediocre

his acting and screen presence are just magnificent",2023-07-24 07:55:22
his wildly blue eyes really enhance the effect plus hes so gaunt even more than normal,2023-07-25 04:47:51
i stayed the whole credits and didnt get an oppenheimer 2 postcredits stinger ,2023-07-24 14:00:36
" im taking kyoto off the list due to its cultural significance to the japanese people also my wife and i honeymooned there

my theater was jampacked but mostly dead silent excluding reacting to the jarring exorcist trailer but this scene made everyone erupt in laughter we also busted up when truman is in disbelief with oppenheimer and says to get this crybaby outta here",2023-07-22 04:12:13
" the gymnasium scene after they learned of the horishima bombing this was nolan directing a horror film

good analogy it was a psychological horror scene pretty trippy as well 

cillian murphy is also in another good example of what a nolan horror would be like

nolan could do a great psychological horror based on that messed up the prestige ending",2023-07-22 04:09:59
just want to add i loved the weird comical choice to put a massive bouquet of flowers in the middle of the table in that soviet test scene and have strauss push it to the side,2023-07-24 05:59:35
" can you hear the music robert the scene where oppenheimer is told to leave cambridge and we seem him abroad looking at art thinking of the quantum world all while the beautiful score is played such a beautiful montage it happens early so its somewhat over shadowed by the later scenes but make no mistake i think its one of the best in the film

as a physicist i thought this part was kind of silly but this sort of thing is pretty common in science related movies by now so i’m used to it i was more confused that they never revisited it other than the beginning they never really touch on anyone thinking about science or any thought process that leads to discoveries the “science visualization” cgi sequences were done at the beginning and then never had a presence in any other part of the film",2023-07-22 05:25:44
people  on nolan for using non linear storytelling in every movie and i agree its a bit overplayed and loses its wow effect somewhat but it was still a technique masterfully executed as you listed,2023-07-22 05:42:58
"the way einstein sums up the burden of genius but also the way you will be taken for granted as you age

just like oppenheimer did to einstein’s science when he mentioned something to the effect of “it’s our time now”",2023-08-14 16:19:38
is there a name for the score during the “can you hear the music robert” scene when he is looking at the art or is it just the main score,2023-07-23 06:04:33
"i dont think he was that mean to him the first time he didnt want him to take notes on the discussion and took his pen and put it in his pocket

the second time he didnt want to sign the petition  and accidentally knocked over dr hills notepad but he clearly had a remorseful look in his eyes",2023-07-24 11:09:37
honestly pretty amazing that nolan could smuggle a twist into a film that’s portraying real life events but he managed it,2023-07-21 14:36:08
i expected the sabotage to come from the top like politicians and the government itself but the conflict arising from embarrassing a power hungry person and a struggle to influence national policy felt more grounded than conspiratorial,2023-07-22 01:40:26
was i the only one who thought it was pretty telegraphed the minute somebody asked how did he get access to opps documents i knew it was strauss,2023-07-25 06:13:27
i accidentally spoiled this twist to my friend a few days before we saw it i had read the book and mentioned “rdj is the bad guy” i thought nolan was going to spare strauss until about halfway through the movie,2023-07-23 02:26:33
"there was a moment where he was speculating who could have led the trail of fire from oppenheimer straight to his desk and in that very moment i thought “ he did it himself”  when the twist was verified i felt a slight bit of disappointment and then thought get over it cocksucka you got one right for once enjoy it 

great movie so glad i saw it in imax",2023-07-24 00:23:31
“have you a valediction oppy”,2023-07-23 13:42:04
i read the book knowing what was coming and still thought for a moment that rdj couldn’t have been the guy to leak the documents,2023-07-30 05:47:01
stunned by a twist that was telegraphed for three hours,2023-08-02 00:14:49
so we can say that thomas shelby managed to outwit iron man in the end,2023-12-09 14:08:52
did you see einstein walk out of the shadows literally nick fury ,2023-07-21 09:37:56
they name dropped jfk like a sequel tease lol,2023-07-22 06:42:06
that guy with the bongos seems like hed have had an interesting solo movie,2023-07-21 13:31:07
im ready for the scientific cinematic universe,2023-07-23 17:43:03
is einstein the captain america analog even if he was born in germany,2023-07-25 04:57:42
please  can we just have one movie that stands on its own without clamoring for a sequel prequel cinematic universe,2023-07-25 04:32:15
also what was up with the attempted breaking bad crossover heisenberg showed up just for a scene,2023-12-09 14:09:25
i took my son who is 18 an hour in i’m thinking   he’s gonna be so bored by this as soon as it ended he said ‘that was incredible’…i think all of us are hungry for more intelligent meaningful and fresh art and culture in our lives,2023-07-21 06:12:03
all hail christopher nolan and the imax format,2023-07-21 06:02:32
"i think nolan has a bit of a bad rap for being a film bro director but i think he is genuinely one of the best of our time for exactly this he makes dramatic films that also happen to be blockbusters one of the few modern directors that can straddle that line its hard to think of another director outside of maybe spielberg possiby tarantino that would get blockbuster money and releases for even his more oscarbait fare 

hes not a perfect director certainly but i think its become popular to  on him in some circles for the wrong reasons the fact he can drop a three hour biopic the same weekend as barbie and have it still likely to make significant bank is a testament to his value in modern cinema",2023-07-21 10:25:14
especially when his last film signaled the start of covid this film shows the concept of “the movies” will never ever ever die,2023-07-21 14:31:27
this is happening because the movie was not sold as a 3 hour dialog heavy movie it even caught  me by surprise lots of young fellasteenagers confused in my screening,2023-07-21 05:54:53
let’s remember that this is a movie directed by christopher nolan with a star studded cast it was already very hyped since before it was even associated with barbie it’s not an indie flick it was always going to be highly successful especially since it’s of a more straightforward plot compared to previous endeavors of nolan,2023-07-23 05:39:16
it’s like nolan is just on such another level that he has to play on hard mode voluntarily but still flexes about it since it’s still too easy “i bet i can make a 3 hour historical drama about one of the more sensitive subjects of american and world history that is rated r due to full frontal nudity with no cgi while going up against barbie and mission impossible after one week”,2023-07-24 22:00:04
the artist deserved more popular acclaim than it got black and white is always welcome to me,2023-07-21 03:28:50
yall wildly emotional lol you almost cried because of a sold out theatre meanwhile i wish mine was empty so i could enjoy it more,2023-07-22 20:22:18
how many directors are allowed to make huge budget original movies based on their names alone like 5 if that,2023-07-24 19:12:59
"this was the first time in my life i saw a movie in a packed cinema room and everybody was behaving well

usually if its 34 full i know there will be some rowdy teenagers or chatty groups of friends",2023-07-23 07:57:35
my favorite film of the decade thus far,2023-07-24 14:33:52
in this day and age,2023-07-26 06:59:21
i havent seen a nonmcu movie pack a theater in years,2023-07-22 19:37:29
this movie is not so different form your average marvel fare,2023-07-21 15:42:10
 yeah the theater i was at is a 4k imax not quite native 75mm but about as close as you can get and is quite an amazing theater i see a lot of movies there including a lot of the marvel movies i’ve been to a 445 on opening night for some of them that aren’t that busy the 7pm would be sold out though for oppenheimer the whole weekend for every showing has been sold out they announced 3060 have been sold out i went to a 445 on a monday and completely sold out it was really great to see,2023-07-25 03:30:59
ive had almost universally poor theater experiences for the past few years but i didnt see a single phone screen or hear a single person talking in my oppenheimer theater it was uncanny,2023-07-25 16:40:33
ive had almost universally poor theater experiences for the past few years but i didnt see a single phone screen or hear a single person talking in my oppenheimer theater it was uncanny,2023-07-25 16:40:46
"yes i took my sister to the movie who has no knowledge of ww2 at all and she is mad at me that i havent been showing her more historical movies now even though every time i do she says she doesnt want to watch them because the good guy always gets treated horribly by society or circumstances

alan turing in imitation game nicki lauda having that crash in rush oppenheimer having his life and reputation smeared due to imagined offences etc i really did not expect it to be this compelling for people with no context for what happened

and now she hates rdj because of his role as straus ",2023-07-27 06:32:24
i mean usually only the avengers are the ones to fill up seats,2023-08-01 07:46:25
every imax screening was sold out for two weeks in my city finally got to see it today and looking around at an absolutely packed out screening in front of the biggest screen possible was a beautiful moment felt like something i might not get to see again a few years ago,2023-08-12 10:30:43
yeah they did a really good job of explaining the urgency and complexity of things without dwelling on it all you really needed to know was they were making the bomb at los alamos and the bomb material was coming from other places the story was compartmentalized to los alamos just like the entire project was designed to be,2023-07-21 03:13:50
the marbles also do a good job of showing the passage of time,2023-07-21 08:51:15
also the raindrops rippling the water akin to a barrage of nuclear missles was another clever motif throughout the movie,2023-07-21 04:22:34
ha ha funny you say that because interstellar definitely used the poking a pencil through a piece of paper thing to illustrate a complex topic,2023-07-23 01:11:44
"i must be the only person on the planet who wants a drama about the people who bred all the plutonium and enriched the uranium which is ironically the only particularly difficult part of the whole exercise

the hiroshima bomb was so dead simple they never even bothered to test it",2023-07-22 02:23:41
i mean it was basically a progress bar,2023-07-22 17:51:23
"i enjoyed the marble thing too but i dont see how its any more or less brilliant than what interstellar did

seeing the progress mattered in this film which the marbles accomplished  and in interstellar it mattered to explain what a wormhole was the paper allowed them to do that without dwelling on it",2023-07-26 03:41:52

didn’t nolan do that paper thing in interstellar,2023-08-02 00:09:50
" most films would give some  exposition try and explain something really  complex like bending a piece of paper and poking a hole through it or something

the paperandpencil device was great actually much better than the marble bowl imo

the problem was the terrible context an astronaut explaining worm holes to another astronaut while they are in a spaceship flying towards a wormhole with the intention of flying into it",2023-08-05 19:14:21
wouldnt they need three trinity little boy  man,2023-07-23 08:50:27
" im just gonna say that the bowls on the table filling up with marbles might be lowkey one of my favorite plot devices 

biased as an iowan my only disappointment with that was there was no mention of iowa state or the ames process which was developed there as part of the process many of the manhattan project sites are now us department of energy national labs with oak ridge being ran by the nonprofit ut–battelle but iowa state became one of 4 universities with such labs with the others being princeton calberkery and stanford iowa state however is the only one with their lab on campus",2023-07-23 17:31:54
a bunch of people cheering marbles being thrown into a jar was pretty funny to me in a very charming way great for practical tracking of progress in reality and for the audience,2023-07-25 04:46:10
i was so lost was it time lapse i couldn’t figure it out,2023-07-25 05:08:35
what about the plate of spaghetti in the flash,2023-07-24 07:47:08
 at nolan using the exact thing youre talking about piece of paper thing in interstellar,2023-08-28 03:30:17
i love how the bit about him destroying someone’s marriage is literally just a throwaway line,2023-07-22 04:22:58
act 4 was a legal drama it was like watching a law and order trial scene but better,2023-07-23 08:50:48
the roast of j robert oppenheimer,2023-07-22 22:42:08
yeah i almost felt like the movie ended during the trinity explosion and a new one began afterwards i don’t mean that in a critical way i think it really worked,2023-07-25 23:04:11
i wish it would have been the last 30 of the film should have been heavily condensed,2023-07-27 05:04:40
slammed,2023-07-23 14:33:20
nolan is teasing us for his new american history cinematic universe,2023-07-23 19:20:17
it took me a beat or two after it was mentioned in the movie but then i realized the events in this movie drew a direct line to the bay of pigs crisis becoming the defining event of jfks presidency,2023-07-22 19:50:33
jfk actually tried to amend the wrong doings that happened to oppenheimer when he took office inviting him to the white house to apologize and awarding him the enrico fermi award which they show in the movie jfk wasn’t actually able to give the award to oppenheimer though because he was assassinated prior to it lyndon b johnson was the one who actually gave the award following jfk’s nomination for oppenheimer,2023-07-23 08:43:43
my husband did too lol why if you don’t mind me asking,2023-07-21 07:28:33
stones jfk almost feels like a spiritual sequel to this,2023-07-22 21:09:44
the jfk name drop got a nice reaction in the theater felt like an “oh ” moment,2023-07-22 07:25:34
the guy next to me said who it was right before they said it in the movie ,2023-07-26 01:15:16
i almost wonder if it was a wink to oliver stones jfk which was clearly an influence on this,2023-07-27 22:01:51
that one and the bomb one i knew the sound wave was coming but  did it hit,2023-07-21 02:56:36
for me the scene in the gym is the scene of the movie the way he kept trying to give the speech while reality was breaking down around him felt just like a waking nightmare the best directing nolan has done by a country mile,2023-07-21 03:10:30
i dont know what other peoples theaters were like but the audience stomping and clapping was the loudest part of the movie for me louder than every explosion lol,2023-07-21 02:13:23
most impactful part of the movie so good,2023-07-21 03:05:27
this films a horror the dread the jumpscares,2023-07-21 02:34:16
and you had the mix of people celebrating mixed with people panicking and screaming,2023-07-21 04:48:55
that was incredible the use of sound was excellent,2023-07-21 03:33:29
that was my favorite scene of the movie just came back from viewing and oh wow what a scene i loved the artistic direction of making the actual bomb explosion relatively quiet to the rest of the film and yet the sounds of cheers ended up being the loudest and most dissociative thing in the whole film they cheers ended up sounding like screams,2023-07-21 06:30:40
that  audio cut made me jump off my seat,2023-07-21 06:16:20
when it starts showing the carbon shadows on the floor and the skin of some of the people melting im preparing myself to see some graphic scenes of the consequences of the bomb that thankfully didnt come,2023-07-21 08:22:19
i loved this scene but i’m fairly certain they were all waving around the 50 star flags when it should be the 48 star one,2023-07-21 22:48:23
exactly,2023-07-21 02:10:30
for me it was the shockwave scene the first one i was expecting and even though i was anticipating the second one it happened a lot sooner than i thought it would and it made me jump in my seat next to a complete stranger,2023-07-21 06:15:05
amazing stuff your butt not the sound design,2023-07-22 07:47:00
i had my ears plugged for like 4 minutes of silence,2023-07-23 03:40:28

that was one of the most interesting parts for me  i don’t know what i expected when the explosion happened but it wasn’t dead silence  in retrospect it makes perfect sense but in the moment i was left shocked,2023-07-21 02:47:32
it was not at all what i expected but it was brilliant,2023-07-21 03:34:38
"nolan has created a masterpiece yes the first ten minutes are odd and the first introduction of “i am become death the destroyer of worlds” was certainly unexpected but the visual and auditory depiction of anxiety and the feeling of being overwhelmed was masterful sure maybe it’s not the best ever but of the movies i’ve seen in a cinema this is the best 

also yes the whole theater suspense and bewilderment was truly once in a lifetime",2023-07-21 06:20:11
just saw it in a huge imax theater with a brand new sound system jumped a foot out of my chair when the shockwave blast hit them after the prolonged silence of the fireball the audio work was beyond compare,2023-07-21 04:13:22
"i know the sound of the crowd stomping was used a lot but it reminded me of a train chugga chugging had that similar feel of an oncoming train pretty sure that was intentional the use of trains also very prominent

one of the best sound edited films i’ve ever seen",2023-07-22 02:39:51
someones  phone went off i wanted to throw hands,2023-07-21 23:37:27
he didnt play with anything just used real life physics it felt really good because throughout the movie you can see their text explosions also have a delay between the flame and the sound which i found quite refreshing and since they got farther and farther from the explosives the sound became more and more delayed,2023-07-21 08:22:01
"the many uses of delayed sound explosions and crowd noise also reflect the theme of the movie that your actions have consequences that may not be immediately apparent but that cannot be undone his affair the bomb his communist affiliations each a decision that ignited something and only later does the blast arrive 

as i write this i realize that the poison apple at the beginning is an interesting counterpoint where he does have a chance to reverse his action before the consequences",2023-07-24 14:06:52
"yes

i loved the accuracy of the differences between the speed of light and sound from the explosion he definitely got those details down right",2023-07-21 04:55:54
"ive always loved the interaction between light and sound i remember being fascinated as a child when i saw some people playing basketball and the ball struck the ground long before i heard it and it was shown so beautifully here didnt even use music during the scene 

my theatre was also silent",2023-07-21 09:01:37
i love how they teased the way that scene was going to go with every other explosion in the movie you always see them first,2023-07-22 03:02:46
someone in my theathre plopped open their beer right as the bomb dropped,2023-07-22 13:25:15
"not mine  there was a group of  kids sitting beside me constantly talking about the movie and this  kid shouted boom when the whole theater was dead silent during the trinity test 

 them",2023-07-22 16:50:44
i thought it was done really well but i personally felt like scale was missing i know he did it practically but i sort of wish there had been a wider shot or an after shot in the daylight to show just how far the blast affected and things of that nature i appreciate that they didn’t show the footage from japan though we all have imaginations that do the work for us after nolan has set the hints in of melting flesh and charred corpses,2023-07-24 18:51:17
i had put in my earplugs in anticipation of the explosion sound was surprised with the dead silence i waited a few removed one of the earplugs thinking there isn’t gonna be a sound and then boooom my one ear hates you nolan,2023-07-26 07:37:22
" my whole theater was completely silent it was awesome to be a part of

same you could have heard a pin drop in the theater 

just complete awe 

this ladies  gentlemen is filmmaking",2023-07-22 04:57:00
gary oldman really looked like he was playing jaime lee curtis playing truman,2023-07-21 04:21:39
wait was gary oldman the one playing truman i knew he sounded so familiar,2023-07-21 03:17:33
“barbenheinner” concept is genius these two films have more in common than i expected,2023-07-21 02:24:15
"as someone who did barbenheimer tonight my  am i glad i did barbie first

all the people saying “barbie will make you feel better” are so so wrong no way would i have been in the right headspace after oppenheimer to handle barbie which for the record i also greatly enjoyed although obviously very different movies",2023-07-21 07:48:04
based on your replies i’m not sure folks realize that was gary oldman playing president harry truman so this comment is for educational purposes,2023-07-21 03:47:48
hold up gary oldman was in this gotta go check out the full cast list,2023-07-21 03:13:09
i already know a few people with tik tok brains going to see it and i can’t wait for them to tell me how it was so long and how there so much talking,2023-07-21 02:23:17
gary oldman was in this,2023-07-21 03:49:26
he made truman be a complete convincing  with only a couple of minutes of screen time genius “the russians wont make nukes”,2023-07-21 06:43:24
rdj exceeded my expectations,2023-07-21 09:59:47
that was gary oldman,2023-07-21 03:39:49
there were a ton of people in my theatre who clearly regretted their choice either from boredom of abject terror mostly both,2023-07-21 03:40:16
gary oldman wait what,2023-07-21 03:40:41
gary oldman was in it,2023-07-21 05:48:30
dude did he  ever he shined like a  beacon in the final act not that i mind it juxtaposed the science and politics so well and that was absolutely necessary rdj  killed it,2023-07-21 08:32:03
my theater had a lot of teenagers and young adults i think it’s wonderful that a lot of young people and people in general are going to see this movie who might not have otherwise it’s a very important film in my opinion,2023-07-22 02:34:17
dont let that crybaby back in here,2023-07-25 16:34:39
gary oldman is in this  ,2023-07-21 13:47:38
i saw multiple people walking out of my theater around the halfway mark pretty sure they were some of those,2023-07-21 16:29:40
i was thinking the same thing i think a ton of people don’t know what they’re getting themselves into,2023-07-21 21:02:16
"i heard a lot of people in the theatre lounge talk about how excited they were about a double feature and i just chuckled to myself knowing how heavy oppen was lot of folks just wanted to jump in the bandwagon

my soul was prepared for both and absolutely loved both movies",2023-07-21 06:20:56
"in the parking lot afterward i looked up the cast list saw gary oldmans name and said to my friends he cant keep getting away with this

 chameleon",2023-07-21 14:26:27
heard quite a few people dressed in pink coming out of my screening saying thank  that’s over it was sooo boring,2023-07-21 17:51:25
yeah my theaterbwas pretty packed and it really wouldnt be for any other 3hr biopic felt like there were definitely a lot of people that wouldnt have went to see it otherwise hope they enjoyed it,2023-07-21 23:30:54
took me a few seconds for me to recognize him he did great,2023-07-21 09:16:06
how about emily blunt she was awesome too,2023-07-22 05:44:42
damon didnt really need to do anything other than look gruff a lot but mans understood the assignment,2023-07-22 06:05:29
it’s expected from damon from rdj…i honestly never expected that he was capable of such a performance he was phenomenal,2023-07-24 04:09:15
he kinda reminded me of brad pitt in inglorious bastards i was worried he would be too much matt damon but he nailed the role,2023-07-30 00:55:14
josh hartnett was too im surprised nobody is mentioning him,2024-02-22 04:21:22
i didn’t like rdj at the end so much,2023-07-22 06:03:24
is amazing how einstein was called a crazy man by his own scientific community and then judged the same way as oppenheimer was the contrast of the last scene is perfect,2023-07-21 03:00:52
i love how the important moments in the film are broken down in detail like with the trinity test the different perspectives and moments noticed pile on like a unique form of slow motion,2023-07-21 03:13:33
i dont know why but every time i saw einstein it felt like a crossover in an mcu movie,2023-07-21 06:09:07
near the end i kind of figured the last scene would be with einstein in color but still that scene hit me i was teary eyed,2023-07-21 04:26:22
"on the drive home i wondered for an extremely brief second if the ending would’ve been better with just “maybe they were discussing something more important” 

then i was like nah lol",2023-07-21 05:59:30
i think it gets even better when you look at it from oppenheimers perspective back at the beginning of the cold war he has no way of knowing how the cold war played out from his point of view the us has their bomb the soviets are hot on their heels and nuclear holocaust is all but a few years away and you put it all into motion horrifying,2023-07-21 08:51:58
that last scene made it a 1010 for me hit me like a train and was so impactful and haunting,2023-07-21 05:15:26
it felt like the whole movie was made just so they could drop that mic,2023-07-21 05:59:13
"this moment was the moment that gave me the most goosebumps this movie was pointing towards that ending and the way it was shot was beautiful

coming off the heels of rdjs final scene who gave a  brilliant performance throughout that scene has rdj slowly inching towards oppenheimer and einstein in the background and ends where their conversation began earlier in the movie signifying that yes we might still end up killing ourselves prometheus coming to the full realization of his contribution to what may come


yeah that scene was okay lol",2023-07-21 08:27:06
"i think this was truly my favorite part

for a “visual” film experience it is surprisingly much more tame than i was expecting for a nolan film…

but the images that were used will stick with me especially the last one that final image is what nolan seems to be trying to encompass with this film having a discussion over the “genie” that’s been unleashed and finding proper people to monitor it",2023-07-21 07:24:47
when you expect the destroyer of worlds to make one final appearance it does but in a way that knocked your teeth back,2023-07-21 08:09:12
lots of people here are talking about the main topic of conversation einstein and oppenheimer had had the end but i think what did it for me was oppy’s comment at the very end and the visuals of the icbms launching and destroying the world it was like a snap back to reality a reminder that this is the world we live in with nuclear arsenals capable of levelling every city on the planet,2023-07-22 14:10:24
it was really well put together as usual with nolan and it did a great job closing out the movie,2023-07-21 06:42:14
nolan is the best when it comes to the final scene,2023-07-22 00:56:27
"the moment the held the conversation details from us i knew it was chekovs einstein and be payed off later

though i never got any closure on the whole abandoningourbaby thing what was that about and why was it moved on from",2023-07-22 07:35:42
that line is still sending chills down my spine,2023-07-21 14:07:05
that scene wasnt for you,2023-07-21 04:43:44
it’s grampa telling homer it’ll happen to him too…,2023-07-21 23:38:14
that really closed the movie really well and then it ended the way the movie begaun one of the best endings ever,2023-07-23 16:25:10
i dont think its an exaggeration to claim that that scene is one of the most powerful haunting and poignant messages ever put to the big screen its going to leave a lasting impression on me for years and i know im not the only one who feels that way,2023-07-22 14:45:39
everything about that was so perfect i was holding back tears it was so overwhelming,2023-07-23 05:21:12
i just saw it today and thought their dialogue at the end was hard to understand but i got the gist of it,2023-07-22 18:30:24
overstated,2023-07-23 00:55:07
"i didn’t understand oppenheimer’s final line i heard it as he say he accepted the responsibility with glee

edit how am i being downvoted for this lol",2023-07-21 02:33:41
so dramatic will you be 90 years old thinking about that scene ,2023-07-24 02:28:22
overstated,2023-07-24 02:55:06
that scene confused me because i thought oppenheimer didnt have the note at the time,2023-07-22 00:25:17
"i could feel things were wrapping up and was just hoping it would have an ending which was on par with the rest of the movie ive had the disappointment of a great movie with a bad ending too many times  and yeh  chills perfect ending 

and the entire packed cinema i was in was dead silent for the first time all night as well ",2023-07-23 15:19:08
what did they say to each other during that i caught most of it but think i missed the most important words,2023-08-02 02:13:49
you shouldve listened to the do barbie first crowd bro,2023-07-21 02:48:02
glad i went straight home after this to absorb the film and then open my 800 wikipedia tabs in peace ,2023-07-22 14:40:57
i did barbie first and man am i glad i did,2023-07-22 05:43:17
oppenheimer made me so ready to see barbie after a lunch break,2023-07-22 21:00:31
yea the barbie second crowd got it quite wrong,2023-07-21 08:37:24
"i thankfully had a two hour lag and was able to snag a few guinnesses next door to take the edge off and chat with the bartend about my existential dread

then decompress in a malibu dreamhouse",2023-07-22 04:00:34
i tried watching barbie afterward as a palate cleanser given the heavy nature of oppenheimer i didn’t like it and i had been looking forward to seeing it i wished i just saw oppenheimer immediately after again,2023-07-24 03:54:00
i would have if i wasn’t with friends who were all doing barbie right after as well,2023-07-23 10:13:49
we do its just that most people dont care  if you look at the work being done today on quantum technologies quantum computing and biology its nothing short of incredible  its also that we really havent discovered any new major theories most of our scientific progress lately has been aplication,2023-07-21 06:32:52
the way i see it is the more stuff we discover the harder it gets to discover more stuff and the more people are necessary to make those breakthroughs happen one dude just figuring stuff out isnt a thing that can happen anymore,2023-07-21 11:38:08
i think a lot of it is that what scientists are doing today is so far beyond what most people will learn about in school people learn about the bohr model of the atom in 7th grade the nobel prize for physics in 2016 was given for theoretical discoveries of topological phase transitions and topological phases of matter does anyone without a phd even know what that means,2023-07-22 00:22:32
my dude we had a world wide pandemic and had vaccines created in a year i don’t know the names of the people who created the vaccine but i imagine future generations will,2023-07-21 21:21:34
" there were a lot of generationally smart people on earth at the same time several names i recognized from textbooks that i didn’t realize knew each other and worked together it could be because i’m not actively studying scientific journals but it seems like we don’t have as many einsteins bohrs and oppenheimers these days

in one moment i thought “this like the avengers for nerds”",2023-07-21 17:12:08
you’ve probably seen it because it gets posted to reddit every now and then but look up the solvay conference of 1927 look at the group photo you’ll be surprised how many names you recognize from textbooks,2023-07-21 15:37:57
i think the other reason why we dont see the same level of genius these days is because of several other things 1 revolutionary discoveries are now few and far between because the big big ones already happened 2 we communicate differently with the internet and social media so its easier to get drowned out or diluted back then articles were written about you and everyone read it now an article can be written and it might be one of ten others that are all over the internet,2023-07-21 06:40:43
they also didnt have twitter who knows how many current geniuses are befallen to modern technology some of those names might not have been as legendary and mysterious with all this immediate access to each other people used to think musk was a genius too history might change that as well,2023-07-21 14:41:41
i think a modern day example of smart people and science at work was the speedy development of the covid vaccine that will probably be a really cool movie in about 50 years,2023-07-22 23:09:22
historymaking scientists often don’t get the publicity until after the events have entered history we’re too close to things to see how revolutionary the race to get a covid vaccine was,2023-07-22 23:30:54
 being too arroganthatefulignorant to fund and support his scientists during something so important reminded me of a certain someone,2023-07-22 07:56:42
eh people like that exist in every age its the circumstances of said age that gives rise to these figures the people always exist,2023-07-21 14:33:01
there are many scientists at that level but ultimately the problems were dealing with now are too complicated and too difficult for a single savant to tackle the way the bohrs and heisenbergs could laboratories like cern where the really exciting stuff is happening are at scales larger than los alamos and foundational papers have author lists large enough to staff entire universities,2023-07-24 02:45:07
"i think scientists today are every bit as smart as those guys were then but those scientists had just landed on the shores of whole new unexplored continents of knowledge everywhere they looked they discovered something mankind had never encountered before and became legends 

today since all the easier discoveries have been made it’s harder and harder to have worldchanging breakthroughs that seemingly happened like every six months from around 18901950 science no longer looks like a 12 scientists sitting in a room with a chalkboard and basic instruments today it requires hundreds sometimes thousands of geniuses using multibillion dollar equipment and enormous stores of collective knowledge and training just to barely move the ball down the field in extremely niche arenas more often than not they’re just confirming or refining the groundbreaking theories eisenhower heisenberg bohr and oppenheimer made back then",2023-07-30 04:34:55
dude yea i literally didn’t know those people were all alive at the same time,2023-07-22 03:16:05
world war 2 era was a veritable age of heroes  it’s wild to think about,2023-07-22 19:33:01
mostly because the amazing discoveries in physics are incredibly convoluted and into the weeds of quantum mechanics or the standard model or very specifics of relativity that just isn’t viable for grade school textbooks roger penrose black holes and it’s relation to relativity hawking was recent enough so i’ll count him hawking radiation steven weinberg standard model kip thorne relativityligo those are the more “famous” names there are many more there are fewer elementary discoveries as the technology revolution kind of addressed most of those through the 1900s nowadays several years and hundreds of millions have to go into research and the discoveries aren’t as elementary and thus not nearly as easy to understand,2023-07-23 06:07:30
because there is very little perceived societal value placed on intellectual innovation now,2023-07-23 08:57:07
reading american prometheus i had to sometimes just pause and really appreciate the scenes of all these historically famous people just causally interacting at dinner gatherings or going to his ranch in new mexico even the names i didn’t recognize included noble prize winners rhode scholars etc etc in many different areas not just science it became almost annoying at times like gd we get it oppie,2023-07-29 01:23:23
consider reading ‘logicomix’ it’s a graphic novel that doubles as a biography of bertrand russell my first exposure to it sparked a realization numerous brilliant minds coexisted during the same era and were close to each other intriguingly many of them experienced severe mental instability,2023-07-21 19:26:51
its basically a realistic version of the avengers,2023-07-21 23:42:01
there are actually more geniuses like that now thanks to broader scientific education but this was during a time when many new fields of science had the capability to make an enormous impact on a world war we might see another era like that one relating to quantum physics and ai although nuclear weapons pretty much guarantee that it wont be as dire,2023-07-22 07:51:40
do you think that ordinary contemporaries of those scientists knew who the  they were,2023-07-22 17:21:25
that was a particular period in time when human knowledge had come to an inflection point in particular there was a huge theoretical inconsistency between electromagnetism and general relativity despite both theories seeming to be emprically correct thats where quantum physics came from throw in the end of european colonial domination and the rise of communism there was also a lot changing politically as well,2023-07-27 05:09:21
i think one of the reasons definitely not the only one but one of them is that those generational geniuses went to different fields today like computer science for example,2023-07-27 14:27:36
"there are plenty of geniuses around just like the ones you mentioned the problem is that there are less and less scientists that are also great science “salesmen” 

especially in todays hyper competitive world with every piece of media vying for your attention how in the  are we gonna find someone that’s a genius at scientific research but also knows how to deliver the message to the everyman 

the last one we had that had this level of stardom was stephen hawking now we’re stuck with neil degrasse tyson then there’s scientists that are practical in their approach like bill nye who “recently” made a comeback mythbusters also ended which was huge for bringing science to the masses but adam savage still brings a lot to the table on his youtube channel tested 

but a super genius that’s also a great salesmen is not easy to find and we may never get another one especially if advertising companies keep pushing media companies to spit out more and more content",2023-08-02 02:35:24
i think they are famous because of how their work impacted things we can all tangibly see nuclear weapons and space exploration being one but in modern times we can see people like dr fauci being  into the limelight in a similar way,2023-08-02 22:57:31
reminds me of an interesting ezra klein podcast from last year about how the speed of scientific breakthroughs seems to be slowing link,2023-08-13 07:51:30
reading frantz fannons wretched of the earth really let me take in what was being said about the political state at the time with stuff having to do with concessions and all that jazz,2023-08-17 03:30:03
the tension nolan built up leading to the trinity test was insane i obviously knew the test was gonna be successful but it still felt like something might go wrong,2023-07-23 08:17:46
yeah i didnt know if they were gonna destroy the world,2023-07-25 12:16:39
easily the best part of the movie imho along with the end,2023-07-22 00:54:37
the teenager i was sitting next to who was on his phone the first 5 minutes of the movie was very visbily tensing up right before the bomb went off,2023-07-31 20:24:32
yes one of the best five minutes in cinema for me,2023-07-25 02:00:32
batter my heart three person’d ,2023-07-22 18:50:59
when oppenheimer gave instructions to josh peck and the look on his face afterwards phew felt like i was there w him,2023-08-09 14:12:15
mine too was bracing myself for the boom the whole time,2023-07-28 23:07:13
yep one of the best tension build ups i’ve ever experienced in a movie,2023-08-04 11:47:56
truman being offended by opps sympathy was spoken verbatim to the real happenings so cool,2023-07-21 02:49:55
fun fact  neils bohr was also suuuuuuuuper against nuclear arms race he actually got to meet with both churchill and roosevelt during the war to advocate for exactly what oppenheimer ended up doing much later,2023-07-22 00:46:07
that was gary oldman,2023-07-21 10:03:52
"truman is a total  though yes he dropped the bomb and made the call but oppenheimer is right for saying that he had blood on his hands truman couldnt make the call to drop the bomb without oppenheimer directing the manhattan project to build the device in the first place they both have blood on their hands

you can argue that oppenheimer was being egotistical but the same argument can be made that truman had even thinner skin in comparison and took offense to something that wasnt only of his making",2023-07-21 05:51:30
how was truman a good guy,2023-07-23 03:34:13
the character of einstein was delivered in such a largerthanlife way i truly felt in awe when he was on screen and yet i feel it would have been so easy to make him into a cartoony caricature just by nature of being albert einstein,2023-07-23 18:23:25
" he comes off as a total 

does he though he was right it was his order and his ultimate responsibility to drop the bombs and  all those people so he feels that too and then this guy comes in and plays the martyr card not that oppie is innocent but i feel like truman has way more on his shoulders",2023-07-21 08:39:45
i feel like this is a great movie for history class after talking about it in class,2023-07-21 21:51:13
"i enjoyed uossius pointing out or quoting that humanity fought towards annihilation until it was actually in our hands and then we held back

id say that there was a happy ending that oppenheimer never got to see",2023-07-24 22:33:23
josh harnett was the surprise for me he knocked his role out of the park along with david krumholtz,2023-07-26 04:24:32
good man maybe president but a us president being a good person is really  hard,2023-07-22 06:50:10
"im a history teacher and i try to convey to students how big a deal the bomb is it really is a break with the rest of our history as a species and arguably the most important thing weve ever done it will either destroy us or send us total the stars

do you have any recommendations for books or resources that discuss this topic further 

the final scene of this movie left such an impression on me i feel like its all im going to think about for a few days so id love to learn more

thank you in advance",2023-07-22 18:06:04
so far the bomb has made sure there hasn’t been world wars at least,2023-07-25 19:17:48
 how was truman a good man,2023-07-21 08:38:29
had no idea that was gary oldman as truman lol thats wild,2023-07-22 03:23:55
i mean in the end truman is right nobody puts the nuking of japan on oppenheimer it’s falls on him,2023-07-23 05:57:23
" albert einstein is in just a few scenes and on film for what 5 minutes and the portrayal is amazing and wonderful and heartwarming 

what are you talking about he was made a caricature of himself",2023-07-30 10:49:40
it’s pretty accurate too truman had his good sides but he really didn’t understand nuclear science,2023-07-23 02:35:14
 yeah teach,2023-08-09 13:23:54
i will say truman just felt like oldman in a wig doing a funny voice again ive seen videos of him talk and he did not sound like an extra from deliverance,2023-07-21 03:21:45
re niels bohr richard feynmans autobiography about los alamos mentions a little bit about just how wicked smart bohr especially was he had a brilliance that was i felt like was conveyed really well in the first scenes but then towards the end kind of portrayed him as helpless in trying to influence a deterrence policy,2023-08-25 07:36:12
this movie had the most middle age  adults ive seen in a theater in years  definitely since before the pandemic startedi was impressed,2023-07-22 05:11:28
he doesnt  the abomb  did i buy tickets for,2023-07-21 17:01:37
ugh do they actually serve a purpose to the story or are they just there to set up the nobel laureate cinematic universe,2023-07-21 13:47:22
could you tell me who all was it,2023-07-21 18:07:19
if you open this image you have i believe 17 nobel laureates on screen so that might set the record,2023-09-10 04:46:38
probably just some random old man they found walking around the studio,2023-07-21 02:52:22
benny safdie tho that accent was so good,2023-07-21 13:53:49
gary oldman,2023-07-21 02:55:54
he mustve thought it was white boy day,2023-07-21 03:22:55
this is super late but if you haven’t already figured it out it was gary oldman,2023-09-11 15:27:16
its also eerie seeing the two bombs leave los alamos knowing their destination,2023-07-21 11:46:54
during his first panic attack there was that subtle quick single woman scream that was  haunting,2023-07-21 12:20:43
destruction  wouldnt have fit thematically besides this is a biopic and were essentially seeing oppenheimers perspective part of that comes with the loss of control of his creation he didnt get to see hiroshima and neither do we but what we got was infinitely more haunting in the speech after the news broke when we hear screams spliced in the cheers the anxiety is dialed up to  that scene,2023-07-22 07:56:10
i agree about recreating dropping the bomb but i wholeheartedly think showing the slides the scientists were viewing of the aftermath would have been way more impactful the movie hammers home how destructive the bomb was but how people thought it was necessary whether it was or not is not for me to decide we absolutely should have seen the aftermath and the consequences of their actions,2023-07-23 21:09:16
i feel you i liked that nolan focused more on oppenheimers reaction as well,2023-07-21 11:27:33
it really portrayed how oppenheimer felt so isolated after creating the bombs and shipping them off groves final comments at los alamos didnt really instill confidence that oppenheimer would remain looped in on information,2023-07-21 13:54:15
this is the one point i completely disagree the atomic bomb is the focal event of this entire film the deadliest weapon of mass destruction in human history as well as the defining moment of the life of oppenheimer i didnt exactly need to see the horrors it unleashed on humanity but i wanted to actually see the bomb explode a good mushroom cloud thats so massive in scale it blows my mind away i felt that the trinity sequence was good for what its supposed to be but i really expected a bigger and better explosion in the final act to hammer in the dread of what oppenheimer had just created so i kinda felt cheated when we didnt get that,2023-07-23 07:49:00
glad to hear that i’m supposed to be watching it in a few days and i was worried i’d just see hughie every time jack quaid is on screen,2023-07-21 11:25:31
pet peeve but branagh’s “danish” accent was an absolute joke couldn’t have put an ounce of effort into it would have been better just go with his regular british imo,2023-07-27 16:54:51
josh peck stood out like a sore thumb,2023-07-22 20:41:34
i didnt like damon i just felt like i was staring at matt damon in a moustache i feel like a less well known actor may have helped hes the only guy that felt slightly out of place to me,2023-07-22 08:43:41
truman does have a point though and this is a dialogue between 2 large egos he reminded him who’s who there great writing,2023-07-21 06:27:56
i didnt recognise rdj at first  it wasnt till they jumped back in time,2023-07-21 06:27:07
concise is not a word i would use to describe this movie,2023-07-22 22:54:45
i know im replying late to this but casey affleck was in this film for all of two mins tops and was so  creepy,2023-08-19 19:41:49
oppywheres the uranium,2023-07-21 02:13:50
the bomb was spherical spherical,2023-07-21 05:47:55
till today i realized the importance of drake and josh in our modern world my full theater burst into joy when he appeared on the screen like he was some kind of jesus but no,2023-07-21 08:13:05
"isnt there supposed to be an explosion there

yup",2023-07-21 02:10:09
"i whispered this to my wife during the movie 

you are my soul sibling",2023-07-21 03:28:58
the bomb is nuclear…nuclear,2023-07-21 05:23:31
drakewheres the nuclear explosion,2023-07-21 08:57:10
i said this in the review thread but josh pecks character in real life said now were all sons of  after the detonation and part of me just wishes he looked at oppenheimer and just went ,2023-07-21 06:11:17
yo i didnt even recognize him in this,2023-07-21 03:07:30
i never thought it would be so simple i found a wayayayayay,2023-07-21 04:22:54
"j drake did you push the button

d no that was already pushed

drake looks around at nothing

j why are there two explosions in japan

d i dont know maybe someone made soup in a microwave

j you think that someone microwaved soup

d well you could make it on a stove

j you think

truman radio report comes up on background as josh chases drake",2023-07-22 06:31:51
definitely not me just now realizing that was josh peck,2023-07-21 08:41:32
my whole theater laughed all 3 times he was on camera,2023-07-21 06:18:04
this ones for oprah,2023-07-23 23:22:14
i ran over oppenheimer,2023-07-31 00:02:22
ah geez,2023-07-21 06:21:32
this comment reminds me of something this movie didn’t touch on but someone was assigned to the job of going out by himself to the bomb to figure out what was wrong in the event that it didn’t explode i assume it was a “not it” scenario to how he got that job but that would be absolutely terrifying if it didn’t go off and he now had to drive out to the site completely alone and poke and prod it to figure out why it didn’t go boom,2023-07-30 07:41:04
"after they successfully detonating the abomb for the trinity test

now hug me oppenheimer",2023-08-01 20:11:50
holy  that was josh peck,2023-08-01 20:15:18
lol,2023-07-21 02:10:39
 these comments are cracking me up my ,2023-08-04 11:49:10
"the explosion was spherical

nevermind someone else made this joke",2023-07-30 04:24:30
“detonatorsh sharged”,2023-08-01 16:21:38
when he came on screen i was like holy  is that josh peck in a nolan film didnt want to miss a minute so i didnt look it up until after good for him and dane dehaan took me a moment to realize it was him as well,2023-07-26 06:58:40
the mild surrealism of his anxiety about the victims was so good everyone is celebrating and you cant tell whats screaming and what is laughter there are true surreal images face melting but then theres the guy outside throwing up from drinking too much but in that moment representing radiation poisoning that sequence is stellar,2023-07-21 02:32:17
this is nolan showing that he’s capable beyond his own typical crutches while also simultaneously using a lot of those same crutches in restrained ways to craft the story in a similarly compelling way as all of his films i can’t definitively state how i feel about the film having only literally just seen it but i do know that it feels like an incredibly significant film in his filmography i love all of his movies but i can’t help but laugh at a lot of the nolanisms but not here the prestige is right there and very similar though still maybe his best of his previously released,2023-07-21 06:56:42
his best since inception imo,2023-07-21 02:30:01
i think its his best film period,2023-07-21 03:50:11
easily my favorite since interstellar i didnt connect with the story of dunkirk at all and i didnt even understand tenet enough the first time to bother rewatching it maybe one day,2023-07-21 05:28:44
that’s the man,2023-07-21 02:16:19
"i also thought emily blunt was incredible throughout 

a lot of subtle things she did really gave you a great sense of her characters personality



and david krumholtz has come a long way since harold  kumar",2023-07-21 08:18:33
the actors i recognized from tv shows were such a delight im happy i didnt know who the rest of the cast was it was such a nice surprise even rami maleks short screen time is a scene stealer,2023-07-21 11:46:56
thank  he fixed the dialogue in this movie from tenet i don’t think i would’ve been able to make it through if he kept his “experimental” dialogue for this movie,2023-07-22 04:02:38
i think its up there for me with the prestige and memento as his best this movie is near flawless in its execution you can nitpick a little bit on the approach it should be more sciencey or it shouldve shown more of the bombing but it had a clear vision and it executed it perfectly nolan should be a serious contender for best director for this one,2023-07-22 04:55:36
easily his best since interstellar tenet was a mess even if it was very entertaining and dunkirk i just couldnt get into,2023-07-23 11:49:35
i feel he was able to pull out all the stops film making wise because he didn’t have to worry about creating some overarching meaning ala interstellar inception tenet etc it was a biopic after all he fully got to worry about and tell the stories between characters and figure out a way to convey emotions and feelings ie the background shaking behind him when giving the speech at los alamos,2023-07-25 03:38:27
i really enjoy how he plays with sound in here and dunkirk theres this abundance of sound and noise and theres this complete absence of it and the sheer contrast can create tension or drive the narrative i feel no one else makes movies so soundcentric,2023-07-21 08:36:54
nolan isnt responsible for any of the things you have him credit for,2023-07-22 15:24:04
hard agree huge breathe of fresh air coming off of tenet our boy’s still got it,2023-07-23 09:25:23
magnum opus vibes for sure and i thought he could never top interstellar,2023-07-23 09:43:56
the best part of barbenheimer is that i saw 2 films with not a minute of them wasted,2023-07-24 00:12:03
its crazy that hes made two of the biggest physics movies ever and one was all about revolutionary cgi and the other one was completely free of cgi,2023-07-25 05:00:18
i love to see cillian absolutely killing it after all these years as a side character in nolans movies after their history it mustve been a blast for both of them with cillian in the front seat this time especially with such an allrounder movie tenet was fun but it had issues  so im glad to see nolan come back so strongly,2023-08-09 14:16:10
what did you think of the way they “dumbed things down” for a general audience,2023-07-21 11:24:15
i havent seen it yet but from reading the bios of a few physicists in the early 20th century i got a feeling that theoretical physicists were often annoyed by haughty nerds with chalkboards and big ideas and no notion of how to turn them into reality im no physicist but how some of those theoretical physicists designed experiments to prove some of those things was incomprehensibly genius they should get more love,2023-07-21 12:41:20
how about the rest of it,2023-07-21 12:03:20
finally wonder who the next recruit will be,2023-07-21 21:20:16
the audience in my showing cheered so much at post credits scene it was amazing can’t wait for the next movie,2023-07-21 22:24:11
i made this exact joke to my gf as we were leaving lol,2023-07-22 08:34:52
i though the rocket raccoon cameo was excessive,2023-07-23 19:25:51
this would be top review on letterboxd,2023-07-21 22:16:01
"i laughed and found it a hilarious choice to put the big line in a  scene but what else is he gonna say

“it’s oppin’ time”",2023-07-22 04:31:12
"i thought it was so ridiculous too lol 

also that final scene of einstein and oppenheimer talking is turned into a very funny skit if you look to the background and see rdj walking sooooooo slowlyyyyy 


it doesnt even look meandering it looks like it follows ",2023-07-21 03:24:45
she also asks him to read it after he gives a summary of it implying she wanted to hear it in sanskrit but he just says the english translation anyway if they had to use the line here it would have made more sense to use the sanskrit line here and then the english translation when they say it the second time,2023-07-21 20:34:41
when it happened i rolled my eyes  after finding out the thematic tieins with feelings guilt and responsibilty i think it made alot more sense to have the line be said with that particular character  still a bit clumsy but im gonna give it a pass  i mean the line had to be in there somewhere its the whatchoo talkin about willis of oppenheimer,2023-07-21 06:17:41
"yeah that was really my only criticism the second time they used the line it felt right but it was already spent in that first scene 

it’s weird to waste such an iconic quote to a flirting bit maybe i’m dumb and don’t get it 

but who cares this movie was a 1010 gourmet  experience",2023-07-21 06:19:50
my buddy said to me walking out of the theater “ new kink unlocked just whisper historical  to me in bed” ,2023-07-23 13:38:55

100 this i physically reacted to the cringe because of how wrapped up in the story i was quickly forgot about it and loved the rest,2023-07-21 06:13:42
i agree those parts felt very pulpy,2023-07-22 01:02:20
that scene made me cringe,2023-07-21 06:05:16
i get they needed to establish that he read sanskrit for it to make sense that he knew the line for later but yeah it was a bit much,2023-07-21 06:22:24

very excited

to watch nolan finally

take home all the oscars


remember that one time sokka accidentally used an extra syllable in that haiku battle in ba sing se that was a sokka haiku and you just made one",2023-07-21 02:12:27
i can see it getting something for cinematography and sound but not much else maybe cillian,2023-07-22 07:58:37
finally,2023-07-23 20:02:44
if this doesn’t win nolan a best director oscar i don’t know what will ,2023-08-14 11:43:56
"i think that tracks with what actually happened

 at the time of detonation the surrounding mountains were illuminated brighter than daytime for one to two seconds and the heat was reported as being as hot as an oven at the base camp the observed colors of the illumination changed from purple to green and eventually to white the roar of the shock wave took 40 seconds to reach the observers it was felt over 100 miles 160 km away and the mushroom cloud reached 75 miles 121 km in height

",2023-07-21 13:43:07
"the explosion itself is only one part of it 

the entire 10 maybe more minute sequence preceding it slowly building up the tension is one of the most amazing things i’ve felt the level of tension achieved the explosion itself happening and then the tension shooting right back up there when you realise that any second the sound is going to get loud 

nolan always hits for me but whereas i’ve loved his other movies for the way he takes a scientific concept and  with it this one i think comes out on top for the way he crafts tension and uneasiness

edit jfc i sure love the word “tension” tonight saw it 30 minutes ago the feeling is very fresh on my mind",2023-07-21 23:09:17
"it should have been fairly obvious there would be silence since all explosions in the movie are sound delayed like in real life

there will likely be analyses of each scene for how far away the explosion is from the viewer",2023-07-21 14:29:48
it was amazing,2023-07-21 10:34:07
the previous test explosions before trinity test also had delayed sound in the film trinity test wasnt the first,2023-07-21 15:53:14
legit i have never experienced this in a movie before the anxiety of it all was unreal i could feel my heartbeat raise with each tick of the timer going down,2023-07-21 13:57:10
during the countdown myself and everyone in the theater imax sat up and braced for a boom but it didn’t come not in the way we expected and then we let our guard down leaned back and then the boom came in the gym scene and some people legitimately let out a scream it was a horror scene,2023-07-21 19:23:09
was also set up perfectly by a scene or two before it when they show some tests and the sound delays too great decision considering people may think the sound cut out on accident and take them out of the scene if it hadn’t been done sets up the rules of the world just before it as a primer whew,2023-07-22 02:48:23
i wish the dude right next to me had the decency to not start eating popcorn during this exact scene lol,2023-07-23 06:55:44
im a manager at a theatre and i was taking bets on what would happen during the explosion a lot of people said huge sound others figured thered be a harsh ear ringing but im proud to say i figured itd be silent i likened it to the hyper speed ship scene in the new star wars the silence is chilling,2023-07-22 04:15:29
"i thought that they were going to keep it as silence but go the route of showing the attacks of hiroshima andor nagasaki and give sound then

much prefer what happened though",2023-07-24 16:38:54
really is all the time you need for the horror of it all to set in,2023-07-26 04:16:18
bro they started  out of nowhere  it was lit,2023-07-21 21:58:27
the movie is about the creation of the the deadliest weapon ever invented yet a few harmless scenes of  and nudity is what suddenly makes it inappropriate for teenagers,2023-07-24 02:06:41
"it was rated pg12 in here and having just seen it there is absolutely nothing r about the movie

kids wont probably enjoy the movie because its ultimately a biopic but whoever gave it an rrating is a ",2023-07-21 23:12:16
the non imax 70 mm presentation had two previews one for the paul giamatti movie and one for the new exorcist wasn’t bad and the projectionist pointed out the paul giamatti movie was partially shot in 70 mm,2023-07-21 03:11:34
i saw it in a digital imax and it had the full 20 minutes or so of previews,2023-07-21 03:57:54
my 70mm showing didn’t have this got like 15 minutes of trailers so less than usual,2023-07-21 06:59:05
emily blunt in the third act definitely deserves some awards attention,2023-07-21 06:44:58
my theatre had the manager come in and give a spiel about how there would be no preshow and no previews because that stuff is all on digital and this was being projected on film so the digital projector wasnt set up and it would probably be the last movie they would project on film then the start time was 10 minutes after showtime to account for people who thought to show up late to miss the nonexistent previews so they wouldnt interrupt the movie,2023-07-22 20:33:14
don’t forgot music and sound mixing that was insane,2023-07-21 03:57:10
the trinity test basically ends at exactly 2 hours in,2023-07-22 05:35:44
70mm imax at amc citywalk had trailers they had their duallaser projector showing trailers and then kicked on the film projector after a 30 second changeover,2023-07-23 07:55:05
ugh we had like 30 minutes of previews for my imax showing it was super annoying since everyone said there would be none and it was at one of the most well known of the legit imax theaters amc universal citywalk,2023-07-24 11:20:06
my 70mm showing had no previews but thankfully started at the usual 20 mins after the stated show time,2023-07-23 21:26:29
i just saw it in the bfi in london in imax 70mm we had trailers at the start but no adverts to my recollection they showed a trailer for tokyo story the bfi were doing screenings of it the first slam dunk gran turismo napoleon a haunting in venice blue beetle and killers of the flower moon after the trailers someone who worked there gave a quick spiel about turning your phones off and asked us all to give a quick round of applause to the projectionist shout out to alex it looked great which was nice,2023-07-26 16:19:45
my showing started 50 min late due to technical issues ,2023-07-23 02:40:31
i hate it but at this point for a movie night i feel like i’ve been trained to accept a 20 minute buffer i was standard format and happy to have some buffer or arrive later andor get a drink,2023-07-23 11:42:43
i was in an imax 70mm and there were no previews but the movie still started 20 minutes after ticket time as if there were,2023-07-25 00:13:32
our 70 mm imax started 30 minutes later than the start time and had no previews wish they would have said it would start late so i wasn’t stressing in the popcorn line it was definitely for the stragglers because so many people were still coming in that late,2023-07-26 02:28:27
my imax 70mm did actually have ads lol,2023-08-10 02:56:19
"i dont get not liking the last 13rd it was everything the anxiety the claustrophobia the bomb looked cool but the chain of events that followed is what mattered and its perfectly capped by the end conversation with einstein and the culmination of rdj being so consumed by his own ego and greed that he couldnt imagine  oppenheimer and einstein might be talking about something more important than him and how it resulted a 40 year cold war and arms race that triggered how many global conflicts 

its presented as oppenheimers tarnished reputation and fight to maintain his integrity but its also so much bigger than that

how quickly this many scientific achievements isare hijacked by politicians and power hungry egos that dont look at a broader picture or the longer timeline once the knowledge is loose the people that understand it most are sidelined for people who can take advantage of it",2023-07-21 07:08:00
rdj really was great would love to see him as the lead in one of nolans future movies,2023-07-21 06:25:59
can’t believe people were making video eassy about how cinema is dying,2023-07-21 02:16:47
einstein was like that in real life i recommend the book quantum by marjit kumar though his greatest achievements were behind him throughout his career all the greatest scientists in physics still sought einstein to bounce their ideas off of him and see how he felt notice i said how he felt not what he thought he was respected for his intuition he guided other great geniuses some better mathematicians or simply more intellectually capable than himself with his intuition he would say things like ´there is something there´ and that was all they needed im talking people like wolfgang pauli niels bohr enrico fermi gods of physics they all wrote him with their latest work to ask what he thought of the direction they planned to take it,2023-07-21 12:33:59
my favourite part of all nolan movies is the old sage figures nicola tesla in the prestige alfred in batman,2023-07-21 10:52:59
im actually japanese and my grandma lost 3 of her siblings from the bombs that cheering scene kinda made me sick to the stomach lol glad nolan was able to portray the moral ambiguity,2023-07-23 11:02:14
0 i feel you which part of asia are you and your wife from im currently reading a fascinating book called rampage about how filipinos were affected by the japanese invasion during wwii absolutely heartbreaking and i can understand how watching this movie would be so emotional for the both of you,2023-07-21 11:29:47
yeah even in a cast full of geniuses einstein felt like he was another level when it looked like the atomic weapon could destroy the world oppenheimer immediately run to him for help like a kid seeking help from an adult,2023-07-22 21:47:58
the woman in the seat next to mine was sniffling when the movie finished and ended up sobbing by the time most people had left the theatre she was with someone who seemed to be comforting her so i felt i’d be intruding if i asked whether she was okay but i did wonder if she may have had a viewing experience similar to yours,2023-07-22 12:47:03
the look on einstein’s face walking away from oppie made me wonder what they discussed i’m glad we got the tie in at the end,2023-07-24 04:05:12
the japanese should thank us honestly we gave them 40 years of growth for rebuilding their institutions and they kept the emperor,2023-07-22 00:47:08
i didn’t know rdj had it in him i was surprised,2023-07-24 04:01:28
good acting or not this movie got a lot of people confused myself included and it was all over the place,2023-07-21 11:36:17
"you mean the guy from pearl harbor and he had a scene where he was talking about pearl harbor

good on josh hartnett he was great when he came onscreen i assumed it would be a smaller part but he has a ton of screen time",2023-07-21 21:20:43

"it’s interesting to see david dastmalchian pop up in a nolan film at a completely different stage in his career the last time he worked with nolan he was still doing wendy’s commercials and now he’s working with some of the best filmmakers in hollywood

also it was nice to see alden ehrenreich in a good movie again the last thing i saw him in was cocaine bear which was eh at best and he wasn’t very good in it either",2023-07-23 14:55:31
"the guy from numbers

holy  i did not recognize him at all",2023-07-21 21:16:34
crazy part about krumholtz is hed basically tried to retire from acting hed put his resume in to get a job at a car dealership before he got this role,2023-07-21 23:54:06

i was shocked that gary oldman was in this film did not recognize him at all

but who was the sympathetic old guy in the interrogation panel he who looked like abe vigoda",2023-07-21 21:35:35
if you didn’t catch it glasses from full metal jacket was portraying vandervar bush  father and grandfather to two us presidents,2023-07-26 06:34:13
nolan is a fan of film macon blair was in this which means nolan has seen green room,2023-07-26 10:11:45
no one mentioning ian from  drive,2023-07-28 04:18:51
you would never think such actor list could happen in one movie its something from a fancasts worst of all time given how improbably it would have been to happen yet it happened and as a cherry on top it has several oscar winners with like 5 mins combined screentime,2023-07-22 05:46:35
i forgot hereditary boy was in this quite a few young faces i was surprised to see him meg ryans kid dane dehaan josh peck and rodrick,2023-08-09 14:27:42
dont forget ajax from the warriors,2023-08-05 04:56:04
you didn’t think it was distracting it kept pulling me out of it the producer from review james urbaniak was in it for literally ten seconds and had just one line remi malek had to appear in three separate scenes before he actually said anything at all my friend and i were joking that maybe he was just gonna be completely mute throughout until he turned up at the confirmation hearing scene at the end i would 100 have preferred if all those smaller roles were filled by less well known actors oldman included although he was admittedly very good,2023-07-26 10:05:27
i thought the scene surrounding the target list was a dark horse candidate for best scene of the movie that was when the gravity of the entire thing finally hit me namely we are stepping out of the theoretical into the practical and the world will never be the same to think that cities were struck or chosen due to honeymoon and culture is highly unsettling then again is there any “good” way to choose where to drop a nuclear bomb,2023-07-21 05:10:45
were those details you know from american prometheus i might read it now,2023-07-21 04:15:06
i thought the scene with pugh and the become death line was very art house not bad arthousy and metaphorical very well performed thematically appropriate and controversial to the viewership,2023-07-23 21:17:21
theres no historical evidence the stimson nixed kyoto because he honeymooned there its a pop history factoid that gets repeated so often most people just take it at face value,2023-07-21 18:18:20
during the scene where kyoto was crossed of the list there was a wild release of tension and laughter in my movie theater,2023-07-23 02:23:03
im pretty sure that i had my honeymoon in kyoto is more of a factoid but i loved that line reminded me of dr strangelove,2023-07-23 22:21:20
"

interestingly theres no evidence of that honeymoon story and stimson was generally closer to oppenheimers views on the bombs than the movie depicts",2023-07-27 07:26:02
"you are right also lord krishna doesnt really want to wage war in the first place he tries to act as a peace negotiator between pandavas and kauravasthe two families who are on war with one another but after the prince refuses peace terms with pandavas he is forced the correlation can be also found with soviet union and usa during the cold war oppenheimer wants peace terms between the two nation and tries to act as a peace negotiator but is put on the sideline by doing nothing dharma also translates to people born as a kshetriathe class of arjuna to do their prime duty which is fight taking a side of justice against injustice and prejudice no matter who it is up against 

i believe there is also a jewish tradition on warfare somewhat similar to this as oppenheimer is himself a jew says something like jews should avoid war at all costs but it is understood that sometimes war may be the only way to resolve problems and bring peace when all other attempts have failed it may be that a strike is necessary to prevent the enemy from striking first this is known as a preemptive war",2023-08-01 05:34:55
i felt that the way the line was said in the context that it was said while she is riding him was disrespectful as a hindu even cinematically i dont think it worked well  there would have definitely been a better way to incorporate that quote,2023-08-01 20:51:31
it actually felt cramped and short lol like you definitely couldve put more scenes and give more context and i wouldnt have even minded or noticed,2023-07-22 00:30:44
honestly feels like theres a 4 hour movie nolan could have done still without it feeling long,2023-07-21 17:47:08
didn’t look at the time forgot about my phone didn’t think about the bathroom for a movie that is a lot of talking wow a 3 hours well spent,2023-07-22 04:10:49
i do not understand anyone who said that movie was challenging length wise that felt like a  action movie in terms of the pacing the only problem was i had to ,2023-07-25 02:08:56
agreed on all accounts including the bathroom one haha i hope theres a directors cut with scenes that were removed for times sake i feel like i could have lived in that explosion moment for another few minutes just appreciating all the visuals,2023-07-23 17:15:26
the pacing is absolutely fantastic,2023-07-21 23:03:24
barbie felt longer imo,2023-07-21 22:36:19
"even though i drank almost a litre of apple juice during the film i didnt need to go to the toilet until an hour after the movie

x200b

seems like going to the theatre every week for the last 2 months has strengthend my bladder by a lot",2023-07-21 18:33:36
i remember one after the batman too ,2023-07-21 15:54:36
i wish i hadnt need to  in the last half hour my bladder was screaming and it distracted me from fully absorbing the impact of the last scene lol i was fully going in my head like lets get a  move on oppieee,2023-08-09 14:31:46
that scene was worth the whole movie for me,2023-07-23 21:19:02
i did and i had to kind of bite my lip cause i felt my eyes welling up i loved the film overall but i felt such a heavy cloud over me when it was done the world would never be the same again after that test and the subsequent bombing and it was just horrifying these days there are often threats of nuclear war and this and that but i imagined my grandparents who would’ve been 20 something when the bombings happened and how absolutely terrifying that must’ve been,2023-07-23 23:53:27
"it was a weird feeling seeing people cheer on screen for it the horror of oppenheimer and the audience having the knowledge of what had been unleashed 

i think it did a fantastic job at conveying the absolute power and overwhelming terror that nuclear weaponry brings",2023-07-24 00:39:46
i felt real terror during that scene the hair on my arms was standing up,2023-07-23 21:23:06
i felt emotional being reminded that if the atomic bombings happened 8 years earlier then my country would still be intact and there would be no ccp as it is today,2023-07-23 22:10:44
yeah i was super tense and legit nervous,2023-07-25 02:13:22
felt nothing that scene was underwhelming,2023-07-23 21:21:18
i feel like im going to do intense reading up on the subject before the second watch so i can get more of the context,2023-07-21 02:33:14
"as a history guy i noticed a lot of references to communism fascism the labor movement and the red scare that i wouldnt have comprehended so well as a younger person most of what i know about those things ive read after graduating college

like when oppenheimer mentions hes read all three volumes of das kapital if you know what that is then you know hes a genius because thats an extraordinary amount to read for someone whos not an economist or social science academic",2023-07-21 03:09:41
last podcast on the left just did a 6 part podcast on the manhattan project if you’re interested they go pretty in depth on oppenheimer’s life,2023-07-21 02:50:49
i think this film did an exceptional job of reminding you who it was talking about when they started talking about them again,2023-07-21 03:09:54
the biography it’s based on american prometheus is fantastic,2023-07-21 04:52:38
i liked it but i definitely wish i’d read a primer on the main players and wiki entry on the main events aside from the test and the bomb,2023-07-21 21:50:10
im a nuclear physicist and it was awesome seeinghearing the names of all the people i know of so well but i was thinking of how hard it would be for anyone not in my community to follow all the names haha,2023-07-22 02:43:39
haha these are my feelings a rewatch with subtitles i still had trouble understanding some of the dialogue just because of how fast they were talking and with a full historical context will make a huge difference,2023-07-21 09:42:07
as someone who knows the history reasonably well the film did a terrific job,2023-07-22 08:47:45
tbh my only regret was not reading a quick primer on oppie before going in i thought the execution was still masterful and the suspense was amazing but i was having trouble with the timeline for parts of the movie,2023-07-23 15:25:36
read the making of the atomic bomb by richard rhodes  it sits next to a people’s history of the united states for me as the two books everyone should read to understand the modern world,2023-07-23 02:40:03
"i read the book before watching the movie and it made me realize the film has two major flaws

first nolan never tells us why oppy losing his security clearance is a big deal literally all was needed was his wife or another scientist saying “if you lose your clearance you’ll be cut off from the rest of the work  you won’t be able to contribute at all” but alas as much talking as there was we didn’t get this line or anything like it so what was at stake unless you’d read the book or knew the history already  general audiences wouldn’t know

second nolan deafens us with music and sound effects so we can’t hear the dialogue i think i missed maybe 2025 of what was said it seemed when there were moments that were more critical he backed down on the musicsound and let the dialogue come through but many many times i was longing for subtitles",2023-07-21 15:23:02
visual masterpiece sure but not a cinematic masterpiece it felt like watching a movie version of a wikipedia writeup until the last few scenes,2023-07-21 08:47:13
yeah im not gonna pretend i didnt get a bit lostbored during some of the deposition scenes but thats my adhd  not the movies fault,2023-07-21 03:55:50
" should have paid better attention in 7th grade history

to be fair to yourself i don’t think any school history lesson will go into as much detail as that i have read the book american prometheus last year and even i was still struggling it was a lot to take in",2023-07-22 05:14:39
lol this people arent talking about this enough,2023-07-24 13:39:08
"there were too many white men thankfully some where old and some had accents but i’m way too  to keep track of that many and all their motivations

edit this is mostly a joke but also fr",2023-07-21 06:38:31
yeah a little of that was lost by me too but come on that first viewing youre just trying to take it all in,2023-07-21 02:34:05
i’m so glad i’m not the only one,2023-07-24 01:44:57
id really recommend american prometheus it took me a few weeks to read but it was worth it to be able to follow this movie and to know the history a little better,2023-07-23 01:13:58
i thought the  scenes were pretty wild and punched hard in an unexpected way florence pugh played her part so well,2023-07-21 11:25:26
i loved all the surreal parts and i think that was easily the best bit,2023-07-21 15:32:27
i thought it was brilliant with the way oppenheimer became  when they were peeling back his history but then it escalated even more and it was like oh yeah his wife is here for this thats f,2023-07-23 15:53:50
can’t lie that scene had me giggle a bit may be a bit immature,2023-07-21 11:22:14
that was one of my favorite scenes actually,2023-07-21 13:45:39
"yeah that was the most unlike nolan scene in any of his movies

i’m really looking forward to whatever he does next now",2023-07-27 19:14:13
yeah too bad he didn’t use that style anywhere else in the film i honestly don’t see how people can defend this mess of a movie,2023-07-22 00:45:28
ahahahahah genius,2023-07-21 15:27:53
you’ve been saving that up haven’t you,2023-07-22 09:30:22
thats gonna be the honest trailers name guaranteed,2023-07-23 00:28:43
"its not just a movie line  its factual



as secretary of war stimson took direct and personal control of the entire atomic bomb project with immediate supervision over general leslie groves the head of the manhattan project both roosevelt and truman followed stimsons advice on every aspect of the bomb and stimson overruled military officers when they opposed his views 
 that is best seen after military planners had selected kyoto as the most promising target in southern japan for nuclear attack stimson remembering his honeymoon in that city once again overruled his generals

kyoto had been favored for the very first attack but the committee opted to blitz hiroshima which was an important army depot and embarkation port within an urban environment targets in the south were given priority to boost possible invasion plans but the ancient city of kyoto was withdrawn because the us secretary of war henry stimson who had honeymooned there said it was an important cultural center and must not be bombed",2023-07-21 21:15:25
"were taking kyoto off the list because i vacationed there once with my wife

that wasnt the quote or the reason

12 citieswell 11 cities ive taken kyoto off the list due to its cultural significance

is the first part of the quote are you upset at the fact that kyoto is the most culturally significant city in japan it was absolutely the correct moral decision to take kyoto off the list 

it was noble for the us to even consider preserving the historical wonder of kyoto youre viewing it through the wrong lense",2023-07-24 12:32:53
whole theater laughed at that line in my showing i loved it,2023-07-21 18:57:49
why were u enraged my cinema busted out laughing lol,2023-07-23 11:00:19
why did that enrage you,2023-07-25 18:19:59
i can’t begin to tell you my disgust at this line this and truman calling oppie a crybaby  ,2023-07-24 03:56:10
there were a half dozen hilarious bits that flew over the audience seemed like no one knew if it was appropriate to laugh,2023-07-21 08:14:36
and did it without being exploitive of the event or victims or at least not taking the low road of a disaster movie type of scene he didnt have to show the bomb or the aftermath to communicate the horror of it,2023-07-21 07:41:50
its really the crux of the movie to follow up the assumed climax of trinity with the actual even more intense emotional climax to show you what the film is really about i love the placement,2023-07-21 20:17:24
"they didn’t explain it well but they had beef for a few main reasons 
1 strauss wanted to develop the hbomb and nuclear power but oppenheimer refused to support the production of the hbomb 
2 strauss is jewish and feels like oppenheimer is reducing his jewish heritage by being an adulterer and not following his religion enough 
3 strauss was a notoriously hardheaded guy and unforgiving and oppenheimer making him look  in front of the committee hearing  him off and he never got over it",2023-07-21 02:46:18
"i think the scene with truman really captured it truman dismissed oppenheimers guilt as if it was egotistical to assume that he was to blame for the bomb instead insisting that it was in fact himself that was to blame but almost in a proud way of it 

einsteins comment to oppenheimer tells him that being considered the pinnacle of a field invites the haters really 

strauss was just a hater hellbent on proving that perhaps oppenheimer wasnt a paragon at the end of the day humans are egotistical and that is just as much a fact of nature as nuclear physics",2023-07-21 03:06:39
oppenheimer publicly humiliated strauss and questioned his authority in the movie strauss uses his as justification to destroy oppenheimers reputation in the eyes of the american people,2023-07-21 02:43:45
"strauss at least as interpreted by this film had an inferiority complex and was embarrassed by oppenheimer publicly then when oppenheimer started taking the opposite political stance on development of the h bomb this resentment curdled into convincing himself oppenheimer is a security threat 

having read the book this is all based on fact but certainly played up i don’t think we know for a fact what alden ehrenreich worked out at the end 

strauss not getting his appointment was certainly attributed to what happened with oppenheimer but i must imagine they make that a lot clearer in the film than actual depositions would indicate",2023-07-21 03:15:00
yeah there were so many cool things i loved about the movie and im a total nolan stan enjoyed tenet even but i think i was too dumb to understand what was going on in the last act ,2023-07-21 03:12:10
there’s a new documentary on peacock called to end all war that gives good background on oppenheimer and the people around him i saw it before the movie nolan was interviewed in the doc as well,2023-07-21 03:13:47
"same but i would note this is a strength of nolan as a writer he treats his audience’s intelligence with respect and even if i’m not understanding what’s happening the emotions are always there for me to experience directly anyways like watching great shakespeare and then on rewatches i’m rewarded with piecing things together in fact his movies demand rewatches and not just for a flat feeling of familiarity or entertainment but a challenging stimulating task of further engagement and always getting something new from the movie

i’ve seen the dark knight and inception over a dozen times and am always picking up new things — i love it so so much itching for my oppenheimer rewatch already",2023-07-22 03:59:28
thing is you shouldnt have to do research its the filmmakers job to make the motivations clear,2023-07-22 10:54:49
same felt like the third and fell flat because it just wasn’t that interesting i wanted to see the aftermath of the peoplecommunities involved the emotions that were left with the scientists i just didn’t care if oppenheimer lost his security clearance stakes weren’t very highs imo,2023-07-21 04:26:44
same i had to do research after i got home and by the end of the movie i kind of figured out the timelines but it was pretty confusing,2023-07-21 07:32:33
strauss wanted to be the father of the h bomb and he believed oppenheimer’s opposition to the h bomb was due to ego and not ethical qualms strauss systematically destroyed oppenheimer so he could gain the power he believed he deserved,2023-07-22 23:33:37
the conflict between strauss and oppenheimer in the final act was supposed to be a metaphor for mutually assured destruction the little slights that kept building starting with einstein not acknowledging strauss were supposed to be like the escalation to nuclear war,2023-07-31 08:10:01
a dude behind me was talking about how the social network is his favourite movie before the movie started lol,2023-07-21 05:32:05
also structurally both revolve around their respective creations fb and the bomb with interjections from 2 different depositionshearings,2023-07-21 04:11:04
"i also noticed the similarity 

both films use depositions and hearings to flashback and tell the story but are still wildly engaging even during boring legal stuff",2023-07-21 02:50:00
cillian murphy as oppenheimer was definitely better than zuckerberg  he was still more human than the android will ever be,2023-07-21 15:46:45
this is a really really good comparison oppenheimer feels like a much more grand version of social network,2023-07-21 05:51:27
"bombastic sound mixing

x200b

literally bombastic",2023-07-21 18:51:01
the cross cutting between strauss’s senate confirmation hearing oppy building the bomb and the oppy subsequently being interrogated by the government reminded me a lot of social network’s cross cutting between zuckerberg’s various legal deposition scenes,2023-07-24 15:37:17
social network is exponentially better,2023-07-22 04:53:33
i found it more comparable to zodiac especially the last third that is all dialogue and crosscutting i think zodiac handled that a lot better nolans editing just wasnt there for this one im convinced jennifer lame is the most overrated editor in hollywood,2023-07-21 07:57:11
i don’t see it myself other than them both being starstudded dialogue driven films,2023-07-22 16:39:23
i was just telling my bf how i loved nonlinear plots like the social network and now oppenheimer,2023-07-22 05:22:53
let’s not forget the creators of something that fundamentally turn our world upside down one geopolitically and the other sociologically,2023-07-22 23:32:14
"it’s funny you should say that i came into the theater thinking that this was a fincher film it felt like a fincher film at first but then the scenes felt disjointed and not in a way that flowed but in a “trying too hard” way and i was super confused

then there were really dramatic creative choices like the scene in the hearing where oppenheimer and his communist girlfriend appear  and i thought “holy  this is awesome what a bold way to show that this is at the forefront of his mind during the hearing”…and then that stylistic element is never used again like when he breaks down and admits that he had moral quandaries that would have been a prime opportunity to show the burnt bodies of the bomb victims behind him but no instead we get shaky cam

if this movie proves anything about nolan and his filmmaking it’s that he desperately wants to be david fincher but completely lacks both the intelligence and creativity to pull it off 

it’s too bad an “oppenheimer” movie by david fincher would absolutely have been the masterpiece everyone here seems to have deluded themselves into thinking nolan’s is",2023-07-22 00:42:58
peak not peek,2023-07-21 20:32:22
holy  i had this thought right in the beginning,2023-07-21 07:15:44
i dont understand why nolan suddenly decedided to make people understandable,2023-07-21 13:09:40
what tension are you talking about  it was a snooze fest,2023-07-21 07:54:09
i struggle to understand this as i haven’t seen the social network how could the creation of facebook be compared to the atomic bomb,2023-07-21 04:07:29
i’m very glad i had no idea the back bones of this story and came in blind except for the bombings of course those reveals and hate was so good and i liked teller until the end,2023-07-21 04:02:59
,2023-07-21 03:56:37
shame she was in it for 5 minutes,2023-07-21 02:55:42
and interestingly out of everything as well,2023-07-24 17:42:00
it wasnt just you in a couple of the shots there is what very much appears to be a gloved hand on the back of her head holding her underwater,2023-07-23 00:47:23
were in the everybody likes it so i must find reasons to dislike it phase of discourse give it another 6 months and well have moved onto it might be flawed in some ways but its still a great film,2024-01-01 19:09:24
it was an amazing movie unfortunately the general population is braindead,2023-12-30 05:49:15
amen i just finished it honestly i thought it was  awesome then out of that excitement you come here just to read all these niche selfaggrandizing critical comments super annoying lol,2024-01-12 05:10:31
"i know what you mean but i actually think some of these comments are justified the first time i watched the film it did feel lengthy but ultimately i enjoyed watching it 

i just watched it a second time last nightstill hadnt come to reddit and two thoughts were on my mind after the movie the first being the moment they let off the nuke the blast was almost laughable it looked nothing like we are led to believe a nuke blast looks like seemed more like someone blew up some gas barrelsno mushroom cloud nor powerful shockwave very underwhelming

the second was how nolany the movie was it seems the last few movies ive watched from him have all the same structure im not a good movie critic so im not sure how to label it but its like he builds you up with all this info and then big twist andor reveal and because his other couple movies were structured the same way you could see the twist coming a mile away im mainly referring to strauss being overconfident hes going to win then getting shut down by hillramis character maybe its not fair to say that since this was my second watch but maybe it is because my first time i was trying hard just to follow the charactersstory so much that i couldnt actually judge the movie correctly 

i still bought the movie it is good enough for multiple play throughs and i love nolan films but i would like him to go a different route as far as how he sets up his twists if he continues making films i dont want to be able to guess it because ive watched other films hes made thats really the only thing i would want him to work on as a filmmaker",2024-01-13 16:02:45
"this is why when i see a trailer for a movie and go im going to watch that then when i watch it a year later im still blind on what people think of it i prefer to watch movies at home i dont go reading up on a movie until after ive seen it to not put any preconceived notions in my head as i watch it

i personally enjoyed the ride oppenheimer offered overall one feeling i had though is i wish they would have gone deeper into the creation of the atomic bomb more on a technical level seeing as the movie is 3 hours long thought there would be time for it lol understandably to make it work for modern audiences guess it could be too dry for such details though lol",2024-01-10 06:34:32
there was definitely some gravity to this character given in a movie that was introducing new characters left right and centre he got quite the introduction through obscuring his face for his opening lines of dialogue it was almost like you were meant to recognise who the character was once you saw casey affleck,2023-07-21 06:25:53
guy went across the atlantic to  communists in a revolution he had no part in he was the original kyle rittenhouse,2023-07-21 03:24:04
would be his first horror film,2023-07-23 03:56:45
yeah so many characters and then trying to hear their dialogue was also a problem i really wish a lot more cinemas would offer closed captions,2023-07-21 09:37:07
thought i was the only one hard to follow sometimes but maybe that’s my brain’s fried attention span,2023-07-21 07:35:46
i think it’s partly by design to induce the anxiety that oppy is feeling,2023-07-21 09:55:22
yeah i’ll say that i am a scientist who also has read a ton about the manhattan project and know many of the characters as historical figures it made it much easier for me to follow in that sense selfishly i appreciated that nolan didn’t bother to explain everyone but also for a mainstream film it seems like he should have the folks i watched it with had the same reaction as you though,2023-07-22 01:49:13
yeah it was dense and hard to follow anyone who says it wasn’t is either lying delusional or way smarter than i am,2023-07-22 00:51:16
i felt the movie was so fast paced almost like a nuclear reaction going off bouncing from scene to scene,2023-07-21 22:24:45
"one thing i appreciated was how it a name would be said and it would do a quick flashback to that person earlier in the movie made it a little easier to keep track

but yeah there were certainly some bits that i missed thinking about going to a closed caption screening next",2023-07-23 15:08:19
i dont think all the timejumping was necessary,2023-07-26 04:38:56
that’s why repeated viewings are required as such with any nolan film,2023-07-26 10:16:10
it’s definitely anticlimactic after the trinity test hard to care quite so much when the stakes are “will a middleaged man with a nice house who does not currently work for the military in any meaningful way continue to have a military security clearance he likely does not need”,2023-07-26 10:21:40
"theres a good summary of it on the wiki already 

basically rdj had a grudge against oppenheimer and wanted him disgraced and kicked out",2023-07-21 18:55:31
i might be the opposite i understood the third act pretty well and liked it the most it was the first two acts where i struggled to keep up,2023-07-21 19:20:08
i did i’d like to see it again a caption screening,2023-07-23 15:19:11
yes and you could feel the collective anxiety leading up to it too,2023-07-26 06:28:48
nah some  was talking,2023-07-26 10:07:44
completely the flash bathing the theater and everyone filled with knowing the weight of what it subsequently means,2023-07-26 06:59:11
a few people laughed a few people cried most people were silent,2023-07-26 15:54:15
my theatre was silent for the entire movie but thats usually the case in germany,2023-07-28 09:28:14
yup,2023-07-26 06:23:46
"i didn’t even pick up on it the first time around but it’s also funny to me the level of involvement in the others takedown 

strauss is constantly pulling the strings masterminding everything to get back at oppenheimer but when strauss goes down we don’t even see oppenheimer at all there’s not even any reaction from oppie or indication he had anything to do with it at all kind of plays into the whole thing about strauss being insecure and thinking everything is about him",2023-08-06 01:00:31
saw it today and some idiots phone rang right as the silence began infuriating,2023-07-22 22:08:56
going in i wondered if they would give the explosion right away or would they let the sound travel so happy they went the latter route as that made it so much more impactful,2023-07-22 21:51:34
i mean it is gonna be silent because speed of light is much faster than speed of sound kinda like lightning makes a noise after a second of it being struck,2023-07-22 22:58:07
i’ll be honest the same thing crossed my mind 28dayslaternever4get,2023-07-22 00:36:16
,2023-07-22 00:51:21
sodo we lol,2023-07-22 00:45:37
cillian hangs  i don’t wanna miss that,2023-07-27 12:21:44
do… do we,2023-07-22 00:32:58
"thats how they marketed the film no 
a giant bomb behind cillian in posters countdown billboards all over hype around the explosion scene the trailer is literally only about the creation of bomb",2023-07-22 10:52:40
"its not really about oppenheimer either  its a cautionary tale for scientistsengineers working on ai

x200b

honestly im not afraid of sentient ai as theres no reason to believe thats possible",2023-07-22 10:24:48
"the last hour after the speech in the gym is the most important part of the film i feel

strauss and the government dragging oppenheimer through the mud just showed how
little the government cared about the well being of their top scientists using them and throwing them away when not needed 
also shows how petty the government and strauss were fighting oppenheimer on trivial things while oppenheimer is trying to make everyone understand the big picture in the future 

the last hour made the movie for me",2023-08-30 20:46:41
maybe but what happened after the war was incredibly important another example of a government using scientists until theyre no longer needed then throwing said scientists under the bus,2023-08-29 23:24:50
second half went on for too long,2023-08-28 18:38:17
the girl with the skin flying off her face is nolan’s daughter i thought that was pretty cool,2023-08-30 01:30:23
you and millions of others,2024-01-21 18:16:32
it was extremely  loud at my screening and not entirely predictable no,2023-07-21 02:42:14
definitely dont watch in imax then when its loud its loud,2023-07-21 02:42:24
its loud if dunkirk was a 10 this is a 9,2023-07-21 02:40:40
absolutely predictable you’ll know when to put them on don’t take them off until after oppenheimer walks past the bleachers,2023-07-21 02:38:17
some of them you wont predict and overall the movie is loud,2023-07-21 02:49:39
"i got some concert earplugs and wore them for the whole movie on imax   it was still loud  it not uncomfortable   

i wear those every time i go to imax though  im quite fond of my hearing",2023-07-21 04:04:10
normal dialogue is fine which is most of it but anything loud was very loud,2023-07-21 07:41:53
was right in the middle of amc dolby cinema it’s loud as ,2023-07-21 05:19:53
it was uncomfortably loud all the way from australia,2023-07-21 07:54:41
i am become deaf,2023-07-22 21:51:13
i saw laser imax and my apple watch notified me of 95 decibel levels couple of times there are a few audio startles too,2023-07-21 06:45:38
honestly first movie in a long time that felt good and not too loud,2023-07-21 20:32:01
my screening ended six hours ago and i still have a headache i also dont have tinnitus,2023-07-24 01:18:19
i told my friend the only positive i can say is that its certainly loud it was sarcasm it was very loud and not predictable,2023-07-21 02:54:25
one thing you didnt mention is i thought the moat incredible scene was when murphy is talking to the boardcommittee about his affair and emily blunt is visualizing it in real time its an incredible scene because its so bold and captures what an affair is like for the spouse just amazing i was stunned at how creative it was i have never seen an affair shot that way,2023-07-21 02:17:35
the strauss scenes with his counsel felt almost like a different movie maybe my favorite aspect of the film,2023-07-21 02:22:54
" but the heavy lifting oppenheimer does is propelled so much by the score

that was the first thing we all said walking out of the theater just an incredible score from start to finish

 speaking of that scene i know this isnt going to be an unpopular take but rdj was unreal in this movie 

also a point that stuck with me the entire movie hes playing the stoic voice of reason kind of the guiding hand for oppenheimer and then rdj just steals act 3 with his performance in the scenes in his office as he realizes he isnt going to win the game he so carefully crafted  that was awesome",2023-07-21 04:22:24
"“everything in this movie seems to be a direct result of something that happens moments or years before”

a chain reaction… omfg nolan",2023-07-22 04:15:46
re rdj i feel its not super surprising in a way hes clearly happy to show up and be rdj for a lot of stuff but word on the street is he and some other actors took massive pay cuts to be in this so you have to believe he was always going to give it his all,2023-07-21 10:17:39
yea i dont usually like rdj but he was great here,2023-07-21 19:59:45
is that me but the scene at the beginningend with enstein was different because it was from two different point of views,2023-07-21 13:35:39
im playing catch up on a lot of the historical events  figures but what exact event was it that oppenheimer mocked strauss great review btw,2023-07-22 06:44:22
i thought that was brilliant,2023-07-23 03:55:57
i jumped in my seat i could hear my heart pumping in my ears in that anticipation for the actual boom wow what a scene,2023-07-23 04:50:06
that was such a masterful decision and being in a packed theatre in total silence with everyone i assume like me taking it all in was worth the price of admission alone,2023-07-23 07:11:49
yeah the third act was so  thrilling might be my favorite part,2023-07-24 02:38:08
when we first saw josh hartnett sleeves rolled up bangs in his face covered in grease i was just like you cant be here youre too hot to be a scientist,2023-07-21 03:11:47
i truly believe nolan knows his mixes get lost at times and favors the feeling you get when music swells and emotion takes over i think he picks and chooses what you don’t necessarily need to hear perfectly there’s no way he misses that imo,2023-07-21 02:26:24
i jumped when the explosion reached them at the observation site so harrowing,2023-07-21 02:33:44
"we were talking about how it was difficult to understand what people were saying at certain points while walking out of the movie my interpretation was that it could have been an intentional choice to make the viewer focus on the message of the scene not necessarily snappy dialog 

i feel like if youve seen the movie you get what i mean

many scenes seem to add to oppes character by making the audience feel a certain way about what they just watched that feeling might be confusion anxiety humor etc and those feelings come about whether you understand the dialog fully or not

idk just a take",2023-07-21 02:57:46
i can see robert downey junior getting an oscar nomination for this,2023-07-21 03:53:44
hmm i thought the mix was much better than tenet i only remember one scene that was hard to make out dialogue,2023-07-21 04:36:05
people actually doubted the mahomes of cinema,2023-07-21 02:15:44
subtitles should be mandatory for nolan films,2023-07-21 13:25:16
good to have josh hartnett back again i was like whos this lawrence guy im sure lawrencium is named for him but he looks like someone from the 2000s josh lucas no hartnett,2023-07-21 15:18:49
we were saying the same thing too on the way home from the movie how we wish there’d been captions bc so much gets missed between the accents and passionate speeches and musical score but we’ve gotten to the point where we watch most movies and shows with captions bc of outside noise and interruptions so we’ve grown accustomed to it unfortunately,2023-07-21 05:58:21
the mixing was my one complaint especially as a former film student its like i really want to enjoy this thing you created but youre making it really difficult sometimes dude important lines of dialogue are ineligible because he couldnt change the volume of the score,2023-07-22 21:58:37
i guess im lucky to love in non eng country they should screen it with subs as option everywhere,2023-07-21 19:52:58
sometimes i wonder if the loud noise of the imax camera can cause issues with actor dialogue nothing to back it up but it cant be easy to get good audio on close ups when there a huge clicky monster camera right next to the actors,2023-07-21 02:59:08
mixing was a little better than his other recent movies i can appreciate good music as much as the next guy but i feel background music should be in the background and amplify the scene with it being so prevalent it becomes distracting not sure if i just got used to it but it felt better after the opening 30 minutes or so,2023-07-21 07:12:26
people who witnessed the trinity test in reality also said it felt like the light went on forever in the 2 seconds of white so i also took it as the witnesses perspective of it being silent for so long before the shockwave finally hit,2023-07-21 07:35:41
"e observers must have stood there for 3040 seconds before hearing the booooooooom

40 seconds after the blast in real life and thinking back to the film it seemed about exactly that long there too knowing nolan it was down to the historically accurate second",2023-07-21 08:38:38
how bright was the glare,2023-07-21 04:51:37
agree with your point about the tingling feeling on wide shots of new mexico beautiful location and everything was shot amazingly,2023-07-22 18:57:47
the wide shots of the desert were absolutely stunning,2023-07-22 20:09:23
all of the poor lizards in the desert whose sleep was disturbed,2023-07-26 01:17:39
"for me it was all the names

to be honest i dont think most of the names mattered outside of a few like chevalier teller strauss tatlock and grove obviously everyone knows oppy

like with oppenheimers brother you dont need to know his name you see the character and remember its his brother same for most of the scientist you just know they are part of the team with different roles but their name arent important in history they are but not necessarily in the film plot

but that last 30 minutes or so knowing names and hearing them said is important it was definitely hard to keep track of names and then hear them said with the music and soft speaking",2023-07-26 04:29:46
i felt the first half of the movie was hard to keep up with so much quick dialogue lots of it crammed in,2023-07-26 04:38:53
yes watched it in imax metreon sf and definitely felt like i was missing dialogue in multiple parts of the movie not sure if it was mixing or the cinema but it definitely felt overlooked in some areas,2023-07-26 05:59:05
redlettermedia and a couple here on the internet had the same complaint i only had it with the scene where the white flash was happening in the hearing scene cant tell if it was intentional though,2023-07-26 04:18:28
this is so much better than tenet though i missed a few dialogue because its such a dialogueheavy film with so many characters english subtitles will certainly help,2023-07-26 04:03:15
im glad im not in an english speaking country so i got to watch it with subtitles i tried to ignore the subtitles and just listen as i feel you take in more of the movie that way not looking at the bottom half of the screen all the time but it was really hard to understand sometimes it was also way too loud in general though thats probably the theatres fault i should have taken earplugs,2023-07-26 08:26:28
i often times have a hard time catching dialogue in movies but didnt really have any issues with this one,2023-07-26 04:58:27
"i slightly disagree you can still demonstrate the main concept without diving too much into mathematical details

like how in thetheoryofeverything of course they arent going to show all the math hawking did but they still focused on the main outcomes behind all the work he did and discussed in the movie",2023-08-02 13:02:46
i agree they absolutely made the right call i remember taking advanced placement chemistry as a high school senior and a unit on quantum physics being introduced with the idea that some stuff you learned previously wasn’t entirely accurate but needing a certain level of background knowledge for any of the quantum stuff to make any sense this is not a documentary,2023-08-02 13:28:35
there were some very simple practical things they could have explained that informed the trajectory of the project that they were working on two bombs at once that the implosion of plutonium has to be so immediate and precise that most of the work was making explosives whose waves would lens through themselves that they only bothered doing this because its so much easier to separate plutonium chemically and would allow the mass production of bombs,2023-08-05 06:14:22
"i understand what you mean but still i couldn’t help but come out unfairly comparing the whole thing to chernobyl i suppose if they had been forced to tell chernobyl in a breakneck 3 hours a lot more would have been glossed over but it was really important with that show that the audience came away knowing what happened at chernobyl and why from a scientific and political angle 

it is very clear that nolan is far more interested in the psychological and interpersonal stories throughout oppenheimer but i did feel like the movie didn’t try to make me feel like i understood how the atom bomb worked and that left me feeling like i’d missed an enormous part of what exactly was accomplished i honestly would have preferred to be present for conversations that i didn’t fully understand the first time you can still appreciate the flow of ideas and brilliance of the scientists to work through and problem solve",2023-08-06 09:24:37
right like as a stem student it was best for them to only mention it not truly go into it bc not everyone wants to know it and not everyone can understand it which makes the movie confusing,2023-08-02 14:02:17
"just finished seeing it aside from a few really captivating  wellfilmed scenes like the trinity test this movie was a total mess

the bulk of the movie was 2 hours of nonstop fast cutting random 11 dialogue between oppenheimer and side characters and random jumps in timelocation there was basically no continuity to this story or allowance for the audience to be invested in oppenheimer or his story",2023-08-07 18:42:23
i agree except for nolans issue with human emotions this movie yes didnt bring much out of me but interstellar and inception both made me shed a tear or dozens dont let me leave murph ,2023-08-07 15:54:23
"im not a nolan fan  the only movie of his that i really enjoyed was momento  i would have skipped this movie because it was 3 hours long  but i got talked into a barbieoppie weekend 

as a tech worker i think the movie was aimed at people like me  many of us in the tech industry are worried about the lack of government response to the tech revolution  the things we have created have changed life on the planet as we know it  its eliminated a ton of jobs through automation  tech has made it easy to send false information to the masses  tech  social media has helped polarize our politics  and possibly worst of all technology has made it easy for people who already have money to grab even more of it because they can more easily reach the entire world  that is creating enormous inequality anger poverty hopelessness societal instability and oppression  

for me nolans movie was commenting on the type of person who creates  scientists programmers  we are abstract thinkers  so we are sometimes more comfortable thinking about codephysics than we are thinking about the consequences  so dont count on us to join the communists  we need other types of people thinking about the consequences and regulations for example the govt  

unfortunately the govt is full of people like strauss  truman  they are there for the power  and they want power because they are thinskinned insecure and easily feel bad about themselves  they want that power in order to fill that hole in themselves  

if this is the nature of leadership can we count on our leaders to do the right thing  or do we need to step up to make ourselves heard",2023-08-07 22:07:00
"that was a question i asked myself after watching it what was the message of the movie what point was he trying to make and i couldnt believe that we were supposed to leave the theatre just thinking that atomic bombs were bad because thats just too obvious i mean everyone knows this already

and i couldnt discern any actual new message or an actual point to the movie it was just three hours of boredom for me",2023-08-07 21:11:22
"well first of all i liked it i think the movie was really fascinating as a study of a human life and personality that objectively is one of the most important to ever live the movie had a lot to say to me about the drive for greatness morality loyalty ego and regret 

oppy was loyal to a point moral to a point in many ways a good man he sets these things aside to achieve the greatness he was capable of in the manhattan project and the movie functions as a trial of sorts for who he is as a person was his essential humanism offset by what he did to weapons development is he a loyal person to his friends or not 

i think his loyalty to his country and the morality of the bomb are sort of mechanisms to allow the audience to ponder the morality and loyalty of oppenheimer as a man and there is no correct answer but any movie that inspires us to think deeply on what is right and wrong is interesting 

oppenheimer made me think deeply i think it was a great movie",2023-08-07 21:06:50
" i would like someone to explain to me what they took away

i liked the sentiment einstein said to oppenheimer that people give you awards not to recognize what youve achieved but to absolve their own guilt unfortunately i dont think this fit into any larger narrative that nolan wanted to paint and i agree that the movie gave us virtually nothing to care about",2023-08-10 01:08:29
thankyou imo the movie was pretty bad and a horrible example of story telling i feel like there were at least three good stories that could have been told and none of them were told i feel like they told the story out of chronological order to cover up the fact that they did a horrible job telling a story  we didnt really see how oppenheimer was impacted by the mccarthyism and the loss of his security clearance they just didnt convey it so i was like who cares  it was like watching strangers for three hours it was the first time i went to the bathroom during a movie and knew that i wasnt going to miss anything and didnt really care how long i was going to take to get back,2023-08-07 15:41:59
but there was a big glass bowl and small glass bowl and they filled it with marbles…,2024-02-04 02:47:34
" chernobyl did an excellent job at taking a very complex idea and explaining it to the audienc

oh boy you should probably check out rchernobyl the reason the show seems so good at explained complex ideas is because 99 of the explanations are strait up wrong


dont get me wrong great show and if i heard craig mazen was directing  a project based on the greater new york phone directory i would watch the  out of it but its based on bad science and incorrect information",2023-12-11 15:57:17
i have a science education degree and actually teach fission and fusion and to be honest they did the perfect amount of explanation on the science they talked about how adding neutrons is how they split the first atom they talked about the chain reaction the differences between fission and fusion a little the problems with the h bombyou have to understand getting into the weeds any more with the quantum science would have only alienated people they gave the right amount for the general public i feel,2023-12-27 16:12:00
that is exactly what i want to say and the only thing i didnt like about this movie after watching this movie i have to go to the youtube and search how an atomic bomb work because i didnt understand it in the movie but overall that is one of the best one and i love it,2023-12-09 10:01:12
your comment is perfect exactly how i felt as well i really was hoping there was more detail into the bomb creation itself thats the one major knock against the film for me that i wanted to see more of,2024-01-10 06:48:56
yeah i was a little disappointed with that i thought the movie would be about the science but science was just window dressing you could have removed it and still had the same movie,2024-01-09 05:40:35
chernobyl was a limited series i believe if oppenheimer had the same runtime all the science will be explained too,2023-12-07 18:54:34
chernobyl was accidental which means the viewer wants to know what caused it the bombs were intentional the only thing that matters is it that it kills a lot of people it doesnt matter if its 220000 bullets or a single one,2023-12-08 15:49:46
if it was a mini series that non stop intensity of the score wouldve not been as noticeable but for a single 3 hour sitting experience it was a drag,2023-07-26 13:13:42
bro for real like come on nolan give me a breather at least one,2023-07-26 13:22:30
yeah that got real old real fast i was exhausted by the end of the movie,2023-07-26 17:01:35
the imax near me sucks the regular rooms have nice big leather reclining seats yet the imax has  tiny uncomfortable fabric chairs i dont get it,2023-07-21 06:25:01
i thought the trinity test scene was a letdown  didn’t blow me away saw it on imax,2023-07-21 08:02:14
can’t wait to watch this on my iphone,2023-07-21 03:11:55
im absolutely gutted that there are no imax screens where i live still very excited to see the film,2023-07-21 04:54:48
"guess you could say that scene was

rad

",2023-07-21 02:11:17
would seeing it in 70mm not be the ideal choice if i don’t have imax 70mm near me ,2023-07-21 02:22:25
i was only able to see it in 70mm but  it is beautiful on film sitting near the front i almost forgot it wasn’t in imax,2023-07-22 07:21:08
i want to rewatch it in imax but it’s sold out for the rest of the week for me lol,2023-07-23 14:38:24
the nearest imax to me is on the other side of the country ,2023-07-24 04:19:26
nah i wish i had just seen it in digital,2023-08-06 23:38:54
we haven’t seen killers of the flower moon yet healthy competition,2023-07-21 18:59:33
still processing that last scene,2023-07-21 18:58:09
loved the movie but i doubt they give it to cillian will have to split with flowers but i bet rdj gets his,2023-07-21 20:03:06
wait for more films to release in the next six months but nominations for those two feels guaranteed emily blunt probably too,2023-07-23 03:18:23
since her note was unsigned i took it as oppenheimer being unsure if she was murdered or not,2023-07-23 17:35:51
not an expert i got the idea that mr security guy whose name escapes me had her killed for reasons,2023-07-23 16:29:03
i am not sure if jean’s drowning scene is real or partly oppie’s imagination he probably suspected that she was murdered,2023-07-23 18:07:56
yup i thought oppenheimer had killed her,2023-07-23 16:42:18
i was thinking the same thing ive made it a point to see a lot of films with imax footage in a proper theater this being the first full imax film felt a little disappointing though if theres one thing this movie did was feel heavy i do think the large format added something but negligible id say,2023-08-03 11:54:43
definitely agree on the score it almost gets parodylike where every small thing they’re saying has some ultra dramatic soundtrack,2023-08-13 09:34:41
"strauss plot was very fascinating as if you see he is the only nominee from 1925 to 1989 to be denied by senate  that was totally unprecedented and never happens

he was a very peculiar character not as iconic as oppenheimer but a worthy advisory the angst and hatred of a man how he wanted to reign over oppie a fellow jew and how he wanted an h bomb to overdo him and all that


so many nuances this movie is truly a masterpiece not only did he make it 100 accurate and factual but he didnt push the barrier and still showed you lil entries and characters and facets of the time
nolan peaked here",2023-08-14 20:09:35
"i thought the strauss plot did work well as a sort of framing device that explained why we were finding out so much about oppenheimers life and helped to hammer home the big contradiction of why somebody who wasnt all gungho lets just nuke them all still wanting to lead the construction of a weapon of mass destruction

agreed that the movie was quite long and the score was overwhelmingly loud though",2023-08-14 05:05:21
exactly i thought i was the only one who didnt really care for that strauss storyline,2023-08-13 09:09:52
the theatre was soooo loud i wish i waited until i could watch it at home left with such a headache from the loud repetitive noises it’s like they think we will fall asleep or not feel emotional or stressed unless they slam us with the score i’ve seen many an action movie and scary movie in theatre and this sound level was so much worse to the point i really couldn’t understand what the people were saying at times,2023-08-14 02:18:58
the whole movie really relied on cillian murphys performance and everyone wanted to see a bomb go off the score was meant to give us suspense in a low stakes movie without the score it wouldve bored more audiences,2023-08-13 09:51:11
i think they could have cut a large portion of the psychedelic stuff at the start and the  scenes and it would have just made the movie better,2023-08-13 23:19:15
the imax theater i saw it in was  loud no joke this guy next to me had a napkin in his ear  definitely excited to watch it at home,2023-08-28 05:38:28
just saw it and i thought the beginning almost the first hour was really disorienting too,2023-08-28 04:20:26
yeah i was struggling to remember all the scientists names,2023-08-28 08:02:59
yeah defo struggled with some of the speech subs would help,2023-08-31 22:17:22
i think thats part of the point oppenheimer was troubled as a young man and struggled to find purpose though it was a bit confusing with the time jumps,2023-08-29 23:27:16
"nobody recognized gary oldman as truman

why do you say nobody recognized him",2023-08-31 04:17:37
i think i did not recognize oldman because there were so many recognizable actors that he totally flew under my radar since i did not know he was going to be in the movie in retrospect it seems rather obvious i guess but i feel like if you do not know and are immersed it is easy to miss,2023-09-03 22:24:50
its been discussed on reddit how badly people used to age in the old days oppenheimer himself chained smoked for decades and despite all that time outdoors in new mexico the man probably never used sunscreen,2023-09-04 20:57:36
"i found it interesting how they didnt bother to make josh hartnetts lawrence any older than just a bit of grey on his perfect hair you had there horribly old oppie kitty frank rabi and then good ole hartnett made me chuckle

i forget who it was but i could swear one of the scientists who was already balding in the main events of the film had a way fuller head of hair than before in that timeskip scene while oppenheimer suddenly was frail and hairless lol",2023-08-30 21:15:54
maybe not for the amount of visuals but i think the imax speakers really added to the experience,2023-07-21 02:44:42
nah the shot composition is just better in imax as thats the native aspect ratio,2023-07-21 02:43:20
agreed since this is a nolan movie it needs to be watched in theaters for the spectacle of it all especially the score and the loud moments but imax is not necessary,2023-07-21 02:37:16
i go to imax theatres not for the picture but because the sound is better,2023-07-21 09:25:54
its the sound this movie like dunkirk is mostly about the sound not the visuals so yes you should go and hear it in imax some tense moments had my seats rumbling and you cant get that in a usual theater,2023-07-21 08:41:36
i agree on the first point in that i believe there should be an imax theater on every street corner in america,2023-07-21 03:16:59
honestly id rather go to a theater playing this with captions rather than imax,2023-07-21 02:59:24
i think i would have liked to see this movie at a dolby cinema better sound system over bigger screen its unfortunate that by the time i can see it again it wont be on dolby anymore,2023-07-21 06:49:56
i fully agree,2023-07-21 08:04:35
yeah i was very underwhelmed by 90 of the cinematography it was all head and shoulder shots with heads center framed,2023-07-21 07:58:19
it’s a fine opinion and it’s lot like a normal theater will ruin it but i did find myself wishing i could see that extra detail it was a good looking film,2023-07-22 01:08:16
i agree with you not just that but after all the chatter about the visual effects i found the movie a little disappointing  was expecting to see more visceral scenes,2023-07-21 09:27:14
i’m glad i didn’t see it in imax or my ears would’ve blown with how loud it was,2023-07-23 08:01:15
what about florence pugh,2023-07-30 08:20:07
this dude is tripping hard holy ,2023-07-21 08:47:52
the 1431 shots in los alamos were absolutely gorgeous though many imax theaters dont show that aspect ratio,2023-07-25 06:15:45
yeah probably the last imax i’ll see unless someone  some movie makes a really good case saw tenet mission impossible and now oppenheimer in imax and i don’t feel it was worth the additional money or hype,2023-08-06 23:33:46
yeah i waited 2 weeks to see it in imax 70mm because it was so hard to find a showing with any good seats left maybe i’m just not a movie buff but i didn’t really think it made a difference also i had trouble discerning the dialogue over the soundtrack at times,2023-08-13 07:59:15
"i do not like to normally say “ both sides are the same”

but as far as terminally online idiots who see everything through a hyper politicalsocial lens  they are basically the same they never touch grass and everything makes them mad

watch twitter conservatives rant about barbie in ways that make little sense other than to a few hyper online conservatives",2023-07-23 15:56:59
its that the bomb was now in the hands of selfserving bureaucrats who are not going to use the bomb to ensure peace but possibly escalate things until the world ends  oppenheimer got used and the world is arguably a worse place for his achievement its not so much stakes as him having the rug pulled out under him and realizing the world wasnt ready,2023-07-23 14:01:41
"my feeling is that it was about power and respect and jealousy strauss thought that oppenheimer revelled in the position of being the most important man in the world and he hated it and that was connected to oppy being acknowledged by einstein while he himself was ignored but it was further cemented by oppys status after the bomb and his political power as a result of his fame strauss was basically  bent on taking him down a peg

thats what i took out of it i think it could have been developed more convincingly though",2023-07-23 13:56:48
"there are two this is not a trial scenes one for oppenheimer and one for strauss it demonstrates how a perceived slight real or otherwise can be escalated into an attack there is no trial only hearsay and ambiguity

the way atomic bombs would be used in escalating nuclear war between two countries

i agree that it wasnt 100 clear but i like it the more i think about it",2023-07-29 14:03:41
"the problem was that until strauss’s motivations were confirmed to be ego and pettiness you could have been forgiven for waiting for the other shoe to drop and assuming there was something more to it also what oppenheimer is set to lose security clearance is not particularly impactful as it’s not been clearly shown what he needs that for at this point in his career does he even want to still work for the military in any capacity as such does he really need the clearance isn’t he just going to go back to teaching or some other kinda research

and fundamentally however it plays out the fate of a single middleaged man’s career is inevitably going to be a thousand times less compelling than “can we split the atom and make a terrifying weapon that could potentially end a world war”",2023-07-26 10:35:55
" what were the stakes of the this is not a trial was it just because einstein blanked strauss one time

nope",2023-07-23 13:47:05
i kind of agree that the conflict wasn’t communicated well my impression was that mainly they disagreed on development of the h bomb oppenheimer was publicly against the h bomb program and as the leader of the atomic energy commission strauss wanted to silence him there also seemed to be some personal vendetta as well… oppenheimer embarrassed straus and strauss also felt that oppenheimer was basking in the attention from creating the bomb it was also like a microcosm of the overall  political sentiment at the time…the red scare meant that anyone not in lockstep agreement with the us was assumed to be a communist sympathizer,2023-07-23 18:25:04
i haven’t seen film like this in awhile hollywood used to make tons of these ensemble cast pictures,2023-07-23 22:17:33
"agree lots to unpack i had to go back saturday am because i felt like i had seen something i will need to come back to time to time

can you hear the music absolutely beautiful",2023-07-23 22:24:21
" after watching this i realize just how long its been since ive seen a piece of cinema carried by its acting story and storyboardingcinematography so much instead of a product thats simply on a much larger screen

this has to be the most pretentious way of saying “this was a good movie” i have ever read",2023-07-23 22:35:20
this one goes to 11,2023-07-24 23:28:43
when the bomb vibrated the seats,2023-07-24 23:47:51
i loved it,2023-07-24 23:40:31
dunkirk was way louder i remember,2023-07-25 03:03:58
"i recommended to a friend another movie that i enjoyed which was good night and good luck

george clooney directs a powerful ensemble that details the rise and fall of senator mccarthy and his efforts through the television reporters specifically edward murrow and coverage of the era",2023-08-01 09:21:46
yeah they did the same to basically every area of society pretty sure theres even a movie about how they did the same to hollywood forgot the name though,2023-08-01 05:20:13
"honestly need to understand a good deal of us political history to fully understand  would recommend googling for article or yt video it’s covered on the ap history exam so should be good details

the short answer is russia  communist and us was fighting russia",2023-08-01 04:33:55
i suggest reading into the history of the red scare lavender scare joseph mccarthy roy cohn,2023-08-02 04:15:09
well the root cause was the soviets they had just grabbed half of europe large swaths of asia and had an excellent spy network they leveraged that to start communist revolutions around the world and due to bad politics it looks like they were primed to do the same in the us mccarthyism went to far as you can see with oppie but there was a very real danger at the time,2023-08-01 17:27:14
just my own take but along with the babies constantly crying maybe a loss of innocence theme,2023-08-12 12:01:34
it was released in japan,2023-11-04 16:49:24
"100 with you on all this i was amazed that it managed to be even better on a second watch i thought that certainly i would feel some lulls or something post trinity testing but it really does just have perfect pacing even little nitpicks i had with certain lines were just completely gone even after reading a lot of negative things about the movie and thinking it might regrettably poison my mind 

i also agree how it all ties together to the ending and where it places in all the timelines is chef’s kiss definitely the best movie of this decade maybe the last ten years and thanks for reminding me i want to watch jfk",2023-07-31 23:56:20
i just watched it for the first time yeah i understood what was happening but i think i missed a lot of nuance and important details my friends that i watched it with understood it perfectly though i definitely really liked it though cilian murphy and rdj were incredible i think i’ll like it a lot more than i already do on a second watch,2023-07-31 23:32:31
it’s kind of how einstein was though especially later in life he would wander around campustown deep in thought lose track of where he was and have to ask random people for directions home he was also so forgetful a personal servant was assigned to him to make sure he didn’t leave his suitcase behind wherever he traveled his random aloofness and silly fashion were totally onpoint,2023-08-02 04:35:34
i kind of think oppenheimer will hurt cinema  it was marketed as a blockbusterthriller barbenheimer  but it’s a long slow heavy dialogue political science movie  you can have a couple of these things and still be good but not all at the same time,2023-07-28 00:18:23
i don’t get the point of imax for a movie that’s mostly board room meetings yes the test detonation was bombastic and well executed but it’s a small part of the movie compare this to top gun maverick where a large percentage of the film is spent in fighter jets it made more sense there,2023-08-04 09:41:19
the 70mm in the ontario regal was nearly flawless for me i only noticed a speck of hair at the begining but im assuming it was brushed off cause it was only there for a minute,2023-08-04 06:12:07
"  that sound is the most important quality in making a film

yep

by far sound conveys most of the emotion and quality

cheap sound makes a movie cheap but a cheap image can give it a lofi quality",2023-08-04 22:42:48
specks of dust would kind of fit with the recurring visual motif,2023-08-04 05:42:09
"also the score cillian murphy best director and rdj

but who knows the oscars can be weird some years and you just never know what turn up by the years end in terms of films",2023-07-21 02:38:57
it definitely bags the editing award,2023-07-21 02:53:37
lily gladstone is a lock for actress the rest so far is competitive between the two for now who knows what else ends up coming in,2023-07-21 08:12:58
killers of the flower moon have the oscar bait points so your guess is as good as mine,2023-07-21 03:27:26

don’t forget about the ,2023-07-21 03:53:57
i laughed at the scene where they say her husband  died of a broken heart about the affair and oppenheimer says no that’s not true… he never found out,2023-07-21 14:06:06
stalin pops up in the plot credit saying fine ill do it myself,2023-07-21 18:20:45

the end credit scene is einstein putting together a team,2023-07-22 21:50:12

yes the nukes being dropped on japan was in fact a good thing id clap too,2023-07-22 00:51:03
i had a similar feeling leaving the theater i thought i was walking in to see a movie about the manhattan project and the construction of the first atomic weapon and i left the theater having watched a biographical film about oppenheimer not complaining i enjoyed the movie but it wasnt the movie i was expecting to see,2023-07-24 00:13:31
it was never about science it was always politics and being the first to have a bomb i think thats part of the point,2023-07-23 23:59:35
i really thought they would spend more time on the very real crisis they had at the time when they found out they couldnt use the gun design for the plutonium bomb  getting the implosion right was one the most important and complicated tasks in the manhattan project,2023-07-24 00:50:52
"agree 110 with you too much politics and communism and very very little about the bomb and the science behind we never knew what the  was happening at los alamos and less we knew about the other facilities except one of them was gathering plutonium and uranium

i tought it was going to be more like the imitation game or chernobyl where you dont have to be an expert to figure out what was going on and you leave with a feeling that you understand more about those 2 events but with this movie i felt like i don´t know more of the a bomb and the context that i knew before besides the political context wich also dind´t got beyond yankees vs communist with little about the actual context of the ww2 of course its not a documentary but i believe a movie based on the a bomb should be able to explain a lot more than this movie did about it",2023-07-24 01:41:19
completely agreed it showed up for the first hour and they just gave up and focussed on the drama i also wikiholed this subject right after watching it ,2023-07-23 23:47:00
yeah today i was telling my dad he should go see oppenheimer and was sort of quizzing him about what he knew about histhe story going into it apparently he had previously watched a show called manhattan anyone recommend and he was the one educating me on the manhattan project and here i was thinking i was all cool and informed i do wish i walked away from this a tad bit more of an expert on the science and events surrounding his life but i guess i need to do the ol deep dive now thanks chris…,2023-07-23 23:41:15
"did anyone else laugh when truman called him a coward as he was leaving the oval office

i think he said crybaby",2023-07-21 02:35:56
did truman really do that or was it fiction,2023-07-21 02:38:36
anybody found it distasteful like it fueled my dislikeness towards the character,2023-07-21 10:43:33
"this was a very good writeup

to add to it a little i felt like the story was told through vignettes  bits of dialogue with no actual conversations there seemed little continuity or time to flesh out any character motivations when theyre limited to a few sentences at a time the time jumping further interrupted any emotional weight being built up

the movie didnt seem seem to offer any internal exploration of the ethics of creating the weapon until after it was made  now i can readily imagine the significance isnt really felt in full until after the bomb dropped but by not showing how he was able to rationalize it at the time it makes it appear like he hadnt really considered it

the  scenes were provocative but seemed in poor taste as they didnt give florence plugh any characterization beyond taciturn communist it was a visually compelling shot that really sold the intrusive nature of the interrogation but left me a little cold on how underdeveloped her role was

and finally i wish there was at least some effort to explain some of the scientific principles which is absolutely fascinating as  i would have liked at least a couple of examples of not just the theoretical challenges but also the technical and practical hurdles that had to be overcome for instance the gadget that they focus on was an implosion device to create a supercritical reaction you need to essentially have highly fissile material close together a hollow orb of plutonium is stable but if you had the same amount but as a solid ball it would instantly tear itself apart in an explosion  so the technical challenge is to make a hollow orb it is necessary to surround the entire ball in traditional explosives whose combined force implode the sphere into a solid  this had never been done and the challenge is making sure each explosive is perfectly synced to go off at the same time otherwise one explosion goes off first and scatters everything and preventing an implosion the other bomb was of a much simpler design and was thought to not even need a test as the result was more or less certain a movie about scientist doesnt even bother to make the actual science sexy  one of the best scenes in cinema history is the nasa scientists building the co2 scrubber in apollo 13 fit a square peg in a round hole",2023-08-11 05:29:49
"i just saw this movie and you described exactly what i felt to a t very well said

and that truman scene  easily the worst in the film…i thought they would be two great minds meeting and saying powerful things to compliment the truly extraordinary nature of the moment their own roles within it instead oppenheimer is sad and truman comes off as a simple minded  rather than the talented and burdened politician he was",2023-08-10 03:07:37
very well said reflects my thoughts exactly,2023-08-10 05:01:04
"im going to disagree on the clothing while as far as i could tell the mens clothing looked fine for the eras they were portraying the womens did not and there was also something off about their hairstyles as well cant put my finger on what exactly it was not enough skirts wrong styles of pantsuits and blouses but i was definitely going this doesnt look right a couple of times because these women didnt look like women in the media of the time nor in family photos ive seen from that era

on a minor note one of the people i watched the movie with pointed out that they used the wrong american flags during the victory speech there were only 48 states at the time",2023-08-14 04:59:04
yup the nuke looked absolutely terrible do what you like with conventional explosives or camera trickery but you’re never gonna be able to get a convincing mushroom cloud without cg compare the ‘real’ oppenheimer explosion sequence with the incredible cg one in twin peaks its embarrassing how poor it looked,2023-07-26 11:13:20
also nolan did use cg in a lot of this movie  the wobbly backgrounds and digital relighting in the gymnasium scene for one he’s clearly happy to use it at some points he’s just got a weird  for not using it at others,2023-07-26 11:14:54
1 was fusion 2 was fission or maybe the other way around they were both displayed pretty close together,2023-07-21 11:17:00
i wouldnt call it raunchy though it is explicit nudity you see florence pughs  during and after  scenes but its reasonably tasteful not raunchy and exploitive,2023-07-21 14:38:46
you do not see ,2023-07-21 15:09:32
to me the  scenes are pretty unnecessary and very raunchy one with lots of  then another with a woman on top of a man in a room full of people a imagined scene very uncomfortable in my opinion but it only happens twice,2023-07-21 14:58:36
very explicit  you see lots of boobage and its not subtle at all,2023-07-21 14:31:09
"and the prestige and then the dark knight trilogy

i think dunkirk is a masterpiece but its very different from all his other films still give it a watch too maybe dunkirk is actually the most similar one to the way oppenheimer was shot",2023-07-23 16:41:40
watch interstellar and inception next thank me later,2023-07-23 16:29:02
i saw that scene as einstein pondering the weight of what oppenheimer has just said to him and strauss taking it as a sign of disrespect,2023-08-05 14:48:41
"i saw strauss’s fixation on einstein’s silence as an early indication of both his own pride and insecurity to me at the time and later with the movie providing the context strauss was immediately comparing his own influence and renown to oppenheimer’s — and his fixation on einstein was just an extension of that he thought himself important enough that oppenheimer would convince einstein to hate him he was insecure enough to cling to that moment i don’t think the isotope humiliation is what made him want revenge in the film it just confirmed what he’d already convinced himself that day by the pond

einstein was just being himself and got pulled into some guy’s bizzaro villain origin story",2023-08-05 03:44:16
a lot of german speakers said it wasnt german either  maybe dutch with a german accent  or just bad dutch,2023-08-17 19:36:29
those are the 2 narrative layers 1 is the color section from oppenheimers perspective 2 is the bw section from rdjs perspective they run parallel throughout the whole film that’s why the chapter cards never reappear,2023-07-23 22:46:58
are you in winnipeg a group of teens walked into my screening halfway through dressed in pink and did exactly that,2023-07-24 20:23:22
"that’s upsetting because this wasn’t even a boring historical drama my nana has taken me as a watching buddy to everyone that ever existed — kings speech the darkest hour etc

but this one i genuinely found riveting and paid attention the entire time it was that well done",2023-07-24 20:52:58
it seems like me and my friend were the only 18 years old or near my age interested but nolan is my favourite director and cillian murphy is one of my favourite actors so i was always going to watch it,2023-07-24 21:33:55
the hype definitely brought in people that otherwise would’ve skipped it the guy next to us showed up late with his group and checked his phone literally every 30 seconds  ridiculously annoying afterwards i overheard him say “that movie was  really boring and it didn’t even have any twists” i’m really not convinced he knew that it was nonfiction,2023-07-24 22:33:35
i took it as strauss side of the story black and white very oppie color,2023-08-05 21:41:30
do people criticize nolan id thought he generally gets praise,2023-08-15 07:34:55
if it wasnt for nolan at the helm another director might have tried to tell the story visually in a linear matter as a straight forward biopic which would have been a much better movie to do a movie like this and make zero effort to depict the suffering caused by the atomic bomb actually goes beyond bad filmmaking it is evil,2023-08-20 13:07:17
jason clarke plays an  so well,2023-07-21 02:35:22
didnt feel the 3 hours at all i couldve sat through another hour,2023-07-21 03:31:05
"completely disagree on the length 

my wife and i were literally 2 mins ago talking about how we were engaged the entire film",2023-07-21 03:35:21
that ending did not feel like it was even emotely trying to invite an applause type reaction,2023-07-21 09:48:51
"the type of audience that are going to rush to an imax 70mm theatre to watch oppenheimer on opening day are likely not the same people who clap at the end of movies

i cant remember the last time ive seen clapping on a premiere for a more serious movie

that said i do think plenty of people will find it boring due to the runtime but i also think audiences in general will still love the movie",2023-07-21 09:46:45
no clapping at mine but i feel in england i’ve only ever seen an audience do that once and i think they were just hyped,2023-07-21 20:56:30
yeah i gotta disagree on how long it felt i couldve watched it for another 3 hours,2023-07-21 03:45:50
honestly didnt feel long for me when it ended i was surprised,2023-07-21 09:01:48
general audiences are  dumb,2023-07-22 03:32:58
"it is a great movie and i probably give it a 910

i did kinda feel the length too  dont get it twisted i was engaged 100 and didnt check my watch  but i couldnt watch this movie again for awhile i dont think  by the time the credits roll it does feel like you spent a full evening at the theater",2023-07-21 06:21:21
no clapping in my theater i liked the visuals but why did the closeups have the actors ears in focus and not their faces there was so much blurriness then after 10 seconds the actor would move a little and get in focus albeit their ears out of focus i thought that was  cinematography different characters had close ups with their ears as the focus,2023-07-21 02:51:31
completely agree with this,2023-07-21 05:52:41
a cinemascore,2023-07-22 22:14:31
no but the trailers did make it seem that the bulk of the movie would take place at los alamos and also involve leslie groves more which it could have been if it had been cut to like 2 hours or so,2023-07-21 10:19:01
the media marketing didnt help much i loved the movie i would take another hour it didnt feel slow but i would take 1 or 2 more explosion scenes or tests,2023-07-21 20:22:50
sounds like me when i was a young kid traveling by ferry and the boat had a cinema showing jfk was completely not what i was expecting and i couldnt understand it at all,2023-07-21 10:32:52
it takes 2 hours before the bomb goes off then immediately its dropped on japan off screen and were jumping to senate confirmations and a committee hearing where the stakes are a guy losing a security clearance he doesnt need anymore,2023-07-21 10:31:53
i forget the exact phrasing the judge essentially asked if isotopes were important to the development of nuclear weapons which rdj had said very confidently they were cillian murphy responded by saying they were as useful as a cold beer or a sandwich essentially saying rdj didnt know what the  he was talking about,2023-07-21 18:27:31
"honestly i think it was out of respect that he didn’t making a spectacle out of the actual bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki would have likely done the opposite of make people ponder the consequences they probably would have just thought it was cool 

i think would i have been a japanese person seeing that would be extremely emotionally difficult",2023-07-22 02:41:55
"jfk was also the president who awarded oppenheimer the enrico fermi prize that served as a redemption for oppenheimer

jfk got killed before so lyndon johnson handed it over but that doesn’t change the fact",2023-07-22 06:34:06
for me it was benny safdie i thought he stole every scene he was in,2023-07-23 03:22:06
kinda surprised your including malek in this i thought he was a little wasted,2023-07-23 03:24:22
"i had the exact opposite experience somehow people on both my sides started scrolling insta and i saw some people leaving 

worst part is the guy on left was a friend i came with i didnt wanna create a scene so i just watched the movie in peace",2023-07-23 14:18:51
"it might be part of the larger mi  barbenheimer rare theater phenomenon but it struck me that this was the first movie ive had difficulty finding tickets for since  sheesh i honestly cant recall 

i dont even live in a major market and it took me a good hour of browsing fandango to find the number of seats i needed at a theater in driving distance",2023-07-23 14:32:44
same at my theater even when the movie finished while people were walking out it was silent,2023-07-23 15:33:25
saw plenty of people on phones in the theater for the last hour and a half or so yesterday first showing of the day too,2023-07-23 14:13:56
same our theater was packed there was one couple that left with like 30 minutes remaining why did there for 25 hours and not just wait it out to the end,2023-07-23 14:19:45
"with very few exceptions eg teller the vast majority of the scientific community supported oppenheimer during the security hearing after oppenheimers clearance was revoked 494 los alamos scientists signed a petition that was sent to eisenhower and the aec strongly protesting the decision 

in los alamos the events felt personal said lab historian roger meade for the junior scientists oppenheimers treatment caused a visceral reaction and they felt that the oppenheimer incident was an attack on science not just the man the sentiment of the scientists was were here to do science  and now theyre attacking the man that led us here

furthermore strauss actually released the full transcripts of the security hearing basically salting the earth after already destroying oppenheimers public career however the move backfired and further cemented the opposition in the scientific community against strauss as it did amongst his detractors in the senate",2023-07-25 16:58:27

gary goldman was incredible dont let that crybaby back in here",2023-07-21 16:47:31
he spooked me how be just popped up from nowhere at the end like some benadryl shadow entity,2023-07-21 20:46:11
explosion scene should have been awesome but it was kind of meh  i feel bad for anyone seeing this after barbie  barbie wasn’t even particularly good but it tried to be fun at least  oppenheimer wasn’t fun in any way  the social network is a comparable movie to oppenheimer and it wasn’t “fun” but it was sooo good and engaging  oppenheimer was none of those things,2023-07-27 03:39:59
my biggest thing is what you said about straus it kind of comes out of left field and doesn’t feel that important i think nolan made the most entertaining movie possible given the subject matter but i like when he does scifi or fiction,2023-07-28 04:37:03
i agree regarding the actual explosion watched this in imax on the edge of my seat and it just didn’t capture the reality of how powerful the bomb should’ve been in my opinion it visually disappointed with how much buildup it had and it wouldve been more than forgivable to just go the cgi route and make it a bigger spectacle,2023-07-28 09:14:27
yeah i didn’t get the weight of the security clearance thing at all  at the end they also said they’d lose the house or something but it wasn’t clear  what was so good about the security clearance,2023-07-28 00:16:33
"absolutely it also weirdly made me cry in a good way i think 

that last line tied the whole film together wonderfully while also making the audience really feel the existential anxiety oppenheimer had been grappling with for most of his life",2023-07-31 01:41:45
i loved the movie but do agree that los alamos definitely would do well with the hbo miniseries treatment i know that wgn did a los alamos tv show but from what ive heard it was very heavily fictionalized and dealt with mainly fictional characters and also was cancelled before they could get to the bomb,2023-08-20 16:20:42
yeah i felt like he had too much going on that nothing felt like it was resolved at the end,2023-08-20 03:06:51
"i have been hearing from people that it glorifies the entire atomic bomb  hiroshima  nagasaki thing 

there is 0 chance anyone saying this have watched the movie i have a hard time believing anyone could see oppenheimer and come away with the impression that it glorifies atomic weaponry",2023-09-07 21:09:19
i read that bw is rdjs characters perspective color is oppys perspective,2023-07-22 03:53:09
as someone who was captivated by all of it after watching chernobyl i would say i was disappointed because the movie barley had any of the science stuff and was focused more on oppenheimer communist connection,2023-07-28 08:20:28
now he has much less influence on nuclear arms regulations cant really affect policy making anymore,2023-08-05 18:10:22
"the bkack and white scenes were from the perspective of lewis strauss
when lewis strauss is remembering that scene its in bkack and white
then during the interrogation oppenheimer also remembers the meeting and since this time its from oppenheimers perspective its in color",2023-08-14 07:20:06
you’re not alone  i wanted a movie about the manhattan project but i suppose the movie was called oppenheimer… i had unrealistic expectations i guess,2023-07-24 18:13:16
"fully in agreement

its not bad at all that the movie tried to explore things beyond the war including some of what oppenheimer faced later in his lifecareer its that the movie tried to weave a practically fulllength political intrigue drama into a story that already had so many other elements and so many exposition characters

its not that i dont think there is a good story in the whole strauss situation there just wasnt enough time to elegantly tell it alongside everything else times when i was completely ambivalent to something that was supposed to be impactful

 when his wife screams it was strauss all along and threw the glass felt so random and the screenplay up to that point did not make that feel natural
 maleks testimony
 when strauss aide smugly turned against him at the end also felt so random
 einstein coming out of the dark in his sweatpants to weigh in
 his wife giving the clever testimony that seemingly had no impact on anything whatsoever

i fully believe that with some editing and better writing you could cut out all that political stuff shorten it way down and still have your cake and eat it too by exploring the scrutiny oppenheimer faced and his moral dilemmas",2023-07-24 20:38:28
"like the personal quarrel of strauss is a far far less interesting conflict than anything relating to the building of atomic bomb yet the movie was exclusively focusing on it

thanks for summarizing my thoughts in much better words the focus on this conflict also made the 3 hr runtime so unnecessary to me",2023-07-24 18:36:39
your are right i wanted to see more of the science fast pasted scenes cut into different timelines didnt help understanding what is happening and what was happening was not so interesting in my opinion just boring movie,2023-07-24 18:43:05
"i think it was kind of the point almost a metanarrative 

towards the end when oppenheimer is watching the slideshow of the effects of the bomb it focuses only on his face and his reaction to it at that moment i thought this movie is so narrow narrow shots narrow narrative the conference room is narrow this is huge worldshattering stuff history pivoting on the decisions these men made so why is so much of the focus on the argument between these 2 men

but i think that was very intentional on nolans part these are huge history making decisions but most of these people are still really focused on their own little bubbles and petty disagreements and individual egos than they are worried about the broader picture and sometimes those small arguments can influence history in unforeseen ways

strauss whole rant about oppenheimer wanting to feel important and wanting to be in the limelight was 100 accurate but he could have just as well been describing himself his decision to go after oppenheimer wasnt due to any big moral conviction but simply because oppenheimer embarrassed him in public

oppenheimer asks groves if he can go with him to washington and groves irritatedly asks why in groves eyes oppenheimers contributions are no longer important the project has moved beyond his control

and the aide says to strauss that einstein and oppenheimer were discussing something more important an obvious dig that strauss is not even important enough to be worth talking about

einstein seems to be the only one who really understands that hes just one piece of the puzzle and that he cant control the outcome once those ideas are loose in the world",2023-07-24 19:49:55
the thing is most of the actual science is classified information nobody knows the exact methods for a reason,2023-07-24 19:33:05
"the movie was called oppenheimer not atomic bomb

it was a biographical film about oppenheimer and his conflict with strauss was a public and important moment in telling the story of oppenheimer and how he is remembered

anyone wishing for more explosions and bombs went to the wrong movie",2023-07-24 20:15:40
this wasnt a movie about the atomic bomb it was about the father of the atomic bomb,2023-07-24 21:41:35
"the films ultimate thesis is a critique of oppenheimers character that he tries to have it both ways does he have moral scruples does he support the h bomb is he a communist 

the subplot with gene is key to this both with regards to infidelity and to motivate the reengagement with communists during his time in los alamos

when kitty sees gene  oppenheimer in the hearing room its also a pretty explicit portrayal of how oppenheimer is basically letting himself be  so he can get off in his strange handwringing martyrdom complex ties back to kitties line you cant commit the sin and expect us to cry for the consequences sic",2023-12-21 06:10:09
 always make things better,2023-12-12 01:28:24
basically for revenge for earlier percieved slights and in order to use him as a stool to reach a cabinet position strauss created scenarios to  oppenheimers career and prey upon his change of heart in the wake of hiroshima and nagasaki,2023-07-23 06:19:49
"robert downey’s agent called and said he needed half an hour more screentime to seriously compete for a supporting actor award 

that’s genuinely the only reason i think the film can rationalize the amount of time spent on strauss a character whose association with oppenheimer has literally nothing to do with the invention of the atomic bomb",2023-07-23 06:02:51
more than occasional it was rife my guess is that shooting on film they’re not able to get live feedback on focus in the way that you could with a digital cinema camera in the old days you’d just have to measure the distance and hope for the best you wouldn’t know if it was sharp until you got the footage developed i would have assumed that it wasn’t like that any more when shooting on film because they’ve got video feedback and other things but maybe it is still the same because boy was a lot of that movie soft as ,2023-07-26 11:06:11
i do film photography and i only find out after developing that my photos   and are out of focus lol maybe its the same with movie film  i dont know if they can see what theyve filmed before developing,2023-07-26 03:21:33
"motionblur photos are in trend now

maybe slightly out of focus filmmaking is too",2023-07-26 03:07:06
manual focus and at a lower aperture the focal length is paper thin and the film stuff other people mentioned,2023-07-26 14:19:37
"i wouldnt quite say nolan was hammering home that idea these are all true events that transpired and affected oppenheimer deeply

the criticism displayed towards oppenheimer in that hearing was not completely without basis people around oppenheimer during his time dabbled in communism and soviet spies were indeed discovered in los alamos

even in one of the betrayals during the hearing edward teller explicitly said that he did not believe oppenheimers loyalties are in question but probably should not be involved in atomic policies and research given his breach of protocol

i also felt that robbs point that oppenheimer dissenting views on super were inconsistent were also valid  why then he was okay with atomic bombs to begin with its not explained in the movie but i felt that oppenheimer had personal reasons for that mainly guilt with how the world is changing due to his work and his wish that it would rather stay unchanged and somewhat familiar to him

the topdown hammering of scientists by politicians was also balanced by bottomup hammering of strauss by scientists hill with his testimony on strauss confirmation hearing

the only thing i felt that nolan was hammering down was how large and  the red scare was  you really had to subscribe to the western dogma and the western dogma only in order to stay on top in the us this remains true even to this day",2023-07-26 22:24:35
"the war in japan was arguably already won ive seen interviews with the secretary of defense at the time robert mcnamara who basically said the second bomb was unnecessary and they dropped it basically because they built two if i remember the interview correctly

tokyo was already fire bombed into oblivion the buildings there were still made mostly out of wood so it went up like crazy which they touch on in the film for a moment it is an interesting thing to think about they essentially dropped them even in the first place to basically show we can make this and we will use it so dont  with us",2023-07-29 15:15:16
"its complicated bit of a rabbit hole 

the bombs ended the war is only partially true if at all the command structure in japan was falling apart as were communications between the us and japan 

the command in japan didnt really even blink at the bombs bizarre but at least part of them took a to the last man woman and child approach 

the bombs did provide hirohito with a  fig leaf",2023-07-29 18:50:19
" im no longer a fan of nolans nonlinear stroy gimmick it was more frustrating to me than adding to the movie

after watching it a couple weeks ago and reading through this thread i still cant figure out why nolan did it in this movie would love to hear his rationale if its come up in press junkets but overall felt like a cheap trick to manufacture suspense during the final courtroom drama act

whereas in memento prestige inception interstellar and dunkirk messing with chronology  time is directly motivated by the plot skipped tenet so cant really comment on that but from the trailers it seems to fit too",2023-09-12 03:51:39
i think it wasnt that they included it it was how much time we spent at oppenheimers trial how many times did we need to hear oppenheimer be asked about his communist affiliations how many characters did we have to watch give their testimony and then go sorry man on their way out we got the point i really loved this part at first then it kept going and going and going if the goal was to make us feel as worn down as oppenheimer did then i suppose it worked,2023-07-21 20:34:09
i preferred the latter half of the film,2023-07-21 20:48:53
i appreciated the focus on the postbomb world and all of the new implications and increasingly complicated legacy of the scientists involved as the longterm radiation effects started coming to light and the soviets joined the nuclear arms race the trinity test felt well placed in the film to me bc it was a big bang moment and i think the atomic age being the second half focus was greatly appreciated i feel like there isn’t enough pop culture exploration of that chapterlayer of history in general,2023-07-22 16:08:04
id say it is more because people go to see the bomb which seems like a climax to a movie about bomb building with some aftermath of what it means for the world and oppie now which would be tops 30mins maybe it was but it felt it was closer to an hour so people were tapped out mostly by that point after that explosion and bomb working,2023-07-21 20:47:48
this movie has gotten a lot of hype so naturally not everyone who goes to see it will care about stuff like that,2023-07-21 20:28:40
is this still an issue,2023-07-22 13:18:40
more suspenseful if the score just shut up for a few minutes but nah its just there blaring away as people shout at each other round a desk,2023-07-22 15:10:59
perfect way to describe it its infuriating because i feel just cutting down on the third act could have made this film an all time great,2023-07-22 17:48:18
so much this as soon as act three began i started to squirm in my seat i don’t like it when a movie hits a place where you feel like it might never end and not in a good way,2023-07-22 17:52:46
the entire strauss section was 10x longer than it needed to be it bordered on ridiculously monotonous,2023-07-22 20:12:59
yeah when you come in expecting big kabooms and constant explosions you kinda get thrown when you get s gripping character study as well  tbh for the likes of you they should of had the flim playing normally on the top half of the screen and footage of subway surfers in the bottom,2023-07-22 17:53:02
people don’t know what they want,2023-07-22 18:19:08
i will say that the casting of branagh as niels bohr was helpful for recognizing who he was when he appeared again  it had been so long since the first bohr appearance that it might not have clicked right away with a nobody actor,2023-07-22 22:03:41
"reminded me a lot of mike myers appearing in inglorious basterds had a chuckle at the appearances

the film was fine",2023-07-22 21:53:17
yeah checkhovs rami malek appearing every now and then distracted me so much until the big reveal he in particular stands out so significantly as being rami malek its so hard to not notice him,2023-07-22 23:10:14
i already knew it was him but when truman showed it didnt look like him at all and then he had a close up and i saw gary oldman face,2023-07-23 21:38:55
oh  i didnt even notice,2023-07-23 21:34:12
i didnt realize what a dickbag truman was  crybaby,2023-07-23 23:09:03
he should play colonel sanders next,2023-07-23 22:25:12
it was obvious as soon as i saw him,2023-07-23 21:36:55

"  i’ve never had a 3 hour movie fly by like that

i wish i felt that oppenheimer felt like a 10 hour film to me  they even turned the theater lights on before the movie finished because it was soo  long",2023-07-23 23:17:25
"teller betrayed oppenheimer because after the war oppenheimer led the opposition at the aec against development on the hydrogen bomb tellers brainchild and 1 priority since los alamos 

strauss was a petty vainglorious hardline conservative who deeply distrusted anyone with different beliefs from him and took it as a personal affront when anyone contradicted him directly the isotopes thing was absolutely one of the reasons why he went after oppenheimer because it was a public humiliation from the most prominent scientific mind at the time but the primary reasons were oppenheimers opposition to the hbomb and his advocating for nuclear arms control",2023-07-24 01:29:28
the quote part bothered me because she asks him to read sanskrit and he starts to explain the section then she says to read the actual words and he replies in english he should have actually read what was written and then provided a translation sometime later,2023-07-26 04:07:24
he was talking about how everything was composed of atoms drawn together by forces of attraction  is that what you mean,2023-08-04 11:46:14
i can’t possibly conceive how anyone could derive “beginning of life” from this movie,2023-09-20 08:04:14
"im a massive nolan fan and ive seen every movie hes made multiple times including oppenheimer but i was kind of disappointed too im glad people enjoyed it byandlarge and im not going to attempt to combat the reddit general hivemind on how amazing it was on this one so im just replying to your morerecent comment lol

the meatcrux of the movie is pretty goodinteresting the stuff with oppenheimer coming up and then at los alamos the 1954 private hearing framing device and especially the 1959 senate confirmation hearing framing device add a lot of runtime for very little payoff imo i never at any point in the film gave a  about lewis strauss his opinions on anyone or if hes going to be the secretary of commerce and why should i in the story of the atomic bomb and oppenheimer he is at best a minor footnote a guy oppy insulted so he hated him and he gets 13 of an alreadylong movie totally unnecessary cut his scenes

the 1954 private hearing stuff is at least more pertinent to oppenheimers later life and guilt over the creation of the atomic bomb but it also felt unnecessarily long and drawnout without a ton of payoff into oppys psyche stuff that feels like it couldve been conveyed more succinctly with stuff like the fantastic audience scene with oppys guiltptsd flashing in

together those 2 framing devices are a lot of runtime i estimate about an hour and a half and they just simply dont need to take up so much time or even id argue be part of the movie when it comes to the strauss stuff we can have oppys life story and him interacting with all of these great scientists without any strauss i just dont understand what it adds to the movie it feels like a huge subplot thats just taking up space and runtime",2023-11-26 10:08:25
re the bomb same here,2023-11-24 17:00:34
an instance where cgi would have actually been way better,2023-11-26 04:21:36
"that whole scene was the questioner trying to call out oppenheimer on his hypocrisy he was shouting at him to pressure him into admitting that he never cared about the horrific consequences of building the atom bomb oppenheimer basically admits there that he built it only to be used against the nazis but was willfully blind about where it would go after the nazis lost 

that whole commission was to smear oppenheimers image so any statement he made to make himself look like a hypocrite would be good enough for them",2023-07-21 19:17:02
its not about his security clearance but what the security clearance and trial represent its about his loss of control the inner turmoil he experiences and his realization that he created a chain reaction that he cant control and how reckless he now realizes that may have been because he is powerless to stop it,2023-07-23 16:30:16
"it was incredibly devastating for him he felt he served his country loyally for years and was stabbed in the back by the government it made him unable to work as a nuclear physicist again due to his newfound infamy he responded by spending most of his remaining time on st john in the us  islands

the hearing was seen as a real watershed moment for the scientific community oppenheimer attained a degree of public and political influence as a scientist after 1945 that has never been matched before or since in american history a lot of people consider him to be emblematic of a brief period of technocracy when the experts were in charge of scientific and technological policy after his clearance was removed the military was firmly in charge of the nuclear program 

a lot of scientists took oppenheimers treatment by the aec personally they felt it was an attack on their expert authority they saw the trial as not about genuine concerns about security but a plot to diminish the credibility of scientists in the public eye and ostracize them from the policymaking process",2023-07-23 16:43:21
he was called in to testify saw oppenheimer in the hall turned and walked away and then told the committee that he couldn’t testify because he had colitis the implication presumably is that seeing oppenheimer there he decided he didn’t want to participate in the obvious witch hunt,2023-07-23 17:00:44
"1 fission were the color scenes showing oppenheimers experience

2 fusion were the highcontrast black  white scenes of the senate confirmation hearings

i think it was a way to show the change in time and story perspective but a lot of people were confused by that",2023-07-26 15:58:26
"i read american prometheus about a year ago and am going off of recollections off the top of my head so definitely fact check me but they built multiple bombs at los alamos you see them trucking the other models little boy   man components out in the film after the test when groves departs 

as for fissionable materials enriched plutonium  uranium they continued to escalate production over time started as a trickle became a flood i think when discussing project locations groves mentions “breaking ground in tennessee” for their refinery they kept building upscaling production and improving in the following years some of it was done in other facilities in canada for instance bulk of it in tennessee to my knowledge within an alarmingly short timeline the the us was able to stockpile more and more atomic weapons

1945  2 bombs

1950  299 

1955  2500

the processes and “industry” were in their infancy but growing rapidly over time to match the usg’s demand

edit the 2 billion groves kept referencing in the film was mostly spent on creating fissile materials and building factories for that purpose only a small fraction actually went into the actual design rd aspects of the project",2023-07-28 06:02:15
"the movie very subtly implies that the aide played by alden ehrenreich leaked the info to dr hill remember how strauss was adamant that aldens character find out the identity of the unknown scientist witness 

in reality hill learned what happened from reading the transcripts of the security tribunal which took place five years before the strauss confirmation hearings despite promises to keep the tribunal confidential strauss had leaked the transcripts causing further humiliation to the oppenheimers who after having their private business exposed in the tribunal then had the indignity of them being made public the security tribunal not only devastated oppenheimer on a personal level but the tribunal was a huge controversy in the physicsscientific community at the time many physicists did hate strauss for what he did some historians have argued that the oppenheimer affair impeded development in weapons and energy because it actively scared off physicists from working forcollaborating with the us government again teller was ostracized by colleagues for his perceived betrayal of oppenheimer and  up to strauss

hills dialogue in the hearings in the movie comes almost verbatim from the real david hills actual congressional testimony",2023-08-06 07:42:17
"i think it was a mistake to give so much screen time to the strausshearing stuff especially so early on it just felt like it was weighing down what could have been a tight sharp story about oppenheimers early life and the manhattan project

i agree with you the most compelling parts of the movie were undoubtedly when they were actually building and testing the bomb itself ultimately the revocation of oppenheimers security clearance was an insignificant historical event and most people barely remember it today and if they do its mostly viewed as a product of cold war paranoia they kept emphasizing that oppenheimers credibility would be ruined if it happened but didnt really show what that really meant he was never formally charged or jailed was still respected as a scientist credited as the father of the bomb and got an award many years later as the movie shows and who cares if lewis strauss didnt get confirmed to the cabinet almost nobody today remembers who he was the acting by everyone including rami malek is splendid but the historical stakes were honestly quite low so it took away from the gravitas 

on the other hand the starstudded cast of scientists involved in the manhattan project and their discoveries and inventions are still remembered and used today  einstein bohr lawrence rabi bethe feynman fermi alvarez blackett heisenberg szilard teller more than half of these are nobel prize winnersthese people would come to define 20th century physics and we barely learn anything about them other than oppenheimer himself and a little bit of einstein rabi and lawrence it would probably have been more interesting if they kept the focus on the personal and scientific drama while building the bomb for example developing the oppenheimerteller drama could have been more interesting rather than with strauss whos not even a scientist or significant person or oppenheimerlawrence communist theorist vs conservative experimentalist or they could have instead explored the humanitarian aspect  such as the devastating aftereffects of hiroshima and nagasaki",2023-07-25 01:53:01
"was going to make a post but you prepeated most of what i was going to say 

for me it was an odd movie the trinity test what what i expected and really enjoyed while that was very good extremely tense and wellshot just about everything else felt really jumbled and rambling 

strauss was almost the protagonist of the movie and the manhattan project seemed overshadowed by a security clearance hearing in a small room the whole oppenheimer was associating with risky people point seemed to be repeated over and over and over needlessly 

the actual dropping of the bombs werent featured at all the jumping between 3 time periods was a little confusing einstein was almost introduced as comic relief stumbling into scenes randomly and the focus on that one conversation between oppenheimer and einstein  was that a random nolan creation 

in some ways i thought it was an attempt to parallel his story with turings  which makes some sense given the commonalities but for me the film was a disjointed focus on the less interesting aspects of a mans life and passing over much of the most fascinating",2023-07-25 00:13:17
excellent points if you really think about it its flaws are classic nolan at this point,2023-07-24 23:51:41
" and the nonlinear editing just feels like a gimmick to make people think the movie is really dynamic and exciting

100 or to try to give the film the veneer of being popcorn despite 3 hours long",2023-07-25 15:15:05
about the nuke scene cameron did an excellent job in t2 it is still mesmerising but nolan’s approach is different realistic not entirely fictional the cheering scene after the hiroshima bombing where oppenheimer has those vivid hallucinations for me it’s up to linda hamilton’s scene it is a very subtle moment of horror an intimate turmoil of the mind visually perhaps isn’t as spectacular as cameron’s judgement day but knowing that it is based on actual events and people that scenes is even more shocking,2023-07-25 00:25:19
the way nolan hates or refuses to ask for help to write for women is crazy,2023-08-28 18:40:13
i thought that whole segment of the movie was completely unnecessary and would have been better without it,2023-08-28 15:30:00
"it felt like a big gasoline explosion like they used to do in movies

yeah i found it i was hoping for a majestic explosion like the real video explosion we see on youtube,2024-01-07 02:27:18
too on the nose that was my least favorite part of the film,2023-07-21 12:57:57
i thought that scene is disrespectful to hindu scripture i thought it wasn’t true to the oppenheimer character who had a lot of respect for the religion and overall i thought it was corny and probably the worst scene of the film in the way it was shot i see what he was going for but it didn’t land imo,2023-07-21 13:08:17
the entire romantic sub plot was so contrived its insane,2023-07-21 12:59:40
was waiting for someone to say this the beginning of the movie was so choppy jumping from different scenes with short conversations that you’re just dropped in but felt as the story came together at the end that i saw it in a more interesting way,2023-07-21 03:37:43
start definitely felt like a montage  but i feel like this was a conscious choice they covered quite a bit of ground and were also cutting through the timelines for me the pace at the start was worth it for the pay off in the end but agree with the observation,2023-07-21 06:20:08
that’s very nolan also there was no need for a plot twist at the end,2023-07-21 03:57:01
i have two petpeeves with biopics one nolan shares is composite characters i appreciate he gave most everyone their due but my other one is highlight reels i dont want to hear him say i am become death let alone twice and once during an absurd  scene,2023-07-21 08:00:59
"small correction pat leahy retired from the senate at the beginning of this year he also wasnt the oldest democrat in the senate that title still goes to dianne feinstein but he was the longestserving democrat in the senate

while im at it my favorite pat leahy fun fact up until he was succeeded by another democrat this year pat leahy was the only democratic senator from vermont ever all prior vermont senators were either republicans whigs or in the case of bernie sanders independents",2023-07-22 21:51:02
wikipedia page is more engaging and characterizes oppenhiemer better than this movie,2023-07-21 06:13:37
i really can’t believe so many people here are praising it like it was some masterpiece it was well made but def not a 1010 movie it just wasn’t that entertaining imo was much more of a political drama than anything solid movie but just such a slow burn i thoroughly enjoyed tetris much more,2023-07-21 04:15:24
i understand what youre getting at and that is most likely due to the fact that dunkirk and oppenheimer are both historically accurate it puts oppenheimer in a light that people tend not to see him in and although can come off as boring it is highly interesting for viewers captivated by the scientific aspects and historical accuracy but because of that movies like tenet and inception dont compare in the same way you are very limited with historically accurate movies but with nonfiction such as inception well you know the rest if you have seen the movie,2024-02-21 10:36:02
yes there was a flash of one which goes in hand with the rumors she was murdered one step further being that it was the government and possibly boris pash,2023-07-24 02:33:49
"a hot take but unless its nearby and convenient its not really worth watching 70 mm the scenes with explosions looked great in 70 mm but they are just minutes of a 3 hour movie the movie very dialogue heavy and would look fine on any screen 

however the soundtrack is great and definitely makes it worth seeing in theaters in some format as opposed to at home",2023-07-25 00:48:46
its crazy to me that they didnt really dig into that like feynman and fermi are basically just background figures sitting around instead the focus is on guys like lewis strauss which i have little interest i have heard that the movie tries to follow the american prometheus book very closely but here i think it actually suffers from that,2023-07-29 03:49:19
i don’t have a source on hand but if you look it up you’ll be able to confirm that her clearance interview was taken almost word for word from the actual transcript,2023-08-12 16:45:05
i actually thought nolan not showing much of the science stuff had to be on purpose i mean in his past works nolan has shown that he can show science very well and to a good degree of accuracy as well asking the audience to put their mind in the movie here i felt like he wanted to show the life of the person more as opposed to only showing him as this science genius,2023-07-23 22:26:03
"in that rime “defending himself against communist accusations”  probably defined his life just as much if not more than the development of the bomb 

we remember him primarily as the man behind the atomic bomb but that wasn’t necessarily how he was viewed during that time he was the focus of a lot of cultural controversy that at times overshadowed his achievements in physics",2023-07-21 07:28:25
"strauss had a vendetta against oppenheimer largely from that hearing as you said but also from them competing for the princeton job where oppenheimer was ranked higher than him both of these are depicted in the film they also just had personal and political beef around their religion and political stances 

ultimately strauss didn’t trust oppenheimer and had the fbi spy on him this all leads to him recommending they revoke the security clearance which is also depicted in the film 

largely because of this personal attack on oppenheimer the scientific community was against strauss on the eisenhower cabinet and he ultimates was rejected which humiliated him

i hope that helps",2023-07-21 17:25:35
"honestly i feel like most people feel a little misled the marketing made it seem more like it was about the manhattan project when in reality its mostly about whether oppie was a communist

" negatives  the relationship with emily blunts character kitty was a little halfbaked heres this guy as a known womanizer as the film puts it and all of a sudden he decides to marry a woman he meets at a party for reasons unknown and to top it off she sticks with him through multiple affairs for again unknown reasons and even supports him

oppenheimer decides to marry kitty because she was pregnant a divorced single mother raising a kid born out of wedlock wouldve been a figurative and literal death sentence in 1930s40s america where women still werent allowed to open bank accounts in their own names and she stuck through the marriage through multiple affairs because had she filed for divorce she would be left with nothing",2023-07-22 02:53:46
"i agree about his relationship with emily blunt  kitty felt a bit underbaked i really liked her performance but i felt it needed a bit more between them meeting and her struggling with motherhood and alcoholism 

by the end of the film where she testifies i didnt really buy their love for each other and their dedication considering theyd practically only been shown together in a strained relationship a majority of the time 

i wonder if some of it was left on the cutting room floor",2023-07-22 02:39:04
i agree 100 for the explosion being underwhelming the music preceding the explosion was so suspenseful and it didnt live up to our high expectations i thought we would see the real deal when they show the attacks on hiroshima and nagasaki but they never showed that,2023-07-22 02:37:04

all of christopher nolans films are like this not sure why he thinks this is a good choice every single movie im having to squint my eyes and tilt my head to hear the words coming out of peoples mouths so annoying,2023-07-23 12:24:26
definitely not just you its the same problem with tenet,2023-07-23 10:57:58
dialogue was fine 109 for me but there were a few moments that were deafeningly loud,2023-07-23 11:57:04
i honestly didnt notice this time around i had an extremely hard time with tenet though even though i watched it at home nolan movies are known for loud action and barely audible dialogue,2023-07-23 12:23:37
its always like this with nolan although its already better this time compared to his other films,2023-07-23 14:09:24
"he was working as director at the institute for advanced study which provides their director with housing onsite and where he and kitty lived for around 15 years and raised their two children he made a number of controversial decisions and the board was considering calling for his resignation and he correctly suspected strauss who was also a board member at the institute would use the result of the security clearance hearing and anticommunist momentum against him 

he didn’t want to turn out like his brother and so many of his colleagues who never again found work in or even related to the field of physics and he feared that if he didn’t get the outcome he desired that is exactly what strauss would do to him",2023-07-23 20:19:00
"its important because without clearance he couldnt work as an advisor to the atomic energy commission nor really work as a nuclear physicist as lots of the information is classified

it would also be used to smear his reputation as by branding him a communist which during the red scare would destroy someone",2023-07-23 20:03:49
"oppenheimer was the most prominent scientific voice of the time with immense public stature for his work at los alamos he used his position to express his opposition to the h bomb as well as advocating for international nuclear arms control  something that would inherently diminish the control the military would have on nukes these policy stances were something that strauss and many hardline conservatives in washington and the military could not abide 

so strauss set out to eliminate oppenheiner from ever having any say in nuclear policy ever again by initiating a closed door hearing that would relitigate his well known communist ties with the odds completely stacked against oppie it was an extrajudicial railroading at the height of the red scare by a petty asshat that created distrust between american scientists and the governmentmilitary that persists today",2023-07-23 21:33:09

i think that the trial was important to include in the film because after the trial and the subsequent revocation of his security clearance oppenheimer was a broken man im getting this from a great documentary called to end all war oppenheimer  the atomic bomb so it was a pivotal event in his life,2023-07-23 21:37:23
for me it was a bit unclear why he was on trial was it to revoke his security clearance because of alleged communist ties or was there more,2023-07-23 23:18:00
"interesting perspective i felt the trial was gripping and hung on every word

i knew the trial was for the security clearance but wonder if people that weren’t familiar may have trouble following its implications",2023-07-24 02:27:27
"that was my primary concern but nolan had only one shot adapting american prometheus so he had to fit both  you cant tell a complete story of oppenheimer without both 

with how much of the book actually ended up in the film and how nolan structured all the main storycharacter arcs and time periods to interweave and alternate before diverging and then converging again in the third hour what the film achieved was nothing short of brilliant imo its a terrific feat of cinematic adaptation",2023-07-24 01:37:04
without knowing the book it did feel that there were two stories being told here and while they are very well woven together there was something somewhat anticlimatic about having so much story happen after the hiroshima and nagasaki bombings this is an observation more than a criticism,2023-07-24 02:11:42
honestly it would probably have been better if it had been two separate movies more time to thoroughly explore oppenheimer and his colleagues and adversaries their motivations and challenges etc the main critiques im reading online are about the entire film rushing through so much with little room to breathe i would have been down for a two parter if it meant a deeper understanding of the various people involved,2023-07-24 01:32:07
"this is kinda my issue with it i wanted to see more science about the project i have no idea what happened at los alamos the movie told me they sat around for 3 years and waited for enough plutonium and then blew it up then made 2 bombs off screen and that was that 

then the whole climax is about the ramifications to oppenheimers career the film ends with him losing his clearance and we have no idea what happens after that the movie felt like it had assigned reading at the end i’ve been on the internet all day making sense of things",2023-07-24 01:34:59
it was fantastic strauss stopping oppenheimer from warning the world about the bombs all because of his petty ego then this being reinforced at the end with strauss thinking einsten spoke about him and the guy saying “they probably spoke about something more important than you”,2023-07-24 07:38:18
it’s the nolan mix  so many of his movies have a  mix  i always have to watch them again on streaming with subtitles,2023-07-25 05:11:45
he said when i came to you with those calculations we thought we might start a chain reaction that might destroy the entire world einstein i remember it well what happened     oppenheimer i believe we did,2023-07-25 06:16:44

i saw it in imax and i cant imagine seeing it any other way the trinity scene alone made me jump out of my chair the sound and visuals were stunning sure most of the movie is men in suits talking but i think its absolutely worth it,2023-07-26 14:45:48
"there were memes about how audience in the barbie movie could hear the explosion coming from the theater playing oppenheimer but frankly i was a little disappointed with the trinity test sound effect

maybe if the entire hype around feeling the nuclear explosion was underplayed i would have enjoyed those scenes more",2023-07-26 17:59:40
i also saw it in imax and i agree lol,2023-07-26 12:40:38
i watched it in an imax this morning it was a smaller imax theater somehow i wasnt too impressed as the biggest sound effect occurred at the beginning and majority of the movies were dialogue generally the theaters in my country have great quality of sound and screen so i feel normal theater is enough,2023-07-26 14:01:42
i saw it in imax and standard i think the sound was a lot more important than the screen size which imax did feel worth it for,2023-07-26 13:52:28
i saw it at a bigger than average screen but not imax i don’t think imax would have added anything to the movie not sure why they decided to market so heavily for imax viewing normal screen is fine it’s mostly men in dark suits talking in various rooms awesome movie due to acting story filming etc but imax superfluous,2023-07-26 14:19:44
it would have been more authentic to show both cities getting nuked,2023-07-27 17:46:48
it actually focused on oppenheimer rather than the project everyone complaining about the security clearance plot is missing the entire point its not about the security clearance is about his loss of control the inner turmoil he experiences and his realization that he created a chain reaction that he cant control and how reckless he now realizes that was because he is powerless to stop it,2023-07-28 07:30:12

the nudity was unnecessary,2023-08-09 01:10:26

yup nudity was 100 to get the r rating that signals that this is a serious film for adults the scenes with that character added nothing to the movie i would have preferred a scene of him learning and practicing dutch if he indeed learned dutch in 6 months,2023-08-09 17:11:42
exactly what i told my friends when we got out,2023-08-09 09:34:14
"maybe i’m reaching here but i thought that the fact they glossed over the actual detonations in japan was representative of how the situation was out of oppenheimer’s hands once the project was completed the military took hold of the devices effectively ending the scientists’ involvement oppenheimer didn’t know when or where they were going to use the bombs and he pretty much found out about the news the same way any civilian would have 

if they had explored the effects of the bomb in japan it would have strayed from the movie’s path as an oppenheimer biopic the audience is seeing these events unfold through his perspective",2023-08-14 08:47:28
"yeah i just caught the 70mm and it was unbelievable 

ive been disappointed by imax in the past but this was easily the best theatre experience of my life it genuinely felt like a work of art",2023-08-15 19:30:17
your mileage with imax may vary at least in our theater the volume was up way too high and my wife was covering her ears at some spots that were probably intended to be 85 of max volume it really rubbed me the wrong way too i think its partially nolan and his mastering engineers fault and partially our theaters some of the mixing was bad and i think our theater was also a bit out of balance there was some distortion that a good theater probably wouldnt have the imax bass was cool but the transients were offensive and literally could damage your hearing,2023-08-15 17:46:18
i also saw it on imax but don’t agree with this recommendation  there is very little about oppenheimer that sells it as an essential imax experience imo especially compared with interstellar or dunkirk where sound design and scale are so much more critical to the experience of the story it’s just visually very much a straightforward talky drama with just a few sequences that really make all that screen acreage and those decibels work to full effect i’d say don’t worry if you can’t catch it on imax  doing it over again i’d rather have seen it sooner on a regular screen than wait weeks for an imax slot to open up,2023-08-16 16:44:41
im j robert oppenheimer and this is atomic bomb test,2023-11-22 21:19:21
maybe thats why its called oppenheimer and not the atomic bomb i feel like you went into it thinking it was a different movie and then disappointed it wasnt what you imagined,2023-11-24 05:41:00
i took the two glass vases as  man and little boy needs so they were acquiring caches to make two bombs plus the test,2023-07-23 01:30:52
"they waited until they had enough for 3 bombs before testing the first one

edit and by “waited” i mean they did some minor chores like build the first working nuclear reactor and figure out how to precisely compress a metal sphere with explosives and things like that so maybe “waited” isn’t the right term and this was the first time anyone tried to refine uranium and plutonium they didn’t get a linear rate of production once they figured out the kinks the refinement rate increased",2023-07-23 01:12:53
i think it was grease from working on the accelerator,2023-07-24 00:57:26
koreans famously hate the japanse to be fair and theyre right to for what they did to most of asia,2023-07-24 21:29:48
"i think it drew me in emotionally to the weight of the decision it wanted you to question the morality of the bomb and i think it did thay brilliantly

the other thing was how despite all the links to communism never gave away secrets and had a lot of integrity that he couldnt show in his personal life",2023-07-24 22:23:26
as an american i dont think the movie portrayed japan as a total victim i do think it did a good job communicating the suffering of innocent japanese citizens but also was clear that these deaths were preferable to the even more deaths a traditional invasion of japan would have incurred on both american and japanese,2023-07-24 20:46:22
"as an american i kept thinking during the movie about what others thought particularly a japanese person about the depiction of america’s reasoning for using the atomic bomb so i guess i find it ironic to find you wondering what an american thinks
growing up i bought fully into the conservative “patriotic” line that the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki were justified i now feel very confused about what should have been done i honestly just choose not to have an opinion because it is easier than doing the appropriate amount of research to fall on one side or the other and honestly can a definitive decision even be made the idea that more lives were saved by the use of the atomic bomb can that even be validated or is it offensive to even suggest the idea i just don’t know
ultimately i liked the depiction of oppenheimer being conflicted himself because that’s were i am at the movie makes me want to read the book that inspired the movie american prometheus i would like at least one other source for the many different characters opinions and motivations
i’m looking at your last question and i don’t think i answered it yet was japan a victim absolutely was japan a total victim i don’t know i do think the citizens of hiroshima and nagasaki were total victims i kind of wanted to see some depiction of the actual destruction but i’m okay with the choice to only show oppenheimer’s reaction",2023-07-24 21:26:03
"as an american i felt like the movie was a different perspective then we normally get i appreciated a scientific point of view and how it was viewed at the time as a scientific achievement knowing it was built because of the nazis and that a lot of the scientist were jewish made the whole project development make much more sense to me 

honestly i wish no city would have been bombed and that there would have been no reason for one nazis messed up so many things 

i understand einsteins approach just because the knowledge is there there’s a certain sense of morality in not developinggiving others that power 

i also felt like oppenheimer went through an internal battlestruggle with knowing he was unleashing a power no one had ever seen but trying to offset that with reminding himself it’s an defensive measure to the nazis but in the end it was used more in an offense sense rather than defense 

i think the bombings were still a major tragedy so many innocent people lost their lives on a grand scale i don’t know what it would have looked like with a refusal to surrender from japan but kind of like oppenheimer says he feels he has blood on his hands — you can’t deny that there’s a sense of guilt i feel it as an american and i wasn’t even born when that decision was made 

i think the movie also shows the importance of nuclear de proliferation and importance of communication and cooperation with the international community in some ways nuclear weapons helped stop major world wars and achieved a certain level of peace within europe and nuclear weapons along with open dialogue has certainly stopped russia and america from going to war",2023-07-24 20:45:14
"japan was actually very close to surrendering a concerted effort by the americans to obtain a surrender would have been successful especially if the americans would have promised hirohito would not be killed which ended up happening anyway you could say that a culturallanguage barrier as part of the problem  basically america said surrender unconditionally which the japanese relied yes we will surrender unconditionally but with just a few conditions and then americans said no you must surrender unconditionally  and like i said they ended up dropping the bombs and yet still letting the japanese keep their emperor

however there is no way that america was going to simply not use the bomb after all that investment they considered just showing it off as a show of force mainly for leverage against the russians but decided it must be used against a city again they were dropped mainly for getting leverage against the russians",2023-07-24 21:00:40
"it’s older grammar that’s more common in religious settings

it’s like how a common easter greeting is “he is risen” he being jesus rather than the more modern “he has risen”",2023-07-30 13:34:59
the thing he is quoting is an english translation of an indian scripture  which you can read the story in your own first language if you want the thing with translating is sometimes you will get weird grammar because it is trying to stay true to the original text,2023-07-30 09:53:28
i really enjoyed it but felt that there wasnt really the need for nonlinear storytelling aside from some of the revelations of strauss narcotism  i think it would have been much easier to follow and had better pacing if it was written as a linear story with a much tighter emphasis on the posttrinity events,2023-07-31 01:40:45
"  the us makes this movie that could be taken as glorifying the use of the nuclear weapon

 did we watch the same movie",2023-11-19 04:24:21

bro i had a  crying baby in the row behind me,2023-07-24 00:57:47
 i would have been actually livid i love going to the theater but i’ve grown more and more tired of the crowds i’ve encountered lately it astonishes me how many people just don’t “get it”,2023-07-24 00:15:55
"swva by any chance

happened in my showing as well and considering how  loud the theater was at every other instance pretty hard to miss lol",2023-07-24 00:28:46
gotdamn villains,2023-07-24 01:58:09
awful the deafening silence in that scene is thw whole point,2023-07-24 01:23:53
so i havent read the book the script is based on but the movie really seemed intent on setting the record straight on oppenheimer and his legacy oppie really should be remembered in popular consciousness the same way einstein is but the controversy caused by the political attacks against him greatly diminished his image as a scientist i feel like the point of the movie is to say here is a flawed man whose brilliance changed the world forever  acknowledge him,2023-07-24 09:08:45
i think you can request subtitles from theaters,2023-08-11 19:38:54
there was music but it wasn’t unbearably loud,2023-08-12 00:15:51
earplugs helped me tremendously everything was much clearer,2023-08-12 00:27:28
i dont think the music was the problem but the extremely loud sound effects weirdly enough the actual test explosion was quieter than most of the rest of the movie,2023-08-13 23:32:56
this movie was actually quite easy to follow the dialogue the only difficulty you may have is with the names there are many many physicists in the movie with non american surnames some examples are szilard rabi godel and bohr the loud music may obscure properly hearing these names,2023-08-13 00:05:33
 i didn’t know it was christopher nolan or what that even meant i told my husband to remind me i never want to see another of his in theatres i liked the movie content hated the constant noise to the point i had a head ache would be so much better at home first time with subtitles instead of me annoyed the whole time wishing i had ear plugs,2023-08-14 02:30:00
i like how you got downvoted for this rmovies really isnt the place for film analysis ,2023-08-17 11:13:37
that is weird the only thing i can think of is the “can you hear the music” question he got from bohr,2023-08-17 01:54:19
well he declined his job offering and then humiliated him about the isotopes and he was convinced that he was turning scientists against him,2024-03-02 11:02:56
"cant really watch nolans movie while having attention span of average tiktok enjoyer

like honestly this movie is really  great if one is truly paying attention its almost impossible to get overwhelmed or lost in the narrative

but oh well boom boom when",2023-07-31 11:32:58
batman movies are long but better edited and more coherent and more enjoyable all together,2023-07-31 15:08:19
the movie felt super fast paced despite its 3hour run time  dunkirk did not have that problem  nor did interstellar,2023-07-31 16:18:05
the problem is that nolan is overhyped and overrated that the cycle repeats itself every time a nolan film comes out maybe this time it wont be as long and convoluted but alas no its usually worse,2023-07-31 02:53:11
"i felt somewhat the same as you the first time i saw it as if the part with strauss and the interrogation were sort of tacked on at the end and didnt really fit with the front end of the film the second time i watched it i realized that the interrogation is the film and that it was better for it we are left to judge oppenheimer and his motives and the kangaroocourt interrogation allows us to feel some pity for him but it also is the only point at which oppenheimer is forced to face his own contradictions about the development of the abomb the hbomb and his role in it he is forced into making the somewhat absurd claim that his moral qualms about the hbomb were based on his belief that there were too many hbombs built relative to the number of abombs we see in his face how he has avoided this reckoning all along

this section plays another related role in the movie i think in that first half focused on the building of the bomb oppenheimer is surging forward under the power of his own genius determination and optimism but in the second part which could be said to begin with the departure of the bombs from los alamos he starts to sense his own powerlessness in the face of bureaucracy the rising militaryindustrial complex and the logic of the technology itself 

he keeps on talking about how this is not a new weapon but a new world but we see that he never really got it himself just in the way einstein couldnt see past his own accomplishments he had demolished the old world but was never able to cross into the promised land to mix metaphors

more specifically nolan is using the kangaroo court about oppenheimers clearance and the kangaroo court around strausss nomination as a lens to judge oppenheimer himself and strauss too not in the abstract sense of whether they were good or bad but primarily within the context of their actions surrounding the development and deployment of wmds

furthermore this trick on nolans part is itself part of a larger trick he is playing on the audience we judge oppenheimer from the safety of our seats in the movie theater and 80 years removed but the truth is we collectively make the identical decisions oppenheimer did day in day out we build weapons well in excess of the power that anything he built and we build them on an industrial scale nobody really has an issue with this anymore we are completely at home with these weapons 

at its most basic level the movie is about us and the bomb oppenheimer is the lens through which we focus on that because the question is too large for most of us perhaps for any of us to confront objectively i think there are lots of other wonderful things going on in this movie to be sure but i think the structure of the movie is sound and i was convinced of this on the second watching",2023-08-12 19:32:38
probably would have taken too much time and outside the main characters it’s not too important to understand the story,2023-07-21 04:52:01
any sort of criticism is being dismissed because apparently nolan cannot ever make an average movie,2023-07-21 15:16:40
seriously like ive watched like three hours worth of content on his life before studied on the hiroshimanagasaki disaster have read an entire book about fusion fission i know a lot about it still i didnt like the film because the storytelling aspect was kinda meh,2023-07-21 15:46:30
it isnt about smart its is about education and lack thereof,2023-07-21 15:41:24
"“prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to man

for this he was chained to a rock and tortured for eternity”

my  the parallels between oppenheimer and prometheus are brilliant i never really considered them until i finished the film the book this film was based on called oppenheimer “the american prometheus”",2023-07-22 05:43:56
agreed it makes nolan bragging about it being practical fx really tone deaf if you can use practical effects to make something look better than cgi wonderful but when you go to that time or effort to make something that doesnt even look like a nuclear explosion you have lost the forest for the trees,2023-07-23 23:04:16
the trinity scene was a huge letdown it was just a bunch of closeups of what appeared to be generic hollywood explosions in slomo for dramatic effect,2023-07-24 00:18:25
the flashes of explosion at the start that oppenheimer imagined honestly seemed better lol now that i think back it wasnt as grand as i thought it would be,2023-07-24 01:59:21
this 100 interstellar is one of my favorite movies there are so many scenes in that movie that present such a huge sense of scale the wormhole millers planet waves gargantua etc i couldnt wait to see nolans interpretation of a nuclear explosion  to me it just looked like someone blew up a barrell of gasoline  quite a big letdown for me in what was otherwise a great movie,2023-07-24 00:06:10
"it did though it’s pretty close to the original footage

do we need another nuclear explosion in a movie the subject matter is so heavy he has to strike a balance as we all know the incomprehensible destruction and horror of an atomic bomb",2023-07-24 01:34:14
this movie’s was a bajillion times better than tenet’s,2023-07-26 21:05:37
oppenheimer went to princeton well after the manhattan project einstein and him had the convo with the paper during the manhattan project both were flash backs but took place at different times,2023-08-01 00:58:57
"strauss welcoming oppenheimer and met einstein by the pond was after the war

oppenheimer met einstein in the wood was at the beginning of the project

i watched it a second time with subtitle it seems einstein and oppenheimer didnt always have the same agreement on how far quantum physics can expose the possibility of energy so big it can burn the world einstein didnt want to have anything to do with it though he knew mathematically its possible the wood conversation oppenheimer pushed through it and he told einstein by the pond thst the destruction has started

the only timeline im still confused is the round table discussion whether it happened during the project or after with the allegation of a spy at los alamos",2023-08-01 07:01:31
there are a few reasons but one that doesnt seem to get mentioned often is that the japanese government would most likely have covered up or tried to explain away anything other than a direct hit on a city when the emperor addressed the nation in a radio broadcast after the bombs it was the first clue most average people had that japan werent actually winning the war japanese propaganda was incredibly effective,2023-08-08 21:04:28
"yeah thats a big question in history was it even necessary to drop the second at all did they need to drop it on a populated area 

i guess the answer is they wanted to prove a point and the decision makers didnt consider japanese life to be a big concern",2023-08-07 22:52:39
its actually been leaked that the main two reasons why they decided to drop bomb was because  1 to show soviet union the true scope and destruction of the bomb 2 to experiment on how much civilians it killed after being dropped on major cities,2023-08-08 05:07:33
"hes disturbed i think   
  
from my perspective the chain reaction is not only referring to the abomb itself but an entirely new page on the history of mass destructive weapons countries will be on a massive army race after those events and newly created with even stronger destructive forces will be created rapidly and eventually the abomb that oppenheimer created ironically became the beginning of the end for the world  
  
yea thats my opinion tho i have a very narrow knowledge about physics and wars and stuff but thats what ive got after watching the movie",2023-08-11 14:06:00
he wasn’t mad at oppenheimer he was just lost in the horrible implications of what oppenheimer just said because einstein too believes this could be the beginning of the end,2023-08-11 13:55:30
he wasnt mad he was overwhelmed and upset,2023-08-12 12:07:00
i dont think einstein acted mad at all in fact i think the calmness and moral perspective of einstein is the best thing about the whole movie,2023-08-13 01:54:05
i took it as more he was distracted by what oppenheimer had told him not interested in talking to strauss,2023-08-11 13:39:43
i know haha he did kind of have a point though about him ultimately being responsible,2023-08-25 00:39:21
he was a horrible man,2023-08-24 08:28:22
9 hours wow do you live in los almos,2023-07-21 08:10:54
hill had no ego unlike strauss humiliation or not hill could see that oppenheimer was right,2023-07-23 01:20:48
hill cares about what is right not because of someone’s attitude,2023-07-23 01:32:30
i think the point is to show that the scientific community pretty unanimously supported oppenheimers views hill never had a relationship with oppenheimer but came to defend him because it demonstrated how those in power were trying to prevent any backlash towards further development of nuclear weapons,2023-07-23 02:53:23
it’s true and he got caught irl,2023-07-23 02:45:46
yeah he said that he never knew was the lie,2023-07-23 03:57:01
there is a line after they mention the brutal fire bombing of tokyo “after pearl harbor and brutal fighting in the pacific campaign for the last few years the american public gives us a lot of wiggle roomlatitude to do what we do”,2023-07-23 14:21:59
"there is an extremely brief line in the meeting where they are selecting the targets that alluded to that context of the psychology of justifying using the bomb but im surprised they left it there

a general or someone there talks about 100000 dead in the firestorm in tokyo referencing operation meetinghouse this was a firebombing operation and tokyo as a mostly wooden city turned into a blaze killing more than would be killed in the immediate blast of either atomic bombs they were discussing i think the general then said something about the american publics acceptance of that level of killing and that pearl harbor bought a lot of leeway with the public

this to me is a critical detail that could have been further explored by this stage in the war inhumanity and brutality was normalized step by step until the atomic bomb was a huge psychological step but not that much further morally than the mechanized scientifically driven  that the world had somehow gotten numb to and i dont mean to suggest there are no redlines or that there is a clear right or wrong answer i appreciate that you are supposed to watch this and be conflicted war is inherently immoral and even justified wars are human tragedies",2023-07-23 13:11:51
as a nonamerican i just thought i misremembered history,2023-07-23 13:31:41
"they were mentioned in the meeting with the secretary general 

something along the lines of pearl harbor and its been a few years since",2023-07-23 13:08:10
you arent alone,2023-07-23 12:49:01
it’s funny because many believe pearl harbor is a hoax  started by the us as an excuse to bomb japan,2023-07-23 13:55:52
the mindset is that after ww2 russia betrayed the allies and now russia  communism was the greatest threat to the united states from the prosecutors perspective oppenheimer is a traitor,2023-07-23 22:43:59
"the prosecutor is pressing him on why was he opposed to the development of the hydrogen bomb and not of the atomic one with the implication that oppenheimer’s fictional soviet masters where pulling the strings and told him to oppose this project
this starts to dig up a lot of buried insecurities and regrets in oppenheimer after all he doubts his own judgement in the development of the bomb all the time
the scene builds to oppenheimers confession that he believes humanity has no self control when using weapons of any caliber  the realization of this in the ww2 aftermath is the reason he gives for his flip in support of big bombs 

this is an important moment because it  builds on his feelings of dread and cynicism which led him to believe as revealed at the very end of the movie that he has indeed destroyed the world just in a long winded way",2023-07-24 22:34:28
it’s not worth the imax 98 of the movie is people talking in rooms,2023-07-25 02:09:01
this is the last movie that needs to be seen in 70mm imax  its 90 dialog driven scenes in rooms  would i see every movie i ever go to in 70mm imax  of course  do you need to see this in 70mm imax to enjoy some rare experience   no,2023-07-25 02:50:31
"honestly there are just two scene though they are big scenes where it is worth seeing in imax but again they are only two scenes the rest of the movie can be seen on a regular theater screen 

the way people had been hyping this up that you just have to see it in imax i was expecting scenes that were filled up people props and complex settings like how spielberg movies can be a million moving pieces that you would need an enormous screen to see every detail nah instead the majority of the movie are shots of people from the waist up and close up shots of faces most times no one is moving around instead they are just sitting and talking 

personally i saw it in imax and if i had a chance to do it over i would have saved the cash and watched it on a regular screen yes those two scenes were amazing and stunning but in a three hour movies their screen time wasi think ten minutes give or take a minute not really worth it plus seeing close up after close up in that high definition and in that size was bit off putting in my head i kept on telling the camera man to pull back",2023-07-25 03:40:45
"we saw it in imax and there were aspects where a really big screen was enjoyable but i dont feel it necessary

the biggest problem i had was that the theater had the volume up incredibly loud to the point that i was covering my ears in discomfort in some scenes i dont think that was the movies fault but it makes my take on could you hear the dialog as yes but nothing since",2023-07-25 02:08:52
took my 70 year old parents to see it in a dolby theater and they said the dialogue was muffled at certain times personally my ears adjusted to the sound mixing after a few minutes and i had no problems,2023-07-25 02:09:08
i watched in imax today and the dialogue sounded very normal to me havent seen tenet and dont remember if i saw dunkirk in imax,2023-07-25 02:09:47
thats kurt godel a mathematician and also one of the most important human beings to ever exist imo hes famous for proving the incompleteness theorem,2023-07-26 15:06:09
shame he chose not to speak out against his friend once he saw oppenheimer had some loyal allies  he realised he had a choice and made the right decision,2023-07-29 12:00:24
"its unclear if you go jean tatlocks wikipedia page they spend some lines on it in the part about her death 

in short it is not unthinkable the fbi would do that though it hasnt been admitted to publicly however since it would be a straight up  it isnt likely to be admitted to much like the  of mlk in which case we do have proof of the fbi sending him letters advising him to  himself it wouldnt be out of character for the american government at that time to have her killed theres a number of historians which have suggested it and apparently nolan and some other filmmakers as well think its an important enough mystery to put it in the film",2023-07-31 08:00:11
i thought it was implied the deepstateantired fbi was cutting loose ends and security risks for the project there was definitely a blackgloved hand pushing her head into the tub during one of the cuts,2023-07-31 13:30:39
"my takeaway was that it demonstrated that his change in stance came only when the enemy changed from nazis  where he participated in the race to develop the first abomb to use against them to soviets  where an even more powerful hbomb could potentially be used against communists they were pointing out the convenience in his opposition growing along with rising capitalistcommunist tensions

i dont necessarily think that the point of the film was to ask the audience the question is oppy a communist but instead to let the events of the crossexamination play out infront of the audience as a spectator i wonder how it would have come out if it had made that challenge perhaps using screen time dedicated to the strauss plot to play into the ambiguity of whether oppys postatomic bomb actions that seek to redeem him are based on a true desire to save people from a terrible death or because of his own ideological interest",2023-08-05 23:18:17
to be clear at the end of the security clearance hearing they do clarify and state that oppenheimer was not a security risk but they still denied the clearance by a 21 vote due to strauss meddling the justification was surface level nobody actually believed oppenheimer was a soviet spy,2023-08-06 01:16:38
i think youre reading into it too much kennedy is a famous overall well loved figure so pointing out that when he was a new senator he took a stand for oppenheim makes you love him more pretty simple,2023-08-20 17:17:59
i think everyone knew the bombs going to be a success so they choose run a secondary plotline about him getting procecuted for being a soviet spy where the outcome is lesser known i feel like perhaps focusing on his personal life making his mistresss suicide the climax would worked better than the court stuff which would work with nolan time skipping stuff also plenty of shows where the outcome is already known ford vs ferrari comes to mind alan turing etc is still exciting or fun to watch for their better written characters i feel nolans film were great of their overarching ideas visuals sound design but their character is lacking,2023-08-08 06:52:01
that michelin star analogy is perfect for articulating how i feel  i left the theater a few hours ago and the more i think about it the more i realize i dont think i liked it the creation of the bomb was a 20 minute montage in the middle of two character studies before and after the event and while they were both interesting the movie didnt need to be as long or self indulgent as it was,2023-08-07 21:59:25
haha great analogy,2023-08-08 03:48:08

your criticisms on dialogue are issues nolan has long been criticized for  plagued with i remember hearing this all the way back when the prestige came out and thinking nothing of it it finally clicked for me like a light bulb when i saw interstellar

even me as a big nolan fan could not excuse when matt damons character after he is awoken says something to the effect of pray you never learn just how good it can be to see another face after that moment i finally understood what all the criticism with his dialogue is about it came across so unnatural and frankly cringe

at this point ive just come to accept thats nolans way of writing dialogue it is what it is this film definitely had it but i guess it didnt bother me as i was expecting it i also think it actually worked somewhat here since its a biopic and i applaud when biopics break the rules of traditional filmstorytelling since to me thats somewhat needed to make them interesting they shouldnt fit a typical story structure after all so i felt this was one of nolans only movies where the clonky dialogue and awkward chaotic editing actually worked to its favour",2023-08-09 09:46:40
"i have become death quote while in bed with a woman before even starting the manhattan project stood out especially

yea that was an awkward part for me too

i guess they wanted to stablish that he knew many languages including sanskrit and was a fan of the gita but that famous quote so early in his life and at such a weird moment felt out of place",2023-08-09 15:02:06
"i was expecting the score would be hans zimmer but i think it is okay now   


zimmer x nolan preferably better on scifi takes and mindbending film",2023-07-24 03:28:59
i’d say it was already 3 hours so there wasn’t much room for that haha,2023-07-24 03:12:28
yeah going in i thought matt damon would be the weak link in the film but as soon as he appeared i felt the film gained something a bit of humor relatability,2023-07-28 23:38:30
" i would say it was good but not great like most of nolans movies super high production value great performances looks great but something felt missing

i believe christopher nolan makes his best movies when his brother jonathan nolan writes them jonathan cowrote memento the prestige the dark knight the dark knight rises and interstellar while he did not write batman begins inception dunkirk tenet or oppenheimer i hope they collaborate again because i greatly enjoy the prestige but i did not care for oppenheimer",2023-08-10 00:09:44
i honestly felt very let down by the characters almost nobody stands out from one another to me and the rate at which characters are introduced and then cast to the side was a lot for me to handle,2023-10-22 18:38:49
" they overstate the fear of igniting the atmosphere

agreed its not in the film but in the book the film is inspired by theres a documented private conversation in which oppenheimer says to a friend that living a life as slaves to the nazis would be preferable to burning the whole world this was well before any prototype to the bomb being built but it would have been very fitting to have that in the film

 throwing einstein in there for the sake of having that character in it seemed contrived

hard disagree they should have had more einstein they were nextdoor neighbours for ages",2023-12-12 14:17:10
" throwing einstein in there for the sake of having that character in it seemed contrived 

i just watched it and theres a scene after the bomb where einstein literally comes out of the dark to talk to oppenheimer when the car drives off  wth",2023-12-15 17:32:58
i have nothing to add but daaaamn a whole month crazy love how much nyc is a film city,2023-07-21 02:36:25
and then lewis strauss pops in and steals the limelight and says and iamlewis strauss  snap ,2023-07-21 14:04:47
nolan says hes not making any more superhero movies and then gives us that scene incredible,2023-07-22 23:29:34
then on the other end you have chernobyl which the average viewer loved for its simplicity but that same simplicity resulted in a lot of inaccuracies and incomplete explanations,2023-07-24 04:13:09
im sorry but i have very little patience for someone who doesnt have a disorder and cant sit through a movie like this without understanding a thing its your own fault if youre that dumb,2023-07-24 03:45:50
i don’t really think youre expected to remember a lot of the names or to be able to put them to face outside of the main cast generally when they refer to a character who hasn’t been present for a while they briefly cut to a previous shot in the movie to jog your memory,2023-07-24 22:22:04
that is exactly why i only go the movies on saturdayssundays morning even when its for comedy or marvel movies its just old people and me during oppenheimer an old lady spent 5 minutes whispering to herself looking for her hat that i believe never made it to that place but other than that theyre basically sleeping with their eyes open made me fall back in love with the cinema again,2023-07-30 16:52:45
this is why i like alamo drafthouse theyll straight up throw a talker out of the movie no refund no exception and they remind everyone of that about 8 times before a movie starts just to set expectations,2023-07-30 17:15:36
my theater was full of a bunch of old people and i didn’t see a single cell phone and the bomb scene was completely quiet in the theater so the lesson here is go to movies with a bunch of old people,2023-07-30 21:29:53
that’s sucks when i experience this i get the urge to throw my drink at them,2023-07-30 10:27:22
my friend also took out her phone multiple times throughout the movie i am seeing this much more often and i think the whole short attention span issue is starting to show i will rewatch the movie by myself in a few days,2023-07-30 18:05:07
"my sympathies i went to see it in the imax theatre and it was full house this truly has been the first time that it was so difficult to get the tickets and i ended in the first row so this whole gigantic screen was above me some groups were eating popcorn loud but other than that no distractions maybe it is because people are paying extra money to see it in imax better projectors better sound system etc and they want to watch this movie in the best possible quality if you can allow yourself for such experience then maybe give a second shot at this and see it in imax   


great thought about attention span totally agree instagrammers and tiktokers and the scrolling generation certainly does not have that long attention span",2023-07-30 12:37:46
yep my only problem it wasnt much in mine but i would just love it sir with it alone and jump out to get my facts right and rewind some moments i missed because i was distracted my some people being wierd,2023-07-30 18:41:51
dude i was in tears watching the speech oppy gave after the test the foot stomping scene messed me up the screaming,2023-08-04 00:08:12
people said that im so glad i avoided reading or seeing a single thing about the movie before finally seeing it tonight im glad i had no expectations it allowed me to really enjoy it,2023-08-13 06:38:09
felt the same way after i left the theater i really wanted to enjoy it but just couldn’t for some reason maybe a rewatch will change something,2023-08-13 05:47:47
its incredible making a film that has 3 running timelines fast dialogue  that may or may not be audible  and quick jump cuts every 10  seconds and still making the whole thing drag,2023-08-21 08:39:36
lol movies are tough huh,2023-08-20 17:18:31
it really wasn’t perhaps you were confused if that was the case i suggest reading the plot online and then going on for a second watch the hearings become more interesting then,2023-08-20 15:16:39
perhaps it is testament to rdjs acting talent not enough people today remember he was one of the youngest men to ever be nominated for a best actor oscar for chaplin,2023-09-04 20:52:10
kind of,2023-07-21 14:21:08
the problem with cgi is a lot of times they dont do fire simulation well or they try and make it more hollywood to what people would want from an explosion versus what it actually was,2023-07-23 02:13:24
"agreed with all the hype that quite small explosion was very disappointing it did not look like an atomic test  and there is a lot of example footage to compare to 

it seems like an own goal to limit yourself that way especially when the film had plenty of cgi scenes space scenes with nukes anyone",2023-07-23 02:17:40
yup it was unfortunately pretty obvious that the explosion was not that big even with the special camera tricks trying to make it look so,2023-07-23 01:31:32
"dude wierd context is an understatement

random page flipped to  said during a  is how they set it up then when he does actually say it after trinity it was midaf

naw goodgreat movie entirely botched that",2023-07-23 17:00:33
"i want to congratulate you on your honesty i too felt the blast was a bit mediocre and i wanted and expected it to be something that took my breath away instead we got a cloud of fire yes its technically correct but it didnt even resemble a mushroom cloud yes  it was a closeup but it was not terrifying like many said it would be the netrons firing inside the cloud were also a bit off putting since thats nothing that you see in real life they added it to remind you of splitting atoms

x200b

im also not impressed with the number of flashes of atoms splitting building up to the atomic bomb inside oppenheimers head it looked like a made up imaginary image done with a dance of lights and a long shot camera capture effect very much the opposite of a scientific approach like the black hole in interstellar i was left feeling unimpressed and not inspired by the subject matter at all

x200b

my third complaint goes to the choice of not explaining the science very well im specifically thinking of the scene where oppenheimer gets the news that a successful split of atoms has been made there was a line where oppenheimer says now every physicist in the world is thinking about the same thing a bomb yes true but the audience does not do that leap automatically it would be very interesting to give it a few minutes to explain to the audience how einsteins emc2 equation defines how much energy splitting an atom releases and given how small they are and how many can fit in a gramg it would mean an enormous amount of power when the mass is measured in kilos if this were done in a cinematic way without letting the audience know it was trying to educate them then the actual scene where the first bomb went off would have so much more impact i believe",2023-07-25 09:13:39
"i know its a biopic about oppenheimer but yes more or less entirely glossing over the japanese victims in order to focus on the is he a commie questioning wasit was a bad choice ill just say it

i especially feel this way given putins recent nuclear saberrattling film doesnt exist in a vacuum remind people whats at stake if we forget about the mistakes of the past history isnt a story of the past its a description of the present or something very much like this cant remember it verbatim was a prominent line in the film after all",2023-07-30 21:33:51
watched both yesterday i disagree thought oppenheimer was way better,2023-09-03 22:52:12
i thought timelines until later in the movie when some of the once black and white scenes were in color my best take is that the black and white scenes were always from strauss robert downey jr’s perspective while the color scenes were oppenheimer’s first person perspective,2023-07-21 20:47:06
"he was from the chicago group of scientists rather than los alamos which strauss took as a good sign for two reasons he didn’t have the strong relationship and hero worship of oppenheimer that a lot of the los alamos scientists did and the chicago scientists were upset with oppenheimer for not signing the petition on the use of nuclear weapons

remember that rami malek’s character was the one who physically tried to hand him the petition and oppenheimer smacked it away",2023-07-22 01:36:57
for me personally it was terrible i honestly missed so much dialogue and was getting so mad i seen people say its better but honestly i went to a state of the art cinema and it was bad i didnt watch it in imax 70mm though,2023-07-22 10:04:49
"didnt see it in true imax but the mixing was terrible whenever music was playing which was like 90 of the film it was very hard to follow the dialogue my wife is a nonnative speaker and the film was incomprehensible to her for this reason

this is a recurring problem with nolans films that he doesnt seem to have much interest in fixing didnt see tenet but heard about the same issues and i guess it wasnt a big deal in dunkirk because it wasnt that talkie to begin with but this film turn the  music down so i can hear what the characters are saying bro",2023-07-22 11:39:13
everything was clear,2023-07-22 12:21:00
"watched it in 70mm imax

apart from the occasional phrasescenes where the score gets loud dialogue was pretty much clear

didnt really have an issue with it on the whole i think i was ok with not understanding the occasional line after sitting through tenet and having no  clue  anyone was saying",2023-07-22 11:26:26
lol the  kicker was finding out after the movie his motivation was literally misinterpreting that einstein conversation as being about him and being humiliated by oppy talking about exporting isotopes to sweden,2023-07-23 03:51:43
colour scenes were from oppenheimers perspective black and white werent,2023-07-23 06:03:40
strauss was on the record as being strongly against the exporting of radioisotopes for medical aid purposes claiming it was a national security risk oppenheimer effectively debunked this at a public hearing in a very condescending mocking way strauss took this personally and never forgave oppenheimer for it,2023-07-24 01:23:00
strauss thought the us should not export radioactive isotopes because he believed their primary value was for military use and their export would be against national security interests oppenheimer the actual scientist knew that although isotopes were necessary for building nukes they have a lot of beneficial nonmilitary uses as well esp for medical imaging and diagnosis oppenheimer needled strauss for his ignorance during an aec hearing on the subject “my own rating of the importance of isotopes is that they are far less important than electronic devices but far more important than let us say vitamins” strauss never forgave him for it,2023-07-24 01:18:42
it was the first soviet atomic bomb detonation in 1949,2023-07-24 23:57:25
"the last lines of dialogue

oppie do you remember when i came to you with those calculations and we thought we might start a chain reaction that would destroy the entire world

einstein i remember it well what of it

oppie i believe we did",2023-07-27 21:51:59
the last thing oppenheimer says to him which are the final words spoken in the movie is i believe we did,2023-07-27 21:52:22
"they used 6kg of plutonium in the trinity test the rest was used for little boy and the uranium was used for  man thats why we dropped two in succession to make the japanese think we could do this forever when in reality itd be months before wed have enough uranium or plutonium for a bomb

the japanese knew the war had been lost since the marianas turkey shoot they were betting everything on a conditional surrender that would allow them to keep their imperial system and autonomy they couldnt beat the us but they can bleed the us until the american public gets sick of it all and is willing to settle for peace however america had learned its lesson from ww1 and knew that a conditional surrender would probably lay the ground work for ww3 is 20 years",2023-07-30 15:48:13
"my interpretation is basically he had an ego wanted to flex he made the atom bomb but also none of the moral and ethical stain of the mass killing of the bombe despite the entire time advocating for and creating the bomb

he thought by suffering public humiliation he’d be able to reshape his legacy which to be fair is exactly what happened it’s why this movie even exists",2023-08-06 13:18:48
"also what was the humiliation exactly that oppie did to strauss that he made fun of big executives while coming there with him and was it that bad that it was one of major reasons why he had to go that far against oppie or was it mainly about him not going through with h bomb

in the film as in real life oppenheimer and strauss disagreed over whether selling radioisotopes for medical purposes to other countries was a risk to us security oppenheimer could be very condescending about those he thought were below him in intelligence which was almost everyone and as the movie shows oppenheimer made a cutting remarkjoke in a congressional hearing about strauss views which strauss found humiliating there were a few other factors as well to their feud you got the main one correct which was a disagreement over the hydrogen bomb",2023-08-06 17:30:45
thay woman was played by christopher nolans actual daughter,2023-07-21 13:06:14
we didnt even get a mushroom cloud just a close up of fire,2023-07-21 22:58:19
"true but since nolan was going for no cgi the other alternative was to get us to actually blow up a nuke for the film

that wouldve been awesome though",2023-07-21 23:07:38
totally agree particularly with the pr beforehand saying that the filmmakers were using some new technique to render explosions,2023-07-21 22:59:18
yeah honestly it was a bit underwhelming i checked out the original videos of the trinity test to verify that my expectations werent inflated by having seen lots of much bigger hbomb tests but no he could have used the real footage and it would have looked much more impressive id say at this point not using cgi was a bit of a pointless pet peeve but i can respect wanting to tackle the challenge and i think this still had to be one bigass explosion,2023-07-21 23:01:05
yeah the build up was amazing the explosion wasmeh,2023-07-21 23:05:19
they could have done it at 110th scale that would have been about 5 million pounds of tnt they could have added a ton of magnesium powder for a nice solid glow upon detonation you film it at 240fps and you have a pretty  scientifically accurate representation at scale and not a scrap of cgi but yet he did not even do that curious,2023-07-22 00:14:35
they needed cgi nolan doesnt do cgi although even for practical effects it was a fairly feeble effort im honestly not sure they were even trying to mimic any real test footage just lit some gasoline on fire and called it good,2023-07-22 02:35:14
i appreciate it was a little subdued its moment had the potential to take over the plot and jro himself it didnt,2023-07-21 23:40:05
"i actually was a little bit disappointed  yes  but just a tiny bit  after all trinity was a fairly small i missed the scene where everyone is happily clapping and cheering with atomic mushroom being visible in the background  

 also during post trinity speech i felt like that scene should had been more terminator 2 like   instead it looked a bit 
like  overexposed with light mess 

i still enjoyed the movie it was good but i dont think it was great",2023-07-21 23:46:01
yeah the explosion was a complete let down after that amazing build up looked like a run of the mill gasoline explosion in slow motion looked like i could stand next to it and barely singe my eyebrows,2023-07-21 23:41:36
tell me a movie that has a good atomic bomb scene there isn’t one it’s hard to cgi that makes it look good,2023-07-21 23:47:50
i wasnt expecting an action movie but i was expecting a movie more focused on the actual making of the bomb the manhatten project and the science behind it instead most of the movie was centered around oppenheimers controversy with his communist background with tiny tidbits of science sprinkled in even so all of the courtroom and interrogation scenes were them talking about events that had happened but werent shown on screen so it was really difficult for me to follow since it was mostly that non stop for most of the film without any sort of break idk it just wasnt for me,2023-07-22 13:01:18
the only scene that truly never felt organic was einstein appearing just as the car sped off lol,2023-07-22 07:10:16
wife doesnt care about politics history or physics but loved the movie  i do love those things and didnt love it,2023-07-22 09:03:41
if youre insatiably curious about all the documented reasons that j robert oppenheimers security clearance wasnt renewed in the late 1950s this movie is for you,2023-07-23 00:23:40
"if you dont care about history physics or politics this movie isnt for you lol 

nolan fanboys think theyre the only smart people in the room this film was rambling pretentious clinical twaddle",2023-07-22 07:26:10
"rami maleks character isnt in american prometheus as it doesnt deep dive into strausss confirmation hearings but david hill was one of two manhattan projectlos alamos scientists who testified against strauss and nolan looked up his testimony

as for the sentiment of what was the bfd about mccarthyismthe red scare  well i guess time really does heal all wounds except in this case were going to be doomed to repeat history if we dont learn and appreciate it",2023-07-22 14:21:10
im japanese so watching this movie was interesting to me i was expecting them to atleast show the hiroshimanagasaki nuke but surprised they didnt overall i think nolan did a good job portraying the hiroshimanagasaki with respect while also keeping the main focus of the movie on oppenheimer,2023-07-23 09:18:44
red letter media made a very similar observation in their review they made a funny cut of 12 angry men to illustrate the point,2023-08-01 21:20:14
"the  scene at the hearing probably represented how vulnerable openheimer was and also how his wife saw him after she learned of the cheating

but yeah that scene could not have been there too",2023-08-02 06:59:41
honestly i found the actual explosion a bit underwhelming cgi wouldve 100 helped i bought an imax ticket just for that scene but afterwards felt i didnt need to see it in imax,2023-08-09 20:55:31
"as someone familiar with the work of almost every person who showed up in the movie it was a more exciting movie than avengers

but for someone who hasnt studied chemistry in college i would expect the movie to be a snooze fest packed with too much detail and strange names many of the physicists were not even american with names like szilard and fermi indeed the slightly older gentleman who sat beside me in the theater slept through more than half of the movie",2023-08-12 23:54:53
thats because its from oppenheimers point of view the scientists never got to see what theyd built actually  people instead it shows oppenheimers imaginings which makes sense,2023-08-29 23:30:30
were supposed to see it from oppenheimers perspective and he looked away during the briefing hence why we dont see it either i saw an entire video on youtube on this topic whether they shouldve shown actual footage of japan and the japanese civilians postbombing there are good arguments for and against i personally think it was the right choice for the movie to not show it,2023-09-03 10:00:20
i get where you’re coming from but i also thought it made sense we’re seeing this from the perspective of the scientists and military personnel and bureaucrats who helped develop the bomb and the policy around it none of them actually saw it none of them actually knew what it was beyond impact zones on maps and the trinity tests which we saw they can still wrestle with the issues without having to “see” the effects,2023-08-28 01:32:37
"its more appropriate to acknowledge that it happened and let another more appropriate filmmaker tell that story maybe a japanese filmmaker as the obvious example

the there were a good multiple acknowledgements worked for me the movie had a  of points to get across so it was already fast paced any more would bloat it",2023-08-29 23:41:41
"one answer is that it’s called oppenheimer as in it’s about his life which included pre bomb and post bomb experiences  i found the clearance and communist stuff factual and fascinating 

post ww2 american history is interesting  maybe see the movie “the blacklist”",2023-10-09 13:36:25
"i don’t think knowing that the us and russia didn’t like each other because they were capitalist and communist is particularly heavy prereading 

the biggest miss is the security clearance it’s not evident why it is critical even though they repeatedly explain it undermines him as being noncredible 

you just weren’t paying attention",2023-10-16 14:50:56
same nolan was my favorite director but after this and tenet i’m done with his movies going forward he’s making his movies overly complicated for no reason and his sound mixing is straight up garbage i don’t enjoy watching his movies anymore,2024-01-04 23:53:29
"wife and i finally got to watch this last night and im with you on the strauss flip  it suddenly felt like it was no longer a movie about oppenheimer at all just this guy who got laughed at and embarrassed and now was going to get his revenge  

also  it felt like downey was miscast  i wouldve liked to see an older actor in the role like arkin rip

the sound mix was really bad in spots where the score was overpowering the dialogue  sucks to have to constantly mess with the volume instead of enjoying the movie

oh and murphy definitely is getting an oscar for this",2024-01-01 11:15:12
i didn’t realize he was supposed to be the antagonist for some time and still don’t really understand who he was agreed,2023-07-22 20:55:14
"completely agree 

when we got to the last hour and it was all about rdj vs oppie i was like when did this start why is this happening i couldnt connect it to the earlier parts of the movie everything moves so fast its confusing",2023-07-22 21:48:46
this right here  even as late as the bar scene where strauss is trying to introduce people to oppenheimer i was still guessing on whether they were on good terms or not,2023-07-22 21:32:59
they waited too long to tell us that strauss hung onto being slighted by einstein and i didnt understand why oppenheimer was being snarky in that hearing and that he humiliated strauss,2023-07-22 21:49:34
i feel like the ambiguity was the whole point since it wasn’t until the end that lewis really showed his true character not only to the audience but to his advisoraide guy especially when his advisoraide correctly suggested that oppenheimer and einstein might have talked about something more important lewis was an unscrupulous and paranoid careerist politician as a contrast to oppenheimer who absolute did more damage but at least had moral qualms about his actions and attempted to do something good afterwards,2023-07-22 21:53:16
i appreciate you acknowledging this because i knew very little about the events going into the movie and i thought the movie was very hard to follow and was bored throughout much of the movie i had a hard time following most of what was going on outside of los alamos and the direct production of the bomb i feel like nolan did not do a good job provided context for people who are not experts on the subject,2023-07-23 03:17:24
i had no idea what was going on for most of the movie,2023-07-23 02:00:21
okay i was kinda lost at the beginning with the straw guy in court followed most of the movie well except for when he was talking about snitching his friend or mixing up character names then figured it out at the end when they do the court scenes,2023-07-23 02:09:09
wondered the same thing i read american prometheus earlier this year and am glad i did that being said it took some of the emotional punch out of a few scenes as i knew what was coming especially with tatlock,2023-07-23 02:11:48
"i’m pretty up on most history in a casual timeline sense but this is the first history movie in a long time i would have preferred to go against my normal non fiction movie strategy… read absolutely nothing before the first viewing and then read in deep detail after

i feel like my first viewing would have been significantly enhanced if i did a casual or deep study on his life projects and demise",2023-07-23 05:19:59
"jean also got much more screentime for some reason although kitty was married to oppenheimer for much longer and arguably had the bigger impact on his life

the scene where she shut down that prosecutor feltundeserved since she didnt really have much character development beyond drinks a lot and has a temper earlier in the film",2023-07-23 05:51:40
"generally speaking biopics have a very low rewatch value 

i loved a beautiful mind and the imitation game i wouldnt rewatch them",2023-07-23 23:18:39
"personally 

interstellar 
prestige
dark knight 
then oppenheimer 

this is just my personal enjoyment not what i think is a technically better overall movie

i don’t rank movies on how likely i am to rewatch it i loved the whale i will never see it again",2023-07-23 23:29:24
interstellar the dark knight the prestige memento and inception are all definitely more rewatchable than oppenheimer and in my opinion they are better movies too,2023-07-23 23:21:02
i said this last night there are multiple movies i would rather rewatch of nolan’s even with this fact i think oppenheimer is his best overall film,2023-07-24 00:18:41
i think rewatchability is an important factor in great movies i can not see myself ever watching oppenheimer again either,2023-07-23 23:19:50
"i think it’s his best movie one of the best movies i’ve ever seen one of the most important movies of the 21st century but not one i would feel compelled to rewatch

it’s subject matter is so heavy so exhausting it’s an emotionally draining film",2023-07-24 01:31:54
"ill get downvoted for saying so but upon rewatch the only good batman movie of his is batman begins dark knight rises in particular is a horrible movie

my personal 5 faves are

1 oppenheimer which i havent rewatched yet but am seeing again this week
2 inception
3 prestige

his best written film since the prestige contains a good dozen of the best performances on all of his work,2023-07-24 02:01:07
“  “  richard feynman,2023-07-28 15:58:53
maybe because people who like films don’t write paragraphs to other people about it if you want criticism then that’s what you get,2023-07-22 23:00:33
so sorry that everyone in the entire world doesnt hold the same opinion thats really sad and implausible,2023-07-22 21:41:42
do peoples negative opinion of movies hurt you,2023-07-22 21:39:05
"i liked the movie id give it a solid 810 but i had some problems with it the score was louder and more prominent than it needed to be during a lot of the movie the movie was too  long the third act draaaaaaagged the first act was pretty hard to follow lots of scientists and random friends i still dont know who exactly the people were that they left their kid with rami maleks presence was very distracting because obviously he was gonna come back for some big reveal 

but it was also super engaging very well written and acted a great story to tell and had a couple jaw dropping visuals with incredible sound effects i dont think it quite lived up to the hype but realistically how could it have",2023-07-22 23:14:11
this rmovies poster is soo much better than rmovies you guys were lucky to have him here if only briefly,2023-07-23 02:18:32
ooooh that was feynman that makes so much more sense now,2023-07-27 06:37:56
"i wonder if the film indeed was full of physics puns or if im reading to much into it 

like you might  say our paths crossed

or the explanation of quantum physics one might be led to the  presumption that behind the quantum world there still hides the real world in which causality holds  being a reference to the theme of the movie",2023-07-27 07:13:53
i recently read surely youre joking mr feynman and then was pleasantly surprised hes also in the movie i didnt realize he was also in the manhattan project,2023-07-27 12:58:03
"can anyone help who is this scientist in the trailer groves was yelling at him how about because this is the most important thing etc

appeared at 119 in the trailer",2023-07-27 06:45:32
,2023-07-27 07:22:29
i enjoyed seeing the cal campus my alma mater after so many years it hit me personally,2023-07-27 11:07:00
i think the most impressive part was framing the history of science like einstein not being in the same time as oppenheimer i think we tend to compress history and wed be forgiven for thinking history is just back then this movie did a good job showing the progression of science as a discipline,2023-07-27 15:52:56
like going to a concert and getting a three hour nonstop guitar solo,2023-11-22 10:37:18
"this it worked for action movies but this was just a political drama the editing jumping around in between dialogues with loud action strings for what is othewise normal conversations got tiresome fast

the dialogue included so many cringe philosophical quotes over the most mundane topics it sounded like selfparody at times

it was unnecessarily long yet what would have been the most crucial moments like the japan bombings hitlers invasion and the german surrender are mentioned in passing nagasaki and the period in between both bombings are barely mentioned makes it feel really rushed at the end

itd also never made clear if he actually felt remorse for what he created or saw it as necesary other than with those dumb flashing colors scenes that are suppossed to mean ptsd hes shown to be worried for the hbomb as if killing 80000 instead of 200000 somehow made him more ethical the effects of a nuclear bomb are never even shown other than the mentioning of a death toll one of his flashes showing a girls skin peeling off and thats it the only explosion shown looks like a slightly larger than normal explosion in between all this were suppossed to care for a random politician and his political play against oppenheimer this is dragged on for the entire movie and at the end hes randomly saved by a random scientist we saw for two 20 seconds scenes before  rami malek who for some reason knows about the politicians entire plot never being explained how and why did everyone believe him

the movie was more about the red scare than his actual creation this persecution is shown as a politicians personal vendetta but the movie does acknowledge oppenheimer had a  of communist connections and activities yet his only punishment was his clearance being revoked",2023-11-19 16:01:21
yeah i think this was his worst movie,2023-11-20 14:21:38
"its the only way he could make the three hour runtime manageable given the content fast dialog loads of cuts no long shots of landscapes or characters doing something menial just a constant flow of dialog and location switching in the hope that he wont lose the viewers attention that and it feels like hes trying to say way too much in too little time whilst not advancing the plot at the same time

its fine for a good 3040 minutes but 3 hours of that is just horrible to watch",2023-12-01 10:20:02
stick to marvel kid fan hahahaha sure just because u like what everyone likes dosnt mean ur a fan,2023-11-21 18:30:29
"he didnt do the whole film without cg major vfx studio worked on the movie it is just fancy marketing trick for vfx  cg so while the explosion was real you could play with it in post and comp multiple layers and what not retouch it scale it whatever and they would not count it as cg cause the element would be real even if heavily vfxized

but yeah after all that leadup i too expected something bigger to show  now to think of it i guess a fitting parallel would be dunkirk beach without many people cause he didnt want to use cg folks",2023-07-21 20:43:46
exactly my thoughts the nuclear bomb looked like a hollywood explosion very underwhelming i loved the film but the climax of the bomb going off was weak and after that the film started feeling too long and the mystery was not interesting,2023-07-21 20:16:55
its an ego thing dunkirk was seriously diminished by the refusal to use cgi but the point is that audiences were engrossed anyway look ma no hands,2023-07-22 02:37:55
idk if this is a  but breathing noises was a part of the scene,2023-07-22 06:29:38
my favorite chuckle was when einstein just appeared like nick fury,2023-07-23 04:21:24
i agree about the explosion itself specifically there was a shot where the mushroom cloud was in the background and the men were in the foreground the explosion just looked really small,2023-07-23 16:47:30
the third act is not about his security clearance but what the security clearance and trial represent its about his loss of control the inner turmoil he experiences and his realization that he created a chain reaction that he cant control and how reckless he now realizes that may have been because he is powerless to stop it,2023-07-24 21:18:21
i was disappointed because i went in with other expectations i wanted it to be about beauty witch i think the theme that resonates strongest with me but its a good mix of three themes anxiety scientific pursuit biopic and unfair treatment,2023-07-26 08:49:26
i also thought the trinity test was smaller than expected although i think it was intentional and more poetic that way a subversion of expectation the final shot of the mushroom cloud seemed more like a poison flower to me a toxic and beautiful creation with the power to multiply and eradicate all life on earth,2023-07-28 00:00:13
"before the trinity test he said something like

 i’ll send a message if things go our way… bring in the sheets

then after the appeal ended he simply say

 don’t bring in the sheets",2023-07-30 13:32:55
"he brings up the calculations he brought to einstein when they were worried about the bomb igniting the atmosphere 

something about a how they were worried they would start chain reaction that would destroy the entire world and then he says i believe we did

implying that atomic bombs will eventually destroy the world",2023-08-06 00:01:42
i’ll be honest there’s barely any reasons to see this movie in imax,2023-08-11 17:57:17
i think its just what nolan himself recommended,2023-08-12 12:06:42
"it was pretty distracting to see those bars flash in and out of the frame as there were so many little 70mm shots

that being said it was actually amazing to see in 70mm i wish the entire movie was actually shot on that because it was like a moving fresco just this gigantic wall that sucks you into the scene",2023-08-14 07:58:28
it is called “oppenheimer” and not “the manhattan project” … might’ve been a good sign on what the movie would focus on,2024-01-30 07:07:08
its worth it for the sound alone,2023-07-21 14:46:56
they show oppenheimers personal reactions to hiroshima and nagasaki and they show the trinity test,2023-07-21 18:24:38
"“it’s under my real name”

“you should use your real name i like it jfk”

",2023-07-22 00:34:19
i really dont get what about this movie makes it necessary to see in imax the bomb scene was really underwhelming the rest was talking i watched it in a standard cinema and i regretted i didnt wait to just watch it at home not worth sitting 3 hours in the cinema for at all,2023-07-22 08:42:25
not much you were about 1015 mins late,2023-07-22 15:56:40
rdj played strauss who was a member of the atomic energy commission after the war but not directly involved with the manhattan project itself,2023-07-22 18:39:54
it isnt strauss says something about introducing them ands oppie says hes already met einstein,2023-07-22 18:31:29
"nolan did it on purpose

according to nolan this was partially a practical concern casting recognizable character actors in all the roles helped ensure that the audience could keep the dizzying array of characters straight since nolan was committed to not making any composite characters

the moment rami malek shows up in a small role with just 1 line the audience knows hes gonna be important later on the question the audience is left with is what role will he play is he the spy what is going on",2023-07-23 23:26:18
i think the thing about them moving onto japan without lingering too much on it was done on purpose to me it conveyed how caught up they were in building this thing,2023-07-23 23:02:20
they didnt show much it was just oppy hanging around waiting for a phone call and then eventually truman came on the radio to announce the bombs success there were some cheers and etc and then it kind of jumped into the speech,2023-07-26 00:54:03
it was the mayor from buffy for me who somehow got more lines than most of the rest of the alist cast,2023-07-26 04:33:43
lomanitz he was the first student oppenheimer had at berkeley the lone student scene  he kept trying to unionize the radiation lab,2023-07-28 03:11:28
i think he was one of the scientists that eventually got blacklisted cause of communist ties,2023-07-28 03:03:50
his wikipedia page says he had 2 kids so im gonna guess he got laid at least twice in his life,2023-07-28 09:06:29
im just happy i could understand all dialogue,2023-07-28 22:57:20
not really nolan kind of overhyped the imax part of the movie since only 5 minutes of the movie is truly spectacular to see in imax,2023-08-01 00:58:20
they did and they didn’t you will know only after they open the theater door and you see for yourself,2023-10-06 17:17:33
i dont think so born bohr einstein fermi heisenberg were the big hitters amongst others,2023-09-16 16:04:20
wikipedia has her death listed as suicide disputed which is why the movie  is ambiguous about it,2024-03-11 13:16:56
i wouldnt even call it cerebral when you have bombastic dramainduced music puking all over the dialogue in nearly every scene serving to dull ones cerebral senses and trying to invoke the emotional ones instead,2024-03-11 22:51:11
when the sound comes back i think the trinity and then one other time i actually jumped in my seat the second time around that was so so loud,2023-07-21 18:30:37
yeah i was like is there going to be a second stage or oh its fading away,2023-07-22 04:12:10
imagine being such a degenerate you are looking forward to the biopic scene of the biggest war crime in hystory but get dissapointed because you didnt see a big boomboom,2023-07-21 23:43:54
yes nolan needs to address his phobia of cgi with his therapist and stop inflicting it upon international audiences,2023-07-22 02:32:21
i don’t think it’s as rewatchable as those films imo it’s probably artistically better,2023-07-22 03:00:16
"the scene where oppenheimer lectures in dutch was kind of a slap in the face as a native dutch speaker i couldnt understand a word either dont do it or do it better

he did say he learned it in six weeks and the only person he talked to about it afterwards didn’t speak dutch maybe that lecture was actually delivered terribly",2023-07-22 12:19:24
"i regretted not taking my education so seriously as i left the theater i wish i had seen this movie when i was 14  it would have set me on a course to study physics and quantum mechanics and things that can change the world

its funny you say that bennie safdie the actor who played edward teller in this movie was studying to be a nuclear physicist until his brother invited him to a movie screening and got him into film",2023-07-23 06:25:32
"  title card

title cards showing dates of when meetings happened throughout the movie would have made it way easier to follow i didnt like how nolan just expected the audience to know what was going on in certain scenes with all the random time jumps without context",2023-07-24 00:16:28
remember when truman called oppenheimer a cry baby and tried to essentially say the soviets were  that  was so wild to me,2023-07-23 23:27:57
i think when hes asked if he feels that soviet communism and communism are the same and he answers no is interesting communist especially then was basically synonymous with antiamerican when all it seemed those people were interested in was equity i dont imagine that young liberals today are any different but thankfully theyre not taking down our plate numbers or bugging our phones i hope,2023-07-23 23:38:06
thats a political statement from a modern us point of view  there are lunatics everywhere but the soviet communists were absolutely as brutal as the nazis and there was good reason to fear them and anyone supporting them while the paranoia did lead to some witch hunts which is regrettable stalin with the largest and most powerful standing army in the world and a nuclear bomb was terrifying,2023-07-24 01:24:32
just one wideshot would have helped with the nuke in full view illuminating the desert around it to give it scale i can definitely see it done with a miniature set,2023-07-24 14:22:48
i concur with both of your points also i think florence pugh was wasted if you wanted a character to be a dour communist who throws flowers in the garbage and is mad at oppenheimer anyone could have done that what a weird casting choice,2023-07-24 20:41:34
" the snippets shown in the trailer of the fireball expanding and hitting the desert

i didnt watch the trailers because i never watch trailers for movies i want to watch but thats a very weird scene to cut out i agree that sounds like it would have enhanced the experience",2023-07-24 21:06:52
"to add to what others said oppenheimer made a lot of enemies in the postwar period  he continued to push for nuclear arms control and cooperation with the soviets  he opposed continued work on the hbomb  he pushed for resources in air defense rather than retaliatory strikes and an increased role of the army and navy in handling smaller tactical nuclear weapons

strauss and the fbi used oppenheimers communist party ties to push him out of government and policymaking",2023-08-04 16:23:25
"to me it seemed like a culmination of a lot of little things

 strauss being “shoe salesman”poor jew and oppenheimer being from a wealthier jewish family
 strauss being a committed republican and oppenheimer a “new deal democrat”
 oppenheimer embarrassing him over the plutonium 
 oppenheimer openly advocating against the h bomb
 oppenheimer making strauss beg him for the princeton job

strauss thinks the world revolves around him so he takes all of these imagined sleights personally over time it built up into major resentment and strauss recruited other aggrieved parties to help him",2023-08-04 22:20:08
"someone might put up a better answer but in general the crux was that strauss was a powerful man who was humiliated by oppenheimer  once in public  once among the aec he also thought einstein had been turned against him by oppenheimer but this was later revealed to all be in strausss imagination 

which is kind of the point strauss felt belittled by oppenheimer and his kind the scientific community and he couldnt get past that or believe it wasnt about him and oppenheimers past activity gave strauss plenty of material to discredit him sort of like putting a lighter near a massive stack of dynamite",2023-08-04 15:35:57
"i had to look it up on wikipedia because it didnt make a ton of sense to me either

strauss was a man who believed that anyone that disagreed with him was a traitor to the united states they touch on it a bit with the meeting about the soviet abomb but throughout the late 40s  early 50s oppenheimer made several statements about how far he believed the russians were behind the uss nuclear program when those beliefs ended up being incorrect by increasing magnitude ie in 1953 he claimed the ussr was four years behind them on the hbomb but only a month later they detonated a device that appeared at first to be a thermonuclear weapon strauss concluded that oppenheimer was secretly a russian spy and had his friend hoover begin to build a case against him

you need to read more on that era of the us communism was basically considered satan

"and while i thought that speech scene was a fantastic way of expressing the duality of the situation youve accomplished a scientific breakthrough but its now been used to extinguish thousands of lives i wanted more of that

exactly this i wanted way more of this",2023-08-05 13:11:13
your imax complaint is a very valid one i think the answer is they just tried to use imax cameras as much as possible any scene where it was feasible they used it,2023-08-11 13:59:40
" the movie is 100 too long

i didnt feel that way at all   the time just flew by for me",2023-08-14 19:40:04
"the last 30min pivoted to the real consequences of working on such a terrible project under a selfserving government through a fictional lens the end would be unnecessary but i think the nonfiction nature of the film made the end incredibly important and thought provoking

i was personally hooked the entire time",2023-08-15 07:40:40
maybe i’m biased because i played violin for 7 years but personally i think the score was absolutely phenomenal,2023-12-13 04:53:44

"completely agree this feels like two great movies mashed into one messy one the strauss reveal is carried on the shoulders of rdj not the writing of the movie actually backing it up 

this movie is nolan at his most tedious playing with time for no real reason and a pace so fast itd make an action movie blush",2023-07-21 19:11:58

"its so interesting seeing all the different perspectives on this and dunkirk im pretty much the opposite of you im not a big nolan fan but both oppenheimer and dunkirk are 1010 movies for me

the opening fireball shot with the prometheus quote was wayyy more intense and impressive than the trinity test scene i thought the whole movie would have more cool effects shots,2023-07-22 08:24:36

i was hoping for the plasma ball form the original footage accuratetley reconstructed and enhanced in cgi in super slow motion also marked with inceasingly dramatic classical music akin to what was done in trinity and beyond 1995",2023-07-22 08:17:07
what didnt deliver for you,2023-07-22 08:43:12
lets remember this post and show how it curdles like rotten milk,2023-07-22 10:35:07
i assume nolan wanted to  focus more on oppenheimer than the bomb makingquantum physics it felt like a true biopic imo,2023-07-23 03:02:19
they make it pretty clear why him losing clearance is such a big deal though because he basically loses all his influential power,2023-07-23 03:49:33
"agree  spoilers below

absolutely loved a lot of the movie  building the town recruiting the physicists getting the resources and building the bomb blown away by the test the speech after the bomb dropped the conversation with truman and of course the ending the films depiction of the moral issues associated with creating fire was pitch perfect  
  
but so much of the movie was about the communist angle and the potential revocation of oppenheimers security clearance i understand that the movie is called oppenheimer and that this is a big part of oppenheimers life but here are my complaints  
  
the bomb is unquestionably the main story here whether nolan wants it to be or not its hard for an audience to care about an hour of politics involving a political figure nobody particularly cares about when the bomb takes center stage during the second act  
  
yes its probably a tragedy that oppenheimer gets his clearance revoked but why should the audience care the guy was a theoretical physicist who did a job very well and as the movie tells it he definitely didnt live his life like a saint was he actually going to be a great politician or make a difference if he got his clearance and spoke up more  he bit his tongue in a critical meeting depicted by the movie why should the audience care about oppenheimer getting sidelined politically in the 1950s  
  
the overarching plot involving the is he a communist investigation has been portrayed in so many other movies for so many decades that its unclear why the audience would care that much even if it actually believed that oppenheimer was essential to politics in the 1950s how many films have already portrayed unjust hearings imprisonments and worse during the mccarthy era we have literally seen that movie before many times  

  
bottom line i wished the movie had focused more on the physics the creation of los alamos and the mechanics of building and testing the bomb the film does an absolutely brilliant job of capturing the moral complexities oppenheimer confronted after the bombs dropped  thats the movies main virtue imo and it deserves all the praise in the world for brilliantly portraying those complexities in gutwrenching detail  it just felt like the entire plot line involving robert downey jrs character was a misfire unnecessarily elevating a historical footnote to parity with one of the most consequential moments in modern history",2023-07-23 03:47:58
the point wasnt to revoke his clearance it was to destroy his reputation and credibility,2023-07-23 05:07:24
i hate they just skimmed over  mam and little boy specially the building part of that still a terrifyingly good scene when they were being carted away knowing the coming destruction but still,2023-07-23 02:48:41
i agree on a lot of your points i love basically every nolan movie and i wanted to love this desperately like everyone else is but it didnt click for me at all ill see it again in 70mm and maybe my opinion will differ but people are calling this the best of the year nolans best oscar worthy etc and i just dont see it,2023-07-25 04:18:11
i saw the movie but obviously either already forgot things or just didn’t follow  what was the strauss reveal,2023-07-25 05:20:43
i think most of the courtroom lines are taken from the transcript,2023-07-25 10:28:19
you worded it perfectly i feel the same energy the way the conversations are filmed and each one ends with a punch line and it abruptly switches to a different scene,2023-07-26 00:34:38
perfect description especially of the first act  something about the tight editing and sloooow tracking shots around fast dialog makes for that weird energy  it feels so much like it’s a long trailer sequence,2023-07-26 01:49:41
no many people share that opinion nolan was very cgi adverse in this film and it really shows in the trinity test,2023-07-26 19:39:43
"go google trinity test footage

theres no way to not feel underwhelmed as it was just realistic the same explosion 30 seconds for the sound wave",2023-07-26 19:47:29
the images at the start of the movie were of a star no,2023-07-26 19:41:51
" oppie had mentioned again to einstein the possibility of destroying the planet by burning the atmosphere

minor distinction the scene was oppenheimer and einstein recalling the discussion about the possibility that it could occur with oppenheimer now viewing it as a certainty not because of a scientific chain reaction but instead because of politics and human nature

after hiroshima he went up on the stage to speak to his fellow scientists and engineers a somber man traumatized by what was done and nearly every one of them applauded and cheered everyone in that room was learned individuals fully understanding the implications whether due to pride in their accomplishment or fear of the other they fell prey to mob mentality

thats why he spent the rest of his life arguing and pleading to end nuclear proliferation he didnt want to have started the chain reaction that would end the world",2023-08-03 14:36:33
i absolutely loved that truman scene truman kind of had a point honestly ultimately he was the one who dropped the bomb not oppy,2023-08-04 02:21:19
i thought that was made obvious  he thought developing bigger bombs would accelerate the nuclear arms race to a point where no one wins  the hbomb was so powerful the only targets that made sense were major population centers,2023-08-07 16:50:31
ironically the fear of communism in america real or imagined is really back in fashion with a portion of america,2023-07-22 14:51:19
it’s a paradox but it’s somehow possible,2023-07-22 21:35:55
there was a caption 2 fusion when rdj character povthe black and white scene first appeared thats what the scenes being and bw mean btw its from srauss prespective while the color ones are oppenheimers prespective probably has to do whether how the two povs are different and the names are based on their different opinions on the hbomb,2023-07-26 05:00:50
thank you yes too much pr and hype build around it not being cgi and idk you also build it so much in your head so i was expecting to see something idk otherworldly quantum atomic non cgi  ,2023-07-21 21:29:51
yeah exactly that i get that nolan doesnt like cgi but when it actually makes the movie worse maybe you should move on from that,2023-07-21 22:28:01
that whole sequence was disappointing they hyped up nolan going to use a real atomic bomb that was weak tbh,2023-07-21 21:28:48
agree felt the same the only let down of the movie,2023-07-21 21:25:24
nolan said he did not use cgi so they probably just did blow up a big barrel of gasoline it was very disappointing to me as i am a big fan of the 90s film trinity and beyond that has actual footage of nuclear tests and the explosion in this film was just nowhere near how powerful the real thing looks like,2023-07-21 21:29:55
i honestly think the point was to not let the explosion usurp the real focus and that is jro i thought it was haunting,2023-07-21 21:32:16
"yeah it was disappointing its going to sound like fanboy cope but the movie really was dedicated to the humanity surrounding the bomb and dealing with the before and after of the project so i could say the explosion itself wasnt the point of the movie

the nuclear fireball itself was there but only tiny snippets in the very beginning

a lot of folks will find the movie boring because it is not a nuclear fireworks display as the film concluded i felt like nolan was trying to do justice for a complicated man who was wronged by his government and unfairly attacked i like what he has done here

after tenet i am convinced nolan has an inflated ego and he clearly overhyped the practical explosion i was expecting a full beginningtoend depiction of the fireball a slow motion underwater explosive charge miniatures etc",2023-07-22 00:49:51
that line coupled with florence pugh’s  looming over him was hilarious,2023-07-22 20:48:05
yeah the physics flirting was  cringe as well  atoms are made of mostly air so our bodies can pass through each other  my goodness,2023-07-22 09:08:10
it’s funny i completely disagree with most of this that’s what makes this all great everyone has a different palette,2023-07-24 12:49:30
"those last 45 minutes were just tedium

i felt the movie couldve done without most of the strauss plot honestly while i think rdjs performance was good that was a little too much screentime for one of the less interesting parts of an already long film everything after oppenheimers speech after the dropping of the bomb in japan was pretty unmemorable save for the final scene which was great",2023-07-27 05:28:41
you perfectly summarized everything i was thinking about this movie specifically on his directing style it makes dialogue seem so unnatural it drives me crazy people don’t have conversations that quickly especially when they’re witty,2023-07-27 05:51:35
"theres a reason the film is called oppenheimer not the manhattan project or anything else the film is about his entire life including but not limited to his creation of atomic bomb i personally think the last hour of the film is the best part 

but i have to agree with u on the quick cross cuts it takes a second viewing for someone slow like me to catch up with the fast paced dialogues  whats going on but thats nolan for u",2023-07-27 05:22:27
"i think the strauss plot is explained by blunts characters line near the end 

did you think that if you let them tar and feather you the world would forgive you

imo the film works better once you realize than the manhattan project was never meant to be the main story its rather an explorarion oppenheimers mind during those events and how conflicted he was 

strauss was right partly too when you watch oppenheimer before the trinity test he never shown much doubt towards the bomb development it was only after the test and bombings that he started feeling the enormous guilt and changed his position almost 180 degrees",2023-07-27 10:37:20
who else would you have liked to see direct this picture,2023-07-27 05:01:20
i agree totally with you,2023-07-29 14:04:11
"i can agree that most people didnt actually expect nolan to take a full length auto biography as none of his films were familiar to this storyline but many people who enjoyed the film including me has this weird love for autobiographies


and most people werent actually expecting a political background in this movie while nolan actually portrayed oppenheimers speeches as scenes and his interrogation with fbi or whatever they are


but that movie and dialogues are a solid 1010",2023-12-15 03:52:22
its jarring the people discussing how underwhelming the explosion was seem to completely miss the point of the movie,2023-07-22 22:02:32
as bad as that movie was spielberg still conveyed a more accurate nuclear explosion than nolan did,2023-07-23 02:08:54
i saw it in imax no regrets fantastic cinematography in a fantastic movie the sound was also much improved over a traditional theater the bomb scene was particularly impactful with the massive sound system,2023-07-29 00:46:31
" was basically staring at murphys bone structure for three hours

hahaha so true",2023-07-30 06:24:52
there were definitely parts to it that were dragged out for too long oppenheimers security clearance hearing was hefty,2023-08-06 07:46:21
"oppie had such a good cast too i dont know if nolan didnt trust them the script or the audience but it was a total waste so much laughable melodrama  it was like watching a 3 hour movie trailer my bomb it le kills people bwahhh sound effect and jump cut 
its a shame in the middle 3rd when it actually quiets down breathes and the actors are allowed to stretch their legs a bit its quite good then of course theres the totally out of left field tacked on oceans11ass ending that was so poorly executed i was actually giggling suddenly this whole thing is some corny whodunnit",2023-09-15 02:07:42
"i just finished watching it about 15min ago and this was my exact impression good movie did not like the editing over what felt like most of the film it almost felt like the director didn’t trust the material to hold the audience’s attention and relied on quick cuts to keep eyes from drifting away and make it more ‘interesting’ 

the other thing that bothered me was that the characters felt very one note all the way through which is really odd when you’re following essentially the whole cast over two decades or more i also didn’t really care the relationships very much there’s a lot of interpersonal conflict but if you don’t have much of a connection to the characters it hard to be invested emily blunt’s character really stood out to me in this way mostly because her brief punctuated scenes featured her as ‘angry  kitty’ for half the movie i adore emily blunt she was acting her butt off but between the editing and lack of character development it felt very jarring to me 

i enjoyed it i would recommend watching it but i don’t think it’s quite top tier  nor the best nolan film if i could make one change it would be to focus more on just a few key relationships more emily blunt  i would have loved to learn more about kitty oppenheimer why did she become an alcoholic why was she so  off all the time on her wiki article apparently due to her substance use disorder she developed attacks of acute pancreatitis that led to angry outbursts so i suppose it did lead me to reading more about her but i wanted to watch a film about people not caricatures",2024-01-03 06:43:17
"this movie was as exciting as reading a new fact someone is researching on wikipedia lol

i love slow films and character studies but nolans style is more and more becoming similar to snyders with his 3 recent films its all style at the expense of good story telling 

i hope killers of the flower moon get all the awards it deserves",2024-01-07 08:34:33
"i think the artistic direction was to show that carnage in the director opps face  
there were no file photos shown at all i agree with nolan here  if you need a photo of an incinerated japanese child to get the idea you miss the bigger picture",2023-08-08 05:21:31
i believe his speech at the gymnasium was trying to show some of the effects of the bomb,2023-08-07 17:02:26
he wasnt there was he,2023-08-07 22:53:36
i think it worked because it trusted the audience to fill in the blanks we all know the horrors of a nuclear bomb we dont need to see it,2023-08-08 23:52:13
easily his best,2023-12-03 11:35:09
"just finished it as of 30 minutes ago and i couldnt disagree more i watched with subtitles and took the time for bathroom breaks etc and was left with a feeling of triumph yet guilt

id rank this just below the dark knight in terms of nolan films it was long but never arduous and yes had a lot of dialogue but the pacing was beyond perfect and i was never bored

also i feel like i learned a lot

truly a flawed masterpiece",2023-12-03 06:42:23
this movie would have been a perfect limited series  the chernobyl series did what this movie desperately tried to do but chris nolans ego is too big to stoop so low as to make a limited series so now we have this rushed crammed awkward movie,2024-02-03 13:36:09
"im not sure oppenheimer was supposed to be a sympathetic character and weve seen as much as he has this was a biopic not a bomb movie

 then with him imagining the quantum world in the beginning to the point of losing sleep but then that just magically goes

that went away because he left the lab and took up theoretical work",2023-08-08 11:41:27
it mattered because it allowed him the ability to fight for policy without it he didn’t have the same influence,2023-08-21 21:40:37
"its funny that your comment is the first i saw when i opened this thread because i was just having a conversation with my parents about exactly the same point 

the stakes of oppenheimers security clearance what was he planning on doing with it as well as the true personal motivations of the people who consipred to deny him are muddy is he genuinely suspected of being a communist or are those in government afraid that hes become too critical of nuclear weapons proliferation and smearing him as a means of silencing him why do the scientists whose concerns about the atom bomb he dismissed prehiroshima come to his defense during his and strausss respective hearings 

all in all the penultimate sequence of the movie oppenheimers denial of his security clearance and strausss denial of his cabinet position played like a hamfisted courtroom dramahistorical reenactment and drained the movie of much of the energy and tension that it successfully built over the preceding three hours the final sequence of oppenheimer and einstein at the pond and oppenheimers visions of nuclear holocaust was effectively disturbing enough to serve as a bit of a palate cleanser",2023-08-20 19:05:44
i dont think you understand what the effects of going through the hearings and having his security clearance revoked had on himself and his reputation,2023-08-20 17:53:06
i just saw it and that was my thought too  i liked the first 2 hours about oppenheimer and the development of the bomb  the last third about strauss and the security clearance renewal was so ridiculously boring and unnecessary to the movie,2023-08-20 22:30:14
exactly how i feel  i can’t wait for the fan edit that minimizes the security clearance subplot,2023-08-20 19:40:00
sounds like you just like things blowing up maybe go see a michael bay movie instead if you can’t understand the nuances of intellectual drama,2023-08-21 21:55:15
dr oppenheimer or how i learned to stop loving and worry about the bomb,2023-07-28 11:53:35
"i was expecting the emotional journey of being the person who invented the atom bomb as a character study and this wasnt it it neither reflected the intensity of his mental anguish both before and after nor the immense diety like quality of the bomb he ascribed it i went into it as a character study and was still very underwhelmed

he is famous for his citing of the bhagavadgita in describing himself or perhaps humanity in relation to the invention now i am become death the destroyer of worlds this historical moment is boiled down to a read it to me while we bang scene 

his incredible breadth of his skillset was key in developing the bomb he had a remarkable intuition of many fields of science not just physics which helped make the bomb possible none of that is shown there are a few detonator tests and suddenly the feat of engineering that is only possible due to oppenheimers character is just suddenly done and built

imagine making a movie about the wright brothers and skipping them figuring out how to build the plane its such a strange concept to me youd choose that for a character study

i thought the movie was too close to awesome war footage and explosions while somehow weirdly being mostly legal talk i was going into a movie about oppenheimer showing depth and forethought and got a shallow fast paced court drama and stereotypical  scenes i dont know a man who learns sanskrit for fun doesnt strike me as the guy who has the most vanilla  possible but im digressing

i get that its a character study my point is just that it wasnt a very good or accurate character study and misses the point of what makes the real life oppenheimer a captivating story",2023-07-28 10:03:38
never take a date to theatres if you want to actually watch the movie always go alone on a day show so that you can concentrate,2023-07-21 17:44:21
honestly… the quote shortly followed by the delayed explosion audio was one of the coolest movie moments i’ve ever had,2023-07-22 02:21:35
it is how it really happened the observers are kilometers away the flash travels at the speed of light the sound travels at the speed of sound so it probably actually takes 2560 sec for the observers to hear it in reality but the silence really adds up to the woweffect calm before storm as they say,2023-07-22 05:12:04
not a movie but the miniseries chernobyl has a lot of similarity and intensity and is amazing,2023-08-04 05:13:08

"so casey’s character was the person in charge of oppenheimer surveillance oppenheimer went in to to do something else but took the opportunity to step into a military office to raise concerns about someone tied with the russian communist party who was approaching academics to go behind official channels to get information about the work they were doing for the government russia was allied at the time so there was no particular reason they should be doing that 

it was a coincidence that casey’s character happened to get there while oppenheimer was attending other matters and proceeded to call him in to expand further on those concerns oppenheimer realized who he was talking to and acted suspicious af because he didn’t want to give details about where he had heard the information from he was trying to protect his friend

"it’s one of the key lies that the special counsel catches him in the chevalier incident

i think the main take away is that people were getting killed and being treated subhuman for having any kind of connection with communism and oppenheimer is more of a naïve well meaning person only concerned with truth who didn’t realize how dangerous it was he’s incapable of not being himself and was in front of someone who was just a cold blooded murderer i think it’s in keeping with the theme of the movie where oppenheimer is just exploring intellectual theory and doesn’t understand what will happen in practice  

he had intellectual friends who were variously playing with or were invested in communism but didn’t realize what was at stake and that his life may have been in jeopardy

much like his feelings after bomb and what he had helped create from theory",2023-07-21 15:41:37
"he was trying to be a good citizen and reported an outreach unfortunately he lied and wanted to protect his friend chevalier 

pash affleck was someone who didnt have nuance he was a cold harsh man who you should not mess with and only seemed to care about hunting down communists despite collateral damage thats why damon seems so worried oppenheimer put himself at risk by trying to report an agent",2023-07-21 15:43:11
it was the best scene in the movie too unfortunately it was so unclear what was going on that it was hard to follow but looking back it had the most intriguing aspects watching oppenheimer realize his mistakes and how much hed underestimated those watching his every move and how he was putting his friends at risk thinking he was the smartest man in the room too bad the movie didnt know what to do with the story so it just cut back in forth to other scenes to obfuscate the fact that it didnt understand itself very well,2023-07-21 15:33:49
i was confused too lol hit me up if someone responds,2023-07-21 15:27:24

i don’t think we can see him as ‘good’ or ‘bad’ he’s both it’s ‘good’ that he invented the device that ended the war it’s also simultaneously ’bad’ that it took 200000 civilian deaths to do it 

generally i think strauss is portrayed in a worse light than oppenheimer the injustice and unfair trail that oppenheimer was put through is because of strauss the trial does make you root for oppenheimer even after causing so much death with the invention of the atom bomb",2023-07-24 21:13:41
it was revealed that einstein and oppenheimer were discussing the calculations that there was a chance the trinity test would set off a chain reaction and destroy the whole world it obviously didnt but they realised it instead set off a different chain reaction the nuclear arms race einstein wasnt angry at strauss when he walked off just seriously contemplating the fact that his lifes work could ultimately be used to destroy the world,2023-07-25 03:12:42
einstein wasnt angry he was lost in thought strauss made it about himself because well ego einsteins snub was never a snub,2023-07-25 03:16:10
i don’t think he was angry necessarily but thinking about what the future could hold and he probably just give a  about strauss in the moment,2023-07-25 02:44:20
einstein wasnt angry at the end he was mulling over what oppenheimer just admitted,2023-07-25 04:27:42
einstein wasnt angry its just how strauss understood it wrong einstein and other physicts see the world in total diff way but strauss saw it in political manner thats how he sees the world even the scene where he thought oppie humiliated him oppie was just trying to prove his point nolan ended this movie on such a great scene which made the non linear story telling so much sense it was a political flick and the ending sequence shows how physicists saw the world and the project in a totally different manner than the people who saw it in the political manner like strauss and president in the crybaby sequence,2023-07-25 05:19:50

"i would say that my biggest complaint is that i felt like i missed a decent amount of dialogue

didn’t ruin it but still",2023-07-22 03:30:58
"better than tenet but not as good some of the effusive praise about the sound mixing has implied

it’s much clearer than most of christopher nolan’s recent movies and most of it is perfectly fine but there are definitely a handful of instances where the dialogue was just a bit lower and more difficult to make out than it had any reason to be

it was only really an issue in a handful of places throughout the film though and usually just a word or two that were difficult to comprehend i mostly found myself taking an extra beat and relying on the context of what came next to process some lines here and there if your hearing is worse than mine or you know you have difficulty following dialogue when you miss bits it might be more of a problem for you

but again only in places i found the majority of the film perfectly fine",2023-07-22 03:44:27

black and white was from straus perspective color was from oppenheimers,2023-07-23 12:26:14
its from the different perspectives i assume color being oppenheimers and b and w being strauss but i forgot the dialogues in those scenes so im not sure,2023-07-23 12:21:51
"christopher nolan explained the difference between the blackandwhite and colour scenes in oppenheimer

i wrote the script in the first person which id never done before i dont know if anyone has ever done that or if thats a thing people do or not the film is objective and subjective the colour scenes are subjective the blackandwhite scenes are objective i wrote the colour scenes from the first person so for an actor reading that in some ways i think itd be quite daunting",2023-07-23 14:30:12

maybe she hates flowers because they mean nothing he takes her flowers but has other affairs and marries another woman and in the end completely abandons her my question was  why does he keep bringing her flowers in his final meeting with the flowers seem bit cruel to me,2023-07-24 01:44:22
i thought it was that the black and white scenes were from strausss perspective and the color was from oppenheimers,2023-07-24 03:32:28
the black and white scenes are objective and the ones in color are subjective based on oppenheimers perspective the black and white scenes like the senate hearings happened that way in real life,2023-07-24 03:28:23
i think it was too delineate which storyline was which kinda like how he did in memento,2023-07-24 03:28:32
from my understanding oppenheimer told kitty hed call her to take in the sheets which she was putting out to dry when he left for the big bomb test if they were successful the first time he said this he did get a message to her saying this since the test worked later he tells her not to take in the sheets because i think he doesnt think  win the nontrial,2023-07-24 03:36:02
it was like a code phrase for if something was successful or not,2023-07-24 03:33:10
"oppie met einstein twice once he met him before the atomic bomb 1945 thats when the equations happen 

oppie meets him again in the 1950s when hes appointed to aec which is where he meets strauss this is when he tells einstein that they started something beyond their control and its where the movie ends",2023-07-24 06:21:41
"the original chain reaction was meant quite literally they drop the bomb the reaction doesnt stop the world is literally destroyed

the chain reaction that oppie mentioned to einstein at the lake was more that we as a world would never stop building bigger bombs as a result

does that help",2023-07-24 06:19:35
"correct niels bohr

einstein hated quantum theory using the phrase  does not play dice bohr then went on to prove quantum theory correct and proved einstein wrong",2023-07-24 10:42:39
theyre trying to absolve themselves for their actions either from contributing to the creation of the bomb or aiding in oppenheimers public downfall,2023-07-24 18:50:09
its about recognizing that their contributions to science created something that would inevitably evolve beyond their control the new generation of scientists only comes to acknowledge their contributions because it bolsters up their own potential discoveries oppenheimer gave einstein an award at berkeley because einsteins achievements paved the way for what would be his own,2023-07-24 19:10:39
"i think a good illustration of the thing einstein was talking about is the fact that the us government fairly recently vacated the results of oppenheimer’s hearing and said that rescinding his security clearance was a mistake

who is that decision for oppenheimer is long dead so it isn’t for him practically speaking announcing such a decision doesn’t affect anything at all and certainly doesn’t do anything for oppenheimer who would be the nominal beneficiary of such a decision

the point is that when we honor someone in general but especially well after the fact the award is more about the people giving the award than the person receiving it sometimes they receive a tangible benefit for doing so by associating with the person in question often it’s as simple as just making themselves feel good for doing it

but one way or another award ceremonies often aren’t about you even when “you” are the one receiving the award",2023-07-24 19:36:17
the german guy who was escaped to britain i believe we briefly meet him when los alamos is being built,2023-07-26 02:24:12
the award wont be for you it will be for them awards are ostensibly for the awardee but in this case the award is being given by johnson to distract from and bolster the vietnam war johnson doesnt care about oppenheimer einsteins point is that this is probably true of most or all of awards given out by politicians,2023-07-27 15:39:47
"i interpreted it as the award is more about getting past the fact that they dragged his name through the dirt not his accomplishments this is evidenced by an aged teller shaking his hand the last time teller did this he could barely look him in the eye

for me it was a bit of a callback to kittys line you don’t get to commit the sin and then seek sympathy from the rest of us",2023-07-27 18:52:02

when blackett and the rest of the class leave for a lecture by visiting scholar niels bohr oppenheimer is instructed to stay behind and continue working in the lab to get revenge oppenheimer angrily injects an apple on blackett’s desk with cyanide leaving it for him

oppenheimer awakens the next morning panicked about what he’s done so he rushes to class to intervene before blackett eats it however oppenheimer arrives to find that niels bohr is in the classroom and has grabbed the apple instead bohr recognizes oppenheimer’s outofthebox thinking and tells oppenheimer that he should go where  be allowed to think oppenheimer is able to get the apple out of bohr’s hand before it does any harm",2023-08-04 22:33:00

i watched the 70mm imax showing and i wouldnt recommend it over a regular imax screening when the format switched over to imax there was a noticeable improvement in image quality that i dont think ive seen in any other movie it was like a super hd image but you get used to it almost immediately and it doesnt really add anything to the experience as like others have said its mostly talking",2023-08-06 12:30:47

absolutely i felt so blue balled and the real footage is so much more impactful and crazy that the movie version actually comes off as unrealistically boring,2023-07-23 02:53:53
yeah ive heard that it suffers because of nolans aversion to cgi it looked like a gasoline explosion and the camera cut too quickly for us to really take it all in i didnt get the sense of scale that i expect of a nuclear explosion,2023-07-23 02:26:30
a cg explosion would have been more impressive it looked like a campfire mishap remastered footage would have worked well,2023-07-23 03:18:56
i thought “that’s it”,2023-07-23 02:28:19
counter to most on here i was actually not a fan of the bomb going off in silence it killed it for me actually but the movie ramped up and was way more entertaining for me post trinity test,2023-07-23 04:09:16
seems like what you wanted to see was the actual bomb dropping on hiroshima the test was a controlled environment with proper precautions there was nothing to really see apart from the huge mushroom cloud the sound was intense if you saw it in imax,2023-07-23 02:59:38
massively underwhelming even more so when i remember they spent 100million on marketing it as a manhattan project movie about the bomb and how amazing the explosion will be think of all the posters and trailers legit question if other consumer products can be sued for false advertising why can’t i get a refund for a movie when they spend 100million to lie about what the movie is and then i waste 3 hours 35 hours including trailers and travel of my day off to see something that was not what i was told it would be the studio knew nobody would see if it they advertised as a primarily a hard courtroom drama story,2023-07-23 02:31:55
blud looked like gollum in a suit,2023-07-23 09:23:28
i asked for a closed caption device when i saw it and it made a huge difference if i missed a line i would just glance over at it,2023-07-28 00:04:41
i was worried when the twist was being revealed nolan would paint strauss like a bond villain butwhat he says makes a lot of sense oppenheimer never takes a strong stand on anything he created a bomb only to regret doing so immediately after he took interest in labor unions and the communist party but never full enough interest to commit himself to it he loved his wife but always kept affairs on the side to split his affection a complicated and frustrating individual,2023-08-03 19:07:54
"not sure why this was claimed to be a must see in imax when the movie consists almost completely of just dialog

because it was filmed on imax cameras and from what i can gather almost the entire process from start to finish is analogue with little or no digital work at all which is almost unheard of nowadays

regardless of what you think of the movie and i somewhat agree there is something quite special about watching a production carried out solely on celluloid with all of its character and flaws right down to the sound of the projector chuffing away during the quiet parts",2023-08-24 17:49:43
the i am become death scene was literally leonardo dicaprio pointing at the tv felt kinda cheap tbh,2023-08-26 01:01:05
"i cant believe they actually casted him as the bomb

what a genius decision that man is such a versatile actor",2023-07-22 04:36:14
regardless of whether or not it would have looked cool he should have at least made it look terrifyingly awesome because thats how it would have looked in real life  no cgi was a huge mistake not enough camera tricks in the world to make a conventional explosion look like a nuclear explosion,2023-07-22 13:52:04
i wasn’t looking for a cool factor i was looking for intensity i was underwhelmed by that sequence,2023-07-22 13:43:26
the trinity test was filmed so  intensely  i knew the outcome historically but i was on the edge of my seat the whole time,2023-07-22 14:22:25
" the physics and new mexico line actually made my theatre giggle

maybe too onthenose foreshadowing to use in the movie but my two great loves are physics and desert country its a pity they cant be combined is actually a direct quote from a letter oppenheimer wrote years before manhattan project",2023-07-22 15:56:10
" i’m not sure if i’m just going deaf or if the theater i was at was  but i had trouble hearing like half the dialogue in this film anyone else 

it was distracting that there was so much score i felt it was unnecessary and ruined the tone of tons of scenes",2023-07-22 23:37:41
you can never hear nolan dialogue its just a given nowadays,2023-07-22 23:15:52
now i have become deaf destroyer of ears,2023-07-24 07:02:53
" this is basically the wind rises

on the other side of the pacific",2023-07-25 23:42:44
"in regard to the poison apple  


because one perspective is him recalling the events while talking to the men in the hearing to decide if his security clearance gets renewed

the other perspective is him actually recalling the actual events

its made clear throughout the course of this movie that oppenheimer is no saint nor are most involved what you bring up further expands upon that idea imo",2023-07-27 19:19:21
there was foreshadowing of the shockwave and the math behind how long it would take to travel a particular distance before you heard and felt it the second time around there was a good minute or two of extraneous scenes before the sudden sound of the explosion and effects of the quake left from the bomb at that distance its implied but in an elementary way,2023-08-14 07:19:35
"blowing up a city turns the city itself into a bit of a grenade pulverizing buildings and ejecting them everywhere it also set fire to the cities and instantly eliminated any emergency response

there was also a lot of distance between the onlookers and ground zero on trinity versus the bombs being dropped on japan were in dense urban centers

you can detonate huge bombs all over the southwestern us and they did without directly hurting anybody with a notable exception to the fallout",2023-08-14 07:18:35
it did have a horrid casuality in wiki so they totally knew the potential health effects of it but nolan chose to focus on other things,2023-08-14 19:43:41
did you miss the scene where they calculated its radius and the wind and such,2023-08-14 02:37:26
from my understanding the airwind diluted the vapor during the test because it was in such a remote area you wouldnt get that kind of air movement in an urban area,2023-08-13 23:35:03
because they were miles away and calculated how far away theyd have to be to be out of the blast zone,2023-08-14 00:50:21
probably had faith in humanity to not drop a  atomic bomb on civilization just thought it would be used as a deterrent show of strength,2024-03-19 19:54:57
"well the scene in the conference where they took away his ability to deal with secrets and it showed him having  with pugh while oppies wife was there watching brought home how cruel and unthoughtful he was being to her 

and the relationship with pugh was using her thoughtlessly too

that part of his life made him look awful  nolan was showing oppie warts and all and it was plenty  really",2023-08-07 23:02:09
i laughed out loud when gary oldman came on screen what a great scene,2023-07-21 12:22:18
i literally just stated the same opinion above the imitation game had me more invested in the characters and plots than oppenheimer did it almost seemed like they werent sure how or what kind of story they wanted to tell,2023-07-26 22:45:08
i saw it in 70mm imax the way nolan intended the movie be seen and i was baffled by the audio mixing several lines of dialogue were drowned by unnecessary subwoofer rumbling i think i recall one scene where someone closes a door and it was unnaturally loud like a gunshot went off,2023-07-27 00:02:44
the movie is a chore to sit through,2023-07-27 03:50:09
so well said i just got back and felt the same thanks for sharing your thoughts,2023-08-01 08:39:39
i felt like the movie didn’t really start until he first spoke to his new colleague at the university and mentioned he was about to have his first class and he only had one pupil everything before that was a mess that i couldn’t really follow,2023-08-02 00:40:13
yup the show dont tell fullcircle thing is something i noticed too it really bothered me for most of the movie,2023-08-01 13:35:32
what do you mean by that he had more screen time than some other bigger stars,2023-07-21 15:02:46
"it felt like the entire movie was the complete opposite of what tarantino would do every scene was a snippet of a bigger picture and never allowed to just unwind you would think maybe they filmed nine hours of movie and then just went about editing it down to 3 hours

the biggest mistake is not using cgi the trinity detonation felt less impressive than my cousins hillbilly fireworks show
the sound design is all digital the editing is all digital the color correction is all digital everything about this production is digital except for the actual film it was shot on not using every tool at your disposal including digital ones keeps you from ever reaching the pinnacle of your vision  man and little boy with paul newman was way more compelling than this",2023-07-21 23:48:10
strauss plot was odd and out of place to me  in the end i was like wait why do i care about this guy anyway ,2023-07-21 23:21:37
this definitely wasn’t a movie you had to go watch in imax unless you really enjoy examining closeups of peoples face previous nolan movies had more visually stunning scenes and effects whereas this was lacking,2023-07-22 13:40:26
yes i did in several spots the music was way too loud at certain points i was optimistic because so many people said that he fixed the sound mixing but it was definitely hard to discern dialogue in certain parts better than tenets worst spots though,2023-07-22 22:34:37
didnt see it in imax not available where im at and had the same problem about 3040 of the dialogue was unintelligible for me im debating giving it another chance at a different theater but i have seen other movies at the same location without issue,2023-07-22 22:05:34
"tenet felt like i couldnt hear 70 of the dialogue oppenheimer was slightly better where i couldnt hear 30 of the dialogue 

a big improvement but still not great",2023-07-22 22:40:55
suuuuper typical of christopher nolan movies its probably the biggest thing people have against him,2023-07-22 22:03:02
thats nolan for you,2023-07-22 22:03:14
i didnt have any issues hearing the dialogue  i hated tenet because of that issue but i did see tenet in imax,2023-07-22 22:23:37
you didnt miss much,2023-07-22 22:40:59
a little bit especially when the music was loud but i thought it was a huge improvement over tenet,2023-07-22 22:29:37
the score was one of my big problems with this movie it felt random and sharp and always going on when there was very little need for it the audio in the actual big moments was absolutely perfect but during most of the dialogue i didnt need a violin getting louder for no reason,2023-07-22 23:07:16
i was even told that nolan had fixed his usual problem for this movie nope,2023-07-22 22:08:42
yeah straus’ vindictiveness wasn’t built up enough it was literally that one scene about beer cans the lousy shoe salesmen comment,2023-07-28 04:34:10
"i actually thought they did a great job of names and faces like theyd literally flash the characters face after their name on passing dialogs with other characters

i remembered dozens of names but the dialogue was fast and left little for contemplation",2023-07-29 23:14:20
"man i could not disagree more the film had so many glaring issues in my mind

the acting was phenomenal murphy did an absolutely amazing job and the subject matter itself was very interesting oppenheimer had an extraordinary life 

but the filmmaking execution was just kind of a mess pacing music sound design story structure it was all just cluttered and clunky it felt like they loosely stitched together three different films then edited scenes down to 10 seconds overlayed with indiana jones music so keep the film from being 5 hours long 

i had high hopes and left the theatre pretty disappointed it wasnt a bad movie it was good but it could have been great and instead just fell flat under its own ambition and hubris",2023-08-17 22:12:56
"theres a great movie in there but someone needs to learn how to focus a story and how to tell a story without jumping every two seconds

and how to properly present a  nuclear blast lol this one felt like a firecracker poof and gone

and after that the  thing went on and on",2023-08-05 05:58:53
i loveeee how they didn’t show any of the actual bombings other than the trinity test this movie is a biopic not a wwii action movie we see almost everything through oppenheimer’s pov and he even looked away from the aftermath pictures so it’s no wonder why the audience doesn’t see it,2023-07-22 11:33:06
the theoretical physics the consequences of killed thousands of people in one of the most horrific ways possible documented but never shown and so never felt or understood divorcing the consequences from the story of the man is an absolute travesty,2023-07-22 11:21:18
i knew going in it was going to be more about oppenheimer than the bomb but i guess i was expecting it to be more about oppenheimer developing and testing the bomb and less about him trying to keep his security card the scenes at los alamos actually working on the bomb were few and far between and the trinity test felt like a huge let down midway though the movie and underwhelming considering nolan the cast and crew and others insisted it was so massive it needed to be seen on imax,2023-07-22 13:27:08
i’m gonna watch it again with subtitles on haha,2023-07-23 06:50:51
"i felt underwhelmed by the lack of character study specifically post bomb drop we see a lot of cillian murphy looking sad in a room but i feel theres only two really good shots where we get to see how he feels after the bomb drop the speech with the face melting and charred body and the nuclear light bleeding into the room in the board meeting i wanted more of that surrealism which is why i felt a bit underwhelmed 

that and so because we basically an entire plotline for strauss a character whose only relevance is that he set up the dominoes for oppenheimers security clearance evaluation i didnt care about his failed appointment to a cabinet position cause this movie isnt about him its about oppenheimer i get that hes an important figure in the grand scheme of things but if this is a biopic then we should be focused on oppenheimer specifically this added plotline didnt really add anything to me in the long run especially when the last line of that plotline ends with maybe they werent talking about you maybe they were talking about something more important like yeah guy youre right this is oppenheimers  movie why are we wasting an hour on this guy i dont care that he set up the dominos for the clearance meeting i only care about the clearance meeting in the context of how it made oppenheimer feel",2023-07-25 01:47:08
if he meant this as a character study theres barely any character development i really didnt care about anyone the little emotion that the film had was being carried by the performance and the score,2023-07-25 01:45:02
"hmm these kinda comments just feel so doubleedged ive been to about 78 movie screenings the past couple of months before oppenheimer and the bomb is the thing theyve been heavily marketing in all of the trailers that play for it  
itd be like when marveldisney touts that they spend a bajillion dollars on some movies cg whats it matter when the actual cg still looks underwhelming   


like i get that its very very hard to market whats essentially a biopic but i think its more than fair for someone to give their comments especially if they spent anywhere from 10 to even 40 to see the film",2023-07-25 09:11:37
yup this its a biopic first no reason to see it in imax unless you want to personally we watched it first in pasadenas ipic because its a converted nuclear bunker which feels fitting for the theme were still going to see it in imax but i feel like too many people were hoping nolan actually set off a bomb for the film,2023-07-25 01:03:25
"i think the 1 isnt from the hype but from it being based on a true story imo the fact hes working within those constraints plotwise makes it a bit more impressive plus knowing its real and its our world gives it a bit more weight 

the exact same movie but fictional wouldnt be as impactful",2023-08-04 06:56:13
my friend group mostly gave this a 9 as well and i was in genuine disbelief i feel like they got hyped up by the einstein scene at the end of the movie and chose to overlook the basically 1 hour right before then that shouldn’t have been there when more than a third of your movie is an absolutely dreadful slog no way do you get a 9 that’s insane,2023-08-03 10:50:35
"nah its a genuine 9 or 95  1 because of the hype

nolans crowning achievement thats for sure",2023-08-03 15:54:53
i did like the observation by a couple of characters notably his wife that letting himself be put through the wringer for his security clearance was him punishing himself for developing the bomb that to some degree justified the huge amount of the movie devoted to those scenes but they were too long as you point out too repetitive and in a movie told in nonlinear fashion there was no reason to make them the entire third act of the movie its anticlimactic coming after the apocalyptic drama of the bomb itself especially with that much time devoted to it it basically destroyed the pacing of the film i think theres a bit of stephen king syndrome going on nolan needed somebody to tell him to trim some of the  off but in his position in the industry there probably arent a lot of people to do that,2023-08-22 11:54:27
"even the scenes where oppenheimer feels the weight of what hes done just felt surface level to me any10 year old understands dropping a bomb is a horrific event so the scene where he sees everyone nuked   it was like oh yeah you didnt know bombs do that lol 

i cant agree with that because it seems like he acted like this in real life was all in then suddenly realized its not nolan poor writing its oppie poor thinking",2023-08-20 20:11:43
" one second he meets emily blunt and they have chemistry next scene shes knocked up and then next scene shes suddenly a   poor relationship and character development

yea the point of this is oppenheimer wasnt there so he had no idea his wife was struggling and thats why she drinks this also helps him realize it is important to bring everyones families to los alamos",2023-08-21 12:48:49
stick with michael bay if you just want big explosions ,2023-10-13 20:58:38
someone here with less than 50 brain cells,2023-10-12 20:53:16
a reviewer i really trust said it was a very good movie but that they felt the length was unfortunately felt in that last hour what say you,2023-07-21 11:45:50
no me too it was a plain boring script with brilliant editing to give even mundane scene a grandeur feel with over the top editing and soundtrack nolan can even make a scene with the lead taking a literal dump look grand and his fanboys call it a masterpiece,2023-07-21 11:40:54
i started to get bored in the final act there are some great scenes in there but it started to drag for me obviously the ending was great,2023-07-21 14:08:49
i thought the third act was a bit of a letdown it veered into a conspiracy thriller with exponentially less nuance its well written and well made but it payoffs felt a bit forced to maximize drama,2023-07-21 11:55:28
you’re not the only one and i’m pretty sure you’re holding back when you say “a bit disappointed” i’m a nolan fan and i can’t even gather enough to say i enjoyed this movie the filmography side of it is perfect but everything else missed,2023-07-21 12:48:44
it was undeniably really good it’s just not as generational as some critics claimed some were even comparing it to the godfather  or lotr for example,2023-07-21 15:42:12
100 this i likes the movie but it felt just as you describe it,2023-07-22 21:43:21
"as a big nolan fan i completely agree the movie is borderline impossible to understand due to the pace its everything i dislike about tenet but in a slightly less confusing movie

someone said it better yesterday but the movie is boring not because it isnt interesting but because it has a single pace the entire way through there is pretty much never a point things slow down so even when the trinity test happens it doesnt feel particularly special",2023-07-22 21:12:31
"i warned myself to stop falling for hype this time i let myself buy into the hype it seemed too real boy was i disappointed

just like dunkirk about 100 british soldiers on the beach and two fighter planes fighting it out absolutely ridiculous sense of scale vs reality

and in oppenheimer we never actually got a sense of how destructive the physics are instead of showing the audience the devastation that was created we get a courtroom drama",2023-07-22 22:07:28
bang on it suffers from the akira problem,2023-07-22 23:05:38
how so specifically,2023-07-22 22:49:37
agreed it’s far from perfect but it’s really engrossing imo,2023-07-23 19:46:48
i agree with this wholeheartedly and the ramifications of using nuclear weapons is already obvious to most people but i think it should have shown more of the impact that bomb had using it on human beings so you could feel all the dread oppenheimer feels a little more,2023-07-25 06:37:02
why cant a biopic have an accurate truetolife scene of the explosion i seriously dont understand your argument especially considering oppenheimers moral quandaries about the future of the world rely so heavily on the what he witnessed at the trinity test,2023-07-25 06:46:51
"yes weve seen the movie come on man watch this trailer and say again that expectations regarding the focus were misplaced   
  


i understand that strauss scheme influenced us nuclear policy but how why dont spend time on this instead of dwelving into the technicalities through these courtroom scenes who cares if oppie was a communist or not these are miniscule issues compared to the implications on international security landscape the movie decided to not focus on it and i think it didnt for absolutely the worse",2023-07-25 15:01:07
"my problem with movie is it is way too heavy on dialogue jumps from one scene to another and time really fast

there is not much context or motivation given it is an interesting subject to explore the morality of person who was responsible for most devastating bomb in human history but we dont get that much in 3 hrs of runtime

a 30 min video by veritesium gave enough context on oppenheimer than movie tbh

it has a similar structure as the social network and movie would have been more accessible if they hired a better screenwriter

nolan is gifted director and some of scenes were masterpiece and i had quite a great time experiencing it on big screen but as story i was underwhelmed",2023-07-25 16:08:34
now quickly tell me what that guy is clearly most known for,2023-07-25 15:10:09
i’m more disappointed with the horrific at times script writing the first 13rd of the film was bad in that department,2023-07-25 15:21:01
that was richard feynman playing the bongos you ingrate,2023-08-07 05:43:43
physics yoda is funny,2023-08-07 10:32:56
"you just didnt get it  


for real though oppenheimer isnt nearly as good if you dont know much bout american politics",2023-07-21 10:03:22
"i havent seen it yet but that is arguably true of all of his films since circa 2008 when he went full american studio  blockbuster mode

x200b

just to lock in the downvotes s villenueve is heading down a similar path",2023-07-21 12:00:15
" pretty straightforward

it flashes forward and backward in  4  different timelines",2023-07-22 08:44:43
i thought the movie does make reference that the land was indian land there’s a scene when  and murphy are looking at the land and he says something about it being indian burial ground and then later on when asked what to do with los alanos murphy says to give it back to the indians,2023-07-21 19:20:00
that part wasnt in american prometheus the book nolan used as the basis for the movie also ww2 was a rough time  japanese americans were locked up and whole bunch of civil liberties were trampled so its likely something oppenheimer would have been aware of or even if he was considered out of the ordinary,2023-07-21 18:48:24
he decided not to go the inglorious basterds route of showing the violence to decry the violence it’s a biopic  not a nuclear antiproliferation screed,2023-07-21 21:27:06
i just cannot agree with showing the bombing in japan first off it’s not a ww2 movie and second of all i don’t think there is any way to convey how horrific it would’ve been to be in japan on that day there’s some things that are better left to the imagination,2023-07-21 20:39:15
" we’ll just have to agree to disagree on all counts there

i really think your suggestions detract from the movie though perhaps the trinity detonation could indeed have looked a little more intense

the rest of the movie more than made up for that though i felt",2023-07-21 20:33:33
" the marketing also heavily pushed nuclear weapons

that kind of keeps in theme with oppenheimers legacy being the research and not the weapon",2023-07-21 20:50:35
does it really need to be spelled out to the audience why nuclear bombs are so terrible,2023-07-21 22:07:53
american prometheus is an investment at 600 pages but it is an excellent biography i breezed through it in 10 days the most riveting book ive read in a decade,2023-07-22 00:59:26
we live in a world where that is our normal and we are post cold war fears for the most part for them it was new that is a heavy weight,2023-07-22 15:00:54
"he literally built the equivalent of an atomic bomb using conventional explosives lol

sorry it wasn’t flashy enough for you",2023-07-22 15:46:09
i wish they had used cgi to at least simulate the effects of xrays from the blast  if you look at nuclear test footage its pretty distinctive and the absence of it in the movie was a bit of a bummer,2023-07-22 18:48:10
,2023-07-22 19:36:36
"incredible film hope you had a chance to see it in imax cillian’s and rdj’s performance was nothing short of amazing leo and deniro have an incredible movie coming out shortly and i’m sure will be in the running for awards

what’s your opinion on all of rdj’s scenes are in black and white i’m still thinking on that",2023-07-22 19:34:01
i think she doesn’t like him as a husband but she respects him as a scientist,2023-07-23 01:15:45
the last hour was actually my favorite i love court hearings and cases in films reminded me of the social network loved seeing strauss get his comeuppance also loved the beautiful black and white cinematography,2023-07-23 01:38:29
yea it felt like there wasn’t any second to breathe  just nonstop  happening felt super intentional,2023-07-23 06:38:54
"it was overscored to 

this i completely agree im not sure if its intentional or a mixing issue much like in tenet but so many  times the background score would drown out the dialogue and i cant hear ",2023-07-23 10:37:50
i think the nonlinear storytelling made the film exciting a biopic as it is it needed that nolan touch to make it the cinematic experience that it is i don’t think it would have the same gravity with a linear timeline nolan’s signature touch took this from a great movie to a masterpiece,2023-07-23 09:24:52
well it actually did happen in real life,2023-07-23 11:06:22
"i dont understand why nolan even shot it in imax

because he wants people to see his films in the best quality available which is imax",2023-07-23 14:59:29
"  i dont understand why nolan even shot it in imax

i guess because hes taken a personal goal to keep the format and film cinema alive i admire it film is great when certain directors work with it and a film like this will encourage more to keep using it over digital or at least mix it up more",2023-07-23 15:27:47
"the point isnt to see the explosion in imax the point is to see cillian murphys face in imax or a larger screen in general i think this was one of the truly brilliant performances of our time that has to be seen on a large screen as is usually the case with murphy but amplified by such a knowing directorpartner in nolan he does so much with his eyes and subtle  expressions 

i think all of that is lost on a 42 screen and maximized of course on the biggest screen",2023-07-23 14:35:16
i felt the same way maybe it’s my own fault because i created a narrative in my head where the climax of the movie would be hiroshima and then it happened off screen,2023-07-23 20:39:47
i agree nolans refusal alleged to use cgi weakens the films there are some distracting modern buildings in the background of dunkirk and the same happens in oppenheimer scenes at princeton and of course the bomb blast was underwhelming and did look just like a gasoline explosion,2023-07-24 08:24:57
"i’m actually glad that i didn’t looked up to much information before watching the movie made some scenes very intense nolan also mentioned in multiple interviews that people that don’t know much about the story get the most out of the movie

that being said i do think it helps to read the book read as much information as you can before watching it a second time",2023-07-24 09:50:53
imagine this issue but sitting in the front row with all the faces bent and warped i had an awful viewing experience lol,2023-07-24 12:00:38
"i definitely felt it would have been a more enjoyable film if i actually had that background knowledge about him for me the movie didn’t spend enough time fleshing out his relationship with strauss let alone all of the ancillary characters so when the “twist” gets revealed i was unsure how i was supposed to feel i never felt like strauss or any of these people had loyalty to him to begin with without understanding the bigger context and the nuances of the relationshipspolitical situation it was hard for me to understand the point

when i walked out of the theater my first thought was that i wished i had researched his story beforehand i wanted to just allow the biopic to showteach me it but that wasn’t accomplished for me",2023-07-24 11:01:28
i kinda wished i had done a primer beforehand,2023-07-24 15:08:37
i wish i couldve enjoyed this movie more but i couldnt here a thing they were saying so it made the last 40 mins very boring for me sadly,2023-07-24 10:04:39
i think third act was amazing but i felt like it kinda of dragged on for bit,2023-07-25 03:24:51
what do you mean about the plot,2023-07-25 18:26:34
well it is a biopic makes sense to follow the main character around no,2023-07-25 03:01:03
" there was no real plot it didnt really feel like a story

redditors first biopic",2023-07-25 08:25:15
me wait that was enrico fermi running yhe office lottery pool,2023-07-25 20:29:48
"this was easily my favourite nolan film its just so so good i want to see it again immediately also as a science student this was my infinity war  it felt so funny that every 2 minutes another physicist showed up

i love that nolan seems to treat scientists as genuinely heroic",2023-07-25 18:13:49
first time i’ve actually experienced that phrase i literally was sitting all the way forward as the clock ticked down it was insane,2023-07-28 08:54:05
from what i have read that scene with truman was almost verbatim,2023-07-29 23:22:14
"greyhound granted its an apple tv production i think its really the only movie that covers the atlantic oceans side of the naval battles in world war 2

of course band of brothers the pacific are good mini series

hacksaw ridge is good

masters of the air comes out in september its a tom hanks project similar to band of brothers and the pacific but of the mighty 8th air force",2023-07-30 11:08:34
fatman and little boy,2023-07-30 11:19:43
yeah,2023-08-01 06:31:43
definitely a cinema craze but i also enjoyed the florence  scene in the conference room and im   i felt it delivered the sickening feeling of having your dirty laundry aired out and picked apart by scumbags,2023-08-07 16:07:14
" gary oldman blends in again

 as usual i didnt recognize him at all

the human chameleon",2023-08-07 14:45:26
theres a reason why its called oppenheimer instead of nuclear bomb,2023-08-07 08:40:50
why should we see that when oppenheimer didn’t see it,2023-08-13 15:18:05
"only issue i have is how the film shifts atmosphere pretty quickly posttrinity the whole movie is centered around the security clearance but i thought it was over dramatized with the the clearance and hearings for strauss maybe not exactly the most interesting subject matter to treat it with such intensity still it was all well shot and well told within the movie so the only real issue is the dramatic shift towards strauss hearings and oppenheimers clearance

thats the problem when you cant change the plot ",2023-08-23 21:51:15
"i found this review very interesting and thoughtprovoking for me because i feel very far from some of your opinion

i saw it yesterday evening and i felt the female character in this film were incredibly bland stereotyped and frankly ridiculous i dont feel nolan is the best with writing female character but elliot page in inception for example was much much better even the  scene and the  it felt very forced not in line with the rest of the movie
the dialogue in general with that clever and fast tone i felt was very unrealistic but kind of justified by the incredible amount of information he had to put in these 3 hour movie",2023-08-26 11:07:34
"couldnt agree more this movie was absolutely beautiful till trinity and then trinity happens and its just  good i guess 
i wouldve loved this movie more if the whole interrogation scene was cut down short it was wayyy too long


i dont have any plans to watch it again for now",2023-08-27 21:27:14
nolan had to spend so much on the hearings because he wants the corrupt prosecutor maliciously say what he would sincerely say to oppenheimer how could he set up a plan to destroy the biggest intact cities when he was in charge and then switch to a strenuous enemy of the development of the hydrogen bomb without being corrupt crazy or both,2023-08-24 23:53:08
there is also the scene in the beginning that appears to from robbie’s view when he’s watching oppenheimer give the lecture in dutch,2023-08-25 15:14:48
i was able to easily interpret what that scene meant and i frankly can’t imagine how it could effect your opinion on the movie that dramatically lol,2023-08-24 08:27:56
i think you’re right that was the only time it was certainly effective though to show kittys disgusthorror,2023-08-25 00:40:25
in my theatre the exact moment the bomb went off and everything became silent somebody shouted allah u akbar and people started to laugh so yeah i understand how you feel,2023-08-27 23:37:28
compare it to chernobyl where they actually explain what went wrong scientifically in plain language i don’t think the science is any more difficult here but you’re right they don’t even try to relate it,2023-11-26 00:24:04
blame it on the marketing and trailers they used the bomb as a majormain selling point so obviously people went in wanting to see the bomb and probably the war more,2023-07-22 01:46:20
they spent 100million on marketing it as a manhattan project based movie with every single poster having the bomb in it and the trailer building up to the test,2023-07-22 01:35:32
historically accuracy is not a mutually exclusive trait to a film it is entirely possible to have created an oppenheimer biopic more riveting than that additionally calling the grey screen phenomenal is grossly hyperbolic,2023-07-22 01:35:16
"well a movie can be called oppenheimer about a guy called oppenheimer with the director confirming to make it historically accurate and still be boring 

not saying it was i didnt find it boring but whats wrong if other people do the nonlinear narrative doesnt help 

you can order a  fish and chips and get a bad batch fish and chips you dont need to expect tacos to be disappointed with the food",2023-07-22 01:36:43
calling a movie boring is such a reductive waste of time that speaks more to someones personal taste or lack of attention span anyone bored by oppenheimer is 1 not interested in the story and the man or 2 doesnt have an appreciation for aspects of movies like editing acting sound design etc both of which are perfectly fine and acceptable but people would rather try to pin their disinterest on nolan and the movie lol,2023-07-22 01:34:07
loved the film but the bomb was a bit underwhelming after all the buildup and the part after it felt weaker,2023-07-21 19:16:47
blunts scene near the end when she’s being questioned was such an incredible moment,2023-07-22 04:41:26
someone was really trying to say the security clearance loss was boring without knowing that losing your security clearance is a pretty big  deal,2023-07-23 05:35:35
the one that got me was gary oldman doing trumans missouri accent came off a little more like colonel sanders than i think he intended,2023-07-29 23:59:40
it was a danish accent is probably why,2023-07-30 02:46:23
niels bohr was danish,2023-07-30 01:39:09
or or or they were scorning him for taking his usually amazing use of practical effects in a mostly cgi world and adding it to something that could literally only be done in cgi without denotating a real nuclear bomb like theres confidence in your craft inceptiontenet then theres actual overconfidence leaning on ridiculousness oppenheimer,2023-11-17 17:33:30
for the budget size of this movie and the notoriety of the director they could do way better,2023-11-17 11:38:17
from what i understand nolan has heavy input on casting so at some point nolan mustve thought the guy from drake and josh has talent,2023-07-21 10:15:25
which one did you watch first,2023-07-21 22:03:41
cause it’s not about the bomb it’s not about the exciting images or the “violent yet intriguing” parts of war it’s first and foremost about a man who changed the world and the consequences it brought not just for him but everyone around him we didn’t need to see the aftermath in order to understand the dread oppenheimer felt i much prefer the gym scene over a typical “look at the damage of this city” alternative the horrors could only be illustrated to a certain amount so it’s much more important to convey the message than the set piece,2023-07-22 06:10:18
oppenheimer never saw nagasaki or hiroshima he never saw the explosion the movie is about him and if i recall he is in nearly every scene besides the broll i’m also willing to bet japan was not about to let nolan bomb them for an oscar,2023-07-22 06:47:30
the point of not showing it was to mirror oppenheimer’s perspective after he had lost all control and involvement it’s mirroring his loss of control and lack of power,2023-07-22 06:13:34
i dont think it would have made sense all the story before strauss committee is told from oppenheimers own perspective things he has witnessed first hand he wasnt there for hiroshima and nagasaki he only heard about it so all we get about it is him imagining it,2023-07-22 06:08:57
"the colour scenes are focused on oppenheimers perspective the bw scenes are from the world 

take the scene at the table for example in black and white we see the discussion with oppenheimer as a side character then in colour the camera focuses on oppenheimer and what hes thinking etc 

it also makes it easier to track the different timelines if one of them is in colour",2023-07-30 12:10:48
two separate but connected episodes in oppenheimer’s story they were flagged up at the start “1 fission” colour the abomb story “2 fusion” bw the hbomb story,2023-07-30 19:49:55
think it’s run was extended until august 17th,2023-08-03 16:58:35
strauss created that panel himself it was biased and rigged from the start he and his panel were in possession of classified information for about a week before the hearing and the defense attorney was not given this information or any documents also some of the allegations were completely false and there was no way to prove they were false,2023-08-05 18:16:25
"strauss was the most personally motivated one and felt humiliated by oppenheimers testimony against limits on isotope exports  he organized the security hearing and tipped off people about oppenheimers past communist connections

teller and lawrence testified that oppenheimer was a good man but that they felt he should no longer be in a decision making position",2023-08-05 19:59:44
at that point in development oppenheimer and his colleagues were clearly pressed for time that entire supercut was to imply the rush that they were in to get things done for truman,2023-08-14 07:23:33
are you forgetting they tested cores with handstacked bricks of beryllium and a  screwdriver im surprised they didnt use two claw hammers wedged together,2023-08-14 07:40:04
youre gonna get a lot of hate for saying this but i definitely agree with your points i think i enjoyed it more than you but characters have always been nolans weakness too many of them are totally one dimensional and his portrayal of women is unbearable,2023-07-21 15:10:17
i was floored by rdj he builds up slow but man does he shines in last hour,2023-07-21 15:06:17
"but nolan has never written or directed a great or even kind of good woman character

ive seen this critique before about nolan and to be honest i dont understand it i loved ann hathaway in the dark night rises and interstellar i also loved jessica chastain in interstellar so this feels weird to me",2023-07-21 15:07:37
i agree heavily i couldnt care less for kitty after she was shown being  and not caring for her child also half of her time was just them randomly being on horseback and talking about something that i either couldnt hear or that i forgot because the movie keeps jumping around so much,2023-07-21 15:23:01
you didn’t feel the emotions of murphy and rdj strange,2023-07-21 15:07:57
i found it emotionally devastating so these complaints are weird to me,2023-07-21 15:15:17
i personally felt like it could have cut an hour out of it theres scenes that repeat the same things over and over with all the political stuff spoilers  the  scenes were not needed and added nothing to the movie,2023-07-21 19:03:23
i agree completely you said it better than i did there really was a point where around when the bomb started being actually built where i basically gave up trying to follow everything because it felt like it didnt even want to let me understand it i think your plane analogy is spot on,2023-07-21 19:18:29
"i agree with you mostly i watched it with two of my friends we are all nolan fans we all loved memento inception and interstellar and mostly liked dunkirk and the dark knight trilogy 

the movie for me felt waaay too long like the last 3040 minutes with that random politicallegal drama could have been mostly cut cause i just didnt give a  about downrey jrs character and his petty revenge 

also i like when i can understand movies for the first time its not as bad as tenet but still the  cutting back and forth between timelines is sometimes jarring even though i understood the story i feel like nolan is just trying to be clever for the sake of being clever 
the music cinematography acting is of course fantastic 

710 for me",2023-07-21 19:05:19
bang on about the musical interference,2023-07-21 19:02:18
"dialogue this is my biggest issue with nolan movies and i was disappointed to see that he hasnt learned yet all of nolans characters are the same character they all talk the same way they all use the same cadence the same verbosity the same choice of vernacular the same conversational pace

i can agree with you herebecause all his other movies has moving plot there character cleverness has a charm but here try hard to be intelligent and the strauss oppheimer  ego issue become the main twist is just so underwhelming",2023-07-21 19:38:37
"dang number 3 is that glass shattering in how i met your mother i will never not be able to unhear this 

thanks for ruining nolans films for me s",2023-07-21 21:33:32
"pacing killed it for me i was literally falling asleep during the third act not because it was bad or boring but because of the relentlessly static pacing as you say every scene is just leadin to the next scene there’s no breathing room and no engrossing highs to shake you awake again 

but other than that yeah it’s a magnificent movie acting was phenomenal the visuals spectacular hoytema killing it as always and the story really interesting and exciting except perhaps the strauss parts the structure and pacing is what elevated it above normal biopics but at the same time there’s a reason most biopics don’t go crazy with nonlinear narratives and artistic choices either",2023-07-21 19:24:25
the structure is what made the movie not feel slow something is constantly happening,2023-07-21 20:52:18
so if this is a 410 for you give me a few examples of a 910 movie ill wait,2023-07-21 20:43:17
"its not laid out clearly in the movie you would have to have had the context of the book to know specifics here this meeting was in october of 1949 the roundtable was an emergency meeting of the atomic energy commission aec in washington dc  after the soviets tested their bomb 

the report that was produced from that meeting is what ultimately led strauss to need to push oppie out report they produced is here ",2023-07-21 17:04:01
prior to oppies security clearance being revoked but after the dropping of the bomb obviously the movie switchers to color when the timelines collide,2023-07-21 16:55:16
a few years after the war when strauss was overseeing the aec,2023-07-21 16:56:29
"there are moments that are quite loud but i never felt uncomfortable or that i needed ear plugs 

if your hearing is sensitive yes it’s loud",2023-07-21 23:50:50
for me it was too loud and its been the same for all imax movies i saw at my theatre,2023-07-21 23:52:32
"there’s 2 one towards the middle of the first act and one during the second act

one is a bit more graphic than the other but neither overstays their welcome

there is prolonged nudity but nothing crazy",2023-07-22 01:55:44
"editing
lead actor",2023-07-22 02:11:12
i got stuck in front of some teens that laughed historically at nudity and not funny moments  annoying  heads,2023-07-22 03:13:28
where are you based,2023-07-22 03:06:57
 thats sad they made it pg13 from the initial r rating in india by editing a dress on florence pughs body as a lot of teens would be watching this movie,2023-07-22 03:10:15
i was in line in theatre getting tickets  in front of me were a group of younger folk  im 27  they were probably early 20s or late teens  one of them said that hes 16  he was asked for an id  it was revealed that he was turning 16 and not even on that day so he was not allowed entry,2023-07-22 03:32:33
yeah that’s given importance in the story,2023-07-22 17:37:52
the interaction of the scientists’ identities and beliefs in general and oppenheimer’s in particular with the politics and culture of 1930s 40s and 50s america is the primary focus of the film and the framing device for telling the story of oppenheimer’s life,2023-07-22 17:47:37
yes,2023-07-22 17:46:44
yes a large one id say the movie is more about that than it is about the bomb,2023-07-22 17:37:29
it’s a movie about the war effort during wwii…yes there’s stuff about their jewish heritage lol i don’t see how it could possibly not be so,2023-07-22 17:37:39
not  they were visualizing how much plutonium was available to create the bombs,2023-07-23 00:15:00
they were using that to keep a count of the uraniam being enriched in oak ridge,2023-07-23 00:11:53
it represented the uranium and plutonium they needed to build the bombs and they added as it came in from oak ridge and hanford,2023-07-23 00:12:36
not really awardworthy but glad to see josh hartnett back at it more i felt they did a good job with einstein as well,2023-07-23 04:14:28
emily blunt,2023-07-23 04:04:49
"rdjs character was the most nonsignificant flat character imaginable and honestly he didnt play it that well probably because its the most nonsignificant flat character imaginable it better not go to him or damon doing the same damon things

hartnet on the other hand really was great",2023-07-23 05:57:17
i sure hope not this film was bad,2023-07-23 04:51:46
would the bombs have been built anyway yes absolutely it was essentially inevitable from the day we figured out fission worked in practice in 1939 would it have been done as quickly under anyone but oppenheimer maybe but i doubt it the man really was a more or less unique combination of genius at theory while also being a competent project manager those are not often skills you find coexisting the entire project could be expected to have finished reasonably close to when it did without oppenheimer but quite plausibly not in time to prevent the invasion of the japanese home islands the bombs were used to prevent,2023-07-23 05:14:15
"it’s unnecessary in the sense that the film is largely made up of closeups and dialogue scenes in small rooms interstellar in 70mm was practically a rite of passage it’s leagues ahead of this because of the scope of the film but the footage in oppenheimer is really something it’s super crisp and lovely to look at there are several exterior establishing shots that are absolutely gorgeous i wanted more of those

if you get a technical  from some super crisp footage like me then yeah it’s absolutely worth it also  there’s every chance this could be the last 70mm imax film we ever see",2023-07-23 07:43:19
"her whole presence is weird

that  scene with the ham  sanskrit reading was just cringe",2023-07-24 00:32:46
boris pash was an intelligence officer essentially in charge of sniffing out any communist espionage during the early parts of the manhattan project he was also earlycia postwar meaning he was a mean  and generally not a good dude which is why he comes off as intimidating and groves is pretty rattled by his involvement,2023-07-24 01:56:57
"yes the blonde is ruth tolman she had an affair with oppenheimer although theres some debate if it was a  affair or just an emotional one her husband was physicist richard tolman who was the chief scientific adviser to groves on the manhattan project im not sure if he actually appears in the film though

the tolmans the oppenheimers and lawrence were all friends oppie having an affair with ruth did have a negative impact on his friendship with lawrence although postwar the primary disagreement the two had was over hbomb development lawrence was allied with teller",2023-07-24 02:57:10
"the movie is in nonchronological order so the scene at the beginning with einstein takes place long after teller discovers the equation note that strauss and oppenheimer didnt meet until a while after the atomic bombs had been dropped and all the einstein scenes besides the one where he initially shows einstein the equation take place after the bombs had been dropped

i noticed the jean thing too thought it was super interesting and left it ambiguous about whether it was reallt suicide but if it was  i definitely dont think oppie played any part it would have been american government officials silencing her incase she knew about the manhattan project",2023-07-24 06:18:08
if you mean the book he had open during his graduate studies sequence it was ts eliots the waste land a seminal piece of modernist poetry that spoke to the disillusioned morally decaying state of western civilization after wwi eliot won a nobel prize in literature later and this poem was considered his magnum opus its part of oppenheimer intellectual awakening being exposed to the revolutionary modernist ideas of that time present in literature eliot art he was staring at a picasso and music this is represented by the soundtrack but he mentions stravinsky at a later point to lawrence,2023-07-24 06:39:55
not a question but the us sec having had a honeymoon in kyoto being one of the reasons it was not in the potential list of cities to be bombed was pretty unsettling ridiculous and petty not sure if thats the right word but after some digging it was alledgedly true crazy,2023-07-24 06:41:01
interesting redlettermedia complained about the same thing they attributed to their theater though maybe yours made the same mistake,2023-07-26 02:47:03
at my amc 70mm screening they showed a few trailers using the digital projector and then they switched to the film projector and showed trailers for the holdovers and exorcist believer before starting oppenheimer,2023-07-26 13:37:26
hes refering to the dinner at the nobel banquet after winning the nobel prize,2023-07-27 21:49:17
scott grimes,2023-07-30 18:38:15
yeah he said it once when banging florence which is so dumb then the other time was after the bomb i forgot when specifically,2023-08-03 09:10:56
yes twice once when hes banging florence pugh and the other after the bomb goes off,2023-08-03 06:32:28
they were meant to symbolize the fact that he can visualize physics that he can see what no man at his time has seen before we take for granted our knowledge of black holes and quantum theory nowadays back then it was just a pipe dream,2023-08-06 05:45:48
"oppenheimer was given a diagnosis of schizophrenia during his college years though that may have been because of his depression at the time rather than actual hallucinations

i expect the movie just wanted to emphasise his instability and obsession with his work by showing him visualising the quantumatomic world",2023-08-06 09:04:57
i took it as more symbolic than literal,2023-08-06 06:28:02
yeah i thought they were gonna recreate the original clip,2023-07-21 10:33:07
810 ending and the 2nd act save it,2023-07-22 22:52:16
i thought the pacing was incredible the whole film was one of the best ive seen in years,2023-07-22 22:57:28
i always feel like i need earbuds when watching nolan i want to watch a movie not have a perforated eardrum chris,2023-07-31 02:55:33
i actually think one of the best things about this film is that i actually don’t think you are necessarily supposed to be cheering for oppenheimer i don’t think nolan’s take on him as a person is necessarily sympathetic,2023-08-06 15:29:51
"take away for me was oppenheimer never tried once to get anyone to like him not even the audience he had his views and it was just presented that way

reallife rarely has comicbookhollywood heroes and the movie portrays that 

im shocked anyone could even walk away and want to cheeer for oppenheimer or anything the invention brought the whole message was it was awful at every single level and we put a clock on the species",2023-08-06 18:30:07
the legalese definitely started to fly over my head sadly enough about the scenes not having time to breath i especially felt that during the horseback riding scenes they always cut too quick im used to other directors taking their time with such scenes,2023-07-23 06:33:05
"its so weird to me that 23 of the way through theres a whole montage that acts like were getting a big twist  apparently strauss handed over the documents  that changes everything  but it doesnt and i kind of figured it was him anyway and its not really an important seeming question

these are two characters who we see in like three scenes together and one of them backstabbing another does not at all have the dramatic effect the movie seems to think it should",2023-07-23 07:35:07
you’re right about the pacing i feel switching from future to past to not so distant future back to future and so on was confusing as  especially in the beginning and there were scenes being built up only for it to cut to the future again it really didn’t pay off even with some of the reveals later on…,2023-07-23 08:03:00
"maybe youre talking about the executionpacing of oppenheimers conflict with strauss in the movie i mean the conflict did in fact happen in real life so it would be strange for the movie not to represent it

as a viewer already familiar with the history i guess it felt correct because i was already expecting and anticipating it plus there were threads throughout the film emphasizing the mystery of who leaked oppenheimers security files to borden meaning the twist did have setup perhaps its easy to lose the details on a firstviewing considering the sheer amount of dialogue",2023-07-21 11:45:54
"oppenheimer is mediocre

",2023-07-21 12:41:13
i think nolan wanted to the film to be about oppenheimer and not the bomb showing japanese ruins wouldve really overshadowed all of that,2023-08-01 17:18:00
"i appreciate the thoughtful analysis as a scientific history buff i too was disappointed at how little science was covered and discussed in the film the main innovators of the nuclear chain reaction fermi and szilard as well as other key scientific innovators were barely mentioned at all i’m not familiar with the source material but i’m assuming the focus on oppenheimer’s associations with the communist party and the strauss hearings were a key part it just doesn’t interest me that much

i do have to disagree with you on how the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki were handled though we the audience were just as “out of the loop” and removed from the events as oppenheimer and it really made me feel…detached like i was being neglected again like oppenheimer was also i feel like having an intense bombing scene especially after the trinity test scene would’ve felt out of place",2023-08-02 04:55:40
"the fact they did not choose to show the bombs being dropped on nagasaki or hiroshima or the fallout missed the mark for me 

this was my largest takeaway as well the movie walks the viewer all the way up to the line of acknowledging the atrocities of nuclear weapons without allowing the viewer to reflect on these acts show dont tell i realize that this was probably a fervent ongoing discussion throughout filming on whether or not it would be tactful to show the atrocities either with historical record or through recreation im not sure i have the right answer but like this is the subject matter of the film i didnt sign up to watch a 3hour film lamenting the construction of the nuclear bomb for the to whitewash the actual victims during his lucid dream sequence while giving the bleacher speech

i respect nolans practical approach and perhaps restraint for not recreating or filming the attacks on nagasaki or hiroshima instead using artistic license to show the effects of radiation in his lucid bleacher speech however i his visions are tame in comparison to what couldve been shown and imo doesnt leave the viewer as horrorstruck as the characters of the movie im not asking for cgi recreations of barefoot gem that would be nsfl or make the film nc17 or anything but whats the point of an r rating on such a dark divisive topic if youre only going to be giving a halfmeasure



i understand that the strauss confirmation hearing was the framing device for the movie but it hardly seemed related to the plot rdjs performance was great probably the most acting hes been able to do in 20 years but i cant help but wonder how necessary this was for the overall plot since the majority of the film was shown from oppenheimers perspective the movie felt like it was 30 minutes too long anyway and unfortunately for rdj i know exactly which 30 minutes to cut",2023-08-01 16:52:56
the  scene with the quote was patently   the fact that they threw bohr in there for heightened intensity also horrid,2023-08-03 17:18:17
"im not even a film buff but if you think this was an intimate character study then im afraid to know what you think a shallow character study looks like im also afraid to know what you think of actually intimate character studies like whiplash and taxi driver the only intimate thing about oppenheimer is the way the earrpe sound track intimately violates your eardrums while youre trying to watch it

every line of dialogue in this movie was idiotic and cheesy the music was barely discernable as music half the film was paced like a trailer and it didnt even do a decent job of exploring its themes im not making these criticisms up theyre extremely obvious and apparent to anyone who doesnt have nolans  rammed down their throat

i watched margin call last night a movie that deals with the topic of an economic collapse its a movie with compelling characters memorable dialogue and deepthemes all virtues that oppenheimer lacks and it came out in 2011 after the social network so dont expect me to be grateful to receive trash like nolans latest offerings because ive got better movies i can watch",2023-08-04 20:54:52
"i maintain that the meme about this movie brought people in to see the film that have absolutely no business seeing it

people with zero media literacy trying to talk about this film makes me want to slam my head against a wall and its happened more than usual with this one",2023-08-03 15:57:50
different strokes for different folks i personally thought the social network was a terrible movie haha,2023-08-03 07:01:13
"there are so many better movies
all quiet on the western front or parasite to name only two in the last 5 years",2023-08-03 15:58:30
thank you for restoring my faith in humanity,2023-08-04 03:02:34
whilst is is a completely different type of film i feel top gun was better,2023-08-03 18:17:55
is “i had trouble hearing some dialogue because the music was so loud” a nitpick,2024-02-13 12:21:06
im with you to a tee but people on this site dont wanna hear it to add further i also really hate how nolan cannot write or direct a female character worth  when theres two incredibly important ones in here that are essentially reduced to plot devices i also could not stand that absolutely nothing has room to breathe its a character study thats told solely through exposition to the extent that theres 3 minutes of film where theres not dialogue going or music and both are always going together and its exhausting he allows no space for the viewer to just be lost in the characters or setting or events and its just fact after fact after fact after fact of event after event after event in the worst possible way like a  tier high school history teacher that makes the whole class hate studying history nolan just quintupled down on being a horrendous filmmaker with this movie and i have no clue why people love his output so much,2023-07-21 23:17:34
"i think the movie was overhyped but i still think its a good movie

i dont agree with most of what you said

1 ofc the true events are oversimplified and dramatized its a movie

2 the focus of the story is oppenheimer as a person and the implications of his contribution to a weapon of mass destruction its about the social and political impact of his work and the role scientists in the us before and after the war 

3 its not really about the manhatten project alone or the technical aspects of the bomb the majority of ppl wont understand the physics and if nolan would have portrayed all of it accurately and in detail it would make for an incredibly boring movie not too different to interstellar is it him including other notable scientists involved simply highlights the fact that oppenheimer despite his ego and some popular belief father of the atomic bomb was obviously just one of many ppl who contributed the movie also focuses more on his personal relationships and the diverging opinions 

4 i concede that i also found the  scene misplaced i think they shouldve put the quote at the beginning or the end of the movie although the  scene alone without the sanskrit quote makes more sense later in the movie during his hearing 

5 not sure what your issue is with the dialogue the way they did the explosion was also interesting and surprising in my opinion",2023-07-25 00:27:26
i really really really dont get why you would include a intimate scene on a movie that is focused on an important historical human existencial  event and a nerdy spiritual scientist doing science all day with his other scientist colleagues who need to make a bomb asap to end a literal world war and save the human race or so i thought i thought this movie is gonna take more the scientificphilosophicalspiritual route into oppenheimer and humanity as a whole like a lot of nolans movies which leave you with existencial crisis but i cant take it seriously when a movie about world war and invention of the nuclear bomb gets rated r not for the bomb or war but for a completely uneccessary intimate scene on it,2023-07-21 15:43:58
i agree with you on the cringe dialogue and shallowness but it just became fun to me so i enjoyed it as a comedy played super straight,2023-07-22 07:38:33
1 i know you got a lot of downvotes but i also felt that oppenheimers fascination with sanskrit and geeta was portrayed in a disrespectful manner,2023-07-21 16:08:59
thank you for this i really don’t feel like this movie deserves a watch at theaters from me and this helped on that,2023-07-21 15:22:14
 this is  spot on,2023-07-22 13:05:44
" this will get downvoted i see your points i myselfe however knew nothing about oppenheimer and the manhattan project and i dont think many did

coming from this standpoint there was a lot of info to take in and much more would not have fit in to the movie nolan also obviously had to put a focus on something because its still just a movie and he chose the political side of things and the treatment of oppenheimer after the project was finished hence the buildup of oppenheimers ties to communism and the concequences it had later in regards to your point on physics and the different famous physicists going into more detail on the physics and social side of the project would be to much for us layman and filming people doing experiments and math aint that enteraining and in regards to al the famous side charracters scientists they all have their own story that could take up their own movie but this movie was about oppenheimer and not about the manhatten project and everyone involved

so i have the feeling you wanted a full documentary of the project with all the details but thats not what a movie is for there is a perfectly good book that will fullfill those needs it looks like most people where entertained and the movie cept quite close to the facts so everyone is happy and the movie fullfilled its job you dont watch movies to be educated muvies are there to entertain",2023-07-21 15:34:59
go watch a documentary,2023-07-22 03:37:01
thanks for sharing i personally disagree with your sentiment  i loved the film and how it made me feel don’t forget that this movie is titled “oppenheimer” you are obviously more informed on the events and history of los alamos than the average person but that should not restrict you from appreciating a story that simply focuses on the life of robert oppenheimer even if that means the other scientists whose lives are worthy of a mini series take a back seat just my two cents but thanks again for sharing your “unpopular” opinion,2023-07-21 15:42:01
thank you,2023-08-13 22:13:31
this comment is exactly why nobody takes this subreddit seriously,2023-12-28 07:04:01
this is the first that ive even seen it suggested that oppenheimer is a right wing movie,2023-07-25 00:56:07
its not a left wing movie either there is no exploration into the political themes of the movie historically accurately showing communists existed in america in the 20s and 30s doesnt make a movie left wing or even political if you draw no conclusions from it,2023-07-25 01:45:29
the scene in the hearing she acted her  off she might even get the oscar i think and i wouldn’t be surprised if she’s the only one from the cast to win,2023-07-21 18:14:59
"was her accent off though i think i heard some pretty noticeable british slipups in that particular scene

im not a native english speaker so i might be just hearing things",2023-07-21 18:20:37
"as far as awe i think that the people at trinity honestly were not all that afraid of it they were truly excited in real life to build the bomb

as far as chemical explosions as props you wanted nolan to procure and detonate a nuke what other option would he have in terms of practical effects",2023-07-22 00:41:44
"you have the best take ive seen though i will add that i could see this being a film that when i watch it several times over i pick up on more elements that move it from a 710 to an 8 or 9 theres a lot going on from start to finish and i think some of the brilliance could be very easily overlooked on one watch

though it will probably be some time before i can grind through those 3 hours again",2023-07-24 03:16:23
"id agree here but only for the fact that you say you thoroughly enjoyed it that would make me give a movie at least an 8 which is to say your 7 is my 8 with a 7 i generally think the movie could have been done a lot better or that there are other movies of a similar genre that do a lot better job than this did was both with this movie its deeply flawed imo and i think social network did a lot better job in a similar storytelling format of a similarly complex story 

funnily enough id replace most of the hallucinated scenes with actual dialogue to express the horror in words and a lot of dialogueridden scenes with quiet moments of contemplation id call the scene with truman as the only flawless scene in the movie maybe",2023-07-24 05:06:31
i think a 710 is 100 reasonable if i were to rank christopher nolans filmography this would go low in the list but thats also keeping in mind that even his worst movie is better than some peoples best efforts it felt very standard almost as if an ai gave me a christopher nolan movie about the making of an atomic bomb starting cillian murphy,2023-07-24 03:11:54
i also really loved the scene with truman when oppenheimer is just trying to entirely take all the blame and guilt onto himself and truman tells him to get over himself because all that guilt was squarely with truman and not oppenheimer and then he calls him a whiny little  and tells his security to never let him back in the oval office,2023-07-25 18:40:15
i think that it’s a good thing that he explored his life more than just the aspect of internal conflict and morality issues like when during the hearing he was shown to suffer anxiety and public humiliation and how his wife even suggested him to stop trying to play the martyr to resolve his own personal guilt and by the end of his life in real life oppenheimer denied that his actions killed those people he remained conflicted on the matter till his last breath,2023-07-25 17:32:51
the sound is better in imax theaters i think thats what i got out of my imax experience,2023-07-26 01:04:51
on screen nudity was also a taboo during those times why show  scenes then lol,2023-07-22 03:50:08
my problem with the women characters is that they showed no process as to why they were behaving that way both main love interests started off very charmed and then immediately they were both sobbing and crazy people with no extra information im guessing there was a 35hr cut of this film with more context,2023-07-22 04:34:43
edison lol,2023-07-22 18:12:21
for a while i thought truman was unfairly underrated and a pretty solid successor to fdr esp in terms of continuing the new deal and with civil rights  but reading prometheus soured me on him a bit  he was far more hawkish than fdr on foreign and nuclear policy,2023-07-23 21:13:47
"anyone who feels this way i strongly recommend reading the book american promotheus but heres a quick summary

bw is strauss rdj perspective most of the bw is a government hearing for the nomination of strauss to a presidential cabinet position during that hearing senators are free to ask strauss questions and invite other persons to ask questions about strauss competence during that hearing one of the people brought on by the senate rami malek exposed strauss as an opportunist and architect of destroying oppenheimers credibility we also see how the two aides assigned to strauss slowly discover this truth 

 the interrogation in the small room with oppenheimer was a private meeting with the aec science organization that recommends stuff to the government about whether or not oppenheimer should get a security clearance renewed this happens after the bomb was tested and dropped in japan but before the strauss hearings in bw in reality this hearing was just a kangaroo court to get oppenheimers dirty secrets out to a written transcript record he was never going to get his clearance renewed

everything else in the movie pretty much happened prior to the aec meeting as flashbacks and callbacks etc i dont blame you for getting lost my gf also got thrown up 

ps the only bw scene that wasnt in the cabinet hearing was the einstein one that was just the first time strauss and oppy met and the round table dinner discussion about hbomb this happened almost right after ww2 when scientist discovered russia also had their bomb and what the us needs to do to counter it",2023-07-24 17:44:04
i feel exactly the same after the first 30 minutes i had no idea what was going on and why i was supposed to care about any character so i just checked out for the rest of the movie whole movie just felt like random chopped up scenes with grandiose music playing over the most pointless dialogue,2023-07-24 17:41:16
i would not be surprised if a lot of people are lost watching the movie american prometheus the book it was based on i feel is required reading before watching the movie,2023-07-24 17:46:54
"i really liked it because i felt rami was going to speak in strauss favour as the 1 time we see him before he was unceremoniously shoved aside by oppenheimer and strauss himself mentioned that the scientists never forgave him for not signing the petition

but then the twist comes in with rami crucifying strauss instead showing the unity in the scientific community and strauss getting his comeuppance",2023-07-24 19:04:46
" the movie covers most of oppenheimers life but its mostly knee deep 

you are not using knee deep correctly here based on the rest of your post maybe you mean ankle deep",2023-07-26 21:14:17
i feel like the music really gives the movie the personality it needs though,2023-07-27 20:39:29
oh my  this i really enjoyed the movie but please nolan let the actors have the room not every scene needs a constant background score,2023-07-27 19:58:53
nolan is surrounded by yes men in his audio department his artistic choices for audio are very questionable,2023-07-27 23:57:42
nolan does go overboard with his sound design tbh,2023-07-27 19:53:18
it’s the same thing i’ve seen with the irishman a lot of people want the spectacular scenes of explosion and excitement which the film does have but those are just garnishments for the true meaning of the movie,2023-07-22 00:55:28
exactly critiquing a movie because it is not what they thought it would be is not a proper critique its just complaining,2023-07-22 01:04:13
seems like people were too far on one side or the other expecting a war movie or a movie solely about science with no politicspersonal life,2023-07-22 01:44:28
i mean i expected it to be boringlike if they made an invention of the movie for a carthat would be boring too,2023-07-22 01:48:52
the bomb scene was hyped repeatedly by bts clips and they beat it to death bragging about how great their practical effects were and you’re annoyed people are pointing out how lame and out of place it felt,2023-08-03 05:04:35
"this movie is not about the bomb

not about the bomb go watch trailers for oppenheimer where bomb is main thing trailers lied people",2023-08-03 11:37:40
that’s just like your opinion man,2023-08-11 22:56:23
nah the coen brothers are good but they are mostly dark comedy type of directors david fincher wouldve been the perfect candidate for oppenheimer as a lot of it was dialogue,2023-08-13 10:01:47
they really didnt give the gut punch that was needed i left the theater in a daze imo they should have actually gone into some detail of the horrible conditions on the ground at hiroshima and nagasaki they show the scientists reactions but dont show the viewers what they saw they could have at least included a quote from hibakusha theres one in there that tears me apart about a mother needing to leave her daughter behind as the fires got close theres no sympathy in this movie its terrible and i dont need to ever see it again,2023-08-12 03:13:51
"i strongly disagreed with your take but now im like 50 on your side especially for everything before the bombs were dropped i still think there is no funny way to frame incinerating tens of thousands of innocent people

i think the closest you can get was already attempted in this movie truman is framed as having his ego bruised by a scientist showing remorse over being adjacent to the bombs while he himself pushed the button and acted triumphantly",2023-08-14 07:53:12
for me it was opposite it was going at a slow and steady rate till bomb dropping but holy  the pace it picked after that,2023-07-21 14:31:07
"lewis strauss was an admiral businessman and politician who became an aec commissioner and later its chairman he was a hardline conservative republican who was extremely distrustful of the soviets liberals and basically anyone who didnt share his views

as a trustee at the institute for advanced study ias at princeton strauss actually recruited oppenheimer after wwii to run the ias but unlike his fellow conservative gen leslie groves who had a strong working relationship w oppenheimer at los alamos strauss soon came to be annoyed by oppenheimers personality and way of doing things

anyway strauss eventually despised oppenheimer for his public opposition to the hydrogen bomb as well as his advocacy for an international coalition for nuclear arms control as those positions were in direct conflict with american military interests if not outright traitorous to him as such strauss conspired with j edgar hoover to start digging up dirt on oppie and although his early communist associations were long old news by the 1950s they were certainly known before being appointed to head los alamos and then his later appointment to the aec strauss decided to relitigate them by ambushing oppenheimer with a closed door aec hearing to revoke his security clearance and he succeeded forcing oppenheimer into virtual exile 

however strausss conduct during this entire affair was not forgotten by either the many many scientists who worked with oppenheimer or by senate democrats when eisenhower nominated strauss for commerce secretary there was considerable opposition mobilized to derail the confirmation and the opposition succeeded ending strausss political career",2023-07-21 20:00:35
this is exactly how i felt too,2023-07-21 19:40:19
feynman is the bongo player and the one that runs out of the bunker before the trinity test i dont think he was ever formerly introduced in the movie that i can recall,2023-07-21 19:44:02

unless the average moviegoers are 7th grade drop outs they should know about these people atleast in my country we are introduced to bohr and heisenberg in school",2023-07-21 19:41:16
honestly this is criticism of the movie i can get behind,2023-07-23 01:18:02
haha i loved him and his bongos i really enjoyed it but don’t think it’s perfect i wish there were some moments of calm instead of the constant drumming of the score that way the bigger scenes felt more impactful,2023-07-23 01:36:47
i dont think he wanted us to be emotionally connected with the characters too much in this one i think the emotional impact this movie had was just the weight of what was unleashed upon the world after the a bomb was created,2023-07-23 06:30:27
"even interstellar that movie is guaranteed tears for me 
every time when he left the farm for the mission when they lost all that time due to time dilation when he discovered he was murphs ghost and sent her the message stay  i mean what about when he said murph would come back for the watch because he gave it to her

i got chills when alfred finally sees bruce in europe at the end of the dark knight rises after assuming he diedfull circle moment right therebruce finally getting the life he wants took the trilogy for him to believe he even deserved to put his happiness first 

i dont think nolan gets enough credit  also i loved how he portrayed oppys relationship with his wife and how he told his pal that anyone who makes assumptions about someone elses relationships are either fools or children  i feel like that was almost directed at the audience as wellbecause there is a deep bond there unconventional or not",2023-07-23 07:28:40

the second conversation was after the war in 1947 i believe 

oppenheimer started teaching at berkeley well before the war strauss was not involved at that point

the whole thing about kennedy was purely for the audience kennedy was running for a second term in the senate at that point and was already a high profile contender for the democratic nomination in 1960 he and strauss were from opposite parties as well so no surprise that he opposed",2023-08-10 00:18:46
"wasnt this moment when we see for the first time oppenheimer talk to einstein in the campus back at the beggining of the movie way before they are even summoned to the manhattan project

no im pretty sure this was after the manhattan project theyve already detonated the atomic bomb in japan and now strauss is trying to get oppenheimer to take over that position and offering him the house",2023-08-09 17:18:08
"i literally only saw it last night too and i’m already losing my grasp on the timelines so apologies if i have this wrong but i did think the same that first scene with einstein takes place between 1945 and the hearing for the renewal of his security clearance the problem is that from that scene onwards the film takes a fairly clear line of three timelines  los almos during the war the hearing postwar and the senate hearing in the 50s

for the most part those three timelines are easy to tell apart  the two ones in colour are clear enough as oppenheimer looks older in the postwar ones and the senate ones are black and white but peppered in then are the first einstein meeting the aec meeting at the birthday etc

edit the jfk nod was just a nod and a wink for the audience i think not sure there was more to it than that",2023-08-09 15:10:19

peppered with signature nolan  like deafening crescendos that cut to silence chattering violin music drowning out the dialog long dragging scenes with no plot or point and of course whenever two characters have an extended dialog they can only talk in clever quips dont forget to jump around in the timeline so people think youre a smart filmmaker throw in some black and white  yeah

and the point nuclear weapons could blow up the world  shattering news

nolan cannot write a script for  he needs to be told to stop trying

i expect youll get down voted to oblivion for the criticism but i think your points are all valid i consider myself a fan of nolans work but this was quite a letdown,2023-07-22 03:36:43
"you are 100 right i felt like i was bait and switched that last half of the movie went on forever and was endless pointless dialogue with and meaningless resolution and the main character just sat there 

there definitely were good parts of it but i cant believe how mindnumbingly boring it was",2023-07-22 03:55:16
very well put,2023-07-22 15:33:18
valid,2023-07-22 03:45:35
"shut up man 

y’all talk about cinema dying and then talk down on movies like this",2023-07-22 04:04:09
agree ive enjoyed other nolan movies a lot more i thought it was worth a watch and interesting but maybe a bit overrated i dont see myself watching it again,2023-07-24 04:58:48
exactly  it was average at best  it’s not a movie i’m gonna ever watch again,2023-07-24 04:14:21
i agree,2023-07-25 09:24:53
or you just didnt like it,2023-07-24 08:31:40
this shouldn’t be a hot take it got the joker treatment everybody’s  to mcu blockbusters that they think this is a masterpiece,2023-07-24 04:20:38
"absolutely an epic biopic is all about characters relationships and interactions and this movie just didnt do it even the twist at the end of strausss betrayal i felt nothing their relationship was shown as strained but amicable sure but in the 3 hour stretch they strauss and opp really barely had any screen time together   
 

christopher nolan should have had a strong character writer help him write this   


i feel the same about this movie as i did inception and i know im the minority here  


technically impressive but fundamentally flawed",2023-07-30 19:13:21
absolutely agree if the goal was to establish an emotional attachment to anyone on screen and not just rapid fire information to us then it failed,2023-07-30 16:55:22
"same im not even happy agreeing with you

its too hectic too falsely intense too overblown too non linear

if the goal is to make a movie feels like an xray going through you leaving nothing then its a success

people started to clap at then end but it went dry in 2 seconds",2023-07-30 17:38:55
same i tried to like it but it was just too long and i’d had enough after 2 hours,2023-08-04 23:26:16
we’re in the minority for sure but yeah i kinda hated it,2023-08-04 17:48:16
felt that some parts were unnecessary,2023-08-04 17:52:09
i just think it could’ve used some of the sparkwave footage and sounds before the silence — at least that’s what i was hoping for the movie ramps and doesn’t relent til that moment tho masterful by nolan,2023-07-21 03:08:15
i think it’s honestly best they didn’t show the japan destruction tbh i think the  scenes were unnecessary but i can’t say i was upset to see them the explosion was a bit of a let down though,2023-07-21 16:19:12
i actually appreciate him not showing japan its all history and that wouldve shifted the focus away from the opp  i appreciated the long takes of this reaction to watching the aftermath instead,2023-07-21 16:17:06
" at the end they revoke his security clearance… i mean are we supposed to feel bad who gives a 

i think its to show as einstein said they just used him the scene just after the test where the soldier says well take it from here when opie mentions the air burst height really shows that whatever oppenheimer thought about the war was now irrelevant they got what they needed from him now he was to shut up and do as he was told",2023-07-22 14:29:21
while i liked it i didnt feel like it needed the third act it felt like they needed a nemesis so they did all the rdj stuff i would have preferred the nemesisvillain  to have been more of oppenheimers inner anxieties and personal struggles i also wished they had made the race against the germans to feel a bit scarier the impact of the nazis developing a bomb first didnt feel like much of a struggle we never really felt much urgancy until the test was pushed to july and by then  was dead,2023-07-22 16:45:14
because truthfully for 80 of the film it wasn’t that engaging,2023-07-22 16:41:13
the story was told in an incoherent manner and it was marketed falsely like a thriller the trinity explosion in history was way more spectacular to look at than in the movie finally a lot of the movie had incoherent dialogue over constant music it didn’t seem like there were any scenes just moments stitched together overlapping different timelines,2023-07-22 16:39:54
"yeah if you arent aware of the red scare then this movie is basically not even going to register

had friends who didnt even know the basics of ww2 but went to watch because of cillian and complain it was a bad movie",2023-07-23 03:39:31
this is me to the tee i only like horror movies at this point and there arent any good ones in years,2023-07-23 04:06:39
i was also struck by some of the similarities between this film and the imitation game,2023-07-23 09:13:29
spot on a lot of the comments youre referring to remind me of the scene where the americans are cheering and looking wild with excitement when oppenheimer is giving the speech about the bombing being successful creepy and unsettling really,2023-07-23 16:02:35
some of the comments are really…argh… they refuse to accept that this movie is about oppenheimer and eventsrelationships as they relate directly back to him and his perceptions he did not fly to japan he was not in hiroshima when the bomb was dropped people are not going to see exactly what happened to those people and i think the message behind his guilt and burdens is amplified by the fact that he doesn’t and can never know exactly what he’s done it’s a flawed account bc it’s the account of a flawed man i actually appreciate that and would be turned off by external modern day finger wagging that would have taken me out of the movie and reduced nolan’s capacity to give us the “within his mind” experience that we received,2023-07-23 15:23:38
yeah i think most people who have a casual understanding of ww2 know  died first,2023-07-23 20:31:14
i think that was your schooling i had an amazing history teacher in high school who taught ww1 and ww2 modules in depth that 1516 year old could understand with a correct timeline of events,2023-07-23 20:14:36
i think it was you not paying attention in school,2023-07-23 21:12:33
"even

 nuclear bombs dropped
 japan surrenders

is so much less clear cause and effect than we are led to believe it was more like

 japan is already militarily and economically boned
 russia declares war on japan
 nuclear bombs dropped
 japan asks if their unconditional surrender can include the condition that they keep their emperor
 america agrees
 japan surrenders

most of the scientists on the manhattan project were jewish and they were recruited with the promise of dropping the bomb on  the book went into more detail about the other scientists themselves but the line about how the biggest advantage they had was antisemitism was accurate it was also true that a lot of the scientists wanted to stop the project once  died,2023-07-23 20:39:26
guess you haven’t watched band of brothers,2023-07-23 22:54:49
"you didnt pay attention at school and like the movie depicted the japonese were never going to surrender unless the us pulled the big amphibious invasion in history and invaded japan which in the process would delay the war to until 19471948 but  millions of americans and japoneses

the atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki has hellish as they were saves lives and ended much sonner

in fact i think i think all the fire bombings on japan actually killed more people but like oppenheimer said the physiological effect was massive and led to japan surrender",2023-07-23 21:50:43
christopher nolan whoops i should have paid more attention in high school before spending millions on a movie,2023-07-23 22:45:32
he’d probably been holding it in thinking “nobody will hear it when the huge explosion happens”,2023-07-25 06:37:32

"rdj said he felt like this character pushed him yet i think hes still playing the same character  himself

how anyone could look at lewis strauss and say tony stark and say that theres virtually no difference in rdjs performance between the two is beyond me",2023-07-28 11:26:45
i think that a true story about a specific man in such a highly male dominated time place and field would be hard to make naturally pass the bechdel test  they probably could have done it but any such scene would feel out of place,2023-07-28 06:25:26
doesn’t another woman alert emily blunt over the phone to take in the sheets i believe that counts although kitty and jean tatlock are the only significant female characters and they never interact,2023-07-28 07:14:16
why does a movie need to pass the  bechdel test to be good,2023-07-29 14:10:46
rdj has a different accent,2023-07-28 16:18:36
number 2… reaching so hard it’s honestly laughable,2023-07-28 17:38:49
yup could have been better off by cutting all that legal drama by 1520 minutes was this strauss character really a pivotal part of the history,2023-07-28 22:06:25
"that was my big takeaway  strauss is not a scientist hes basically just a boosterhangeron who gets butthurt people dont revere him

if they had just cut his storyline out and explained oh you  off the wrong people and now your security clearance is up for review you couldve lost the entire rdj timelinestoryappearance

but i guess were supposed to get some happy endingwin feelings from strauss getting denied  and it does give you a villain to hate  and definitely makes it a different storymovie than  man  little boy or more recently the imitation game where a war hero gets tarnished later for past sins

i  dont deny rdjs performance was good  but his whole characters presence in the story seemed out of step with the first 23rds of the film where every character is either a scientist or a soldier and ever convo is about science or the war

if this had been a fictional story we mightve followed oppenheimer after the war  maybe he goes and talks with heisenberg in the postwar investigations  maybe he meets werner von braun or other exnazis who are helping with icbm development   he gets disillusioned at operation paperclip and thats why the eus govt turns on him or some such

but nolan had to squeeze a zaslavavatar into the movie",2023-07-29 15:37:51
"the best parts for me were 

1 watching the military haul the bombs away it was chilling
2 when oppenheimer is receiving praise and you can tell he feels mournful and conflicted the empty phrase about wishing it couldve been dropped on the germans getting applause and you can clearly tell he doesnt believe what hes saying great filmmaking there
3 the interaction in the oval office with truman that was a wonderful scene",2023-08-14 10:13:14

definitely gave off a more is less vibe,2023-07-22 00:27:52
it was way too much going on i thought it was going to be about the development of the bomb and oppenheimers struggles within it but it was more about him getting yelled at by jason clarke and then next thing you know they are putting the finishing touches on the gaget,2023-07-21 12:29:06

but licorice pizza was horrendous imo
so i dont think paul would have been good unless he tapped his there will be bloodness

the first hour has so much info and the editing is so terribly quick

so many side characters that you dont know there names and that eventually do have a pay off but you have no idea who it was

he could have cut 45 minutes
then lengthen the scenes in whats left

i wish he went harder on the baskeball hoop speech
i thought the bomb was kind of lackluster then i was like ok hes going to go super hard here but he just held back

this didn’t need to be on 70mm i dont think
too much boca made it look digital

that  looked a million times better",2023-07-21 12:06:55

honestly i agree hes too dark for me i dislike his batman films and i cant see myself liking this any more,2023-07-21 12:05:18

nailed my thoughts as well i dont mind courtdroom drama and extensive dialogue but in the context of this movie and its characters i just didnt really care and it doesnt help that there was so much dense dialogue it was hard to follow,2023-07-21 15:55:39

the prestige sends its regards but yeah this is definitely up there in his pantheon however one views it,2023-07-21 13:19:51
i’ve seen the einstein thing a few times but i thought they mentioned he hangs around that area often   every time we see einstein in the movie he’s around that place which we know is a “short commute” to oppenheimer’s house  i don’t think it’s that crazy to think einstein went over to talk to him,2023-07-22 02:34:34

nolan doesn’t know how to create compelling characters men or women or progress his plotheavy script without a ton of expository dialogue ironically i think his failure to excel at either of those things has worked out in his favor  to audiences those two flaws seem to somehow make his movies feel “intellectual” which his whole brand is built around now,2023-07-23 18:53:38

agree i was looking forward to a dialogue heavy movie that was light on action it wasnt snappy dialogue i didnt care about the secretary of commerce getting confirmed or oppenheimer having an administrative hearing on his security clearance being renewed i would have cared more about the fallout of the apple poisoning,2023-07-21 03:14:02
totally agree,2023-07-21 03:22:36
"
it completely fails to deliver the immensity of a nuclear bombing the moral accountability dillema and the lasting consequences of a largescale bombing as nuclear bomb

this is a movie about oppenheimer not the concept of nuclear weapons and their role in the world that would be something covered in a truman movie",2023-07-21 03:19:16
i expected this i already hate christopher nolan just from clips ive seen of his films theyre all so dark and grim,2023-07-21 11:55:48
im not sure i really agree with the heart thing christopher nolan can basically make whatever he wants at this point and there’s multiple interviews where he says or eludes to being fascinated with this character he didn’t just cgi everything in the movie and call it a day,2023-07-21 20:24:59
i think inception had incredible heart the moment cillians character has that revelation about his father  the way pattinson revealed his friendship with protagonist in tenet  alfred and bruce in rises interstellar with the father and daughter   i think you have somewhat of a point but nolan has a tendency to have cold films till you get a rush of heart at moments especially endings,2023-07-21 21:37:58
isnt interstellar the best example of heart from a megamovie in while,2023-07-21 21:08:17
dunkirk has heart,2023-07-21 20:23:44
serious question does it qualify for best picture,2023-07-21 20:42:41
"you didn’t feel a gut punch when jean died

when he’s handing his baby over to chevalier

plenty of heart nolan’s films just know how to regain their composure and steel themselves at a moment’s notice  much like oppenheimer in the scene following jean’s death as his group bicker and teller declares that he is leaving

his films just snap into focus in a way that might seem overly clinical but just think of the emotional highs and chills in moments from the dark knight trilogy prestige inception  video message scene from interstellar

come on man there are moments of heart beyond belief all over nolan’s work",2023-07-21 20:38:57
"oppenheimer felt like two

im ashamed to say i have a shockingly short attention span i regularly end up second screening whilst watching films at home however oppenheimer held me from start to finish

in fact after the success of the bomb i was starting to worry about how the appeals process could maintain the pace of the film for the remainder of the runtime i had no idea how much time had passed but knew that the success of the bomb wasnt going to be the end of the story

however i think that the political intrigue that followed not only justified the additional runtime but was necessary to telling the story of how the bomb went from theory to practice to politics

i do not think the film wouldve been complete without a resolution to the broader political context i feel that this elevates the bw scenes with senator lewis strauss from a simple framing device to an essential part of the whole story of dr j robert oppenheimer as told by christopher nolan

incidentally i saw this film with my dad who is an old hand at the political game and is well aware of the dark arts entailed and he said that it was one of the best political films he has seen in his life

edit i called oppenheimer robert j oppenheimer rather than j robert oppenheimer i was getting him mixed up with homer j simpson my apologies

edit 2 i realised i hadnt closed my brackets",2023-08-01 01:04:07
i hate to say this but to me her role just felt like a brain break from the excessive dialogue so the audience can see some  her character felt like a caricature the  intellectual who has an affair with a professor there was no depth to her role in anyway and if jean did have to be apart of the storyline i think it would’ve been better if oppenheimer’s infidelity was made implicit as that would heighten our empathy for kitty and the turmoil she went through while being with him throwing  in an audience’s face serves no purpose when it doesn’t contribute to the plot or give us any greater insight into a character’s psyche and that whole scene of her stopping midway into  to pick up a book soo unrealistically yet typical of hollywood  scenes,2023-08-02 20:38:59
no  but i dont understand why they didnt at least tell that her character was a psychiatrist or they did and i didnt realize im reading her character and wellthe movie suddenly feel like it visually reduces her to almost nothing,2023-08-02 07:24:31
yes she wasnt great hard to be with such a stacked cast and her plotline was so pointless,2023-08-01 17:22:48
the  scene while he’s being questioned was very unnecessary and him being  afterwards,2023-08-28 01:12:26
strange im one of those people who struggle with longer movies and tend to check my phone during quieter moments oppenheimer kept me absolutely gripped for 3 solid hours and i only paused it briefly for a bathroom break,2023-12-30 05:15:32
what would you have cut,2023-12-21 06:12:36
"i enjoyed it as a sort of history channeltype reenactment but you have a point about story structure one of the problems i had with the film was that it wasnt clear there was really anything at stake why does it matter whether oppenheimer keeps his security clearance what was he doing at that point in his life anyways and if the hearing was private what did it even matter to his reputation 

its just like after such a profound impact the atom bomb had on the world why should we care about such a trifling thing as a personal vendetta where the only stakes are the egos of a couple well accomplished men",2023-07-28 15:56:33

"his student days in europe were relevant to the geopolitical affairs of the world at the time the us was far behind german quantum mechanics and therefore much further behind in having bomb technology oppe worked with some of the leading minds in physics at the time

i dont get a communism bad vibe i mean or dealing with mccarthyism and ultimately oppenheimer was vindicated but at the same time throughout the movie he made it a point to say in one way or another that he supported socialist policies further than that his objection to the hydrogen bomb was clear just one of the reasons why he was in the kangaroo court hes right at least in the film when he objected to us hiding what we were doing from our allies would create the very thing they were trying to avoid he talks about russias power and might and then i think someone brought up the quote there are two types of communism and i think theyre referring to you know the kind that runs people over with tanks and the kind where we share in our endeavors we share with our resources and we share amongst ourselves the human rights of people as opposed to an arms race this was a brief slice of time when nato actually did carry a lot of power and so did the un its early days so the united states essentially dropped the ball the western world did really but we kind of led the way look at the look at the way they portrayed harry truman calling oppenheimer a ,2023-07-21 22:32:36

" the trinity test was beautifully presented but nolan absolutely fails to scale to the audience how big the explosion was you know its far from how it was presented but you dont feel it was far like seeing on a map how far 3 hour drive is vs actually driving for 3 hours  

i dont understand this complaint and it infuriates me 
this is the trinity explosion the movie literally modeled the scene off this and other footage as practically as they could  

its like everyone expects to see the bikini atoll explosions or  tsar bomba or something trinity was 25x bigger than the nonnuclear explosion that occurred in beirut and was actually 10kt bigger than the explosion that destroyed hiroshima they are miniscule compared to the castle bravo and tsar bomba explosions  

i get that people dont generally understand explosions past what hollywood has shown but  am i tired of reading this  in this thread the intent wasnt to show you big boom wow it was to inspire the same fear awe joy and dread they felt in that moment and a recreation of the actual  test",2023-07-22 05:04:03
"i tried to limit my viewings of the trailers leading up to the movie i was surprised how dialogue heavy it was one of the review blurbs in the official review thread mentioned how it was a lot of men talking in scene but it was very engaging i think they still have it a 910 i really enjoyed it presentation of the narrative as a nonlinear timeline keeps viewers engaged at least for me idk some commenters say they got confused

i enjoy how nolan can give audiences such a wide range of genres",2023-07-22 04:58:54
" this is the wokest movie i seen in recent memory

i mean not really when people use woke derogatorily or not at this point since theres no better name for it usually they refer to the specific trends and language developed mainly by the online left in the last 1015 years or so which is a specific and peculiar style of politics which some who have only experienced it may not realize the movie felt like it certainly was critic of the us but not completely damning and open to considering that communists werent all evil antius conspirators which anyone with some common sense would know though the risk of ussr infiltration was also real overall id say its leaning liberal but its very much making its criticism in a more classical oldfashioned way mostly letting the viewers make their judgement about the various issues on display

id say trumans portrayal was unflattering but then again as the man who ordered the bomb dropped i can see how he would consider oppenheimer a crybaby for going all i have blood on my hands hed be like yeah man sucks huh guess what kind of decisions i have to take every  day in this job",2023-07-22 06:14:34

must remember that nolan is actually not american and the source material book does not celebrate the manhattan project at all 

yes universal picked it up but it’s an innovative nolan film who wouldn’t can’t give the americans too much credit",2023-07-22 06:56:19

i don’t think you are too dumb either there was a lot of characters and concepts being thrown around",2023-07-24 00:50:26
every nolan movie makes me feel that way except tenet i think that was a  awful movie like with interstellar i enjoyed it but i have friends who just  all over that movie and i feel like i’m missing something and it doesn’t help that a nolan mix is wild and i can never hear anything,2023-07-24 00:23:07

its movie that assumed the audience was already partially familiar with the cast of characters that worked on the manhattan project and the famous physicists and political leaders of the time if you go into the movie not knowing who niehls bohr or richard feynman or any of the other side characters are its very easy to get lost,2023-07-24 04:54:52

i recommend a japanese movie called kuroi ame1989 it deals with the aftermath of the hiroshima bombing,2023-07-25 04:12:35
i felt the same but i think now that nolan showed the really dramatic explosion during the introduction with the quote about prometheus that was probably the most gripping yet basic intro scene to a movie i’ve ever watched the trinity test scene seemed more focused on the reactions of the team than the bomb itself,2023-07-25 19:45:01
yeah i thought the movie overall was great but there were quite a few scenes where i felt like i was watching likea trailer for a movie instead of a movie if that makes sense,2023-07-26 09:33:39
man that sucks at the end of my showing people clapped,2023-07-30 18:44:49
"i think most people expected something more action packed its the atomic bomb after all instead of a personal drama about a scientist many also dont really know even a fraction of the scientists who appeared here which imo also removes a layer from the film as someone who studied physics but then went into maths i loved it and hope for more films like this  kind of like an antithesis to the films we get about pop culture personalities like elvis or bohemian rhapsody

but i agree about the first 20mins the structure of the movie was kind of hard to get into at first and i dislike the visions about the atom  radiation when he was a student

edit thinking about it and especially about the ending while i didnt want them to take more time for strauss since the movie is already long it also felt that it needed more somewhere in the first half there was this scene where oppenheimer gave a mocking answer in a hearing and insulted strauss this is kind of integral but without already knowing oppenheimers story the whole strauss part gets boring",2023-07-30 19:16:13
i thought both rdj and damon gave the weakest performances tbh he was made up good as strauss but his paranoia and maliciousness werent well sold imo and just came off looking unrealistically childish and petty in the final scenes,2023-07-31 14:45:43
i didnt even know rdj would be in the movie he was great it honestly surprised me,2023-07-31 11:50:08

i started feeling it with tdkr i saw the cracks in the castle begin to crumble as much as i love that film it was with interstellar that i saw the shyamalan of it all only nolan is just more crafty building a movie but the way he writes stories is just as clunky and quite frankly a little  literally the ending of interstellar is one of the dumbest things ive seen i could not believe it while i was watching it then i was bored out of my mind with dunkirk and tenet was so confusing on purpose it was baffling warner bros gave him any money to do it i think oppie is better than his last two at least but its still nowhere near in comparison the front half of his filmography up to inception,2023-07-22 17:05:58

this is the first of his movies i have legitimately enjoyed since inception i dunked pretty  the prior 3 interstellar put me to sleep,2023-07-21 13:41:49

lol imagine being this wrong,2023-07-26 03:05:31
considering how important bhagwat geeta was in oppenheimers life the way they presented it during a  scene was very disrespectful,2023-07-21 13:37:22
"explosion being overhyped was the biggest problem for this movie’s marketing they almost advertise it like we’re going to see ww2 play out between scenes in the trailer i’m just glad i made myself temper expectations and knew it was a biopic not a war movie or something

ultimately the bomb drop is underwhelming because we’ve all seen real nuclear explosions at this point so it doesn’t look that impressive knowing it was real was cool but it felt like “ah yep that is a real bomb i guess”

the sound design was incredible though",2023-07-21 13:58:59
i watched this in 70mm imax today in lincoln square the audio was perfect for me there was never a time where i couldn’t hear what was being said maybe your theater has bad speakers,2023-07-22 06:38:18
yeah it was a hot mess of a film structurally speaking kinda like 3 movies smashed together  i liked it well enough but jesus christ its all over the place  not a masterpiece in my eyes at all,2023-07-23 04:20:28
its a nolan thing where theres fast editing at those times and intercut with someone talking moving steadicam shots and cuts like edgar wright  i suppose it causes the tension and anxiety i guess  its his signature and i hate it because it happens often in his films  weirdly i dont recall it in dunkirk,2023-07-23 04:24:23
"the first half is actually quite intense some really powerful setpieces

the second half was incredibly tedious and boring and i just wanted it to be over

nolans dialogue is painful feels like walking in on strangers whove known each other for years having a conversation after youve just woken up from a nap",2023-07-26 20:52:10
i went in without watching the trailers and with littleno expectations i liked it very much i think its super well acted and i was personally really gripped by the acting personal interactionspersonalities and moral questions presented by the film,2023-07-26 19:24:23
its very very good im still thinking about it from mondays viewing it might actually be a good thing youre not a nolan fan boy your expectations are probably more in check,2023-07-26 18:32:38
"i did a barbeinheimer double bill today and went into the latter without having seen a trailer last nolan movie i saw was inception about eight  years ago 

short answer yes it’s worth the price of admission you have to concentrate because nolan loves a time skip and sometimes the characters are a bit hard to hear bc the sound mixing is sometimes slightly off but it’s visually stunning and i thought the trinity bomb test scene was very good even though it was three hours long i never felt like it dragged if you like a character driven political drama and i do this is the film for you cillian murphy’s performance is absolutely phenomenal and it’s definitely thoughtprovoking 

that said for what it’s worth while it was good and i enjoyed it but i probably won’t watch it again whereas i loved barbie and will definitely watch that again  but they’re very different so it depends what you’re in to i was watching oppenheimer admiring nolan’s technical proficiency whereas barbie is more straightup entertaining if that makes sense",2023-07-26 21:09:20
i enjoyed it too long tho,2023-07-26 17:52:46
"i am far from a nolan fan i like his films but i wouldnt say any of them are my favorite i thought this film was just ok the acting was great and its a nice looking film but honestly it felt like i was watching a three hour long film of straight dialogue telling me about what oppenheimer did instead of showing what he did i also was expecting a movie more about the science of the atom bomb and the running of the manhatten project and instead these elements were glossed over in favor of focusing on oppenheimers ties to communism 

the atom bomb explosion was pretty underwhelming too 

overall it was a 710 for me

edit i want to add that i went into this with a basic understanding of the events of the movie already so its not like i was completely lost as to what was going on or didnt understand it i just wasnt really a fan of how it was all presented",2023-07-26 18:22:13
i honestly thought it was bad  endless dramatic music over every scene  i’m told how i’m supposed to feel rather than actually feeling it and the background story is way more interesting than the story we were given convoluted flashbacks and flash forwards and the conflicts in the story seemed kind of “who cares…”,2023-07-26 20:06:14
"watched it today i loved watching interstellar loved dunkirk and same goes for the dark knight not a big rewatcher so most of these ive only seen once or twice 

the movie is good its worth seeing but personally for me it failed to live up to the hype it was a tad bit confusing with the out of chronological order things i thought it focused too little on the science im not expecting a science flick but just a bit more explanation of some of the bomb stuff 

i doubt i will watch it again as it is my opinion that this and interstellar are movies that requires a big screen and a phenomal sound system to watch neither of which i have or plan on acquiring anytime soon 

is it worth the admission ticket yes most definitely you will not be disappointed but for me personally it fell short of the hype",2023-07-26 22:51:45
"i’m 100 out of the loop as far as hollywood goes i had heard the name but i didn’t even know about christopher nolan his reputation or what movies he made before this

oppenheimer is one of the best movies i have ever seen and i would recommend it to anybody who holds even the slightest interest in the subject

edit i do think you get out what you put in to a degree comprehend the gravity of the subject and you will end up very moved an uninterested uneducated teenager might not see what all the fuss is about those who were bored probably did not know much if anything about the events the movie covers and do not truly appreciate the consequences of them it is not an action movie but i was enthralled the whole way through the trinity test was anything but underwhelming as a few contrarians are saying 

people will always find something to complain about you’d think the kind to complain about that scene would have wanted the atmosphere to go up in flames then for oppenheimer to crawl out from underneath the rubble screaming “now i am become death ” before donning his hat and winking at the camera while melting into a slurry of blood and charred goo the shockwave blows what’s left of his bones through jean’s casket together again at last pan all the way to japan where emperor hirohito sees the world slowly consumed by fire and uglycries on his knees while staring up at a disappearing and smoke filled sky until he too gorily becomes one with the great mushroom cloud which is now all earth the opening riff of don’t fear the reaper rings out roll credits",2023-07-26 17:57:45
"i have just seen it and i think its good but as some other redditor said a big chunk of it is just explaining what he did rather than showing it to us for example were shown his earlier life and explained that he became so famous not sure if thags the word to be able to direct the manhattan project but the film itself doesnt really show the man himself doing something of such relevance

its an interesting film anyway good acting and worth my money and the 3 hours it lasts",2023-07-26 18:43:31
yes objectively on a cinematic and technical level its just boring,2023-07-26 18:30:13
"i don’t even know what else he has done i give it a 6510 very good in some parts very bad in other parts i hate the way some of the dialogue was written every character has an instant and witty comebackstyle thing to say without thinking about it like csi or law  order or something and a lot of parts felt like i was watching a movie trailer instead of an actual movie

i think for the character of oppenheimer nolan probably saw that one famous interview and decided “yeah that’s how he probably talked all the time” i also don’t like the way they incorporated his most famous quote 

i think it’s worth watching once",2023-07-26 23:09:40
to be honest it lands in the middle of the pack of nolan movies for me some of his movies i like very much others i think are worth watching but aren’t my favorite i score it somewhere in the 7810 range but it’s also hard for me to give almost any movie 910 10 the first time i see it,2023-07-27 00:43:19
it’s his first biopic so he can’t really get too weird with it…i’d give it an 87,2023-07-27 02:43:35

there was a good movie somewhere in the 3 hours of poorly mixed audio and bloated story,2024-01-04 23:54:30
i liked the part where einstein fist bumped oppenheimer and said “way to go brometheus” after they dropped the bomb on ,2023-07-21 21:20:58
i liked when oppenheimer said “it is too round on the top it needs to be pointy round is not scary pointy is scary this will put a smile on the face of the enemy”,2023-07-21 20:47:40
i was trying to tell people i saw it a week early and i was like “ why does this need to be seen in imax…”,2023-07-21 23:08:52
manhattan project,2023-07-22 02:04:28
"i loved the book if you haven’t read it i highly recommend it

as for your comment on representation in oppenheimer i will agree it is a white male dominated film but only because of the time period it was centered around things were not as diverse then as they are now 

killers of the flower moon on the other hand is quite worse in several ways most notably that osage women were being brutally murdered for control of their oil",2023-07-22 13:36:50
this wasn’t a slow burn at all it had an extremely fast paced that very rarely relented just because there isn’t action and just people talking doesn’t mean it’s a slow burn this film was edited like the beginning part of a roller coaster it was all ascension constantly building and building until the final shot lincoln is a far slower film both work for what they’re trying to accomplish in my opinion i agree about your point with the nonlinear storytelling i’m always a sucker for that could definitely feel the citizen kane influence,2023-07-23 01:32:43

"other than the fact they are dead id say favourable 

for example feynman was portrayed quite accurately  he was doing other peoples calculations back then as he was a junior scientist he was shown playing his famous bongos and also famously saying no to the eye protection and instead watching the trinity tear through car window",2023-07-29 04:33:19
oppenheimer isnt considering that he accidentally lit the atmosphere hes saying he sealed humanitys fate and that nuclear war is inevitable thats why it ends with shots of missiles being launched and world bein engulfed in fire as far as the chronology oppenheimer met strauss after the manhattan project and before the aec that scene is their first meeting and his first insane assumption oppenheimer is turning scientists against him,2023-08-19 05:27:16
if you go to wikipedia and read the plot summary on there it is in chronological order it helped me a lot to read that after i watched it,2023-08-19 04:26:41
"as someone already suggested it helps to read the plot from wikipedia i also recommend rewatching it after digesting the plot and figuring out the names 

to briefly answer some of your questions strauss met oppenheimer in 1947 at princeton where he offered him the position of director of the institute of advanced study this is the early scene in the movie where strauss shows oppenheimer around his new office and then they meet einstein at this time the bomb had of course already been developed and used in 1949 during a hearing by the aec which debated the export of radioactive isotopes oppenheimer appeared to embarrass strauss which marked the beginning of strauss’ animosity towards oppenheimer in addition the pair held differing views on the development of the hydrogen bomb first conceived by teller and referred to colloquially as the “super” with strauss fervently supporting the acceleration of the program and oppenheimer seeing it as waste of resources  strauss was also insecure about oppenheimer’s growing influence in the scientific sphere and feared that he was poisoning the community against him this dates back to their 
first meeting in 1947 where he assumes that oppenheimer and einstein were discussing him when in reality they weren’t as seen in the final scene of the movie as for the meeting at the table that took place sometime in 1949 when it was revealed that the soviet union was pilot testing some plutoniumfueled explosive devices similar in nature to those manufactured at los alamos this insinuated that there was a spy at los alamos during the development of the bomb which indeed turned out to be true klaus fuchs a german theoretical physicist who had spent sometime in britain was supplying the soviet union with information about the development of the bomb all these factors along with oppenheimer’s close ties with known communists led strauss to orchestrate an unfair hearing on oppenheimer’s security clearance he gave william borden the executive director of the joint committee on atomic energy access to oppenheimer’s security files and convinced him to write an open letter to edgar hoover of the fbi accusing oppenheimer of being an agent of the soviet union so thus in 1954  oppenheimer lost his security clearance and finally in 1959 strauss’ recess nomination as secretary of commerce was rejected by the senate due to his personal vendetta against oppenheimer that was brought to light by the testimony of david hill",2023-08-20 16:06:06
this is not a movie that demands to be seen in theaters let alone in 70mm imax sure the experience will be heightened in the theater as it would for any other movie the picturesound is biggerbetter  but this is mostly a drama with a lot of dialogue and closeups of peoples faces  there are very few breathtaking wide shots and the actual visual of the atomic explosion id say is a little underwhelming i can much more appreciate the need to see practically any other nolan film in imax but honestly this aint it,2023-08-28 16:03:08
"im a be real this movies probably the best and worst example of hollywood must see in theaters type movies  


if you do see it in theaters a great experience imo but not a very great film outside of it if youre a buff for sound design this movies really probably some of his best work if not some of the best work of sound design in recent memory probably just around dune but both are definitely below top gun maverick in making you feel that oomph of the action  


but my problem with oppenheimer is that i just dont think itd age well at all outside of theaters unless you have some good speakers at home with a decent tv itd probably just feel like a 3 hour biopic with an admittedly very eh explosive payoff even when watching it in imax just like other see it in imax movies this might actually be the worst case of needing to see it in theaters for it to really be worthwhile while movies like maverick definitely have that extra adrenaline rush in theaters its still very entertaining at home dune to some extent has the same issue as oppenheimer but i think ive consistently liked denis work more than nolans after watching some of their older movies",2023-08-28 17:32:37

"for me the imax was worth it and i recommend it if its really challenging i get not being able to but i disagree with the opinions that the dialog scenes are so much its not worth it

i actually think that the switch between different aspect ratios helps the dialog scenes inside rooms have a different ratio which you notice and that punch comes from the change its not just having a particular ratio its the movement between them i noticed and its not two i think there are 3 or even 4

buttttt i also am of the opinion that you do what works for you and its not like you cant enjoy a movie without the perfectlysized screen my mother is 74 with tinnitus and we didnt have issues with sound fwiw",2023-08-29 23:36:22
go watch it in theatres you will not regret it,2023-08-28 10:39:47
yes seeing it in real imax is the only way to truly watch imho ive only seen it in digital just got back from my second viewing but in true large screen imax is a must imho oppenheimer isnt overbearing in its loudness there are times in a packed theater you could still hear a pin drop yet when the movie calls for it its loud,2023-08-28 06:57:57
it really depends i found people to either love it or absolutely hate it those who love it will probably recommend but bear in mind that it can indeed be loud and challenging to follow at times especially if you have hearing problems in your case id personally recommend waiting for digital release with available subtitles but your choice,2023-08-28 15:44:46

i mean can you really blame mccarthyism  he really was a communist for a time and he really admitted to being approached by a soviet spy   there really was a race and espionage situation  klaus fuchs was actually a spy within the manhattan project,2023-07-22 14:34:56

"such a great review

 those pulsing whirring visual cutaways were awesome why did they just stop

youre right the moment these stopped is the moment the wind just died for this movie it blows my mind that they didnt apply this to actually seeing the bomb going off

 oppenheimer was a weird fascinating dude

reading this and about all these other stories and personalities makes me so sad that we spent all this time with rdj

 the very end of the movie is this fiery vision of doomsday

and kubrick did that ending already much better just by using the real footage

why did the critics like this movie so much",2023-07-22 19:28:25
"probably the best review ive read here kudos 

extras point for knowing the context of that destroyer of worlds quote nolan only cared about the literal meaning and how it would fit in the aesthetic of things the fact that the context itself would have been ammo enough for him to go ahead and want to build the thing only realizing later that hes no krishna hes no  hes just mortal hes prometheus only gods can give you the power to destroy you cannot take it from them and give it to mankind 

imagine that krishna and prometheus decoded and finally understood by oppenheimer in the aftermath of his actions he tried to play  but realized hes only human in the end imagine the epic visuals that could have been provided to us on film as recurring nightmares after hiroshimanagasaki 

also even if your argument is that this is all oppenheimers pov and hence we dont see the victims it was perfectly possible he meets one later on in life much much later this is a biography yes but i dont think anybody would have minded a first person account of a victim replace the many strauss scenes with just one of this 


also a major major issue is how oppenheimer just just falsifies details of alamos being the perfect place with nobody around complete erasure of history there unforgivable in my opinion us gov bulldozed their homes cattle and forced them to move within a day then they made the workers work without protective gear where was all this not even in passing do we get any of this all brushed aside 

ive had two days to process the movie and the more i get to know about the historical inaccuracies and the blatant erasure of things i find it even harder to praise it",2023-07-22 18:29:31
well said,2023-07-22 18:17:48
"100 sticky this review you touched on everything and i agree completely 

your description of what happened in japan is horrifying and perhaps a blockbuster film like this should disgust and horrify us with the potential effect of what oppenheimer wanted to make us experience the horror and never want to use the bombs again",2023-07-22 20:06:31
"this criticism felt quite aggressive but i agree with almost every point to a certain degree thats the weird thing i still very much liked the movie  but every film nowadays sort of feel like appreciating the potential

why is it either a braindead effectsfest or a melodrama with shotreverseshot and close ups of faces where are the true epics we have the tech down why arent they made 

overreliance on practical effects indeed its admirable but youre not gonna outdo the actual captured on film nuclear blasts that are literally all over youtube",2023-07-22 18:20:55
i really liked it but your point about scene length is my number one complaint i literally said word for word what you said while driving home after the movie it was a blistering sequence of 3060 second scenes and it got exhausting,2023-07-22 19:31:00
the trinity test should have been what was shown in the first couple of mins of the film the massive fireball absolutely demolishing the earth beneath it and the sound system of the theater rocking us to our core during the explosion instead we got essentially the exact opposite i was let down,2023-07-22 18:19:12
lol,2023-07-22 18:18:04
" the movie is so long and it exposits so aggressively why is the science is reduced to pure mysticism christopher nolan seems obsessed with realism so i dont get why these genius men and women are relegated to speaking in platitudes about the science they devoted their lives to study

the science was reduced quite a bit to become more understandable but it is essentially mysticism to the vast majority of people

think of all the people involved in some way einstein heisenberg and born laid foundations bethe bohr fermi feynman chadwick szilard lawrence von neumann teller etc

anything beyond platitudes will lose the audience  as its still pretty advanced physics some 80 years later there comes a point where adding more explanation doesnt help so it kept the science accurate but to the point",2023-07-22 21:41:13
"this is an excellent review but to pile on one more couldhavebeen the way the discovery of fission spread through the scientific community was a lot more cinematic than depicted in the film—a lost opportunity

fermi was splitting atoms in italy as early as 1934 though he did not know thats what was happening in his experiments he interpreted his results of neuron bombardment as producing new elements heavier than uranium the jolietcuries in france and the meitnerhahn team in germany kept finding irregularities in fermis interpretation because it was wrong ida noddack a theorist hinted at the correct interpretation but she was ignored by 1938 the meitnerhahn team was at the brink of discovery but lise meitner had to flee germany because germany had annexed austria and so her austrian citizenship no longer protected her from antijewish laws she left with nothing but a small bag and a valuable ring

while in exile in sweden meitner and her nephew otto frisch were taking a walk when they realized that the nuclei in everyones experiments were being split into smaller known nuclei releasing a lot of energy in the process meitner stopped in the snow to calculate the amount of energy and they both recognized the significance

frish managed to catch nils bohr on the docks as he was getting on a boat for america many scientists were fleeing europe that year because it was obvious that world war 2 was starting fermi used his 1938 nobel prize trip to stockholm to secretly get his whole family out of italy the prize was for his mistaken discovery of new elements

on the docks frish explained it to bohr who also recognized its significance he promised to keep it secret while meitner and frish finished writing their paper bohr brooded about it for a month at sea in new york he told a few physicists at columbia which set off a chain reaction of its own with physicists telling their colleagues at other east coast universities the request to wait for meitner and frishs paper was lost along the way on the first day of a conference on superconductivity in washington dc a totally different field someone burst into the room explained how nuclei were being split and everyone left the conference to reproduce the discovery at their home universities thats what spread the news across the country

meanwhile leo szilard had been thinking about sustained nuclear chain reactions since 1933 he just didnt know what reaction could be made to trigger itself when he heard about the atom being split releasing neutrons that could initiate more reactions he realized that this was the one that could be turned into a bomb he immediately tried to get his colleagues to adopt a code of secrecy which was a hard sell but he eventually won them over hes also the one who tracked down einstein on vacation in upstate new york to have him write a letter to the president starting the manhattan project einstein was the only scientist famous enough for roosevelt to know personally

unlike the movie the berkeley scientists wouldnt have learned about it from the newspaper—this wildfire discovery was spreading much more quickly through the scientific community as well as its import atomic energy was a common theme in science fiction at the time—though usually as a fuel for rockets to the moon—it would have been in everybodys mind and its discovery was also deeply connected to the mass exodus of scientists from europe and the beginning of war theres a lot of dramatic potential here which the movie didnt take advantage of

i recognize that the movie was following oppenheimer and most of this involved a lot of other people but its what was going on around oppenheimer in the world that he was a part of",2023-07-23 02:29:30
what a great take of the film i agree it was a bit underwhelming visually and too much focus on strauss,2023-07-23 02:57:38
"as someone who studies political science the nuclear treaties are actually the most well followed international agreements

it may have been out of scope of the movie but i wish they had explored this more  a lot of those arms control agreements oppenheimer wanted actually did come to fruition",2023-07-22 22:52:36
the movie isnt boring because it doesnt have action or is a 3 hour biopic of people talking its boring because it has only a single pace the entire movie which means that nothing that happens feels like it has any more or less weight than anything else that single pace is also so fast that unless you have prior knowledge on who all these people are its incredibly hard to follow or invest yourself into or even get a sense of the passage of time,2023-07-22 22:38:18
did you know that not everyone on the internet is american,2023-07-22 22:45:45
so sorry people dont study political science and therefore have the audacity to call the greatest movie ever made boring so sorry they should try to get their degrees first before having the gall to even step foot in the theatre,2023-07-22 22:54:54
i thought it was tremendously boring because it was so historically inaccurate and the dialogue was extremely forced this movie dumbed everything down the people who disliked it are not a mass of ignoramuses,2023-07-22 22:51:12
shes too seasoned and doesnt want to relive another failed marriage,2023-07-22 23:50:21
this is also an “issue” with the book the story is more of a political thriller than a scientific movie,2023-07-24 13:57:41
"agree when i saw clips in the trailer of them putting together that weird sphere i was wondering about the background of how that thing actually worked but it was just used in a montage more or less 

i wanted a little more behind the scenes of how the bomb worked and got made from raw materials",2023-07-24 14:52:16
"agreed its a good movie but it feel short for me 

basically 23rds of it is about the mind behind the manhattan project and building to the trinity test and then the rest is about a senate confirmation hearing and a clearance hearing that has laughably low stakes compared to the rest of the movie 

it is like if titantic ended with a halfhour of insurance companies attempting fault with white star lines sure its somewhat interesting but the meat of the story is right there",2023-07-24 13:40:11
its based on his biography,2023-07-24 13:57:02
agreed they could almost make a parallel sequel focusing more on the technical drama of the manhattan project,2023-07-24 13:22:40
no bruh that would make it boring,2023-07-24 13:34:29
"this…on your tv

the cinema experience enhanced this film so much",2023-07-30 01:58:19
theres a tv show called manhattan thats about the building of the bomb doesnt focus on oppenheimer hes more of a side character in it but you may enjoy it anyway,2023-08-03 00:26:55
"yeah pretty boring plot einstein seemed like a more interesting character than heimer in this movie

i disagree with dunkirk that was a boring slog esp for a war movie i don’t care that he used “something” millimeter film",2023-07-29 05:30:02
took the words right out of my mouth i also expected more into the scifi corner like maybe some visions of him or whatsoever so many possibilities but it was straight up a biopic it was missing the mysteriousmystic side for me but i honestly didnt knew what to expect the villain plot with rdj was pointless and boring to me the ending that were all going to die to nukes is sounderwhelming yeah ok no  maybe,2023-07-29 23:18:30
100 agree wasn’t a horrible film but  is it overrated as  like you said the personal details of oppenheimer were not that interesting and i cannot understand the hype behind this movie,2023-07-29 06:43:53
"i’m with you  i posted similar comments last weekend and was downvoted big time 

i walked out of the movie feeling pretty indifferent  acting and score were great but i just couldn’t get super invested in the story  there were so many names and people that quickly came in and out of the movie that i lost track of who was who  it’s not something i plan to watch again or really recommend to others 

i love a lot of nolan’s earlier work but this one didn’t excite me at all",2023-07-29 05:49:00
i mean fair enough if you didnt like the movie to each their own  personally i loved it but it was literally called oppenheimer  not manhattan or trinity so of course it was going to be mainly about him  personally and professionally and not about the manhattan project in general,2023-07-29 18:52:04
" his wifes big connecting weve been through fire together moment is that she helped him greive over the death of the chick he was  on the side insane to me

i mean that was literally what happened in real life so

its okay if its insane to you but its what kitty and oppies relationship was actually like nolan didnt invent that",2023-07-30 03:58:14
" couldn‘t tell you anything about oppenheimer‘s character

well he clearly had a problem with the real world aspects of his theoretical mind  he could totally disassociate from the consequences of the project until hed suddenly realize what they were and almost couldnt deal with it",2023-08-07 14:35:11
"this is such a good summary i totally agree here is how i was seeing it

 fastpaced editing a closeup of one person saying half a sentence cutting to the other person responding the whole movie
 nonstop music it just never stops except in that one scene see this scene is important because we finally stop all the noise
 3 time lines really is this a throwback to memento

 3 hour trailer just as you said

good things ive ran into all those scientists names during my engineering school it was great to see them in a movie the historical facts in the movie seem to be all accurate",2024-02-19 17:53:26
stop assuming you’re being discriminated against because you’re a woman,2024-03-12 08:55:11
"this is why i’m always wary of nolan films i don’t understand his obsession with messing around with timelines it always feels like he’s ribbing me with his elbows going “aren’t i sooo clever” because of how much he’s needlessly obfuscating his stories 

i know this comes down to personal taste i’m not insulting anyone who likes his films i love memento but then so many of his other films are given the memento treatment and i can’t understand why",2023-07-21 13:36:05
i really don’t think any of the individual acts if told in a linear fashion would really hold up at all aside from the trinity test portion i get this as a general criticism of nolan i don’t really like dunkirk interstellar or tenet but i don’t really see it here if you know high school level history and come in ready to pay attention it’s not that hard to digest,2023-07-21 13:40:04
yep same thing he did with tenet most generic spy thriller ever with the illusion of layers added on top via pseudoscience and bad sound mixing,2023-07-21 13:28:11
"i dont find the time jumps unnecessary
it allows him to pack so much into a 3hr movie without making it boring
and female characters in general dont have big roles in his movies",2023-07-21 14:00:41
bingo,2023-07-21 14:35:11
well of it works and it made it pretty fast paced,2023-07-21 20:47:59
nolan is the master of making movies that seem superficially smart  cleverdumb movies with no nuance whatsoever,2023-07-22 15:44:27
i agree i liked it but also felt like it dragged on way too long wouldve been better spaced apart like a miniseries,2023-07-21 11:24:19
being completely honest the nuke seemed kind of small to me some  in the theater ruined it too by crinkling a bag really loud during the entire silence before the shockwave,2023-07-23 16:59:10
"e of the prevailing messages of t

i dont understand why they would think that truman was trying to take the burden off of oppenheimer when he said to not let that cry baby in here again i thought he was offended because ultimately it was trumans decision to drop the bomb",2023-07-23 16:16:45
"i was quite happy with them not showing the bombings because the movie was heavily centered around oppenheimer himself and i feel like showing more special effects of a bombing wouldve been a distraction the moment it happened worked well to me because it was heard over the radio just when he wasnt sure what was happening the focus is on his state of mind and his reaction to finding out the news even the trinity test spent a decent amount of time focusing on peoples reaction rather than a copious amount of time on some mushroom cloud the loud boom was delayed extra long to emphasize the drama to let people take in the silence 

while i agree the  scene seemed unnecessary his nudity in the closedroom hearing seemed apt wouldve been rated r for language regardless 

my main gripes are more about nolans style being a bit overdone at times choosing the blast the soundtrack over some dialogue to invoke emotion rather than allowing the actors to do it at times was distracting probably works in theater sound but will be difficult to parse through on regular home audio without subtitles

his techniques to tell a few stories in parallel but at different elapsed times is a bit old to me inception and dunkirk followed the same formula and it works for those movies but felt unnecessary for oppenheimer other than to make it feel more like a nolan flick",2023-07-24 22:51:27
"they also didnt go into the temple elemanuel vs ethical culture society schism or his dads collection of picassos or his trip around corsica reading proust or writing poetry in his room at harvard or trying to strangle his friend or katherine page or sailing off long island or his visit to haakon chevalier in paris or his retirement to the  islands or explicitly his affair with ruth tolman or theres only so much you can include in a movie and thats just the stuff that was part of his life

louis slotin isnt part of oppenheimers story einsteins socialism isnt part of his story hiroshima and nagasaki are barely part of his story because by that point as pointed out in the movie the key strategic decisions lay with the military

the quotation from the bhagavad gita isnt even attested to contemporaneously — a real quotation from kenneth bainbridge now were all sons of  is actually a banger oppenheimer referred to the destroyer of worlds line in letters several years later and in the 1965 tv documentary in order to burnish his reputation which actually dovetails with the themes in this new movie

they didnt say e equals m c squared 1111eleven1 give me a  break",2023-07-24 22:56:56
i agree with most of what you said there was just too much emphasis on the oppenheimer security clearance affair which honestly was an insignificant historical event compared to the building of the bomb the event didnt even seem that personally significant to oppenheimer since he didnt fight back nor did they show the impact of the revoking of the clearance afterwards,2023-07-25 02:05:26
good review,2023-07-25 01:41:16
"ebola  

great review ",2023-07-25 04:38:55
good review you should make a letterboxd,2023-07-25 04:40:54
was jro a serious candidate for a nobel physics prize,2023-07-25 10:43:31
oppenheimer gave the lecture in dutch as he was in holland are you saying the lecture wasnt actually spoken in dutch i dont speak either language,2023-07-21 20:20:30
they are similar languages,2023-07-21 20:21:28
he continued to lecture write and work in physics he also moved to the us  islands where he actually has a beach named after him,2023-07-22 02:40:50
"yes he used a syringe to inject potassium chloride what they give inmates for lethal injection into the apple

edit it was potassium cyanide not chloride",2023-07-22 03:05:26
yep and just a combination of homesickness impulsiveness and anxiety,2023-07-22 03:06:54
oh but he had to do a clever turn on the line we all expected,2023-07-22 04:01:38
the opening montage with a quote about prometheus was one of my favourite parts of the film,2023-07-22 08:05:02
someone in the movie i think it was strauss himself asked the same question and the response he got was  does he really have to have a reason to do the right thing,2023-07-22 13:11:33
"hill was one of the people pushing the petition against the use of the bomb that oppenheimer slapped away earlier in the movie

strauss whose primary motivations are petty personal vendettas over perceived sleights believes that this will help him and result in hill giving positive testimony since he presumably would dislike oppenheimer

but that was also an indication that hill had a strong moral compass and principled view of the world and the way that government should be run someone like strauss who would go out of his way to destroy a scientist like oppenheimer when he spoke out in favor of those more principled views later on would absolutely be someone that hill would be personally against seeing in power on ethical grounds",2023-07-22 13:28:52
i think it was you can lift a rock without being prepared for the snake beneath it,2023-07-22 16:26:14
time constraints they only had room for about ten minutes of not men in suits talking to each other,2023-07-22 21:06:12
remember the couples that oppenheimer and his wife left their baby with later the man in that couple tells opp that he disagrees with the us’s decision to not share data with russia and alludes to a friend of his who could get info to the russians if oppenheimer wanted to subvert official channels and opp responds with “that would be treason” that’s the exchange that everyone kept asking about,2023-07-23 02:14:11
that was oppenheimers subjective experience in color,2023-07-23 02:28:30
the dialogue was super hard to hear in a lot of scenes i have no idea how they released the movie like that,2023-07-23 03:17:35
many of them were accused of being communist others were ostracized from the public because a great many people didn’t believe the bomb was as necessary and oppenheimer’s brother was a former communist,2023-07-23 03:47:34
"im assuming that movie spoilers btw in case

its a combination of personal vendetta from stauss to oppenheimer but also the entire thing is politically charged due to hatred of communism but also that the uss rival is building their own nuclear bombs its all complicated as far as i see it and the scientists being disgraced is likely cause of a combination of that

but unfortunately im not well versed in that part of history",2023-07-23 03:47:17
"there was a scene that highlighted

1 frank oppenheimer robert’s brother which they said he couldn’t get a job at any university 
2 lomanitz faect organizer ended up working in the railroad 
3 chevalier who was the guy who knew a guy who could back channel info to the soviets 

is that what you meant

basically all three got caught up in mccarthyism",2023-07-23 04:01:58
just an innocuous phrase that would mean nothing to eavesdroppers but get the message to her right away,2023-07-23 20:59:02
he couldnt tell his wife anything about the project so he couldnt call her and say it worked but the sheets were on the line so calling and saying take in the sheets wouldnt draw any attention but he told her before he left if it goes our way ill tell you to take in the sheets it was just a code between the two of them,2023-07-23 22:37:31
i assumed he didnt want any of the radiation spread to get on their bedsheets drying outside,2023-07-23 20:55:08
he couldn’t do that to a friend,2023-07-24 15:40:02
100 yes,2023-07-24 17:28:28
in literally every way,2023-07-24 17:16:40
absolutely,2023-07-24 18:34:25
"einstein was shaken by what oppie says which strauss incorrectly identifies as oppie talking  about him  


oppie says  you remember how when we started this project i told you there was a possibility that we might destroy the world well i think we did  


the bomb did not destroy the world literally  but it destroyed it all the same in oppies eyes because it has the potential to do exactly that in the future it also touches on the idea that absolute power corrupts absolutely oppie gave that power to the people in charge  


einstein understood this and was visibly shaken by the idea",2023-07-24 17:28:41
it was the conversation from before which lewis strauss had been thinking was about him which turned einstein against strauss after strauss advisor says maybe they were not talking about you but  about something more important we cut to oppie and einstein where oppie tells him that the unstoppable world ending chain reaction they feared might have been triggered  a metaphor for nuclear arms race,2023-07-24 17:29:22
oppie was trying to report that george eltenton used his friend hakkon chevalier to forward an offer of sending scientific secrets to the soviets through backdoor unofficial channels  but he was trying to do it without naming chevalier of course he fumbled it very badly and contradicted himself multiple times when he retold the story again,2023-07-24 19:39:52
pash was trying to find out who the moles are and was trying to get oppie to talk and he was a master at intimidation and oppie was caught looking like a school boy who tries to  a teacher,2023-07-24 19:08:25
‘overrated’,2023-07-24 22:40:50
because of all the time jumps and the high tempo in the beginning of the movie that’s pretty much impossible,2023-07-25 23:43:47
he tries to poison his professor and neils bohr almost eats it and then he meets heisenberg and decides hes gotta go to america and spread the gospel of quantum physics,2023-07-25 23:45:02
i think oppenheimer confirmed it when he didnt deny it,2023-07-26 13:56:54
the manhattan project took place 19421945 the lake scene is set after the ending of the war in 1947 when strauss offers oppenheimer a job in government we encountered the scene 2 times the first time in the beginning in black and white 3rd person and in the end in colour meaning its oppies personal experience strauss meant to befriend all the physicists after the war and chase the big spots in government with their support and yea well it didnt turn out that way and then he took actions to fight oppie and his influence in nuclear energy debates in order to do so he pulled some strings and made oppie face those trials calling him a traitor and a commie we see both trials taking place in 1954 when we see ultimately strausss demise whilst facing the demise strauss is referencing quite a few times that oppie managed to turn the scientists against him beginning with einstein then he references that lake scene set up in 1947 and then we can see what the actual convo was at the lake in colour meaning its how oppie experienced the convo,2023-07-26 08:30:38
"he meets einstein by the pond during the introductioninterview with strauss who offered him a place at an institute this is between the bombs going off and the enquirytrail he faces

it flashes back right at the end because strauss was curious as to what he said as he thinks oppenheimer turned all the scientists against him he suspects oppenheimer told einstein something about him that turned einstein against him but doesn’t know

it flashes back to that scene at the end and turns out they didn’t discuss strauss at all and was more a oppenheimer expressing his concerns for what the consequences would be",2023-07-26 08:10:49
"story of prometheus is greek might be roman mythology prometheus steals fire from the gods to give to man and they sentence him to torture forever 

oppenheimer gives parallels between its titular character and prometheus in that he has stolen the next level of immense energy that should have never been wielded by humans which is nuclear fissionfusion  it also implies that for a discovery that arguably advanced humanity oppenheimer himself suffered the shunning and consequences",2023-07-26 14:28:19
"this isnt the exact words but when i google prometheus quote oppenheimer it come up with nothing but his famous misquotation of time i am destroyer of the worlds and i have come to engage all people  

so to the best of my knowledge it was something like prometheus gave the secret of fire to all mankind  for that the gods have him punished eternally",2023-07-26 12:47:44
"prometheus stole fire from gods and gave it to man for this he suffered for all of eternity

im paraphrasing it but essentially the quote is about how oppenheimer created the most powerful weapon but suffered by his own guilt for his entire life",2023-07-26 14:22:39
i saw it in nyc today on the largest imax screen in the states the trinity test was pretty  sweet on imax ngl it was 100 feet of an explosion it was bananas but its like 1 minute of a 3 hour movie the movie is all talking if you dont have easy access to it dont bother i live here its easy for me,2023-07-27 00:28:20

they explain that in the movie its the production of uranium and plutonium required to build the bomb,2023-07-28 05:14:18

if i could hear the dialogue over the atomic level music every 20 seconds i may have been able to provide you a quote,2023-08-14 10:36:17
i didn’t hate it as much as you but yeah it did what i was afraid of putting the best part in the middle of the movie all of the red scare commie stuff had been pulled off better in other movies robert downey junior doesn’t know how to act anymore the explosion was underwhelming there’s a short interview with oppenheimer from the 50’s on youtube that’s far more compelling that the entire movie,2023-07-23 03:09:45
the movie is called oppenheimer not big bomb but i guess theory only gets you so far,2023-07-23 03:36:32
genuinely curious what did you expect then did you expect a nuclear bomb to go off and then someone like the rock to go in and save the day,2023-07-23 03:44:45
agree we jokingly said it felt like watching a three hour long trailer just exhausting for the first two hours and then it slowed down a bit for the last act which was quite uninteresting for me,2023-07-23 19:02:17
agreed the pace made it impossible to remember or care about a lot of the characters,2023-07-24 02:23:43
i agree could have cut down some stuff,2023-07-21 05:33:14
i agree 100 such a weird unnecessary  scene they are talking in one scene and doing it the next it made everyone uncomfortable,2023-07-21 11:59:46
to be fair it was heavily heavily marketed as a manhattan project focused movie about the bomb and that ended after two hours and the bomb wasn’t that cool,2023-07-22 00:47:00
"tbh dead reckoning is also quite long but i never felt it go slow

oppen really slows down after the test not surprised some got abut restless",2023-07-21 23:58:10
"nolan really managed to portray the surreal moments in the movie after the bombing when oppenheimer delivered his speech you could sense his remorse yet his words contradicted his true feelings he tried to appease the public who were chest thumping their governments actions believing they were right but morally questionable

the war was essentially between two authoritarian powers but the usas actions caused civilian suffering no less than what  did despite this america is still hailed as the hero of world war ii in the eyes of its public",2023-07-22 05:13:15
there was definately a shot of a fiery mushroom plume,2023-07-22 15:05:26

i didnt know it was a political movie,2023-07-24 14:23:57
can you elaborate on how did it ruin the movie,2023-07-24 12:50:33
do yourself a favor in the future and never watch trailers that’s what i started doing about a decade ago,2023-07-24 15:48:35
"the noise of the foot stomping was louder and far more memorable  


that was the entire point the whole movie was about the serious implications of the aftermath",2023-07-27 19:31:30
i think it could have ended after the speech scene following the test i didnt need the political drama afterwards that killed the pace,2023-07-28 06:08:03
 it was the opposite for me started off slow maybe the first 45 minutes and then it got really good,2023-07-28 02:59:22

i enjoyed maverick more at imax than this,2023-07-23 21:59:22
that was my feeling leaving the theater today and im the one who hyped all my friends up to see it ironically they all loved it,2023-07-23 20:25:00
"i agree 

i wont lie i expected a  like he could  with time in dunkirk but this feels like a rushed and sloppy summary of a book nolan read and eagerly needed to put into film 

the soundtrack is underwhelming tenet was much more gripping the opening scene for tenet was amazing pulled me in this didnt until way into the third hour when i got confused about the whodunnitbit with strauss while the riddle with einstein is not as important as it is presented 

murphy is a good actor but i dislike the supposed physical likeness that underlines ones actingskills also branaghs obligatory cameos tire me 

i really needed some more  of worlds i could do without the love drama",2023-07-23 19:51:24
i 100 agree that there is no reason to see it in imax lol it felt like 90 of the movie was just people talking in various offices  laboratories there were a few cool visual moments but i regret paying for the imax ticket,2023-07-24 04:09:52
"i’ll never watch it again and i don’t really have any feelings on it i saw it cool

i meanthats how most people see most movies",2023-07-23 22:00:21

"yeah i didnt get the rdj character at all i felt like he had more screentime than his character deserved because wellits rdj the last 40 minutes with that political drama could have been downsized to like 15 minutes

i have to agree with you nolan just cant make proper dialogue scenes like ever  he is good at visual and sound experience but most of the time thats about it,2023-07-21 23:35:56
sounds like your more bothered about other peoples opinion of the film rather than your own very insecure,2023-07-22 01:00:49
couldnt have put it better myself agree on all points  the dialogue really caught me off guard i noticed it felt like there was never a full stop people just kept on talking over dramatic loud music the part when he explains atoms are full of air and they could pass through each others bodies then  was hilarious,2023-07-22 10:02:41
well said couldnt agree more absolutely loved it and the three hours flew by for me i should consider a second viewing before it leaves theaters later on great experience,2023-07-22 21:47:26
it just shouldnt have been a biopic oppenheimers life is not interesting enough to require a biopic  the bombs are bigger than him the story that needed to be told is of the bombs and of the victims they killed not the poor baby who made them and then lost his security clearance,2023-07-22 21:24:48
"what if its just a biopic that happens to be boring

why cant people stop strawming negative opinions into you just wanted a transformers movie youre not intelligent enough for this movie for smart people give me a break

then why did they purchase tickets and go see it",2023-07-23 02:31:49

i was so engrossed in the movie and dialogue i know it was long but it didnt feel as long as avatar 2 after 40 minutes of pretty cgi scenes that made the check my watch several times id rather have dialogue,2023-07-23 07:49:21
the problem is the movie wasso dialogue heavy but the audio mixing was kinda bad so i had a hard time deciphering what the characters were saying the breakneck pacing didnt help either and the characters kept mentioning names of people who i never heard of i need to rewatch this movie with subs to fully understand it,2023-07-23 09:15:58
"add one more you just wanted an action movie strawman comment

what if people who are nagative wanted a good 3 hour long dialogue heavy biopic how hard is it to understand this and not get on your high intellectual you just wanted transformers horse",2023-07-23 09:22:58
the trailer was so misleading what about the trailer would lead someone to believe this is a dialogue heavy movie,2023-07-23 07:33:26
movies are supposed to be entertaining there are plenty of entertaining dialogue heavy biopics out there this was not it,2023-07-23 07:10:40
of course there was a lot of mysticism and marketing to the movie especially that imax stuff but honestly it checks out im very allergic to  and pretentiouness but i honestly loved it even if it isnt the best its just so refreshing something new and i miss the feeling of mass excitement for something so im in,2023-08-21 20:16:59
sorry that was not my experience at all i think imax greatly enhanced the viewing experience,2023-08-22 00:45:04
having seen it in many formats the 70mm imax experience was the best way to see it there are many many great performances in the film you’re going to see many oscar noms for this one it’s one of nolan’s best imo so in other words you couldn’t be more wrong,2023-08-21 21:50:14
"but one that must be viewed on the big screen and in 70 mm imax if possible

seems reasonable because nolan made it with imax camera so ofc the marketing must about that",2023-08-23 09:05:46
nolan has been having this issue its a problem of contrast when every single moment is heightened and intense and important nothing is,2023-07-21 08:31:54
dark knightinception was the golden era,2023-07-21 23:53:36
so if i didn’t like tenet dunkirk and tdkr would you still recommend this one only movie of his i liked since inception was interstellar but even that had issues,2023-07-21 23:51:16
yeah i agree it was a perfectly good movies but the things that made it a nolan movie im like meh,2023-07-21 23:34:09
"i think he wanted to avoid pushing the envelope in that regard due to the real consequences of not dropping the bomb which also could have ended with 100s of thousands of dead japanese civilians but i guess well never know if japan would have surrendered purely due to the soviet incursion into manchuria without the bombs being dropped 

it certainly would have invited a lot of controversy into the media space of this movie",2023-07-22 00:20:56
oskar schindler saw that brutality in his own country and up close comparing these two men is completely idotic sp you wanted to see the bombs dropped and the dead bodies to know nuclear weapons are bad for sure,2023-07-22 00:46:21
i had no sound issues 70mm regular in what format did you see it,2023-07-22 01:04:07
i think showing japanese people literally burning to dust wouldve been a step too far i feel like people are implicitly dehumanizing the events this way and i really respected how respectful nolan was on this front,2023-07-22 03:48:56
i was so beyond over it an hour in and then it just keeps going and going and going with endless repetitive dialogue,2023-07-22 15:53:15
the dialogue some of the worst ive ever heard,2023-07-22 16:23:59
this made me chuckle,2023-07-23 03:17:11
"i wasnt actually sure if it would be worth all the hype i went in thinking it would be a bit of a standard biopic even with the christopher nolan label

just left the theater 30 minutes ago with my mind absolutely blown best movie ive seen in a while",2023-07-23 06:06:02
"maybe just a case of collective setting of expectations too high

the movie was so hyped by everyone that as you said we all expected the greatest movie ever made if it wasnt marketed in this way it wouldve been much better received",2023-07-23 06:00:00
the thing is what is so significant about the bomb is the politics behind it the dawn of the cold war and the doomsday clock the central point of the movie is how the political discourse around science can be weaponized oppie was a great part of the reason that the us developed the first functional atomic bomb but the other was how quantum mechanics was considered jewish in  germany,2023-07-24 10:28:50
"well they named it correctly this wasnt a movie about a bomb it was a movie about oppenheimer

nerdier people will enjoy the historical aspect of the aftermath theres tons of info about the manhattan project out there already

its a movie about legacy",2023-07-24 13:38:56
totally i love the few scenes we got of scientists debating and lecturing but there was so much time wasted on boring senate hearings and the clearance review i say this as a politics nerd it was a strange choice,2023-07-24 08:39:36
"i actually agree with you on the first part i feel like the main plot is kind of petty but i that’s just my opinion i’m a huge physics nerd so i was more excited on the manhattan project

i hated when the soundtrack covered the dialogues in tenet but i didn’t experience that in this film i mean the soundtrack is loud but it didn’t cover the dialogue as badly as tenet or maybe i missed out some parts idk",2023-07-24 09:01:03
black and white scenes are to show from strauss perspective its an art choice of nolan to differentiate   between oppenheimer and strauss perspective and also dont forget the movie is based on a biographical book so to include just ww2 bombing would make no sense as it is not supposed to be a war movie but rise and down fall of oppenheimer,2023-07-24 11:59:07
you hit the nail on the head it felt disjointed loose unfocused pretentious and unsatisfying it felt like a dumb person’s idea of a smart movie honestly one of nolan’s worst at least we got a little feynman injoke cameo,2023-07-25 11:59:50
" you dont just sit around a table say quantum mechanics is crazy yall and frantically start writing stuff on a blackboard

i mean you do or at least thats how my classes on qm and qft went

 science chemistry and physics are not like that

physics is at least its all well and good being able to shut up and calculate and thats important for developing some intuition but if you cant eventually intuit how the physics works youre not going to be able to understand further physics",2023-07-25 13:55:29
" you and me practically wrote the same first sentence paragraph here 

x200b

i feel like i can understand your notion with the usage of the ost although i disagree with it because this movie ultimately is just talking for a large 99 of it i personally found the soundtrack to never really take away from any of the dialogue scenes and honestly helped it become much more accessible to the general audience its interesting because ive heard peeps claim dune was an absolute snorefest they didnt get why people were liking it etc but absolutely love this movie i think its due to how much nolan wants to keep people engaged through the soundtrack and editing",2023-07-25 12:19:50
extremely agree with each one of your points,2023-07-25 12:29:56
"saw it last night i know i was meant to like the film but i just didnt

totally agreeing with you and all the reasons you listed i would also add the multiples flashbacks with no links to the main plot",2023-07-28 14:47:40
don’t be it was awesome i saw it 3 times in imax,2023-11-27 05:52:05
even the nuke scene was so so boring,2023-11-22 02:57:40
"it wasnt near as bad as tenet but its around the same level nolan needs to swallow his ego and stop writing his own scripts dude cant write dialogue if his life depended on it

im glad someone else felt that oppenheimer the character wasnt fleshed out at all it seems like nolan had no point of view or opinion about him i never understood why he was supposed to be great or magnetic to everyone around him he always seemed outside and like you said aloof",2023-07-21 08:26:54
nolan has always  at portraying women,2023-07-21 12:22:09
i believe the stuff about the security clearance is true,2023-07-21 14:02:00
"the wife kitty goes from being a useless  that he’s stuck with because he knocked her up to being the most badass character in the final 30 minutes 

except this happened in real life oppenheimer wanted to be contrite and not combative during the security hearing but was feckless and overwhelmed by the withering acrimonious interrogation he was subjected to by roger robb the aggressive prosecutor hired by the aec kitty oppenheimer may have been an alcoholic and uncaring mother and she may have had her disagreements with her husband but she nonetheless loved robert deeply so after a few days of seeing her husband being subjected to a kangaroo court kitty made every opportunity to vociferously defend herself and her husband and bring the fight back to his opponents when she was under cross examination

but it makes all the drama about him losing security clearance at a time he’s apparently no longer involved in the aec even sillier

except again that is exactly what happened oppenheimers security clearance was set to expire in 1954 but even without it oppenheimer would have remained the one of the most prominent and influential public intellectuals in the country if not the world his political enemies strauss chief among them wanted to finally and utterly remove him from having any influence in the conversation regarding nuclear policy as they viewed oppenheimers opposition to the hydrogen bomb and his advocation for international nuclear disarmament as dangerous to american military interests if not outright traitorous so taking advantage of the era of peak mccarthyism they ambushed him by relitigating his past associations with communists and they were successful in forcing him into exile",2023-07-21 14:41:56
its mainly like that because it is historically authentic,2023-07-21 14:06:19
its a biopic literally named oppenheimer how would one not expect it to be about his life,2023-07-25 11:39:59
sorry but why the  is anyone expecting a surprise twist in a movie that is unambiguously marketed as a historical drama,2023-07-21 14:47:07
they should’ve leaned into the surrealism the gym scene was the pinnacle of the movie and i was disappointed that they abandoned that direction,2023-07-23 04:20:33
so much of this movie is built like there’s going to be some reveal or historical rewrite  the atmosphere is set alight or something  i don’t mode historical biopics that just tell the story as it happens but don’t have the film crescendo if there’s no payoff,2023-07-23 21:50:49
wait whats the problem with gary oldman as truman,2023-07-27 13:43:24
some buffoon was writing how he started crying at the opening scene  you have no  clue if the movie is going to be good at that point  just goes to show these people wanted to like it and were going to pretty much love it no matter what,2023-07-22 16:30:10
yup also what were your expectations how dare you expect anything from a much marketed scenemarketed as the highlight of the movie btw  them  tbh this movie became film bro favorite the day it was announced and cemmented that position when the trailer dropped it didnt matter how good or bad the actual movie would be i knew it would be hailed as the greatest movie ever made lol anyway its been a mixed bag and thats the truth nolan fanboys cant do anything about it its already minting all the money in the world so it can handle the criticism too,2023-07-22 16:32:14
"i’ve seen some very well articulated criticisms that made me rethink certain aspects of the movie however for the us audiences that were expecting the successful execution of the bomb to be the plot driver of the movie i do wonder how much of that comes from our culture around ww2 movies having a certain clear tangible and moral driving force so people went into this movie expecting another “how our boys defeated the axis powers” that comes from being from a nation that was one of ww2’s winners 

i’m not doubting an appreciation for complexity i think those digs are pretty simplistic and cheap i’m just wondering if part of the expectationsdislike at least in the us comes from our shared longstanding traditions behind telling very specific types of stories when the subject matter is about anything relating to ww2 most ww2 movies would have ended around oppenheimer’s ‘success’ speech maybe even after his press tourconvo with truman",2023-07-22 16:55:53
i can accept that a person didnt enjoy the movie but to call it boring is insane to me not a single person should have walked into that movie expecting a turn your mind off popcorn flick and people complaining about the politics thats literally part of oppenheimers story,2023-07-22 17:15:44
unpopular opinion just because you didnt like the movie that much doesnt mean everyone else is lying about how much they liked it,2023-07-26 20:45:08
im with ya,2023-07-26 22:34:38
classic new movie from popular director syndrome,2023-07-26 20:19:56
"nah the  scene during the interview narratively fits it’s from kitty’s perspective the ugliness is key like you said but certainly not unnecessary

there are four main stars and the cast is so star studded because everyone wanted to work on this film blunt and downey took pay cuts just to work on it screen time is easily relegated to how consequential that person was to oppenheimer’s life on a personal level 

i didn’t feel the runtime at all thought it was paced perfectly",2023-07-22 02:58:11
i kind of felt bad for the actress in the  scenes especially the one during the interrogation felt really unnecessary and almost grotesque i would be surprised if there was anything in the historical account to portray her the way they did,2023-07-22 03:17:31
how long are the  scenes gonna watch with my dad and i dont feel like sitting for 15 minutes watching basically  with my dad next to me lol,2023-07-22 03:12:18
i disagree the  scenes helped the audience understand that oppenheimer was a womaniser and had a strong love affair with jean tatlock,2023-07-22 22:16:46
the first act was so disjointed from the rest of the movie  watching young oppie attending university lectures,2023-07-23 10:42:52
i enjoyed my recliner sofa seat viewing  in a normal theater vs imax,2023-07-26 17:41:57
"1 starved of strong theatrical releases for a very long time
2 nolan is a tremendous director with incredible casting which provides thoroughly enjoyable performances
3 covers a highly historic and timewarped us event that fundamentally changed national political dynamics forever

i loved it but can say i prefer nolans more original screenplays compared to historical contexts like this and dunkirk",2023-07-31 01:40:52
the part where he whips out his  and says its oppen time had me on the edge of my seat,2023-07-21 10:24:33
honestly that would have been less weird than the actual utterance of that line that we got with pugh,2023-07-21 10:22:07
"they first met in 47 when strauss tries to hire him to princeton and the scene they replayed 55000 times with einstein by the lake occurs

i guess strauss was strongly opposed to the distribution of isotopes in a purely political way basically taking the stance that distribution of isotopes would readily enable other countries to create a bomb and oppie basically mocked that position and made a fool out of him and strauss never forgave him they also butted heads on the necessity of an h bomb program",2023-07-21 14:43:30
the last scene was phenomenal,2023-07-22 01:56:49
anchoring us with the marbles in the fishbowls as to show how much more uraniumplutonium were required,2023-07-22 04:07:45
"1 christopher nolan shouldn’t be understated he gets thrown around on reddit a lot because he’s well accepted but he also has massmarket appeal like a range of “frat bro  middleaged dad”
2 because he is a fan favorite of a key demographic movie studios love to promote his films and this was no exception it was marketed hard 
3 70mm film releases not as mass appeal but it explains why any 70mm showing is sold out
4 dads like wwii movies 
5 barbenheimer i guess it’s certainly lead to some more traffic",2023-07-23 03:47:55
hype mostly  this movie got an a cinemascore which surprised me because i didt think this would vibe with a general audience but somehow it has  perhaps people just fed up of  superhero movies and wanted something different im not exactly sure why  for sure the barbenheimer meme has helped i think,2023-07-23 03:52:50
nolan is a brand like nike he has millions of loyal supporters additionally he’s the only filmmaker in hollywood to shoot 70mm imax thus when any of his films are released it’s a spectacle and people want to see that format finally this film coming out at the same time as barbie ignited an insane free publicity campaign,2023-07-23 03:56:56
"i honestly thinkbecause this is how i feel that audiences were starved for an intelligent well made film obviously the subject matter and it’s extremely tasteful and well done nolan perfectly highlighted parts of history without banging you over the head with any of it 

“you should feel sad here” 

none of that was there it was sharp and thought provoking beautiful and haunting",2023-07-23 04:41:24
a linear story wouldve been boring imo,2023-07-23 17:29:09
interstellar and inception are technically linear,2023-07-23 18:07:48
"i hated it

because for a biopic it doesnt really tell me much about his character his backstory what got him into physics why he was sympathetic to communism what his drives are etc i watched 3 hours about the guy and i still barely know him besides his involvement with the manhattan project some of his spicy but narratively unnecessary personal affairs and his legal troubles with the atomic energy commission after the war

for a documentary this is just a 3 hour long expositions upon expositions expositions about new characters new locations confusing time jumps between past and present constant nonstop fast cuts between scenes so much so that even emotional scenes lose their emotional impact because the audience isnt given time and room to feel the impact before it instantly jumps to another scene with more info expositions

i dare you to tell me you 75 understood and followed exactly who was who who did what and what actually was going on in the movie at all times on your first viewing

characters talk like they are in an epic or shakespearean play it sounds cool but that isnt how real people talk in real life and almost every scene is accompanied by an epic orchestra score even when its unearned or insignificant in the narrative nolan just wants every scene to feel overly epic and i think that has become a massive detriment to his films

there are some truly stellar scenes when they are actually given runtime but these are less than 10 of the entire film

i think nolan still hasnt learned from his mistakes from tenet and really dropped the ball on this one",2023-07-24 08:16:07
" the trinity test was slightly underwhelming visually

i think that was just being true to the source it was relatively small far away in the dark it wasnt the ginormous hydrogen bombs detonated in picturesque atolls on a sunny day",2023-07-24 22:25:49
he walked out then oppenheimer convinced him to stick around by letting him work on his hbomb theory,2023-08-14 00:50:54
i think topic of morality of nuclear weapons was the core focus of the film the security meeting and congressional hearing were mostly used as a means to deliver the plot,2023-07-21 04:37:48
totally agree the trinity test was a big let down for me visually a wide angle watching it detonate from a far rather than jumping to everyones reaction would have been a lot stronger of a visual the audio was on the spot at least i just felt the bomb was like 1100 the size of the actual event and lost almost all of its weight once you saw the cloud,2023-07-21 04:04:13
totally agree i’m not trying to  anyone off here but i think there are a lot of nolan stans in the sub rn found the movie well made but not incredibly entertaining found myself way more engaged watching the prestige and dark knight the third act was fine but the stakes didn’t really feel that high the bomb was dropped i didn’t really care that he was gonna lose his security clearance,2023-07-21 04:31:06
100 agree even the abomb detonation wasn’t exciting… not a good movie  too many characters to develop any fully why was emily blunts drinking highlighted so much but then nothing came of it,2023-07-21 03:21:28
agree on the explosion it was cool but was definitely overhyped,2023-07-21 05:35:07
"my brother the atomic explosion is not the point of the whole movie you are missing the point

edit actually seeing the video now how the  the scene is not a good portrayal of the explosion the scene is enough to be a good representation i can’t even imagine how that could be in real life absolutely terrifying",2023-07-21 03:37:22
wonder if it was your theaters sound system that was giving you problems because i thought the film was a triumph of sound design and didnt find any issues with the sound mixing but i guess take that with a grain of salt because i didnt have issues with  the mix of dunkirk or interstellar either,2023-07-22 16:42:53
to each their own but i walked away with a very different opinion,2023-07-22 16:05:23
"thank  someone else brought this up i thought i was the only one who thought nolans decision to focus so much energy and narrative runtime on something so arbitrary was sooffbase

like who  cares the title of the movie should have been

oppenheimer the quest for security clearance",2023-07-22 15:47:02
i think it was meant that way  to be less “cinematic” and epic but instead more contemplative abt how powerful this moment was not in the movie but in history and how that changed the  world,2023-07-24 05:47:12
the visual effects were definitely underwhelming i didnt know what i expected but it was definitely not that but the sound design is perfect watched it on imax  the whole theater was shaking,2023-07-24 06:44:58
idk i kinda liked not knowing whether we were going to hear it or not lol i was scared for a bit,2023-07-24 07:40:50
"1000  was just talking about that i was really hoping to see some crazy atomic almost surfaceofthesun type visuals and i got a  of an explosion

that was hella disappointing great movie but  that was a missed opp interstellar was visually stunning was hoping for a mindbending trip of an explosion 

also for some reason emily blunt did  to me too haha",2023-07-24 06:05:05
anybody thought the movie was underwhelming,2023-07-24 06:25:00
i was very underwhelmed,2023-07-24 06:48:33
"i agree with you that the film is too cumbersome i told my friend that if nolan wanted to cover so many of the minutiae of oppenheimer’s life they should have done so in a miniseries where his life could be have been better developed over the course of several hourlong episodes—though nolan doesn’t make miniseries so oh well 

but i actually found the boardroom and confirmation  session in the latter half of the film to be the most compelling the security clearance meant clearly more than just security clearance to all the people who were involved there seems to be this interesting dissonance between the terror and sheer significance of scientific revolution and the petty egocentric nature of our political process",2023-08-03 00:46:32
"if you know real life and history then you’d realize that premise doesn’t make sense though we beat the nazis by a long shot and they were out of the war before the bombs were even dropped 

if you want a race to the finish biopic go watch air on amazon prime good movie but not on the same planet as oppenheimer what we got was much better than that

and losing his security clearance means he will no longer have any say whatsoever in how his creation will be used which is a big deal for him if you payed attention to the  movie",2023-08-03 04:06:32
don’t know why you’re getting downvoted just got out of it a few hours ago and i agree with you on most of your points it is bloated could’ve lost 4550 minutes cillian murphy is phenomenal the middle of the movie is it’s strongest the test scene is a staple in nolan’s career and the ending is nolan’s best ending since the dark knight and inception it’s so impactful and haunting,2023-08-07 04:31:51
typical nolan cant get out of his own way is a good way to put it someone needs to tell him to not mess with the time stuff too much and he needs a better editor,2023-08-07 10:30:39
your last sentence kind of gives away that youre baiting,2023-11-25 14:59:54
i kept checking the clock to see when it would be over the trinity test was the only scene that i actually enjoyed,2023-12-10 16:14:32
why getting downvoted for sharing opinions about a movie this isnt a nolan or oppenheimer subreddit anyways totally misleading marketing only if we knew what it actually meant no cgi is used in the film offcourse not because its a courtroom drama film,2023-07-21 11:21:30
i was so  that i went to a movie about an atomic bomb and didnt see one single mushroom cloud explosion,2023-07-21 10:36:24
i’d agree on the lackluster explosion and i feel like nolan relying too much on practical effects is starting to affect my enjoyment of his movies dunkirk for one felt so empty when it shouldve been packed and i couldnt just ignore it,2023-07-21 10:12:29
oppmidheimer,2023-07-22 13:22:49
"agreed despite the downvotes the most interesting parts of the movie were the manhattan project scenes and the most moving were oppenheimer realizing the ramifications of his invention 

i really didnt care at all for any of the political theater and plotting and there were too many characters to keep track of",2023-07-22 05:11:14
"i think his earlier movies were his best interstellar is quite a cheesy love is the answer movie that forces emotion it does not deserve

this was brilliantly acted by cillian murphy emily blunts accent was distractingly atrocious and the movie reminded me that rdj can actually act

for some reason i find nolan increasingly gimmicky now his focus on hamfisted symbolism overwrought sound design and deviation from straightforward story progression  even when it adds nothing to the movie  is frankly boring

its a solid 5 for me would be a 65 if it was edited down i wish they had added more about the moral play and its impact on oppenheimer rather than looking at it from a largely clinical politicking angle

as with all nolan movies the moving parts are all there but there is no humanity and especially for a movie like this no attempt to explore the human condition",2023-07-22 04:22:21
definitely the hour in the conference room was arbitrary,2023-07-23 01:32:58
it was called oppenheimer not abomb,2023-08-04 22:34:04
it was interesting how nolan used the aide to just pull the rug out on him and that entire subplot altogether at the end  maybe they were talking about something more important than you,2023-07-21 03:10:43
"the significance of that scene was showing einstein was rejected by his own countrymen the political leadership particularly after all his hard work and achievements the same was done to oppenheimer

oppenheimer was an outspoken advocate for nuclear arms reduction and international cooperation and for being that was torn down and humiliated by militant advocates of arms proliferation i think you should feel bad for him

oppenheimer and strauss were at odds politically oppenheimer being a leftwing internationalist and strauss being a rightwing nationalist strauss was also a political creature who operates primarily in his own self interest where oppenheimer was naive to politics shown many times in the movie for his advocacy of leftwing groups and ideas despite the hostility of the establishment and was guided more by acting for the greater good

the last scene alden ehrenreichs character really demonstrates the difference between oppenheimer and strauss while strauss is shown obsessing with the idea that oppenheimer was conspiring against him ehrenreichs character bring up the idea which is shown to be true that what oppenheimer and einstein were discussing was in fact more important than petty politics",2023-07-21 04:17:26
he said he remembered the conversation about the bomb maybe destroying the world and oppenheimer says i think we did,2023-07-21 04:58:07
oh definitely the dialogue is impeccable especially the post trinity test sequences are unfiltered cinema gold,2023-07-21 14:56:59
my wife was confused and said that homework preparation would have been a good idea to consider before the cinema visit like theres a lot of characters and they are not introduced well enough for people who never heard about the manhattan project before,2023-07-21 20:54:36
except it is well documented that strauss singlehandedly set all the events in motion for oppenheimers security hearing including collaborating with j edgar hoover to dig up dirt for like a year before the hearing telling mccarthy to effectively stand down from pursuing any congressional investigations of oppenheimer and wiretapping oppenheimers conversations with his lawyer and giving the transcripts over to robb to help him prepare an effective attack,2023-07-21 21:45:14
its not paradoxical  a different administration gave oppenheimer the medal it was jfk who was also the noted vote against strauss appointment they had a different opinion of nuclear warfare and of oppenheimer than trumans administration did mccarthyism had also died down quite a bit by then,2023-07-21 21:55:28
strauss’ pov non black and white were oppenheimers pov,2023-07-21 23:44:56
indicate a different point in time all the bw scenes were strauss senate hearing which took place in 1958 4 years after the oppenheimer hearings,2023-07-21 23:35:53
nolan said this when interviewed by the associated press “i knew that i had two timelines that we were running in the film” he said “one is in colour and that’s oppenheimer’s subjective experience that’s the bulk of the film then the other is a black and white timeline it’s a more objective view of his story from a different character’s point of view”,2023-07-21 23:33:53
funny to see nolan criticized for being too left wing in this film when the dark knight has themes of government surveillance being a necessary evil and tdkrs class conflict definitely have a conservative edge,2023-07-22 19:00:41
i think nolan has his next biopic movie now,2023-07-23 01:31:19
yes so much,2023-07-23 03:04:41
"im surprised no one had said it but i interpreted as two main things 

it is putting you out to pasture it is a signal that your time as a leader in your space has come to an end no one gets the salmon and potato salad at the peak its always near the end it is not them praising you it is them announcing their emergence 

and with this its a sign that you no longer control what you innovated einstein lead physics was the leading mind but by that point had become overshadowed by oppenheimer he was the old man who enjoyed being by the lake similar to the bomb physics was going to stop being under oppenheimers control you can create ideas but once theyre out there theyre no longer yours and take s life of their own",2023-07-23 18:37:56
when they make amends with oppie and welcome him back it’ll be more for selfish reasons to assuage their own guiltcomplicity in the injustice they perpetrated on oppenheimer  rather than actually acknowledging and taking responsibility for what they did to him,2023-07-23 17:29:38
einstein is warning that the giver of the award will be virtue signalling and that an award given is intended to have a greater effect for the giver that the recipient,2023-07-23 18:11:11
giving oppie an award looks good for them they don’t care if this actually clears oppie’s name,2023-07-23 18:02:43
i think for some of them it will be a way for them to forgive themselves for stabbing him in the back for others they just want to be close to the genius so they can say they knew him,2023-07-23 17:27:52
she was absolutely trolling robb with that kitty knew no matter what she did strauss was going to get the aec to revoke oppie’s clearance so she was not going to continue the feckless charade her husband was doing and instead would call out the hearings for exactly what they were a closed door extrajudicial inquisition,2023-07-23 21:17:43
they were actually under the stands of a disused football stadium and they were showing opp the first ever sustained fission reaction,2023-07-24 11:37:24
first successful nuclear chain reaction,2023-07-24 11:35:19
chicago pile1,2023-07-24 13:22:33
teasing jfk like its a marvel movie ,2023-07-24 15:55:29
"agreed on the brutality i expected it to go into more detail of the aftermath as well 

rolled my eyes when i saw casey affleck 

the scene with his reaction to jeans death felt odd im not sure why it was too quick perhaps 

emily blunt at the board hearing was a real charming scene the level of wit was impressive

i wonder if they  purposefully made the actors look old or we are all just getting old that cant be it",2023-07-26 04:02:57
in the book apprarently people had different recollections of this scene kittys version even involves her coming in to condemn chavalier for suggesting it after learning about this i hope nolan could do multiple versions of it to show different perspectives it would be fun but too maybe too confusing and contradicts the purpose of the color scenes being oppies perspective,2023-07-27 06:48:47
wasn’t the entire movie tense,2023-07-27 05:55:52
the army discussing where to drop the bomb was such a fantastic cynical scene wish more attention would’ve been directed to this sort of stuff rather than so much security clearance time,2023-07-28 00:15:18
well people can rent a highquality version of barbie digitally already oppenheimer wont be available until late november thats where the availability generally comes from,2023-10-11 03:05:46
its because of nolan and his insistence that people do not watch his movies anywhere other than cinemas,2023-11-18 11:45:43
im with you so much talking with barely anything of interest the strausssecurity clearance plot line was such a drag the marketing made this movie look way more interesting than it turned out to be this movie was such a chore to finish i have no desire in revisiting it,2023-07-27 08:12:28
“why wasn’t this movie about what i wanted it to be about” it’s based on a biography anyway large chunks of the film touched on the morality and human tragedy of nukes you may have been napping,2023-07-26 19:31:24
kind of a weird statement seeing as i have seen virtually total critical acclaim lol  but i havent seen it yet so will see,2023-07-21 03:59:50
preproduction started in january 2022 and filming only took 57 days,2023-07-21 13:44:22
"you should prepare in advance familiarise yourself with the story and some people 

1 getting to know the characters in advance will add so much more to the experience of watching this movie",2023-07-21 16:09:13
" ithink you should be a film critic cause i love his review hilarious 


two points 

1 oppie likes her because shes this strong woman whos dedicated to the communist partytheir general idea of helping otherscommunist ideology its not exactly a clash of identities more like they appreciated each other for what the other represented shes rude to him cause he wont commit to the party wont officially join and that puts a strain of their relationship shes also independent so its on and off basically she wont commit to him romantically throws away flowers cause he wont commit to the ideology she lives by push and pull 

2 kitty suffered from post partum depression its evident if the way shes losing control with the kid screaming when he arrives home shes depressed and takes to alcohol 

the last paragraph ",2023-07-22 01:10:26
i came out of the movie feeling like the biggest idiot ever because i couldnt follow 70 of what was going on what were the character motivations besides the politics of the time eg matt damon turns up and before you can understand his character hes already shouting instructions to set up a lab town boring scenes with courtrooms indictments hearings etc i couldnt feel the emotional impact of the destructive repercussions of cuttingedge technology which i guess the film was trying to convey,2023-07-22 01:11:31
"they could have cut all of the romance and that would have saved at least 20 minutes for example it felt very self indulgent 

you cant cut the romance from a deep character study of a man whose romantic life was a prominent part of who he was cant cook dinner without a key ingredient just to save time",2023-07-22 01:37:09
oppenheimer was a womanizer he was also defended by the woman he cheated on better than he could himself that moment with kitty and robb wouldn’t have resonated as much as it did if you cut out the romances oppenheimer had,2023-07-22 02:06:41
gary oldman was in this,2023-07-22 03:35:03
we were all scammed into thinking we needed to see this in the imax watching that boring last half of meaningless endless dialogue didnt need to be on an imax,2023-07-22 03:59:35
yeah really not much point in imax for this most of the shots are of that cramped interrogation room,2023-07-22 04:39:32
yeah the whole thing felt like a recap of something that i kept waiting for to start,2023-07-22 08:31:14
yep  3 hours of exposition with no full stop,2023-07-22 08:54:57
"lol u were probably too tired or maybe you cant appreciate nonfiction filmsthe structure and timeline was well segmented and flowed well sequentially

wdym though by wanting to see more of the nuclear side of things like you want to see the nukes being used or some fictional depiction of a world where a fictional us used more nukes

also nolan is intentional af with his storyboarding and the final cut lmaothe color scenes are supposed to represent oppenheimers perspective and the black and white scenes are supposed to represent lewis strausss perspective

x200b

i mean i dont feel a connection persay to these historical rich white people but the history is interesting considering if any of these choices went differently the nazis russia or us could have destroyed us all before we had the opportunity of being born 

you also cant deny that everyone killed their rolesthe acting was top notch

this movie is awesome i dont like nonfiction stuff usually but nolan did sumn phenomenal w this",2023-07-22 08:30:44
"the movie shouldve focused only on the manhattan project not his early life and postwar political struggles its just spread too thin

you missed the entire point of the film",2023-07-23 14:13:49
post war stuff is what really made the movie come full circle though and powerful though i would’ve walked away with the much lesser opinion of it had it not,2023-07-23 13:56:58
thr post war stuff was basically the point of making the film though,2023-07-23 13:59:02
the atomic bomb didnt have a sound because well it didnt in reality the main sound was from the shockwave,2023-07-30 18:00:49
youre thinking they underplayed the explosion as an ethic thing to stop turning weapons into epic sights ,2023-07-30 17:40:36
"no explanations on the maths the figuring

come on now are you implying the moviegoers should get a lesson on quantum physics i actually liked the lack of mathematical reference because that would just take away from the storytelling",2023-08-01 06:32:26
thank you the structure of the film was my gripe the first act is jumping through time at a breakneck pace as well as hopping back and forth between past present and future for the entirety of the movie and you’re tasked with trying to keep up with like 30 characters i thought it was also way too long and had way too much going on,2023-08-07 04:50:09
"you nailed my two biggest problems the whole structure felt weird like a nonstop montage we never seem to spend more than 2 minutes on a scene before we’re catapulted into a different time period 

and yes with subtitles i would have followed the politics sooo much better",2023-08-07 03:01:28
100 he knows how to make a movie that is clear but does he know how to bring out human emotion id argue no even his more poignant work in interstellar and inception is clouded with this clinical coldness i just dont believe hese interested in anything that could bring out a strong emotional response,2023-08-07 13:53:39
the black and white scenes are from strauss’s perspective since he only sees things as binary there’s no consideration of anything besides what’s goodnot good for himself oppenheimer’s views are in color to symbolize his depth of vision he is seeing every aspect of the universe even down to an electron,2023-08-16 04:38:47
to me the future being in black and white was because those were the real dark times the past is in color because of the hope that they’re doing the right thing,2023-08-16 02:00:45
" cheating incident is recounted in the room of the hearing as a way of expressing how haunted kitty felt by the incident

i dont think this was what was being expressed more how she felt violated by it being paraded out in front of the panel which she pretty much states outright so less haunted by it happening and more disgusted by it being brought out into public view

i do understand the desire to keep cgi out of the detonation though theres obvious bits in the final moments but yeah the lack of the iconic mushroom cloud or more of the initial globular fireballshockwave did end up robbing the film of some pretty iconic imagery didnt even need to have a long shot maybe even use some of the actual footage given thats when it was being recorded",2023-08-16 20:08:57
"to your first point about the film being in blackandwhite for the future and color for the past is simply to illustrate that the past is where the story truly takes place and that’s what the film is about at least that’s my interpretation so representing it in full color makes sense because that’s the story nolan is telling it’s the main narrative 

the manhattan project is the story of the film but the effects of the manhattan project on the lives of those involved is a secondary plot so it takes a backseat 

even if time wise both parts are very long the heart of the film is the making of the bomb",2023-08-16 04:23:41
the music drove me absolutely bananas every single scene had the swelling dramatic score behind it even when the onscreen action was perfunctory the only time i got a break from it is when an actual nuclear bomb went off,2023-08-17 01:42:59
the black and white and colour is not meant to visualise time its meant to visualize oppies recollection of events monochrome is the objective sequence of events literally and figuratively the black and white records colour is used for oppies subjective experiences clouded by his judgements biases and limited pov colouring his perception my friend and i discussed this immediately after the film and agreed it was a good way to distinguish what really happened in the context of the film and what oppie perceived to have happened which was suitable for a trial i have a background in physics so hearing all the scientists names being dropped made me think oh yeah thats him rather than being confused but i understand most people could find it overwhelming to remember everyone as for the music i thought it was good and didnt feel too loud maybe because we were superfocused on the film no kidding everyone in my theatre was dead silent throughout the 3hour movie we were all gripped in fact it made the times when the music wasnt there like the delusion scene much more impactful,2023-08-19 09:42:34
"portrayal of women

thats odd that you felt that way because to me it showed exactly how women feel about affairs  some other woman touched her man pleasured him marked her territory so to speak  its burned into her mind and the other girl looking her in the eyes shows that age old resentment for the other girl  women never forget the other girl

to me this was a very realistic portrayal of this  it shouldnt be tasteful because cheating is not tasteful",2023-08-17 15:37:37
because the movie wasn’t about the bomb it was about oppenheimer,2023-07-22 02:36:09
overall i enjoyed the movie but the movie felt mile a minute and i was numb after the first hour of dialogue,2023-07-22 21:28:44
i found it a little hard to follow frankly  didnt help the dialogue seemed drowned out by the score,2023-07-22 21:28:18
not at all actually thought the 3 hours went by fairly quick enjoyed every minute,2023-07-22 21:39:08
"i respect your take and i noticed some of these issues as well particularly with sound always the case it seems with nolan but the dialogue for the kitty scene was taken word for word from the actual transcript if i recall correctly a lot of the dialogue was i believe

but yes this destroyer of worlds quote in bed was a bit much",2023-07-24 13:59:41
agreed i wanted the whole thing to slow down wish it would have focused less on cramming as many charactersactors into the movie as possible and made more room for interesting dialogue and actual character development the dialogue felt like nothing more than a vehicle to move the plot along entire scenes at times lasted no more than 10 seconds just to make a quick plot point wasnt my thing,2023-07-24 14:36:22
"also with the dialogue nolan has this thing where he wants to do a lot of iconic lines that are meant to feel smart and cool but the thing is he does this with every other  line of dialogue to the point where every conversation feels very unrealistic manufactured and corny and none of the cool sentences hit as hard he has the very same issue with the editing and score

hey oppie what time should we grab lunch

pulsing synth arpeggios

 oh we can always just eat when were hungry 



sir the vending machine in the rec room isnt accepting quarters our boys in nevada say itll only be working again thursday

what  thats going to ruin the day for a lot of men

ruin the week sir its only monday

screeching metal sounds",2023-07-24 16:02:36
i disagree with lots of your points but thats your opinion i cant and wont argue that but the portion about kitty testimony i could be wrong but i believe her testimony was taken verbatim from the actual transcript,2023-07-24 16:09:52
" seriously theres no way you guys saw rami malek read his script for 10 minutes and thought wow his character that i totally knew the name of blew it out of the water

believe it or not the security clearance hearing and the strauss confirmation hearing were pretty  big deals at the time  but yea this sort of  is mostly lost over time but ramis character did pretty well to serve the point of the science community backing him while having strauss getting his comeuppance   casey affleck was more of a random insert imo

i will agree lynchs trinity  on the best things ive ever seen and nolans pales in comparison i also love your take that the last hour was the best part as thats what im seeing getting dragged  i loved that ",2023-07-24 14:05:25
this vibes with my experience but i couldnt be arsed slamming on it anymore and getting downvoted into oblivion  the quick editing and time jumps and the odd score during normal conversations were the most jarring to me  i cant the trust the 1010 masterpiece nolan stans man theres just no arguing with those guys lol,2023-07-24 13:58:49
i disagree with a lot of what you said but you got me thinking… i don’t think there have been any great female characters in all of nolan’s movies,2023-07-24 15:41:41
i feel like nolans insistence on cramming the score into every corner of his movies has entered the realm of selfparody looking back i was wondering if there was ever a scene in some of his more recent movies where a character is quietly doing something on camera with no blasting noise in regards to this movie there are no quiet moments where we get to know the characters and become attached so the emotional beats didnt really land for me,2023-07-24 14:47:25
"to have such a great quote from great book reduced to a  scene is immature  such a typical westernizing thing to do

he did it to make it look grandiose to western audience

oooh look at this quote from this exotic book ooooh its from exotic culture oooh let’s forget the meaning  seriousness behind it  use it in a exotic way",2023-07-24 15:25:10
"ball my eyes out 

ouch",2023-07-21 15:45:34
i was literally just about to make a direct reply to the op about the focus thing that was so bizarre to me this was my second time watching a movie in a real imax theater the first being the recent mission impossible just a few days ago and i thought maybe it was more common and i just only noticed due to the increased fidelity but im now feeling a bit vindicated,2023-07-21 19:16:05
yes ive posted about how the close ups were out of focus peoples ears were the focal point during their lines such a shame,2023-07-21 18:07:36
agree editing was  at times but it really did shine in the trinity sequence  i thought to myself nolan is the master of suspense what a waste using his talent on courtroom drama,2023-07-21 17:48:07
my wife thought the opposite i had no trouble discerning the difference in time but i also had a pretty good understanding of the timeline prior to the movie she didnt know what time we were in and would have liked little numbers on the screen giving the dates,2023-07-23 20:18:37
you think thats wild imagine how surprised i was when josh peck walked on screen,2023-07-24 06:32:00
strauss storyline was too convoluted due to the non linear story telling for me,2023-07-28 00:19:14
"i got you

in the final scene oppenheimer asks  einstein if he remembers when oppenheimer showed him the calculations that the bomb could start a chain reaction and wipe out all life on the planet

einstein says yes what of it

oppenheimer i believe we did",2023-07-31 08:52:42
i wonder if a lot of those people were watching the movie because of the whole barbenheimer meme and had no idea what kind of movie it actually was if you were just going to see this movie because of the meme and then you realize that you’re about to sit through a 3 hour drama about a bunch of scientists i can see why you’d maybe leave lol,2023-08-06 19:57:59
i couldn’t believe he said that in the  scene lol,2023-07-28 04:33:15
i would not recommend interstellar based on this comment,2023-07-21 16:59:07
some of these directors become so big that they feel like every one of their movies has to be 25 hours at minimum and its really just so pretentious they think every scene they can possibly concoct is gold and the viewers will feel privileged to sit there and absorb their greatness so they dont mind if it takes all  day to watch that said i am looking forward to seeing this one but your comment has me tempering expectations but i pretty much guessed what you said would be the case when i saw it was 3  hours long,2023-07-21 17:11:46
appreciate your honesty is it worth paying for to see it on the big screen in hindsight,2023-07-21 18:28:54

"i agree with all of this but even if i didntits a perfectly reasonable take downvotes not deserved

another example of constant drama that you didnt mention  that scene in the interrogation where kitty at first seems timid but then rawr she bares her claws and best the interrogator

in isolation its an ok scene though it could have been developed more slowly and suspensefully but in the context of the larger film whats the point to show that kitty has grit ok butso she still cant change his rather irrelevant fate and it really doesnt reveal anything new about her we didnt necessarily know she was quick with words but we knew she was pretty assertive

its just a minidrama inserted within a drama that has no bearing on anything",2023-07-26 23:03:03

i gave it an 8 out of 10 it’s a strong film and a very good biopic cillian murphy and downey jr were great and there were nice surprises like josh hartnett who i thought was really good in his role this was one of damon’s better roles too and it was nice to see him in a military type role blunt being interrogated was a good part too other than his girlfriends communist ties it spent way too much time on his womanizing which wasn’t really important in the context of the film from trinity to the end it was a very intense movie the mixing and i’ve heard a few people say this was bad sound shouldn’t be so loud it’s draining out dialogue especially when it was the committee just arguing with him and you knew they were going to be against him to begin with i think the theme of an atomic bomb having no place in a modern world and killing so many everyday citizens needed to be hammered home more because that is the general sentiment of people nowadays nuclear power has the power to end civilization was too long too could’ve easily been like 21530,2023-07-27 00:45:53
lol how is this movie arthouse,2023-07-27 14:03:40
it wasnt arthouse  it was just nolan  he doesnt make arthouse films and it actually needed to be cold bc oppenheimer himself was considered to be as much the point of the movie isnt to be some biopiclike reveal of an inner character we dont normally see but to in some ways examine the legacy of this huge figure i think its okay if it wasnt for you it was definitely uncompromising in its intentions but i dont think looking for soul in a movie about j robert oppenheimer is setting yourself up for success as a viewer hahaha the guy has famously been called soulless,2023-07-27 15:46:46
"7 for me the nudity was completely unnecessary as was the artsy  at the beginning

having read american prometheus its obvious how the film was made by picking scenes but i disliked that the scenes picked were modified to give a wrong impression eg the apple scene",2023-07-27 08:19:21
you are not worthy,2023-07-27 20:56:14
yeah i think nolan tried to make it fast paced i suspect to appease our short attention spans and the nudity was pretty unnecessary,2023-07-27 08:16:01
least whats your nolan movie ranking,2023-07-22 08:06:22
" who finally got that call to be in a nolan film and was essentially relegated to two  scenes with little to no plot reasoning

besides like the other half dozen scenes of their meeting and early relationship and the fact that it was extremely relevant to the hearing to prove his continued affiliation with communists

were you on your phone for that bit or something",2023-07-22 09:16:17

well said thats how i felt about it,2023-07-21 12:03:27
technically it wasnt amazing if half the close ups had missed focus i cant believe an oscar contender wouldnt nail the focus,2023-07-22 02:09:07
thank you i admit that parts hit me emotionally but i mostly left the theater  that this wasn’t done more competently by a better director,2023-07-22 00:50:06
we must not have watched the same movie,2023-07-22 00:39:56
yup his most emotionally engaging movie is interstellar imo and he got clowned on that one,2023-07-22 00:54:41
“wasn’t a good movie at all” and “technically it’s amazing” what,2023-07-22 02:36:15
same here i liked parts of it but overall it felt like a very fast very loud wikiepedia article,2023-07-22 15:11:41
i dont think theres anything wrong with you people like different things and thats fine but calling it the most boring and uninteresting movie ever is a little too much it was an action movie without the traditional action scenes every scene was intense and i didnt feel bored a single minute of it this isnt me trying to be mean or anything but if you genuinely think that the dialogue meant absolutely nothing then idk you probably werent paying any attention they were going back and forth about the ramifications of the atomic bomb and the change in political landscape that would come with it the guilt that oppenheimer felt and the way he was labeled from war hero to maybe a treasonous commie would at least be good enough for the movie to not be the most boring movie ever,2023-07-22 15:07:00
more books less tiktok,2023-07-22 14:39:13
nothing’s wrong with you this movie  and was made for dumb people who think they’re smart,2023-07-22 15:13:53

i didn’t hate the movie though thought it was a solid 710 or at best 810 but disappointed as i love nolan and expect better from him",2023-08-04 11:35:02
the last hour felt like a completely different movie and not in a good way,2023-07-25 05:51:08
keep in mind einstein was way behind modern nuclear physics and probably wasn’t up to date on the hydrogen bomb oppenheimer might have just told him for the first time that these weapons will proliferate and be planet killers instead of city destroyers,2023-07-25 03:51:03

"i swear emily blunts character was the only one that was 2d oppenheimer boiled down to im just doing my job here but i feel really really bad about it everyone else was forgettable

everyone brings up isnt it so  how little of a reaction most characters had to the mass killings the real horror is how quickly they moved on but nolan didnt care enough to even attempt to develop this within this movie it was effectively a victimless crime 

the most we see him try is by having oppenheimer picture the gymnasium crowd as explosion victims and stepping on that charred baby  but this is neutered by emily blunts correct you dont get to sin and then expect us to feel all sorry for you line",2023-07-26 08:11:52
"wanted to get my thoughts down too

nolan is my favorite active director he has a half dozen five star movies in my book a legend in his own time however i walked out of tenet i found it incomprehensible and just didnt care to watch the last twenty minutes

maybe it was high expectations or the worldchanging source material but i left disappointed it was beautifully shot acted and scored but the movies structure was needlessly convoluted and groaned under the weight of its runtime 

i can understand beginning with the hearings red scare hysteria corrupted the us government and led to the ruination of many great men but the back and forth took a good story and made it difficult to follow for someone without any familiarity with the subject a normal linear narrative would have made it clearer that the us was first to develop the bomb because of oppenheimers prodigious abilities only to betray him a few short years later its as if nolan thinks linear stories are boring and presumes his audience agrees or maybe he doesnt care either way it was a bit tedious 

and the bigger problem was the length i dont have a problem with a 3 hr movie but there needs to be cohesion maybe its sacrilege to say but this probably would have been better as a limited series once the movies focus recentered on the 1950s and there was still 45 minutes left i knew we were in trouble this is somewhat amazing considering the first hour covered ground and introduced characters with breakneck speed

unpopular opinions probably maybe even unfair im looking forward to watching it at home and hopefully enjoying it more but i thought the movie was kind of a drag",2023-08-01 14:18:58
"i agree as well i am a nolan fanboy as well and i am a physics student i was looking forward to this movie hard 

the production value music and acting is absolutely top notch 

but the writing is so bad and boring  it seems so full of text that doesnt have any substance it is like half of the text and scenes are completely unnecessary the movie couldve been easily a 15 hour movie 

its just a biopic of a guy made in a confusing way where the guy is interesting but not interesting enough for a movie of more than 3 hours there are dozens more interesting physics persons in history also they made einstein an awful caricature of himself that was a crime

i also think they wasted a really important opportunity to show the atom bomb droppings and the horrors the japanese people had to endure there was nothing shown about the japanese suffering only hinted maybe it was a deliberate choice but i think it was chosen badly or the us government didnt want it included or whatever",2023-07-30 06:02:27
it was such a terrible movie it shouldnt even get a 2  10,2023-07-21 12:04:49
i wanted more technical and science stuff too apollo 11 is one of the best movies i have seen in recent years and while it was a documentary with no narration i think that sort of focus on technical detail would have worked great in this film too,2023-07-21 20:58:22
saw it a couple hours ago and thought i was having an identity crisis  everything i’ve read albeit minimal as possible to not give it away said it was a perfect movie  i walked out feeling underwhelmed and thought i might just have lost my passion for movies…,2023-07-21 22:49:18
what 30 mins would you cut,2023-07-22 01:58:08
wouldve felt super rushed to me this movie had 0 filler unless youre talking about completely taking out certain plots,2023-07-22 01:49:24
"i was not expecting all of the politicaltrial parts that took place after the war it would have been a better movie if instead of showing all of the post war drama it instead extended the process of recruiting scientists and discussing the building of the bomb maybe end the movie with them discussing the immediate effects of the bomb in regards to the soviet union

i didnt know who 90 of the characters were nor why they were important they breifly mentioned klaus fuchs in one scene then promptly revealed a scene or two later that he was a spy it would have been nice to actually meet the character before dropping that bomb on us to give us some gravity of the situation",2023-07-23 08:35:46
i expected to see at least the planes carrying the bomb and seeing a bit just before the bomb hits the ground in japan i mean the build up a whole sequence and we didn’t get to see it wasted potential,2023-07-23 08:10:50
"id like offer a few points politely in response to this

1 trailers are made to show exciting moments in a film i can almost guarantee that nolan had no involvement in the trailer itself as those get put together by the marketing department and usually a third party company who specialises in making trailers so watching a trailer and thinking oh i see what this director is going to be doing with this move is a bit silly this is a nolan biopic film not fast  furious 10 where youve seen the trailer means youve basically seen the film

2 this is a biopic about a scientist we werent going to be watching 3 hours of exploding bombs im also not surprised we didnt see the actual bomb being dropped this is about a persons life and like most people its not full of action and surprises its people talking in rooms

3 this is a nolan film even his more action filled movies like the dark knight films and inception for example include a lot of dialogue there are whole scenes in the dark knight films where characters explain why they are doing things what their philosophy is et cetera inception has some of the best action set pieces in nolans filmography and yet whole chunks of the film are exposition and characters dialoguing

4 the actual trailer you link to also includes many scenes of various poeple talking",2023-07-23 10:59:11
well it’s a biopic about a physicist considered one of the brightest minds so the dialogueheavy part shouldn’t be too much of a surprise  and we already know his workthe project so the political component of the movie also shouldn’t be a surprise if you didn’t know the details of the accusations against him i can see how there is a bit of a surprise there did you expect an action scene though he was a real person not an avenger lol,2023-07-23 07:53:38
because the film is about oppenheimer so it’s going to tell you about his life and not just randomly cut off after the bomb because a lot things happened after it,2023-07-23 12:23:32
"it needed a better writer

oppenheimer is just chernobyl best for beat with a worse writing team and sadly a worse medium",2023-07-23 07:52:33
" with a million 20 second cuts 

thats just his trait though isnt it  usually with someone talking over the cuts

"it’s also a factual and pointed attack on just how paranoid and authoritarian postww2 us was

that pulling back of the nostalgia curtain is tough when that’s the period you want to “make great again”",2023-07-23 16:54:17
this comment section makes it painfully obvious how so many people just wanted a story about the case on his security clearance when the movie is literally called oppenheimer and should be about his entire life not just the case his life didn’t start in a court room so why should a film about his life im glad they showed us stuff like his motivations for becoming a physicist and what in his childhood took him down that path oh wait,2023-07-23 16:44:54
yeah yeah theres a lot of action junkies out there that wanted this to be hurr durr big explosions instead of telling the actual story of a complicated historical figure theres always the transformers movies if thats all you care about,2023-07-23 16:42:04

he always shoves more  in there than the movie can lift",2023-08-14 07:25:17
i just thought it was too dialogue heavy and frenetic for the first hour or two  i had heard it may be akin to the social network like that but the social network is rivetting and engaging cinema  i didn’t feel that way with oppenheimer,2023-07-26 04:47:46
"i agree entirely i wanted to like it but i left disappointed its not a bad film by any means but i feel like its a missed opportunity for a great film it had simply phenomenal cinematography and acting but the editing and storytelling were subpar and downright confusing at times and the use of alisters gave away the plot in their importance it left no mystery or nuance on what side character might have a surprising role later on 

also there are too many callback references it almost became comedic at how often that occurred and i really disliked how we see the horror of what the abomb means mainly through cillian murphys acting i fee like they should have shown some of the horrors so that we could feel it too and not just seem him react it left you sympathetic to what he went through but not actually feeling it yourself it was almost shallow since we actually know what the horrors were

and the pacing was terrible it felt like they tried to cram a 5 hour movie into 3 hours it was painful to endure the part i enjoyed the most was in the second act with the lets build our team phase where they took committed more time to a specific part of the plot to really let that story unfold more organically that and the very ending with the reveal of oppenheimers and einsteins conversation  those were both done very well",2023-07-27 03:29:02
what struck me most and likely contributes to a lot of my personal problems with it is the book its based on american prometheus is fantastic if youre interested in actually learning about oppenheimer id highly recommend it,2023-07-26 02:29:08
"oppenheimer losing his security clearance matters because  
1 without security clearance oppenheimer is limited in his ability to affect policy with government officials  he cant attend certain meetings    
2 it shows how science is always mixed with politics  science is not pure the way citizens like to sometimes imagine  
3 it shows how polarized the two sides are  the side that wants militarynuclear strength will do anything to win against the side that wants militarynuclear peace agreements  theyll even use false accusations of disloyalty and break proper process  decorum",2023-08-03 11:01:13
people can differ here but my take was a gradual shifting of how one controls a big idea andor how one affects change through their field or area of impact i thought it was well rendered the film starts off with oppenheimer gaining more impact and control over his field but there are clear places where he has to compromise by the end he has been completely consumed by the vindictiveness of a politician and his impact has been collapsed i thought it was interesting and effective in making this point again though everyone can have different opinions,2023-08-03 19:57:38
"i mean theyre completely different kinds of movies no country for old men is about chaos and the uncaringrandom nature of life how things change in an instant its got almost no music to help represent the almost uneventfulness of its story things like this happen every day and life marches on

oppenheimer is about the creation of the most powerful weapon in the history of the world and one man trying to justify its creation within himself and the heavy score represents that conflictthe extreme significance of the story

they honestly couldnt be more different",2023-08-03 19:04:37
"  no one cares if oppenheimer loses his security clearance why are we on this for the literally over an hour to end the movie

this act is not about the security clearance its about defining the person this entire movie is a character study of if you went into the movie mistakenly thinking it was a historical drama about the making of the abomb i can understand your disappointment but thats not what the movie is",2023-08-03 10:57:29
yeah matt damon was good but its matt damon really takes you out of it and made too many of his scenes feel like a joke,2023-07-22 19:44:07
yeah it was a little distracting,2023-07-22 18:46:45
i disagree i think rdj was the most distracting character one of the first few scenes i thought i was watching tony stark and i havent even watched avengers by the end he was fantastic though,2023-07-22 19:24:02
that part was definitely incredible the hour long section after the long meetings over his communist links were incredibly boring and needed to be edited,2023-07-22 19:28:45
he keeps making movies without addressing any of his flaws lack of character development exposition dumps inconclusive scenes randomness feeling and sound mixing where the score overpowers the dialogue,2023-07-25 19:46:27
feynman bro feynman,2023-07-27 02:29:27
crazy to think oppenheimer was the fool in the truman part where truman was made to be cartoonishly evil also he was very decidedly immediately cut off and thrown away after making the bomb not kept around past his usefulness he was practically handpicked because the communist angle made him controllable and disposable,2023-08-21 12:41:54
it didnt make me feel like i should care about strauss and oppenheimer i didnt feel invested in the story of which anyway i had no prior knowledge or interest in,2023-07-21 10:25:26
its interesting how the movie basically dismissed its own subplot as pointless when the aide was like maybe they were talking about something more important than you,2023-07-21 03:12:36
"it was dry i agree for me it didnt pick up until after the explosion honestly

if youve ever seen hbos chernobyl it felt like that but on a much lower level nowhere near as gripping or exciting i think even the old geezer who said cut all the phone lines was at the security meeting too lol",2023-07-21 09:49:05
i feel the same way this movie was made overcomplicated for no reason other than nolan thinks hes very clever to juggle multiple timelines myself i like to be told a coherent story nolan was the wrong guy to tell oppenheimers story he tried to turn a fascinating biography of an important person into an action movie and used those sensibilities and aesthetics because thats what he does,2023-07-22 17:59:54
"a few things

1	⁠the money shot in my opinion is the speech after the bomb drops in japan  artistically i found this to be one of the most interesting scenes i’ve ever seen in theaters
2	⁠i think in general you’re right the general public will not “love” this movie because of its complexity and difficulty paying attention to a dialogue heavy film for 3 hours

i snuck in a flask during the movie and i swear having a little bit of whisky in my system allowed me to be incredibly focused on only the dialogue and nothing else happening around me

this movie requires that you be 100 focused and it is unforgiving in that the irony is that it’s best viewed with an insane sound system but you  near need an intermission in the middle of the film

i think critically this will receive a mountain of well deserved praise but the public will push back for the exact reasons you describe above

i personally loved it but i understand your points as well

i want to mention that what this really is attempting  is to be two movies tied into one

because that’s the point right there is a world before the nuclear bomb there is a world after the nuclear bomb

there is a movie before the nuclear bomb there is a movie after the nuclear bomb",2023-07-22 16:33:43
extremely over engineered movie thats it i think thats the perfect way to describe it so  overengineered that it makes you feel exhausted at the end of it whatever the payoff,2023-07-22 16:24:35
i didn’t think it was that hard to follow i missed some dialogue because i’m bad at hearing accents but in terms of what each scene was meant to convey and who wanted what it was pretty straightforward,2023-07-22 19:36:12
bingo my exact thoughts it’s overly complicated which muddles the story and robs it’s emotional beats i don’t agree in the dialogue lots of movies are dialogue heavy but the dialogue has to be engaging think any qt movie or sorkin social network has a similar structure as oppenheimer but it was laser focused,2023-07-22 16:31:03
nolan always plays with time when presenting his movies did you not expect this the black and white scenes represent strauss point of view the colour represents oppenheimer i thought it was easily understood tbh it flicked back n forth between the creation of the bomb strauss downfall and oppenheimer losing his clearance and subsequently any influence over the use of his bomb moving forward,2023-07-22 16:55:58
thank you you put my thoughts into words better than i was able to i pretty much agree with you on everything and the fact that so many are calling this one of the best movies of all time baffles me,2023-07-22 16:25:54
"trinity was underwhelming for me looked like any good hollywood explosion i was expecting something more creative 



can already hear the what were you expecting a real nuke",2023-07-24 21:08:41
"they spent less than 10 seconds on developing anyones actual character 

i was connected to none of them",2023-07-25 22:30:05
yeah this is how i feel too so many characters were introduced so quickly i kinda gave up halfway through attempting to remember who everyone was,2023-07-24 12:01:53
same i dont understand why you were downvoted,2023-07-24 14:12:22
its so dumb because the movie was so fast paced and they skipped so many things but it also felt so slow it was moving so fast that i could barely keep up but it was also unnecessarily slow i dont know what why or how they did that,2023-07-27 02:16:16
second this big time three hours of lots of grey haired dudes whose names i couldn’t keep track of visually amazing but the story didn’t need three hours,2023-07-27 01:46:08
why people are downvoting you,2023-07-21 18:50:58
"yes thats exactly how it felt the pacing was so fast that scenes had so little room to breathe and it was jarring or even laughable sometimes when he comes home to find his wife  and upset about their crying child and literally the next scene hes giving the baby away   

personally i loved it though",2023-07-22 07:43:21
im of the same mind every scene felt unfinished was that intentional maybe but it didnt add any tension it just made me confused i love nolan and i was on the edge of my seat with dunkirk memento is one of my alltime favorite films maybe i just need to see this one again i really didnt think id be this disappointed,2023-07-22 06:40:39
me too why so much focus on the courtroom and conference room stuff why tell people that they must must see this on the biggest screen humanly possibly,2023-07-22 06:53:29
trailer and marketing was 100 deceptive a lot of money was thrown at marketing for this movie and they did anything they could to get their money back claims that it needs to be seen in the imax after seeing it nope not this film i definitely felt a little scammed,2023-07-22 19:30:45

"reads book that movie is based on
movie is like book
surprised pikachu face",2023-07-23 03:25:10
it’s true don’t listen to the people saying otherwise because even if you watch this in regular you’ll get the same experience this is was good biopic but not another interstellar which was definitely worth watching in imax,2023-07-23 07:11:29
what was absurd about it,2023-07-23 06:42:44
"i absolutely loved the movie but i didn’t see it in imax and i would say that of the 21 other movies i’ve seen at the cinema this year there was one that gave me less of a sense of “i wish i’d seen that on a bigger screen”

i’m delighted i saw it asap rather than waiting but this would have lost nothing if i streamed it at home",2023-07-23 08:07:22
" this was the most unimpressive movie ive ever watched in imax and ive seen a lot

lol i get feeling embarrassed because you let other people dictate your method of viewing and blaming anyone but yourself for that however that is some impressive memory holing of that whole period where the industry was doing imax 3d there are dozens if not more worse movies that have existed in my lifetime in imax

you just played yourself my guy deal with it",2023-07-23 06:51:14
did you like close your  eyes and plug your ears during the movie,2023-07-23 06:44:55
imax gives you more picture and perhaps better sound but both are unnecessary to enjoy this movie,2023-07-23 09:23:21
i imagine its mostly the score driving that sentiment i saw it in a normal theater and enjoyed it just fine,2023-07-23 12:24:06
"yeah sometimes it works but idk i feel like this would’ve been better off as a linear narrative 

almost seems like they had to do it cause otherwise you’d have 2 hours of movie left after trinity",2023-08-02 12:19:19
it was smart we didn’t in an odd way felt it would have glorified it it allowed people to go to the images they have seen and the worst ones at that someone on the way out actually complained they didn’t see those images clearly missed the purpose of the film,2023-07-21 03:52:59
you do not see that no,2023-07-21 03:31:54
"the plot really centers on the perspectives oppenheimer and strauss

the film does not depict the perspectives of the nazis japanese or soviets at all",2023-07-21 04:03:49
nah you are right the sound mixing with nolan is garbage,2023-07-21 15:46:25
is it weird i think hollywood needs more nudity  this wasnt really gratuitous  seems prudish to complain about a couple of breastsbetween paramours,2023-07-22 04:09:51
the book that the movie was based off follows a similar sequence the book was about oppenheimer and his “downfall” not the manhattan project,2023-07-22 04:07:27
definitely nolan’s style similar in a way to malick’s but a bit more relentless like an extended montage it works for some doesn’t for others,2023-07-23 01:34:05
personally i got overhyped by the trailers expecting a more edge of your seat extremely suspenseful thriller type of movie when really its a talky drama about interpersonal relationships and attempts to find communist ties oppenheimer had to tarnish his reputation i think if you go into it expecting a talky yet stylishly made biographical film about a complicated protagonist whose invention changed the world we live in and the subsequent attempts to smear his name then you might get more enjoyment out of it,2023-07-28 00:22:11
strauss was nominated to be commerce secretary in eisenhowers second term this was about four years after oppenheimers security clearance was revoked,2023-08-05 13:20:55
this movie could have benefitted from some date markers on screen,2023-08-05 13:48:17
"trying to get a spot in eisenhowers cabinet secretary of commerce iirc he was denied in the end 

i missed it on first watch too haha theres a lot going on in the film",2023-08-05 09:54:31
not only did nolan not really make this clear he also didn’t tell us why we should care about it that entire plot line was pointless and took up an hour of the movie although hard to tell with all the  time skips,2023-08-06 04:56:42
lol nolan writes a super dialogueheavy movie and just rushes everyone through their lines it’s like trying to watch a  just for the story,2023-07-21 12:44:12
out of a 3 hour long film this is what you take home,2023-07-21 13:03:25
yeah the whole hearing part felt like an epilogue to the main bomb plot,2023-07-21 18:17:21
its relevant because it paints a portrait of a man who is almost on horseblinds consumed by the mission he is tasked with while being totally unaware of what his own emotional response would be until his creation is out in the world funnily enough his creation sparks a series of chain reaction of more bombs bigger bombs  quite the opposite of what he intended thats the real conflict the guilt and turmoil that the consequences of his actions seem to bring him the story is brilliantly told almost spiritual in its depiction the security clearance bit is just a smokescreen for how the world we lived in or rather still do functions and how even geniuses like oppenheimer are but disposable material for people in positions of real power lot more to chew on but this is the limited gist of my interpretation at the moment,2023-07-21 15:30:03
it’s very well explains on his wikipedia page under security hearing,2023-07-21 15:37:37
the last act with strauss is literally oppenheimer dealing with the aftermath of what he created,2023-07-22 01:11:24
how do you tell the story of prometheus without showing his punishment,2023-07-30 00:07:58
"i actually agree with you in that i wish they focused more on the moral quandaries faced by geniuses in science i think many before oppenheimer struggled with this too think haber process a jewish chemist who created a chemical process to cure famine then germany asked him to create chlorine gas in ww1 he did  used that haber’s creation in gas chambers during ww2 haber’s wife ended up killing herself as a result 

it’s really crazy actually the moral questions scientists reckon with",2023-07-30 00:47:30
"for instance“i read your paper on molecules” really molecules i would have preferred if it felt more like we really watching real scientists and not soap opera characters

they were referring to the bornoppenheimer approximation published in 1927  its literally a paper on molecules the paper is titled on the quantum theory of molecules  jean baptiste perrin had only received the nobel for proving molecules exist the year before its easy to miss just how much science that seems basic to us advanced in the late 19th to mid 20th century",2023-07-31 09:02:14
"definitely agree about the melodrama during some parts of the movies   
the beginning was definitely a bit unreal  


but there is that whole dark academia aesthetic that i always enjoy seeing in media even if it involves a tortured genius throwing glass in the corner of the room",2023-07-31 04:15:12
"


i feel like i need to rewatch every nolan movie at home with subtitles to determine my opinion of it and this one

this is exactly how i felt when i walked out i enjoyed the film but really feel i need a second viewing in the comfort of my home to really and truly take it in",2023-07-21 10:00:59
also oppenheimer by all accounts wasunlikable in the classroom his students created a petition to get him to shut up,2023-07-22 23:31:45
but there were also parts i recognized as accurate like what truman said during and after that oval office meeting,2023-07-23 00:01:53
i still dont think its a masterpiece or anywhere near his best work it was a very ambitious film but is heavily flawed i loved oppenheimer though definitely is top 3 nolan and a towering achievement in film,2023-07-27 14:59:30
it is funny how people ripped on interstellar i agree personally that film had a profound impact on myself as a young 24 year old pursuing science at the highest level possible in my field at the time,2023-07-27 15:51:57
"i think they touched on his personal life beyond character development because the government scrutinized his personal life during the security hearings they brought up his associations with communism his love affair and his very own character 

it seemed appropriate to provide some context to his story before and after his time at los alamos",2023-07-27 23:33:50
"i thought the nonlinearity did a good job of creating the feeling that a man regretting his life would feel how the decisions that led him to become the compromised man he was feel like a jumbled blur 

as for oppenheimers personal life theres an important parallel with his professional life in how he fails to see how his actions hurt other people until its too late",2023-07-28 08:23:00
"oh a word for casey affleck dude  scared me a type of guy whod  you  everyone in your home  call it tuesday

too smart to talk about politics is an odd take considering their actual political affiliations especially einsteins rather they just didnt consider him important,2023-07-29 18:22:47
i think its hard to understand the spirit of the times the communists in russia had made it plain and clear that the russian revolution was just the beginning for them communism didnt make sense in russia alone but needed to take over the world through an organisation called the comintern moscow  stalin was controlling the worlds communist parties so imagine that having a bunch of guys inside your country who are politically loyal to another im a time of heightened tension after wwii that was simply not on and the americans and many other countries around the world cracked down  them it was simply too much of a risk to not have them under control,2023-07-30 19:02:24
the tldr is that it originated in the late 1800s with labor unions threatening the profits of robber barons but then combined with postww2 tensions a booming american militaryacademicindustrial complex thanks to that same war the ussr having their own nuclear arsenal and their abysmal attempt at and glorification of communism they made the perfect postwar bogeyman for protecting the new status quo weve never really recovered honestly the mac is just as powerful as ever which is why america is generally in a constant state of war of some kind,2023-07-30 21:43:52
i liked how they killed the sound kinda like the star destroyer explosion in the last jedi but the explosion itself was like whatever,2023-07-22 08:54:32
its because nolan decided to do it through the scientifically accurate way this is how it would look like irl,2023-07-22 08:38:20
youve summed up my feelings better than i could have articulated rdj was phenomenal but his whole arc seemed to stray from the overall narrative like alden says at the end paraphrasing its not about you,2023-07-22 20:38:49
i have to agree it was just all exposition the whole thing start to finish was just characters explaining what they were doing at that moment it felt like a movie full of robots,2023-07-22 05:05:30
i loved the film interesting points you bring up though i wouldn’t say the  scenes were unimportant especially one that was very important for getting inside of oppenheimers head also he ran out of the bunker to get a better view that’s it it also really reminded me of uncut gems and i think that was a great choice personally to focus on the anxiety of the time period and the character and to show it through the editing sound mixing and score,2023-07-23 01:43:18
"i thought the pacing was great it doesnt lend itself to a lazy viewer thats for sure ive been waiting for a movie that forces you to focus

not even a thriller i watched it yesterday and felt that the pacing was so weird for the first half it was so rushed i felt no urgency or tension that the movie was trying to communicate until the trinity test agree with you that it was very unfocused and there was no breathing room between the scenes or even during those  it was constant dialogue most of which felt like one liners not even quotable ones followed by a montage and same again i appreciate that the writing team tried to portray the historical events somewhat faithfully and the involvement of various giants whose collective work lead to humans splitting the atom it was such a rush i got flashbacks to my highschool chemistry and physics books however this movie should have easily been split into 2 parts perhaps 2 or even 25 hours each to cover the significance of events that were portrayed the historical background the society at the time and the various physics chemistry and ideological concepts even people that were mentioned for what felt like namesake dare i say death of stalin was more engaging despite being a farce and a stage play being shown on a screen in terms of its historical contenti didnt watch tenet but i think nolans work has gone downhill in terms of quality post inception interstellar was very captivating but it also wasnt convincing enough in terms of the emotions it was trying to portray dunkirk was a pure audiovisual feast only meant to be watched at a theatre it falls flat during a rewatch in a living room i think nolan should try working with a writer and perhaps get lee smith back for editing what a waste of an ensemble cast that nobody else could put together and cillian especially wasted visually spectacular as is nolans signature but an unconvincing adaption of the biography perhaps due to its pacing  i wouldve loved for it to be a 2 part film or a bbcesque mini series spanning 6 our even 8 hours,2023-08-05 20:08:56
disagree about murphy i thought he was fantastic in this given that most of his dialogue is exposition  i did think the movie was average and masturbatory  full of nolans most annoying traits,2023-07-22 15:36:59
 yes you couldnt have put it better and it was so fast and rushed and i literally missed half the dialogue,2023-07-28 04:15:47

i think the whole imax 70 thing is marketing and it seems to have paid off im glad it did 

as a side note im voting for nolan to direct the next bond movie would be phenomenal",2023-07-23 16:42:02
personally i think nolan is overhyped in general lol everyone has memento or batman goggles on,2023-07-23 17:03:35
the only clear storyline was that kitty was  and they even overplayed that,2023-07-24 19:29:41
100 agree the endless music playing on 90 of the scenes was so exhausting,2023-07-25 02:00:30
tbh i thought itd be more powerful now i am become death destroyer of worlds i dont think my emotions changed once during this movie just neutral,2023-07-31 03:43:06
i think it’s his best and most human movie by a wide margin,2023-08-19 23:25:34
pretty much summed up my thoughts haha i did like matt damon though,2023-07-21 15:21:16
well it is biographical oppenheimer wasn’t on the enola ,2023-07-21 20:18:49
oppenheimer would never have seen the nukes he learned of their use through the truman radio broadcast the film reflects his worst fears as opposed to actual events it is a movie about him not the bombings,2023-07-21 20:24:20
oppenheimers sudden remorse for it all was very swift one moment his like yeah science later that evening  what have i done,2023-07-21 19:59:25
"fantastic analysisreview

ive been feeling it for a while that either nolan dumbs down the dialogues or he makes them so complicated that you need multiple watches he hasnt been able to find that balance 

oh i wish the movie was called the manhattan project imagine how well the whole cast could have been used in equal measure after watching chernobyl i wanted a hbo max series on the tmp 

for me this was a good movie like my money or tickets werent wasted but it left a lot to be desired",2023-07-22 00:01:27
i was very disappointed with the bomb scene as well there was no good sense of scale which would have been easy to achieve perfectly with modern technology and likely be less expensive than whatever method they ended up using the only positive effect of not using digital effects was that it made for good marketing,2023-07-25 04:13:58
"thank you for this comment i wont go as low as 410 because to me that is obscenely low but i just arrived at this thread expecting everyone to be slobbing over it with perfect 10s that its refreshing to see this so soon

theres a lot of talk about the actual nuke footage being more akin to a big  than the actual atomic bomb but to me that is just small detail because despite that the actual scene is very good imo its just the rest of the movie isnt its confusing doesnt really pull you in for oppie like you said not to mention an ear  movie as usual with nolan in some other thread i saw someone say that the explosion was the greatest moment he had seen in his lifemovie history and i was baffled did we even see the same movie

i know i was happy that i didnt pay extra to see this in imax its quite expensive where i live because the only it would have been good for would have been the nuke that was so lackluster the rest is a confusing mess of out of context andor unimportant conversations and i put  in unimportant because they are indeed very important conversations the movie just portrays them so quickly after the other and without any coherent flow that as an audience you just stop caring",2023-07-25 08:16:21
well said,2023-07-25 07:40:17
"i think i personally like the movie  maybe you didnt

this movie was not good none of the drama was compelling even after three hours of watching this tripe i didnt feel like i knew or understood any of these characters on a deep or familiar level

it wasnt a drama  it was facts  clearly  plainly presented you need context  a lot of it to understand what actually happened 

the movie barely even tries to make the audience connect with oppenheimer oppenheimers sympathies with the communist party are barely explored oppenheimers romantic relationships are barely explored oppenheimers attempt to poison his professor is glossed over oppenheimers guilt over the nuke is used to bludgeon the audience over the head but not in a way that actually teaches anybody anything i know he feels remorse but in real life remorse tends to be a nuanced emotion oppenheimers remorse is presented to the audience in the form of ear  and unexpected nudity

oppenheimer never had connections with communist party  when the president of us realized the backlash he was going to get after the bomb was dropped  all the group of scientists stood against the govt you need context for this too  how the german scientists ended up in us  what the nazis motives were  why the bomb was dropped  other plans  etc  he was just painted as a communist yes  oppenheimer did have lots of nefarious relationships not to mention his guilt made him chainsmoke himself to death

oppenheimers remorse required far more depth  understanding i dont know what you expected from it 

when truman called oppenheimer a crybaby i shouldve been outraged instead i was like yo this dudes got a point this wouldve been impossible had nolan actually given me any reason to connect with oppenheimers character

it was a biopic from the pov of oppenheimer himself  scenes   stuff like that was largely not required  because it wasnt a drama  it was just a clear visual representation between the bomb  its creator

you need context  a lot of it maybe its not something that most people can connect to on a regular basis  but hey  not everyone gets to meet nuclear weapon scientists  engineers on a regular basis",2023-07-25 08:38:17
nuh uh,2023-07-25 07:28:37
was the line not youre not just selfimportant youre actually important,2023-07-25 10:23:23
i have the exact feeling about the romances needed a bit more time to be fleshed out,2023-07-26 03:44:25
" it was already obvious he was going to say that

thats the point the moment the analogy comes back up you get it because the film shows the origin of the nuclear arms race chain reaction


 nolans batman banter type of humor didnt really fit

very subjective but i liked the dark humor in kyoto being spared and matt damon joking about killing a quitter

the first hearing is about oppenheimer being denied his access renewal its a kangaroo court orchestrated by strauss to character assassinate oppenheimer because he felt slighted

the second hearing is about strauss being promoted in the atomic energy commission which he gets denied",2023-07-26 00:01:07
saw an interview where nolan said that the point of presenting a talkie drama in imax is to get rid of the notion that imax  big epicfantasy which i agree with the format works on an emotional level outside of just blockbuster filmmaking and the film is still epic just not in the way we tend to think nowadays,2023-07-27 13:33:58
" hiroshima bombing and civilian casualties cgi aerial shots of a nuked city etc

no thank you",2023-07-27 16:08:42
"matt damon played matt damon in this movie a big cuddly teddy bear of a man who was supposed to be the angryserious one but was outangryserioused by literally everyone else 

the incongruity of his performance was my favourite part of the film",2023-07-29 18:54:04
thought it was fantastic and subtle oppenheimer experiencing firsthand the awesome power of the universe in that brief silent moment before the shockwave hits the culmination of all his years of study and planning the most critical moment of his life nolan used the rest of the movie to give us that peek at ,2023-08-20 04:04:53
 just left the imax theatre and i was thinking the same the build up to it the music the intensity of the scenes but when the actual explosion happened… i was kind of underwhelmed… seems like they just close up scenes of a fire and not an actual atomic bomb the sound was pretty good with how it muted everything and then the sudden shockwave but it seemed short,2023-08-19 16:45:43
if only the title of this movie gave an indication of what it would be about i wish they named it oppenheimer instead of the misleading big bombs going boom in cities,2023-08-20 23:25:28
lol but everyone knows the scale of destruction if they paid attention in a history class imo the focus on main character and him hearing the news from other sources was a brilliant idea,2023-08-20 14:32:11
right i feel like no one mentions how choppy and weird editing has gotten in movies over the past 510 years whoever marketed this movie and deserves a raise because it garnered way more hype than it deserved it was like nolan prioritized complexity over entertainment and storytelling i dont want to watch a 3 hour art film,2023-12-10 16:12:29
i was really thinking about leaving,2023-07-21 12:22:22
" watching a nolan film on opening day is the worst way to experience it

explain",2023-07-21 10:33:24
"i strongly believe it would have made a really great 3 episodes 1h30 each show

this wouldve been much better as a show like chernobyl",2023-07-21 11:41:21
i am from india and i was completely lost for almost 80 of the movie i also used to think i am good at english but seeing this movie made me realise i have a lot to work on there were so many characters whose names i forgot as soon as their part was over except some famous names like richard feynman and neils bohr i really wanted to like this film i think ill have to see its dubbed version to understand it better,2023-07-21 11:03:11
what was convoluted about the plot  seemed pretty straightforward to me,2023-07-21 10:44:06
agree sorry for the downvotes ill wait for mine,2023-07-22 13:04:17
out of focus close ups,2023-07-22 15:20:56
idk if you’ve seen the movie’s “testament” or “threads” but i highly recommend in terms of giving you a feeling of dread and a great portrayal of the true horrors of nuclear war oppenheimer kind of touched this feeling a few times but i wish nolan would have leaned more into it i get the movie is about the man himself but still,2023-07-24 00:01:05
i was half expecting the final scene to be of the streets of japan on the morning of the bombing and then perhaps the aftermath i was a little bummed out we didnt get to see that but i totally understand it oppenheimer wasnt there to see it and he found out through the radio broadcast which is what they showed in the movie i think actually showing the bombing might have edged on exploitative and i respect them for making the decision they went with,2023-07-23 04:43:04
"i just wanted to say about the sound thing like yesterday night i went to the movie i arrived 20mins late for me if i had to describe the sound system in the entirety of the movie ill say it was atomic 

why remember in the scene where they were trying to test the first bomb that part of the musicsounds exactly had the feeling of an atomic explosion rhythm it went from bigbigbigbigbigbig to complete silent then to hearing of oppenheimers heartbeat to a big explosion ",2023-08-11 03:52:57
it was fine for me but the person next to me covered their ears a few times,2023-08-11 16:38:12
your grandma probably remembers when we dropped the bomb i think she can handle a silly loud movie,2023-07-21 14:00:03
"i saw it in 70mm and don’t think much of the
movie would have benefitted from imax to be honest",2023-07-21 22:16:30
only 19 us imax theaters can show it in 70mm plenty of regular theaters can show it in 70mm they just won’t be imax as well,2023-07-21 21:50:44
you need to watch nolans insomnia 2002 feat al pacino and robin williams i dont know why this movie is so slept on its  incredible and robin williams was  terrifying,2023-07-22 09:47:36
but somehow hydrogen bomb is too much except the hydrogen bomb is unequivocally more destructive than the original atomic bombs like orders of magnitude more destructive the bravo hbomb was 1000x more powerful than the abomb dropped on hiroshima youre going from a weapon of mass destruction to a weapon of mass genocide,2023-07-22 14:52:58
if you mean the last scene between him and einstein what he said was i think we did in that he thinks he set up the eventual destruction of the world,2023-07-23 00:45:15
do you mean jack quaid he killed it on the bongos all movie long,2023-07-23 02:26:13
the mention of the german v2 rocket and the trails was to show what was to come after the atomic bomb icbms and nuclear warheads gave me chills,2023-07-23 05:20:39
nah nolan wouldnt be able to depict female protagonists accurately and realistically,2023-07-24 09:00:33
i don’t think he’d be capable his films consistently have terrible writing for female leads and he totally wasted two amazing actresses in this movie,2023-07-24 08:53:51
you know this is a spoiler thread you dont have to cover anything much like nolan didnt have jean cover herself in those scenes,2023-07-25 07:08:28
" his seeing people getting their skin melted off is so clichéd that it circles around and becomes almost not quite but almost worthwhile using but maybe just once

him seeing the clichéd skin melting off is a particular contrast to the group watching photos from hiroshima

if i remember correctly the photo session happens before the skin melting scene

we ever only see his reaction to the photos rather than the photos themselves and after that the photos start to come into his hallucinations

 nolan is the cinematic genius and im a nobody but ill still tell him any day of the week that that just does not work especially when kitty is already glaring at him

thats not about robert its what kitty sees and reflects her personality she was very jealous of jean tatlock and drank her way through the affair

the color scenes in the movie are told from a first person perspective subjectively and may be hallucinatory but its not always from roberts perspective

 why not just have oppenheimer wear a im incredibly ashamed and humiliated in case you cant tell sign around his neck

i think that would have set the wrong tone the scene is not supposed to be funny at all and would not convey the hatred kitty felt towards jean",2023-07-25 12:06:07
"i expected to see the demon core accident depicted or at least mentioned

why though its a biopic not a cracked article opp himself didnt have much to do with it",2023-07-29 07:40:49
" i expected to see the demon core accident depicted or at least mentioned

demon core is not at all mentioned in american prometheus",2023-07-29 02:11:24
"bit of a coin flip the scope of the film and its subject matter can make one step back and gain significant perspective on the world our fragile position within itand yet that were somehow apes whove worked out how to harness the power of the sun

on the other hand the existential dread of contemplating the end of humanity and earth as we know it might not be the best if youre in a fragile state

theres also a suicide scene which might be a trigger point",2023-08-17 20:57:22
"as far as intensity goes it’s not very gory at all the only gore if you want to call it that is very mild it’s more the knowledge of what happened that is upsetting there’s never anything particularly disturbing on the screen

it is a movie about the atomic bombing of japan though from oppenheimer’s perspective if you think that’s too heavy a subject in general right now then don’t watch it

i’ll also say the film is quite pessimistic and grim it is 90 people talking at each other in rooms but the stuff they’re talking about is pretty heavy

edit oof i totally forgot to mention that one character commits suicide or is murdered in the movie",2023-08-17 18:40:04
lots of big sounds saw it in imax and got a big shock a couple times,2023-08-18 00:12:30
its not the worst movie for emotional intensity it does move really fast but there are some shortish scenes that can be seen as somewhat heavy,2023-08-17 18:59:42
this film will be on imax for a limited time so see it there while you can its a film that ask questions of you and maybe the questions it asks you will help distract you from what youre dealing with,2023-08-18 18:13:15
i don’t think it’ll be too much though of course it depends on exactly your personal circumstances,2023-08-19 21:38:24
"i liked it and also wished it was longer but i didnt like they used it so many times

i wish the camera would come out of the cockpit and show us the missiles maybe follow them until detonation",2023-12-08 15:53:16
during the speech scene of oppenheimer people are seen to be waving the american flags with 50 stars which was not adopted until 1960 more than a decade after the events in the film,2023-12-28 06:35:03
that he peaked making the batman movies and while he tries to make fincheresque movies he can’t quite pull them off,2023-07-22 00:48:29
i love this take,2023-07-22 18:05:53
"black and white scenes for a black and white character wow so deep classic nolanite brains

also it helps the audience tell his scenes apart from oppenheimers

yeah so that black and white scene of oppenheimer walking past reporters must have been a strauss scene no dude its just to show the time jumps which still largely failed because it time jumped back and forth in both the black and white and color scenes",2023-07-22 18:23:15
"well its a biography right it was more about oppenheimer himself than the bomb

i dont have the same conclusions as you i walked away feeling like oppenheimer was an actual human being than some genius physicist i read about",2023-07-24 03:34:55
if you went into this movie just for the bomb you done  up my guy its called oppenheimer if it was called trinity or the manhattan project maybe,2023-07-24 04:47:08
its not supposed to be giving a lecture on how to develop a bomb its first and foremost a character study with a focus on the interaction between scientists and government not so much the in depth complexity of the science itself the key point they get across is this is cutting edge science that requires heavy industrialization to bring to practical reality,2023-07-24 05:08:05
"he had two prior appearances from what i remember he was working on the chicago based team he was the assistant taking notes and then again approached oppenheimer in the hotel lobby to sign a petition

i thought it was intentional oppenheimers interactions with this man were rude he criticized him taking notes and then knocked his hand away when he asked for the signature his lack of screen time and the rudeness i took this to mean that despite how oppenheimer didnt give a  about him  he still took the mic at the hearing and defended oppenheimer",2023-07-24 21:54:37
"this is such a silly criticism this is a biopic based on real life real lives of hundreds of different people that intersect the story in different way 

history does not follow proper storytelling structures it’s pretty random and there’s so many people in anyone’s life that most will indeed be “random appearances”

what could have been done instead given drhill’s role in the appeal against streuss to some other more involved character forfeiting the historical nature of the movie for pure fiction

or maybe given drhill way more focus that he needed in the earlier bits of the movie  where he was a straight up less eventful figure in the grand scheme of things  either focusing on his less meaningful actions or making  up just to give him things to show off

random people do incredibly important things all the time after being low profile their entire life and there is no way to display these dynamics in ways that conform to fictional story structures these are the constraints that the genre puts on the movie",2023-07-24 22:50:09
i dont know why this is being down voted i liked the film but this is a valid comment,2023-07-26 02:45:02
"on another note i did find distracting that that everyone and their mother was in this movie 

movie was good but yeah his best work is behind him at the moment",2023-07-26 02:57:13
i agree,2023-07-26 02:52:53
"its a movie about the war and the 50s and you wonder why there arent many strong female characters taking up 50 of screen time

where did you study history",2023-07-26 05:25:13
"kitty is a great character with real human complexity she has some of the strongest moments of integrity in the film 
my wifes reaction to your comment was what movie were they watching",2023-07-26 02:56:17
the way nolan writes his female characters is disgraceful and frankly embarrassing for him,2023-08-01 11:06:03
"oppenheimer is famous for his thousand yard stare cillian did awesome performance portraying it reflecting how much things running in his mind

agree on the nudity its definitely not important",2023-07-31 23:45:07
agreed i felt like the dialogue was so heavy handed and after a while of loud music being played through every single piece of dialoguei was tired,2023-08-28 18:56:29
"not all all kinda wild that this is getting that much traction as a “must see imax film”

film isn’t even must see imo",2023-07-23 18:44:27
"i think all the focus on the character drama and politics is to highlight how dangerous the bomb is its to show that we have placed the power to destroy the planet in the hands of flawed human beings where even the scientific geniuses among us are full of ego mistakes regrets and petty envy 

the message of the movie is that this could one day end the world for humanity and this is something we should reflect on",2023-07-26 16:53:55
i personally believe that focusing more on the hearings really made this an oppenheimer movie if more focus was put on the atomic bomb drops or the manhattan project it would have been less about oppenheimer and more about the war the movie showed all that it needs to about the man himself in my opinion and i enjoy that it didnt lean heavily into the actual war it was a movie about oppenheimer and not ww2,2023-07-26 06:36:25
"i think you didnt understand the film you personally having no interest in it is fine but the movie does and spends a lot of its running time since the beginning talking about politics academia money ideology war and all the  human elements involved fear greed envy pride so what eistein says has everything to do with the rest of the film

i understand your perspective if came into this looking for a play by play on oppenheimer the man but without that context he is not that interesting 

you said it yourself oppenheimer is not einstein the movie knows that the manhattan project is just part of a chain reaction of  and ignorance thats why its looking at the bigger picture",2023-07-26 14:31:58
is strauss really a  to oppenheimer irl that felt contrived,2023-07-22 07:38:17
"i think the best was then when time moved and we got the black and white shots in color later on

it was also really funny to see flashforwards grät movie overall 8",2023-07-22 21:27:27
i think a little knowledge of physics or at least physicists from the time helps too everyone knows einstein but so many legendary physicists are named fermi max born thompson heisenberg even richard feynman makes a cameo though i don’t think he’s ever named,2023-07-24 06:12:45
i was worried about not being able to hear well but the volume was great just had to deal with the mumbling and accents but overall i think most conversations were audible,2023-07-27 14:53:49
unfortunately i thought of terminator 3,2023-07-28 05:59:18
"nodinspiration from the same idea of a doomsday device which is basically just a metaphor for nukes anyway we have enough of them to destroy the world we could and who knows we might sorta thing 

like once it’s been created the world is always at risk of that happening so if it ever happens all the time between the moment of the trinity test until then could be seen as moot the world was effectively destroyed from that moment anyway",2023-07-28 06:16:23
in my opinion the world already knows about the ramifications of the bomb we’re sort of living in it right i knew much less about the story in the film and that’s what kept me interested  felt like i came out with more knowledge,2023-07-31 03:20:50
"i definitely think imitation game is a what a biopic shouldnt be way too many creative liberties and hollywood tropes when the real story would have been more than enough completely undermines turings real efforts during the war

this film is so accurate to real life and uses the jumping timeline effectively to keep the audience engaged and tense this is what imitation game could have been

to each their own i just find it interesting to see someone say they prefer ig over this when i feel so polar opposite about it",2023-07-22 21:54:00
im  so i cant comment but i kinda agree lol  film was mid,2023-07-24 11:58:14
"its interesting seeing a perspective thats pretty opposite of mine

i do want to add oppenheimer is the one that seems incapable and unwilling to shoulder up and really fight against his opposition emily blunts character is trying to get him to stand up for himself the entire time but then when shes in the position to defend herself in front of the gray board she realizes its not as easy as she thinks it is and then we see her true spirit the fight within her which is reiterated with the decision to decline the handshake from teller at the end of the film",2023-07-24 23:15:25
so after watching a film you cant say anything about the film idk who that says a lot about,2023-07-28 21:03:35
"i wish they gave you a context of when their was happening because not everyone knows history well enough to know that the  got bombs when there was more talking in the movie

sorry i must be reading this wrong either youre saying an insanely ridiculous thing that not everyone knows that japan got bombed by the americans or youre saying a different very ridiculous thing that not everyone watching the movie realised that japan got bombed even though oppenheimer was broadcasting the radio broadcast of the announcement that japan got bombed to his entire little town through the speakers",2023-08-05 13:02:49
haha yes  i’ve been thinking a lot about how really intense music was playing over really kind of bland political or scientific dialogue,2023-07-27 03:44:59
huh what does “it being a commercial” even mean,2023-07-22 03:43:25
commercial for what imax 70mm film uranium hamilton watches,2023-07-22 05:11:14
you have to accept the fact that this is basically a commercial this makes absolutely no sense,2023-07-22 03:41:48
commercial,2023-07-22 03:45:45
it didnt help that every single character talks the exact same way and only talks about what is happening in that exact moment,2023-07-22 15:13:46
the movie is called oppenheimer not the abomb only the crew aboard the enola  saw the  man explosion so instead we get oppenheimer’s response to the news,2023-07-22 18:45:52
"this was my first reaction too but after reflecting more i think it makes sense that were not shown the actual bombings the movie wasnt about the bombs or the war or nuclear energy  it was about oppenheimer he spends his lifes work developing a weapon that he never sees in use so we follow his story but never see the bombs again once they leave los alamos as the movie emphasized once they left the lab they were completely out of his control and he learns about their use at the same time as the rest of the world over the public radio message


you say that the bombing in japan was the actual event that defined oppenheimer and thats the real tragedy of his story  that the public heavily associates hiroshima  nagasaki with oppie even though the trinity test was really his crowning achievement so were left kinda blueballed without seeing the real bombs in use but were supposed to because thats exactly how he felt after his brainchild was handed over to the government",2023-07-22 18:44:40
it was the opposite for me  its cool to see how ppl can have such different views for me the first two hours were great but didnt feel like they had a lot and were more just build up while the last hour discussion of why the bomb has to be made japan not surrendering and after was the soul of the movie and really completed it took it from a 75 to a 85,2023-07-24 05:54:11
well and you may know this they went with the silence due to the speed of sound being slower than the actual explosion take beirut explosion videos everyone marvels in shock at the pillar of smoke but then the actual soundwave hits and they are blasted back or rattled,2023-07-24 06:18:46
"regarding cillian’s acting maybe that’s how the real oppenheimer was more subdued and thoughtful i’m not sure i wanted to see more out of his range come out

i was thinking this as well its not that he didnt do a good job i think he was great as oppenheimer who i think in real life was a more reserved person  but having seen cillian in peaky blinders i didnt think the role of oppenheimer really allowed him to display his range as much",2023-07-25 22:31:16
totally agree with you about cilliansroberts acting and the emotions cillian told just from his eyes,2023-07-29 17:25:17
i feel like at this point in the year murphy is the only option for best actor who else this year even stands a chance so far i could see dicaprio getting a nom depending on how killers of the flower moon but off the top of my head i can’t picture any other good performances that i’ve seen so far,2023-07-21 15:33:35
its way better than tenet but at times the sound played over the dialogues a bit too loud making it hard to catch what theyre saying,2023-07-21 15:43:43
the dialog is very clear for me  im not a native english speaker,2023-07-21 15:42:47
you hear it 99 of the time stuckmann said you miss 25 i only missed like a few lines when oppenheimer and strauss first meet,2023-07-21 15:42:51
i had zero issues all dialogues were perfectly audible and yet soundtrack was so amazing for this movie,2023-07-21 16:06:22
well there were only two women in the film that had more than a minute of screen time,2023-07-21 21:33:31
i noticed the vehicles outside the room but couldnt clearly make out if they were modern or cars from the 50s,2023-07-22 06:03:21
"i have a chinese friend and we remember watching the movie arrival the second the main character spoke chinese he killed himself laughing because she butchered it beyond belief apparently 

it’s a really weird thing how movies butcher the  out of other languages or miss it entirely the only time i forgave it was when it was purposefully meant as a joke during the helicopter scene in the dictator when he was speaking hebrew and not arabic",2023-07-22 17:26:09
id have thought nolan wouldve had the attention to detail to get that right esp considering its the point of the scene,2023-07-22 17:30:34
" the blending of the pursuit of science with the moral ambiguity with the political smear campaign was so effortlessly assembled into one cohesive story is remarkable

really i have the complete opposite opinion about this",2023-07-25 08:25:35
arrival was way superior in that sense and less hard to follow even if the plot was deeper,2023-07-25 19:48:01
dont know what exactly you mean by that but of the two arrival was the better film imo not that oppenheimer was bad not at all but arrival is one of my favorite movies of all time hard to top that,2023-07-25 17:01:46
and ,2023-07-26 04:17:29
"maybe im being too critical but i feel like they wrote a character driven movie but then forgot that they were supposed to have deep character interactions and decided to make up for it with all of the scene cutting and time skipping and all of that

strausss disdain of oppenheimer went way deeper than because of one public humiliation but that wasnt delved in to any deeper and there are so many characters that arent really developed then oppenheimer himself so he just hated himself and wanted to be martyred did he feel regret the real oppenheimer didnt at least not publicly was he a narcissist who wanted attention did he care deeply for people is the whole point supposed to be that i leave the movie asking these questions

in the same way i felt inception was a heist film without any of the fun of a heist film i felt this was a biopic without any of the meaty depth of a biopic

nuke scene was cool though",2023-07-27 22:00:31
woooah how come man,2023-08-01 21:45:19
absolutely no reason for this film to be three hours long lol youre right so much of it is one character saying something and then just cutting to three other people saying the same thing and then one guy refutes it so they cut to two others who agree with him and it just goes on and on and on and on and on feels like they couldnt decide on focusing on the politics or the science so they just half assed both,2024-04-10 16:31:07
style over substance from nolan once again his dialogue is so  awful like george thinking he could write the prequels hire a good writer to punch it up,2023-07-21 12:33:32
very much the same and then the constant music going on top of every scene i wish they would have just had some scenes that were slowerpaced with no tense music,2023-07-21 16:14:45
agree but for me it all kinda came together in last 45 minutes and i kinda actually enjoyed that kind of experience its like you are trying to fit pieces of puzzles in first 2 hours and then it slowly starts to come around to a satisfying ending,2023-07-21 16:11:29
as a citizen of earth you should know who most of the characters are it seems to be a problem with your education,2023-07-21 15:35:15
not a minute wasted i felt like they needed to chop at least 45 minutes of the movie theres so much that doesnt add to the overall experience and is just there to input part of oppenheimers life,2023-07-21 19:06:45
i found it strange that this was the movie nolan decided to put nudity in lol,2023-07-21 21:24:48
to be fair cillian murphy was showing just as much skin i didnt mind it but im coming with the knowledge that florence pugh is very body positive so i was more thinking good for her,2023-07-21 21:24:11
yeah this was my only gripe with the movie could have easily avoided the r rating,2023-07-21 21:26:16
both pugh and murphy had a similar amount of screen time in undress so i dont see the double standard in this case,2023-07-21 21:28:23
"i think the why is to demonstrate an underlying  nature in oppenheimers relationship with jean

and as others have said i think screen time with oppenheimer undressed was pretty equal",2023-07-21 22:00:42
the question is would you rather see florence pugh clothed or ,2023-07-21 21:36:06
lolllll who cares,2023-07-21 21:33:43
i do think the should had gone tiny bit deeper into how they figured out how to make this bomb i dont think i would have to be tok technical at the same time,2023-07-21 23:24:36
yeah the bomb was such a wet  compared to all the hype they created around it,2023-07-22 12:22:29
and then an eagle flies by with a tear in its eye,2023-07-22 10:46:57
definitely dreaded having to wait another hour for the movie to end after the first two acts,2023-07-22 15:00:47
"nolans style and ability really showed during the high points like when trinity went off and when he was hallucinating the end of the world 

but the dialogue sections were frankly awfully monotonous they reminded me of some of the dialogue in the batman trilogy or inception but here it wasnt edited and it just kept going and going",2023-07-22 19:45:36
i rewatched it with earplugs and it was waaaaay better i could actually understand the dialogue,2023-07-26 19:19:40
i feel crazy having watched it and everyone seems to love it but i just cant see why im a chemist i was really expecting to like it but there wasnt much of a focus on the science of it at all or even much about the internal conflicts of building the bomb,2023-07-30 05:36:29
"its been 80 years and that hasnt happened so i dont understand the shock or the people claiming wow what a gripping ending and thought that was what you didnt think before nuclear bombs could end humanity

my brother the movie was the biopic of the man who lived the rest of life with the guilt of having created the atomic bomb and that died halfway through the cold war fully believing that his work would be responsible for the end of the world",2023-08-03 18:15:38
"dude you went to watch a movie called oppenheimer and got mad at a conversation about nuclear bombs ending humanity 

thats like everything every talk about nuclear bombs centers around and yeah the world hasnt ended but it has been completely molded by the existence and fear of nuclear war lol to just go  world hasnt ended why should i care about this conversation is just too shallow",2023-08-02 23:45:24
just came out of the cinema i would agree act 3 was a bit lacklustered and i couldnt help but wondered that the cinema was  warm,2023-08-02 20:38:31
"went into it thinking if i saw 3 bombs go off then itd be stellar imagine my disappointment when the only ones they showed were in the title sequence and the first test 

my pick wouldve been trinity test either hiroshima or nagasaki and hydrogen bomb test especially after building it up all movie

still a solid movie the drama and acting were excellent i enjoyed each act for different reasons but feels like a case of chekovs nuke over promising and under delivering",2023-08-02 23:57:26
just left the theater and the last act just felt like forrest gump but dramatic and no fun soundtrack just name dropping historic people from that time frame it was awkward,2023-08-02 22:21:20
i dont consider it his best work i rewatched it last week and while very ambitious it sags in its attempt at deep characterization,2023-08-08 14:59:52
yeah i agree he could have made that sequence bigger i think cgi would have benefitted that portrayal of how big the explosion was but more than that how he directed and edited the whole sequence felt kind of humdrum like oh great it worked not oh  that was terrifying  great it worked,2023-08-18 03:20:00
it might’ve been unnecessary if it never happened but jfk voting against him is historically accurate,2023-08-13 15:20:49
"without competition robin in rises

simply because that is not even anyones name in batman lore and implying that blake is going to be robin also breaks batman lore because there is no robin named blake who was a former police officer and became robin as a grown  man",2023-08-14 07:44:33
neither because both were necessary and one was actually true jfk did vote against strauss,2023-08-14 04:29:38
"there seems to be alot of people saying this

i think people are expecting to see a ford v ferrari style movie about the manhattan project and are getting a biopic about oppenheimer instead

not that the marketing is leading people to think that it says right in the title what its about but people are thinking that anyway",2023-07-21 13:39:20
exactly  wish they focused more on how long and how hard they worked to create the bomb all i saw is them talking a lot but no actions also wish there was more of how the public treated him aftermath but cillian and rdj were so great i feel like it was worth it to watch on cinema,2023-07-21 15:27:15
same audio issues for me i thought that it should have less courtroom drama and at least a 1020 minutes scene showing the bombing of japan people always say show dont tell but they seem to have forgotten that it kind of undermines the true destructive power of the atomic bombs by not showing them or even showing the aftermath,2023-07-21 15:17:28
i have my problems with nolan but i dont think hes anywhere near as bad as shyamalan,2023-07-21 17:00:25
maybe i’m just  at hearing but i couldn’t make out like 25 of the dialogue i haven’t seen tenet so i don’t know how good it is compared to that but the dialogue audio definitely still felt subpar to me,2023-07-21 16:56:54
i absolutely agree i felt this was a great return to form for him after tenet,2023-07-21 16:50:05
completely agree it was so nice to be able to actually hear the dialogue throughout the movie,2023-07-21 16:53:21
,2023-07-21 18:23:09
"as someone whos not really a fan of nolan i think this movie works in spite of his style moreover than because of it

nolan really has no subtlety as a filmmaker  early in the movie he wants to show how smart oppenheimer was as a physicist  how does he do that  by blaring loud sounds and inserts of electrons spinning around atoms musical swells etc

i feel like that sort of intense filmmaking is absolutely appropriate for the scenes relating to the first atomic tests and oppenheimers speech to the crowd turning into visions of a nuclear holocaust  it makes sense to be so intense there

but in those early scenes i was just like why  it would have been better for me if it was a bit more subdued but nolan just cant he has to crank the intensity to 10 as often as he can",2023-07-21 16:59:45
what was pared back exactly the rapid cutting between four or five timelines made a normal linear story practically incoherent and for no purpose whatsoever he made a puzzle out of a story that should have been presented without preening displays of cleverness just for the sake of being clever and i say this having read the book twice no character development and clumsy nonintroductions of all the other characters didnt help matters this film is a mess,2023-07-21 17:06:16
at the same time too i also think its nolan at his finest he utilized all the aspects that are good took out the bad and we got this great and legitimately intense film which kind of shocks me since it really wasnt the visual spectacle i thought itd be,2023-07-21 16:56:23
i think the significance of isidor rabi the  man on the train who comes back later it is sometimes hard to tell a bunch of identical haircuts apart is that hes one of the few people who obviously genuinely care about oppenheimer as a person instead of just a resource where everyone else is obsessed with possibilities and results rabi repeatedly asks how oppie is feeling he declines to take part in the project because of his strong moral grounds—which its implied oppenheimer shares but oppie lets his other ambitions overwhelm his fears rabi is the only one who notices that oppie isnt eating and hands him food twice his role is to be an emotional grounding rod for oppie—which oppie rejects repeatedly but rabi doesnt stop being his friend or being real just because oppenheimer is who he is to be fair kitty and jean also address oppies emotions in different ways but it hits different coming from a man and a fellow physicist,2023-07-21 22:22:49
i feel like i wrote this,2023-07-23 07:15:05
the court drama is a huge part of his life though,2023-07-23 22:22:26
"didn’t want entertainment from this i wanted a couple generations to get a healthy dose of fear

i can understand that it was the day after that did it for me but keep in mind the current generation of 20 year olds experienced this when they were kids   i dont think theres anybody who thinks nukes arent that bad",2023-07-24 04:21:01
"i really think nolan should have bit the bullet and made this either a premium tv series akin to chernobyl or just said  it im making a four hour movie with an intermission

i thoroughly enjoyed it but i felt the first and third acts were not as well developed or paced as the second the manhattan project portion of the film was nolan at his best whilst the lead up and aftermath could have benefited from more time to cook

asyou said too many scenes in the first act needed time to breathe so many characters coming in and the film having to delve into the communist party affiliations oppenheimers education and subsequent return to america and time at berkley 

the fundamental experience of the movie is the audience rooting for oppenheimer and the project to succeed being totally invested in the trinity scene and then like the scientists being conflicted by the implications and the results of their work in the hands of the government the film achieves that but it could have been soo much more effective if the first and third act werent so break neck",2023-07-24 05:26:20
"your review really summarizes how im feeling about it i thought it was very good but it was not quite the level of nailbiting action and excitement i was expecting much of the excitement after the successful bomb test which was such a brilliant emotional and climactic moment came from tense quickly exchanged dialogue i understand why it is important to examine oppenheimers life after that moment as they did but it dragged on entirely too long

when it first started they separated the time frames by title 1 fusion and 2 fission which maybe i mixed them around and i was expecting some dunkirklevel excitement and drama but it didnt pan out excellently acted but underdeveloped in many ways cillian murphy was brilliant",2023-07-24 17:46:43
i think its pretty disappointing that anyone bringing this up is immediately shut down with um its a biopic idiot its called oppenheimer nolan chose to make it boring as if its not still a movie with a responsibility to hold interest and entertain,2023-07-25 13:37:10
" the final scene discredits that because clearly the movie made a statement that was larger than oppenheimer about nuclear war

people read things differently but we spend the entire movie looking through the lens of how oppenheimer felt about the bomb thats why people keep saying its a movie about oppenheimer because its about his views and reactions to the bomb not the consequences of the bomb itself 

even the security clearance scenes all revolve around oppenheimers opinion on the bomb 

so its weird to me that people read the ending scene to be preachy in some way when you think about the context of the rest of the film its entirely how oppenheimer felt about the consequences of developing the bomb",2023-07-25 13:53:10
i actually agree with you ending the movie on a note about the dangers of nuclear war yet spending 50 of the movie time on the oppenheimer security clearance affair is weird,2023-07-25 13:27:15
"youre not supposed to see firsthand the destruction the bomb caused thats one of the strongest messages of the movie that oppenheimer spends years and dedicates his life to building the atomic program and building these bombs and then one day when he finishes and the bombs drive away in those trucks he loses all control over that work to the point that he doesnt even know when how or if the bombs will be used until he is informed along with the rest of the american public over a radio broadcast by truman

if we got a scene showing the planes dropping the bombs or showing a cabinet meeting discussing the strategy of their use without oppenheimer there that would have undermined the total lack of control were meant to feel from him once the project finishes its work",2023-07-25 19:30:06
"its called oppenheimer not the manhatten project

though agree with the cringe dialogue",2023-07-25 14:26:30
same i was so confused on why they didnt show hiroshima or nagasaki it would had more of an impact for the audience the  scenes were pointless why were they even included,2023-07-25 17:01:03
i did like kitty a lot in the movie but i have to disagree about the feminism take i think the barbie movie is one of the best feminist films i’ve ever seen what didn’t you like about barbie,2023-07-25 23:03:59
it is crazy you found this better at a feminist message than barbie the female characters were about an inch deep kitty’s one scene in the deliberation was great but she was relegated to repeating that her husband is a complex character the whole movie as if he wouldn’t know it lol,2023-07-26 04:37:24
"completely agree the film looked and sounded fantastic and there were some great scenes that i’ll look forward to rewatching 

but the sheer amount of scenes that flew over my head and how often i did not know what was going on made me enjoy it much less",2023-07-27 23:28:52
honestly i felt the same it was like watching tennis and im a huge nolan fan i would have preferred the movie to be longer to invoke much more,2023-07-27 23:30:20
it must  being so  that you cant comprehend greatness,2023-10-03 03:29:19
waste in the sense that someone interesting couldve had that seat instead,2023-10-01 21:08:24
you wasted the ticket not anybody else ,2023-09-30 17:25:28
dude its not about lack of action its about lack of compelling dialogue there are great court dramas out there oppenheimer isnt one of them,2023-07-22 21:49:26
you can not remove the manhattan project or the atomic bomb from oppenheimers story  anything after concerning the man isnt particularly interesting its like focusing on te lawrences life after the very embellished lawrence of arabia days id also argue that by refusing to show the extreme horror of dropping a nuclear weapon on two civilian centers vaporizing melting and burning thousands of people instantly and effecting them years after is letting audiences off the hook its typical of american movies on the subject,2023-07-22 12:34:38
i have my problems with the film but one thing i think it absolutely nailed was the frenetic pace as a reflection of oppenheimers mind and recollections loved how chaotic it felt as the story began to unfold,2023-07-22 12:34:54
yeah i felt the same way about the explosion even though i knew it was practical effects i thought it would be more impressive as well,2023-07-22 17:17:27
in our viewing one guy slept through the last two hours he was with our group and he snored loudly made one of my other mates laugh during the most inappropriate moments,2023-07-23 15:15:42
go watch avatar 2 again more your speed,2023-07-25 17:22:25
don’t be embarrassed to admit you couldn’t understand it,2023-08-12 05:04:37
graphite itself is not radioactive the graphite in the chernobyl disaster was irradiated,2023-07-21 16:08:15
"i don’t see why it cost 100m either

look at the cast lol",2023-07-21 16:17:27
i agree the trinity bomb test was underwhelming it just looked like they zoomed in on a campfire and put it in slow motion,2023-07-21 15:19:48
i havent seen it but im not really fussed about spoilers what makes you say that about imax does it not have the same kinda epic cinematography youd expect of an imax blockbuster,2023-07-21 15:06:34
why do people care what the budget is it doesn’t impact you at all,2023-07-21 15:11:00
i was hesitant when i saw the runtime but actually felt it flowed along very nicely to me it was kind of two films a suspenseful heist and a courtroom drama i disagree about the imax although i can see why it could be divisive i found it to be one the better uses since top gun maverick and midr in that it really showed off the scope of the story and the emotion of the characters,2023-07-21 15:18:56
imax so that we can see cillians mesmerising blue eyes,2023-07-21 15:28:44
not as bad as his other movies but still tough to make out about 40 of it,2023-07-21 23:09:24
it doesnt have nearly the same problem that his other movies do,2023-07-21 22:23:33
agree if anyone tries to suggest they went into this film hoping and praying to see political courtrooms theyre lying to themselves they wanted to see scientific discovery and the exploration of human morality,2023-07-22 01:42:02
" florence pugh is great has like 5 lines but loooks great except that one scene which was why that even crosses a persons mind

you mean the imaginary  in the committee room i found that to be one of the most creative scenes of the movie oppenheimers secrets are being exposed so hes as  in front of these people and his wife feels the full shame of having his cheating discussed in front of all these inquiring strangers so its like she sees the other woman staring at her while literally  her husband you dont get much more visceral than that with a visual metaphor",2023-07-22 06:05:57
i felt the film was trying to tell the story of oppenheimer the man the scientist who was an equal to that of einstein a name synonymous with genius where americas politicians were fueled by power oppenheimers pursuit was scientific and he was motivated by the idea of defending the world against the nazis not by bombing the japanese he understood that it was the threat of the bomb that would be enough i think it was effective in reframing his motivations and perception highlighting his integrity as a rigorous and inventive scientist while also displayinf the impact of his choices,2023-07-22 05:48:34
"framing the movie that way telling oppenheimer’s story that way… why

strauss destroyed oppenheimers reputation 

had him exiled out of washington  

tf you mean",2023-07-22 05:39:38
" i think they really should have used the r rating to show more aftermath instead of florence pugh  which were unnecessary for the plot but i guess good eye candy for the audience otherwise they easily could have avoided that and just get a pg13 rating for more ticket sales

yeah i thought the whole book n  scene was needless and cheesy as  i think they could have introduced the sanskrit line better somewhere else in the film 

the questioning scene where he admits cheating was also strange shes obviously gorgeous but stilljust felt out of place and cheap really who sits across the room from the person theyve just slept with i get it was to create literal distance between them for opie but still seems awkward i enjoyed this film but i dont think its nolans best work",2023-07-22 14:25:23
i could give a  about the explosions because i was there for the historical retelling of what went on before that point i would have enjoyed it but the constant dialogue being drowned out by incredibly tense music throughout the entire movie was a problem that killed the enjoyment of a movie i was otherwise excited to see,2023-07-22 19:36:18
lets not put all blame on the meme though the bomb scene was heavily marketed to be the highlight nolan imax bomb ofcourse people expected something on those lines it is a biography but its the biography of the father of the atom bomb people expecting it to be more about the creation of it are not wrong but for a complete bio even the trials are important could have easily been two movies,2023-07-22 20:24:58
wow you are such an intellectual person for not wanting explosions in a movie about bombs you are so hot congratulations for being so smart,2023-07-22 19:43:59
idk i felt like the female student being the one to lead the conversation about ending the project because japan is going to surrender is a subtle nod to how women can be intelligent and compassionate in a way that men are criticized for lacking on the world stage something about that scene just came across as her making sense and oppenheimer being led by fear,2023-07-23 06:24:06
its wild to mention the bechdel test during a historical movie that is literally about a bunch of smart men standing in a room,2023-07-23 06:53:48
i mean why divert from a historical story for the point of including an obligatory two women talking scene to check a box in filmmaking,2023-07-23 05:26:33
i was more than hooked throughout the entirety of the movie the way that nolan shot the film made it felt action packed even when it isnt and i love this movie for it,2023-07-23 07:03:34
this is spot on the editing was horrible i couldn’t tell what year we were in for half the  scenes,2023-07-23 08:30:06
i totally agree another reason why i hated dunkirk it wasn’t the movie it could have been and nolan’s style annoys me however this has excellent performances from murphy rdj and the rest of the ensemble cast which dunkirk didn’t have in my opinion murphy’s performance alone makes the movie special,2023-07-23 08:48:54
" i wanted this movie to be about the race to make the bomb including the politics of whether or not they should devote the resources the testing of the bomb and the moral ramifications of what oppenheimer did he was trying to save the world and instead he might’ve doomed it that is an excellent movie we did not get that movie

youre the type of guy that likes the smell of his own farts  delusional",2023-07-23 07:27:50
so you wanted a movie about the bombings and not about oppenheimer but chose to go see the oppenheimer biopic,2023-07-23 07:44:33
agree after coming out of theatres i was like thats all i mean it was good but not nolans level of greatness which he did with interstellar and dark knight,2023-07-23 12:06:20
what did you think you were going to get ,2023-07-23 12:06:44
yeah a 3 hour movie is a hard sell to most people even if its a big director like nolan,2023-07-23 20:21:49
social media isn’t real life,2023-07-23 20:09:15
no,2023-07-23 21:01:34
i think i enjoyed barbie more,2023-07-23 20:31:26
i can agree  i have well above average knowledge of everything the movie covered and even i struggled to keep up at times due to the way the movie was filmed and paced  i was pleasantly surprised at the number of things it got right though  i recommend any study the real deal as its very fascinating  and the movie doesnt even begin to do justice to the actual trinity explosion,2023-07-24 00:43:52
i knew only the basics about the manhattan project and nothing about oppenheimer himself i was completely absorbed by the movie the one thing ill agree with is that there were some moments of dialogue that i missed one from emily blunt fairly near the end that seemed somewhat significant,2023-07-24 00:10:35
idk about you but what helped me while watching this movie is a little study about the bomb science characters  his events i only read like 210th of what was shown but that was enough to really understand the movie i was glued to the screen for 3 hrs didnt felt bored upto the person ig,2023-07-27 07:19:56
100 agree about inception being peak nolan,2023-07-27 08:16:31
"pretty much my experience i watched and watched and waited for cillian to be sublime and waited to be gripped and subsumed and waited for the tension to build and waited for the characters to arc and waited for the selfimportance to subside

i’m still waiting

and this is a throwaway but the overuse of bass early in the movie destroyed the impact of the bass sequence that should have been reserved for the big explosion how is nolan so overfocused on film techniquery in every other aspect yet blows this emc2 of sound design i watched this in dolby cinema with state of the art sound and premium leather recliners outfitted with vibration technology the repeated early particle dropins with ultrabass were way better than the actual bomb and sticking to what i presume was the actual delay from flashtoshock wave was an awful decision like yes give a delay but it’s a dramatic movie the delay doesn’t have to be what it was the flash and the long wait punctured the balloon and deflated the scene this is arthouse filmmaking emphasizing technique over nuance and technicality over soul it’s rain man ocd brought to a big budget film",2023-07-27 14:30:25
"i was confused on the timeline either so i googled and find out about the difference between the bw and color scenes i was also confused whether the oppenheimer interrogation and strauss hearing occured at the same time 

at the second viewing i notice they had a casual conversation at the beginning that the strauss hearing was 45 yrs after oppenheimer was denied for the security clearance",2023-07-31 23:50:22
it took me until the end of the movie to realize that the part where einstein blows off rdj was after ww2,2023-07-31 23:33:59
why do you hate nudity,2023-08-22 03:34:29
but the marketing is mostly spend all your money to watch the atomic explosion in imax 70mm the  you need to do some research  part has not been really there  is that really the fault of the audience,2023-07-21 11:47:07
if you have to read a book in order to watch a movie then the director  up it should stand on its own,2023-07-21 13:11:06
"the movie held your hand sooooo  it though everytime someone showed up on screen no matter how many times they had already been introduced the characters are like ahh mrbohr how are you niels lol

and i dont mean this as a bad thing just saying they went far to make sure and use the characters names everytime at that point its on the audience to  keep up if you cant it might just not be for you and thats fine",2023-07-21 13:09:05
its definitely the movies fault if many people that watch it have a hard time following the characters im not even saying this movie has that problem but just in general,2023-07-26 12:15:58
yes,2023-07-21 11:27:33
"yes the start made me think it was gonna be more symbolic and have crazy visuals 

but the back half of the movie was just talking scences mat daman then",2023-07-30 10:49:46
but like the movie is called oppenheimer it’s about oppenheimer and what happened with him after ww2 of course it focussed on the trials and the general politics and morals behind it,2023-08-10 00:15:21
well as teller said in the film oppenheimer had left physics behind many years ago and was a politician then that might be why the movie focuses more on the political aspect rather than the physics stuff,2023-08-11 22:10:21
"no its about oppenheimer and his life its a biopic

its from his point of view so it shows his reactions to and feelings about everything that happened and it focuses on his affairs because he was a messy  person",2023-08-29 23:34:26
what did you find offensive about it,2023-08-27 08:25:49
"it is based on a book about oppenheimer not necessarily just the bomb

american prometheus the triumph and tragedy of j robert oppenheimer

it is a great book and was pretty close to it left out some soviet spies but hit all the arc points",2023-07-22 04:12:43
some fair points but did you not read the title of the movie,2023-07-22 03:59:36
agreed on all points except 3 in that i thought the detonation scene at the test site was pretty spectacular,2023-07-22 04:12:19
re point 1 it was titled oppenheimer and not the manhattan project or the atomic bomb for a reason,2023-07-22 04:50:59
i agree a lot of the scenes couldve been cut to save time,2023-07-22 07:26:50
agreed half the theater had fallen asleep i rolled my eyes when rdj turned out to have some vendetta against oppenheimer like why was this reveal needed starting to think christopher nolan is a onetrick pony because all his movies are overly long bloated and even when dealing with really interesting thoughtful material likeoppenheimer he falls back on tropes and cheap dramatic moments and dialogue,2023-07-22 08:48:44
never thought i’d say this but they should 100 have used cgi for that shot instead of practical it just looked like a huge gasoline explosion with all that black smoke no mushroom cloud or anything  also it supposedly lit up the surroundings to the point it looked like daytime for a few seconds the movie had nothing close to that,2023-07-22 12:36:57
agree it just didnt look like a nuclear explosion it sounded like one yes but visually it was disappointing,2023-07-22 12:30:52
i agree was expecting something much more substantial also i understand the film was based on the book american prometheus but it wouldve been much more impactful to the overall message if theyd shown the devastation of the actual bomb,2023-07-22 12:26:02
i did hear oppenheimer said hwhile couple of times,2023-07-22 16:30:18
"the bomb actually going off was the one part of the movie i was disappointed in i thought they did a great job with the sound of the shockwave etc its just that im sorry but a nuclear bomb does not look like a giant plume of fire its instantaneously violent the way they shot it with slow burning clouds of fire looked more like  or diesel than even conventional explosives 

when a nuke goes off theres a few shocking seconds where the world goes white yet stays silent you can feel the destruction rolling toward you even though you cant see i honestly would have rather they put in some old stock footage of the explosion than attempt to poorly replicate a mushroom cloud they do the speed and violence of such a terrible bomb disservice",2023-07-25 07:37:26
"100 i thought it was going to be more about the bomb making not the political  i thought it was going to have more philosophical conversation about the creation of nuclear fissionfusion through oppenheimer 

those thoughts felt like the backside of the story

and totally that explosion was weak as ",2023-07-25 22:42:15
i disagree it wasnt a war movie and not focused on really anything but oppenheimer even the scenes where cillian wasnt present the only convo was about oppenheimer the main point was how oppenheimer was convinced to make the bomb  how he felt abt it  the actual creation  resulting guilt adding in the actual bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki would be necessary in most movies involving this but would’ve taken away from the focus on oppenheimer’s confusion,2023-07-24 05:52:03
"i think it was meant to be mostly from oppenheimers perspective

not seeing the bombs was the experience oppenheimer had feeling completely left out of the loop and only finding out through the wireless

it was important that we felt his disconnect after the government took his teams work and then used it because it led into the final act where we saw his work to try and caution the world on the horrifying power they now had",2023-07-24 05:48:28
there was something off about the dialogue it was too zippy and frenetic at least in the first half of the movie  i’m with you i wasn’t emotionally invested at any point,2023-07-26 01:54:08
can’t disagree more about the ‘no energy or suspense’ in the conversations but i do agree that matt damon was an excellent scenestealer,2023-07-26 01:42:52
"yeah i agree with most of what you are saying the pacing was far too relentless it was exhausting the way they jumped from one event to another with sometimes no threads to tie them togetheresp the first hour or so 

and the nonlinear storytelling just didnt work for me in this situation mostly because it just seemed too haphazardthere wasnt a specific design behind why some things are shown at specific momentsif that makes sense

i did think cillian murphy was fantastic as he is in pretty much anything he does and he really carries this film on his back the rest of the cast was very good as well ill prob see it again just for that reasonbut my first viewing thought is that it was an okay movie that could have been goodgreat if it wasnt held back by a director trying to be too clever for his own good",2023-08-02 23:54:25
strong agree  i think the movies was possibly great but it wasnt necessarily good  too much going on,2023-08-03 04:42:24
minor spoiler a character picks up the bhagavad gita off oppenheimers shelf and asks him to translate it which is when he reads that line,2023-07-21 04:57:43
he put them back on he took them off to safely walk outside so he could see where he was walking but then he returned them to his face,2023-07-21 06:28:07
there are a few scenes in this movie that are loud as ,2023-07-21 07:25:14
yes very loud and some intentionally anxiety inducing sound effects too,2023-07-21 10:13:28
it is very loud there is also one jump scare type scene that is very loud as well,2023-07-21 11:48:30
its actually the only thing he says the whole movie no matter what the circumstance basically an i am groot situation a really brave choice on nolans part,2023-07-21 19:03:24
insert obligatory its oppenheimerin time joke and he oppenheimered all over the place or something like that  kids these days,2023-07-21 18:28:45
yes while having ,2023-07-21 21:57:23
i wouldnt go to all that trouble to see it in imax imo most of the movie is people talking in a room or cillian staring out of a window the nuclear bomb scene was genuinely amazing in imax but thats 5 minutes out of a 3 hour movie,2023-07-21 20:11:36
there is absolutely no reason to go that far to see this in imax its a great looking movie but it doesnt have the spectacle id associate with needing to pay the premium for imax to see,2023-07-21 19:59:55
i dont see why this film needed to be shot in imax regular theater was fine like 1 minute of it was imax worthy and there are a ton of extreme closeups of faces that would probably look strange in imax,2023-07-21 19:59:41
i only saw it in imax but probably not needed to enjoy the film,2023-07-21 19:58:57
thats what i thought at first lol but then i remembered jason clarke from winning time where he is also excellent,2023-07-22 03:45:25
i think its easier to count the number of scenes he wasnt smoking in,2023-07-22 11:27:16
having watched it i feel the movie is best watched with subtitles doesn’t matter the format as there’s hardly enough spectacular sequences very pretty looking movie but not enough spectacle,2023-07-22 16:24:29
who knows ifwhen we will ever see another imax 70mm film again  enjoy it,2023-07-22 16:44:24
what if you miss the 70mm imax i would see it sooner than later see it more than once,2023-07-22 17:29:22
no it’s not worth it,2023-07-22 17:54:22
this is one nolan movie you dont need to see in imax its mostly people taking,2023-07-22 18:32:39
funny when that kind of thing happens,2023-07-23 14:17:15
given your condition just watch the normal version it will still be loud,2023-07-23 03:39:22
basic ww2 history thats it go in with free mindspace the movie will fill in the gaps just be focused a lot of dialogue to follow,2023-07-23 12:41:54
the second world war usa’s perception of communism at the time and the consequences of the use of the atomic bomb and how it shaped the cold war,2023-07-23 12:36:51
as long as you know world war ii pearl harbor and the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki were a thing you should be good you can always look up stuff after,2023-07-23 12:38:42
yes in audio sense,2023-07-23 17:06:27
there are a number of very tense sequences and i can think of one or two places where the use of sound creates a somewhat jumpscarelike effect but it’s really not that kind of movie and there aren’t any at all in the traditional sense,2023-07-23 17:07:38
not a lot but yes,2023-07-23 17:05:50
"it was to show his mind and thought process in motion  you can see him watch and take an interest in how the glass breaks hence close up on the glass particles breaking and moving apart  

it displays his inquisitiveness into the theoretical nature of even simplest things why does the glass break this way why does it shatter when we throw it etc",2023-07-25 12:13:11
from truman’s perspective is that he is the one who is getting the brunt of the public spotlightnotoriety for making the call to drop the bombs while oppenheimer who’s been mostly secluded from the fight is deemed “father of the atomic bomb” and crying about it,2023-07-25 13:00:38
truman was actually even more insulting to oppenheimer in reality  they toned it down for the film it probably would have come across as unbelievable,2023-07-25 16:09:58
because the decision of dropping the atomic bomb will be on his shoulder and not his he will take all the blame while oppenheimer will only be the one who created the bomb,2023-07-25 13:36:58
“why was truman mad at oppenheimer is he ”,2023-07-25 15:39:42
this is probably the least imaxworthy movie of all time youll be fine,2023-07-26 00:33:15
the sound is what you really want out of the film for the imax choice whether its 70mm or digital the imax experience is going to have the better sound than a standard theater go see it in imax digital,2023-07-26 01:04:17
i think youll have a great time in dual laser imax the sound will be just as good,2023-07-26 05:19:14
it kind of took me out that the guy pressing the detonator would probably do the same thing under the instruction of david dobrik,2023-07-27 18:09:53
"heres just whats introduced in the first 20 minutes i might have missed some things but all of the below is absolutely contained in the first 20 minutes and spoils nothing spoiler tag anyway

oppie successfully created an atomic bomb and helped end ww2 however hes now facing charges of being a communist the story follows two time periods differentiated by the color palette color  oppie in school and working on the manhattan project black  white  oppie postwar in a fight with lewis strauss robert downey jr a man whos aiming to be appointed to the presidents cabinet

oppie studies quantum mechanics in europe but hes effectively useless at the handson research hes punished by an instructor and almost misses out on a lecture by the great niels bohr kenneth branagh in retribution oppie injects cyanide into his instructors apple later oppie is forced to throw the apple away when bohr tries to take a bite out of it oppie travels around europe meeting some famous scientists werner heisenberg for one before moving back home so he can start the first american department on quantum mechanics",2023-07-31 01:20:40
"so they mentioned it earlier but it was borden the guy who wrote the letter basically calling for accountability for oppenheimer’s actions

so he was a fight pilot and i believe it was something along the lines of how he saw a german fighter edit wasn’t a german fighter but a german rocket called v2 on his way to bomb i think the uk while he was flying undetected it was showing the scariness of an powerful weapon

so later in oppenheimer’s mind he put himself in borden’s shoes and the aircraft flying above was an aircraft carrying a bomb",2023-08-02 17:03:18
at the end when oppenheimer is sitting in the cockpit the lights are missiles carrying nuclear warheads,2023-08-02 18:11:24
" thrilling all the way through even with the timelines jumping around and a huge cast you never really got confused or bored

i have read american prometheus and i should say i was still struggling to keep in mind who boris pash william borden lomanitz etc were that said it took just the first 510 minutes for me to “lock in” to the energy and flow of the film

maybe this style of storytelling doesn’t work for everyone but it works for me",2023-07-22 07:08:41
"  id be very surprised if the dr manhattan character wasnt at least partly inspired by oppenheimer

hes named after the manhattan project",2023-07-23 15:59:33
yeah the music buildup over oppenheimer admitting he developed moral scruples about the bomb felt weird,2023-07-28 06:26:06
i think it’s important to remember that the film is largely from oppenheimer’s pov so he got that personal impression from truman in that historically accurate meeting,2023-08-05 22:39:03
they are completely different takes though david lynchs style is much more surreal i feel like its very apples to oranges to compare them,2024-03-09 01:29:09
it was confusing for americans also,2023-07-22 19:39:00
"i have a weird fixationanxiety about nuclear war the concept has terrified me since i was a child even though i grew up well after the cold war the logical part of my brain knows the odds of one day dying in a fiery holocaust are near zero 

however just like with the trinity test potentially igniting the atmosphere near zero doesnt quite cut it for me and the events of the past few years really havent helped knowing it could happen at any time at the hands of a single or small group of people will never cease to terrify me until the day all nukes are gone which obviously wont come 

because of this i was deeply horrified by the ending  thinking about it after the fact though it was a bit hamfisted and over the top it felt especially out of place movie that chose to be less explicit with things like hiroshima and nagasaki all i really know now is christopher nolan definitely shares my anxiety lol",2023-07-23 00:12:52
80 years is not even a blink of an eye in the grand scheme of things and all it takes is one wild  human being to make the bomb and other things just as destructive a reality,2023-07-23 00:22:57
have you seen manchester by the sea with casey affleck or assassination of jesse james,2023-07-24 14:20:26
agreed with you on the third act dragging but i think it makes sense to not show the bombs drop on japan were getting the perspective of oppenheimer and the other researchers who worked on the project they built it it was shipped off and then one day they heard on the radio that it was used and the war was over they were completely removed from its impact which left all the death and destruction that it caused to ruminate only in oppenheimers imagination,2023-07-30 20:20:30
"with regard to showing the effect of the bombs… we know what the effect is other movies have done that it was in a wolverine movie fercrisake this movie was a look at oppenheimer’s subjective experience not a newsreel about events that have been portrayed on film many times

and with regards to the … what makes anything in a movie necessary does it have to be necessary in order to merit inclusion or does it merely have to evoke a response the  portrayed in the appeal scene was showing what was going through kitty’s head  it was a fine way to show it the only reason that this stuff is titillating is because we’re so protective about it this was a movie for adults  most adults are comfortable with  it would be odd to try not to be triggering in a movie about the still unresolved stakes of a nuclear arms race",2023-07-30 10:32:21
because neither of the female leads get any real character development in this film like a lot of his films the women are plot devices to develop other charactersplot for a character study it sure lacked characterization,2023-07-22 21:35:02
they expected a tarantino revisionist history movie with a michael bay nuclear explosion scene,2023-07-22 01:59:21
i don’t understand why people seem to be confused that a movie called oppenheimer is about the life of oppenheimer and would include his extensive life after the bomb dropped,2023-07-22 03:23:12
a case of necessary evil more the feeling he wanted to stop  and further wars,2023-07-21 21:59:51
i was thinking holy  freddie mercury with the save,2023-07-22 15:44:37
yeah all i saw was josh from drake and josh he didn’t even really have any lines they could’ve given it to anyone else,2023-07-23 05:50:11
yeah a bit but also jack quaid and rami malek is there such thing as a film having too many well known faces it becomes distracting from the story,2023-07-23 07:50:28
it was that and the part when they pan across the team but jack quade is at the front and so tall he’s literally all you can see,2023-07-23 07:53:54
"agree that oppenheimer felt empty even if i was immersed as well 

to be fair to jfk its rivetting and has compelling scenes where the stakes are clear who killed the president and theres a sinister side to the government that really leaves you feeling a bit haunted by it all even if the claims are stretched and not exactly true if nolan focused on the sinister us government pumping out hundreds and hundreds of abombs and the silencing of oppenheimer was to get pacifists out of the way it wouldve packed a better punch rather than it being strauss revenge which is just about someones ego both narratives are true but the former is a clearer antecedent to todays situation 

by 1959 when the final scenes of oppenheimer take place there was something like 5000 nukes between the ussr and usa but the state of geopolitics seemed completely left out almost like what happened at hiroshima and nagasaki was in a vacuum",2023-07-31 16:45:35
with respect jfk led to a senate level reopening of the assassination files  while similarly edited the screenplay is largely unmemorable compared to jfk  this will be forgotten much like a beautiful mind and imitaiton game though for different reasons,2023-07-31 16:23:24
agree nolan seemed like he wasnt sure whether he wanted to tell a story about oppenheimers person oppenheimers achievements or oppenheimers legacy and in that spread the film too thin across a fairly extensive runtime,2023-07-31 21:56:19
i disagree it was good but nowhere near interstellar tdk or inception imo,2023-07-21 14:34:14
i thought emily blunt was terrible in this her only good scene was the one where she sat for the committee and finally showed some character the rest of it she had barely any lines random outbursts alcoholism no dimension and her line deliveries bad dialogue were stilted and odd for me,2023-07-21 23:12:40
not a tough guy an absolutely fanatical anticommunist  i think he pulled it off,2023-07-21 22:56:57
yeah was his character supposed to be a tough guy i wasn’t buying it either so much so that it was sort of distracting haha,2023-07-21 22:55:16
if youre familiar with the real events that took place the characters names werent all that hard to follow,2023-07-22 03:29:15
i mean yeah…but an invasion of mainland japan would’ve been even more costly historians generally agree on this consider ourselves lucky we never get to make these  decisions,2023-07-27 02:39:36
there may be innocent individuals that were against the war that died to the bomb but the overwhelming majority of japanese supported the war and many were prepared to die if the allies decided to do an amphibious assault you dont get to enjoy the spoils of war from killing looting  other countries while claiming you are just an innocent civilian when others retaliate,2023-07-26 19:43:05
yeah and i like how people are glorifying oppenheimer as some sort of national hero for saving america,2023-07-27 02:38:42
just finished it didnt even felt like 2 hours 12 angry men had felt longer,2023-11-11 22:28:05
the movie isnt about the war or los alamos or even the bomb itself the movie is about oppenheimer and his life and how his creation affected him,2023-07-27 02:49:01
it seemed they were going for more of oppenheimers perspective where he knows what hes caused and the impact on the people of japan but he wasnt there so he never saw the horrors,2023-07-27 02:21:20
" its definitely nolan at his most selfindulgent for better and worse think closer to dunkirk than interstellar
 you could shave a good quarter off the movie and not change anything 
 characters still mumble dialogue and are overpowered by music in a few scenes 
 the female characters seem to exist for eye candy or to make an occasional quip to male characters  nolans assertion that this movie is his best attempt at a romance is quite a shock after seeing the film
 the final quarter of the film which is quite interesting admittedly feels like an entirely different film

this is being nitpicky though as the experience is well worth the trip to the cinemas and its definitely worth your time",2023-07-22 12:33:09
"all i heard was its supposed to be seen in imax and the best theater you can find

95 of the film is a close up of someones face

there was never a moment to breath

i got almost no emotional connection to any of the characters

i feel like it was marketed to be a philosophical look through oppenheimers eyes on the creation of nuclear fissionfusion 

its a court drama",2023-07-25 22:25:38
"dialogue wasnt anything special to me
the dialogue being barely audible in nolan movies is humurously highlighted in the movie when murphy does an attempt at speaking dutch
it sounded more like german and it wasnt convincing couldnt understand a thing
but apart from the bad dialogue if you go into the movie wanting to know more about oppenheimer as a person and find the whole science aspect interesting then you will not leave dissapointed
if you dont care for either then you might not like the movie its a bit long and doesnt have much action",2023-07-22 12:45:39
just go watch the movie,2023-07-22 12:31:39
i agree it was a tacky way of introducing the quote i dont think there was any kink involved though it just seemed like the  was middling enough for her to reach for a book,2023-07-23 05:34:28
yeah such a lame way to introduce the famous quote,2023-08-20 16:15:12
"id suppose to ask what was your relationship with the history and science in general before hand 

i was nearing goosebumps throughout so much of that movie i remember specifically at the mention of los alamos  and to lesser extent with all of the historical characters i also really geek out over these science histories wherever i can find them surprisingly light genre 

can be over hyped sure i wasnt as blown away as i was hoping so can understand that but i was completely surprised by how many people are going to this quite honestly how many people really enjoy science history this much lol let alone this time around theaters been packed for weeks",2023-07-31 12:03:19
"actually it’s sort of funny to me how the opposite has been happening in this thread the first 10k comments were mostly all glowing but the ones from the last two weeks are all trying to tear it down

in my opinion it’s just a great movie i think some people are just trying to go against the grain a little bit and nit pick but the overwhelming response from people i know  in real like who have seen it have all been somewhere between “very good” and “one of my all time favorites”",2023-08-23 01:17:11
i dont know man it has its flaws but i was pretty  satisfied some of the characters have dialogue that make them feel more like talking points with a pulse but the rest was very impressive personally it had me looking up related podcasts and books for a few days afterward,2023-08-22 20:27:27
youll probably get down voted here but i mostly agree with you  im not sure i agree people are pretending to like it  i think they actually like it  but i do think a lot of peoples opinions of the film have been heavily influenced by the extensive marketing campaign and viral social media presence this movie has had  i think its hype and momentum will carry it through oscar season and it will be successful  but im not sure in 10 years what will be remembered about this film besides cillians performance,2023-08-22 16:35:55
"  in front of the hearingcommittee room oh gawd what purpose did that serve

did you really not understand how that was symbolic of how they were ripping open old wounds by examining his personal life 

this was about as obvious as they could make it without putting a huge sign over oppenheimer going this scene is meant to be uncomfortable and to show how much pressure oppenheimer and his wife were put under during the security hearing",2023-09-07 21:25:48

to show kitty’s state of mind clearly and yet despite that how she comported herself during the hearing",2023-08-29 22:24:32
im really surprised by how much everyone seems to love this movie me and everyone i watched it with found it to be one of the most boring movies weve ever watched the 20 minutes around the test in the middle were nice but other than that it was 25 hours of extremely boring mostly political discussions definitely not what i expected from a nolan movie,2023-09-03 21:10:35
i heard this movie bombed,2023-07-21 11:36:43
omfg i was thinking about seeing it but now i absolutely need to for sean  avery i will openly cackle and no one will know why  he was such a  in the nhl,2023-07-21 12:13:26
"i took it to be that it had nothing to do with strauss that einstein was so affected by oppenheimer’s comment that he didn’t even really notice strauss 

as alden ehrenreich’s character says roughly “maybe it wasn’t about you maybe it was about something important”",2023-07-21 18:21:00
he wasn’t cold to strauss he was so affected by what oppenheimer said he wasn’t thinking about strauss  strauss’s ego just made him think it must’ve had something to do with him,2023-07-21 19:55:17
absolutely those scientists were like rock stars with their impact on ww2 and the space race the closest youre going today are scientific communicators like neil degrasse tyson,2023-07-24 04:46:14

i only remember that sound happening in one scene for about 5 seconds,2023-07-26 18:35:37
he used it as part of the soundtrack when they are assembling the bomb prior to the trinity test which really emphasises the manipulation of radioactive material i thought it was perfect,2023-07-26 23:02:26
nope don’t believe so,2023-07-26 18:15:27
i thought old people were supposed to have worse hearing,2023-07-27 10:22:49

you know you can like more than one genre right",2023-07-21 21:49:19
they could better capture the trinity test with cgi i’m surprised you didn’t find it a bit underwhelming,2023-07-21 21:44:37
oh  the pretentiousness,2023-07-21 20:54:29
oh  dude i didn’t know you were so chill like that i hope nolan reads this and you guys can make out,2023-07-22 15:06:09

sorry buddy i dont need things to be dumbed down didnt like the film stop being a snob,2023-08-28 19:07:11
did you think the movie painted the us government as good that’s a wild take to me,2023-08-02 11:40:37
"japans emperor said they would fight until every single man woman and child was dead before dropping the bomb it actually saved so many lives 

even worse than that imagine what would have happened if germany built it first they may have eradicated entire races countries and religions from the planet

its an unfortunate event surely but it was the lesser evil",2023-08-02 04:44:32
"a the movie is about oppenheimer not the morality of the bombing of japan thats a small part of the big picture

b the bits that were focused on the morality of the bombing made it clear that even though oppenheimer was a hugely selfimportant  he was still leagues more guilty about his role than people who actually held primary responsibility such as truman basically the people who ultimately decided to use the bomb were portrayed as extremely callous and honestly monstrous",2023-08-20 18:42:02
a lot of lives were saved that would have been lost by an invasion,2023-08-02 02:19:32
yeah  was that  it almost felt like this film was just trying to shoehorn in as much mainstream hollywood talent as possible  most of these characters had less than five minutes of actual screen time  give or take  affleck was especially bizzare given the level of build up that seemed to be setting him up as a dangerous antagonist,2023-07-24 01:56:18
what didnt you like about casey affleck,2023-07-21 12:34:31
"as someone who rated it lower i’ll justify why  
1 i was not expecting a legal drama  i hate legal dramas 
2 there are dozens of films that talk about the red scare that are more compelling   
3 there was no reason to shoot this on imaxwhich doesn’t make the film worse it’s just annoying to see something with so much potential use it on 3 hours of close ups of people talking   
4 governments throw people under the bus daily there was zero shock factor or thought compelling moments
5 they skipped over nearly every interesting part of gathering the team and developing the bomb",2023-07-21 14:39:24
they marketed so hard to be only an imax viewing which kinda blows my mind,2023-07-25 22:42:38
the movie is called oppenheimer not  man and little boy,2023-07-22 19:35:13
yeah true but the physicist is tommy fookin shelby,2023-07-25 21:46:03
to all of who say it was too long what would you cut without leaving something essential about the character of oppenheimer out,2023-07-22 13:04:54
i don’t think you’re supposed to have empathy for oppenheimer or view strauss as a villain i think you’re just supposed to recognize the conflict between two flawed men,2023-07-21 19:08:07
i dont think oppenheimer is supposed to be a straight hero strauss hits some purposefully good points about his lack of empathy and not caring about casualties right next to the sequence where he gets interrogated about it theres even the bomb motif again to show how hard hes being hit by it strauss is way more flawed but oppenheimer isnt this great guy,2023-07-21 19:13:34
i was super mad that i couldn’t understand oppenheimer’s literal last words in the movie the audio  is not just with him but it seems most modern movies it’s super annoying,2023-07-21 19:21:53
well its based on an biography about his actual life his beliefs and experiences its not just a movie character that you can take creative liberties with like batman,2023-07-23 16:54:52
"back in those days before and after the rise of mccarthy it didn’t really matter how committed or not committed that you were to communism even a slight peak at the ideology or a past confirmed communist friend in your record and you were immediately suspicious

i did like how the film drilled that down but yes the weird hand waving of nolan when it comes to how state authority works in his movies is never ideologically consistent",2023-07-23 15:52:57
the movie is a western,2023-07-28 23:01:41
its the most intimate of positions to be shown on camera and so makes it even more harrowing as one of the scenes we see is his wife imagining it happening,2023-07-29 04:34:17
i am now become oppy destoyer of this ,2023-07-29 13:52:31
"it would have been weird if they were doing it 

maybe he explains in the commentary",2023-07-29 07:46:10
mate im seeing you all over this thread just want to say thank you after the gloomy film these comments are quite funny,2023-07-29 23:48:11
yknow guys like this isnt just some ordinary bomb were discussing ok its a gamechanger a worldshaker the ultimate power play,2023-07-22 02:59:22
he said anything black and white is objective and anything color is subjective,2023-07-22 05:21:19
"i think the significance was that the “flashbacks” were the meat of the story for most of it and there was more happening visual in those scenes so it would have been a weird choice to make them black and white so just practically it made sense to do it the way it was done i mean can you imagine watching that bomb go off in black and white

but also it seemed like the black and white had much less to do with the timeline and more to do with the perspective when the story was from robert downey jr’s perspective or at least when he was the focus it was black and white when it was from oppenheimer’s it was in color with the exception of the first few hearing scenes if i recall correctly that’s why we got a few scenes that were black and white that were then revisited from oppenheimer’s perspective in color",2023-07-22 05:27:13
thats what i thought too some of the dialogues were too fast and sometimes even excessive also the high number of characters was a little bit misleading for someone who doesnt live in america and doesnt know the structures of their politics some scenes were hard to follow,2023-07-22 11:00:55
oppenheimer explained it himself in a 1965 interview with cbs ,2023-07-22 14:17:04
he was probably related to lewis strauss and wanted to shut the screening down,2023-07-22 14:39:49
"prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to man

for this he was chained to a rock and tortured for eternity",2023-07-23 06:21:11
reading the quote hes so famous for during the  scene seemed silly too me and the start of the movie seemed kind of rushed scenes where passing really fast but the movie is already long so,2023-07-23 14:42:16
i think theyre trying to show how far removed they scientists were from the actual use of the weapons,2023-07-23 20:30:40
the movie is intentional about seeing things from oppenheimers perspective the only departure from this is during the black and white sequences which are strausss nolan also did this in memento,2023-07-23 20:52:01
not really apparently irl one person willingly looked at the flash and another accidentally looked at the flash they both experienced flashblindness temporary blindness,2023-07-25 00:19:18
" he knew it would  hundreds of thousands and maybe more in the future yet he still created it then felt remorse later how is that supposed to garner sympathy 

he didnt create it by himself he was head of a project that involved 4000 people and it would have gone ahead without him also they were in a race to create it before the nazis eventually at least though the nazis were defeated before trinity which gives important context as to why he was eager to build it also you dont have to sympathise with him the movie certainly wasnt trying that hard to make you love him i walked away feeling he was a confused  with issues 

 nolan trying to “humanize” robert and his scientist just didn’t work for me and i wouldn’t be surprised at all if most of their remorse was fabricated

the scientists were not monsters if you view them that way then you have dehumanized them for yourself",2023-07-21 13:19:30
"its up to you if you want to interpret it that way but i think thats a really black and white view of morality many people worked on the bomb project for many reasons those reasons and their views of the bomb changed over time its imo a wrong possibly even dangerous view to imagine that bad inhumane things must arise from inhumane people it was not inevitable that it would be used on a civilian target  in fact truman assumed it would not be he had a whole speech drafted where he boasted that the hiroshima bombing killed no innocent people because it was a purely military target

oppenheimer and many of his colleagues remorse absolutely wasnt fabricated you need to consider it in the context of the time when the us was absolutely gungho for the nuke taking that position when he did wasnt some point scoring thing it took a lot of courage and put his reputation in the dirt it would be much easier to just shut up and accept being a national hero

youve heard of the bulletin of the atomic scientists right a lot of the public awareness of the dangers of nuclear war come directly from these people",2023-07-21 13:04:34
its honestly impossible to accurately judge the feelingsemotionssympathies of people living in wwii compared to now it was unlike anything weve ever experienced and hopefully ever will we have to check a lot of our 21st century moral standards at the door i imagine many of the scientists in the mp constantly dealt with this dilemma but i assure you everyone was convinced that the nazis were well ahead of the us and the world where nazis have nukes is orders of magnitudes worse than anything else if youre a person lets say a physicist living at that time youd have to come to the understanding that you pretty much have no choice,2023-07-21 14:52:32
"i actually disagree

i think its left open because of how complex of a situation it was i think the film displayed oppenheimer as a deeply complex person and illustrated well the paradox of building something that in the end he did not support",2023-07-21 16:50:52
the fact that you dont know how to feel about oppenheimer is exactly what he was going for hes not a perfect human he had many flaws and you feeling complex towards him means nolan accomplished his goal,2023-07-21 16:59:22
i think that was the whole point it was left open to interpretation,2023-07-21 16:20:41
"with exception of damon

thats interesting would be thankful if you could explain this a bit in detail",2023-07-21 16:20:14
"i felt like oppenheimer’s character was underdeveloped was i suppose to feel empathy see him as bipolar manic a puppet

hes not a fictional character he was a real man one of the most complex morally in recent history if you came out of that story with a very strong and sure opinion about him and his morality then that wouldve meant they told his story wrong",2023-07-21 18:26:09
since the prestige wow interesting opinion not everything he’s done has landed for me but the dark knight inception and dunkirk are some of my favorites of his,2023-07-21 20:04:25
"i couldnt shake tony starkironman out of my head every time he appeared on screen on top of that he had the same cadencemanner of speak as tony stark and his makeup was  awful 

this is a you thing rdj is gonna get nominated for best supporting actor he was phenomenal",2023-07-22 01:42:08
my thought also  i wasnt impressed by the trinity test effects  the internet was saying howd he do that and then i saw it and it was mostly a bright flash and a closeup of a fireball in slow motion  he probably should have used cgi and  just put a lot into those few shots to make them perfect  they didnt show the 100ton tnt shot they didnt show jumbo they didnt show the aftermath at ground zero  all in all i was totally disappointed  with everything related to atomic bomb development in the movie  pretty much the atomic bomb development was just a minor side plot to the movie  i get it it was about the man but this stuff should have been better,2023-07-22 15:21:40
yeah that might be my only problem with the movie the detonation just don’t look deadly and horrific enough,2023-07-22 15:15:29
he wasnt guilty about japan hes guilty about starting a chain reaction of nuclear proliferation,2023-07-22 20:17:19
"2 hours in i felt physically uncomfortable trying to understand the 10 million words being spoken while very loud music and pointless sound effetcs were playing over them at all times i regret watching it in a dolby room 

i am sure this is actually a better movie to watch on the computer where the sound isnt trying to  you",2023-07-22 21:47:02
oppenheimer found out about the bombings on the radio he didn’t see them so it makes sense the the movie told from his perspective doesn’t show the bombings,2023-07-22 22:52:43
i personally think that them not showing it added more weight to it oppenheimer wasn’t necessarily thinking of what the bomb could do to japan he was thinking about making the unachievable achievable you can’t realize the implications of what you have done until it happens especially for something as life altering as the atomic bomb,2023-07-22 23:11:13
"i agree  especially the sound design i dont know what hes doing in the mixing room but hes gotta stop with the inaudible dialogue also it felt like the entire movie was constant tension buildup e en after the bomb i cant remember anytime in the film there was background music except after the bomb exploded maybe that was on purpose but seriously it isnt neccessary to have something playing in the background 100 of the time you can still set the scene with words and environmental sounds

also im tired of the back and forth time jumping scene chopping nolan does in every film its constant forwards backwards current and its all too quick its jarring its confusing it doesnt add weight like some people think it does it can be used well but when its 90 of the film its too much sometimes you gotta slow it down we had 3 hours to explore the characters and connect to the story but nothing ever stuck because as soon as you start to feel something the scene skips i think a mixed use of linear and jumpy storytelling would do nolan better in another comment i suggested going linear after the bomb but idk whats best somethings gotta change though because its getting stale",2023-07-23 06:54:01
"totally agree on 1 and 2 didn’t pick up 3 

1 the over scoring was insane i feel like it’s usually used to inject emotion to a scene but the cast was so stacked it was unnecessary and almost condescending let matt damon do this thing instead of having the music carry the scene

2  i don’t think nolan can write women i can’t think of a compelling female character from any of his movies so the female characters end up feeling forced and tedious",2023-07-23 07:00:20
he was really bad at it in the dark knight rises as well,2023-07-23 07:50:54
yes agree it was a very good adaptation of the book,2023-07-23 19:38:27
14 bucks saved for me,2023-07-24 01:07:47
" i did not understand at all the reason to include his cheating scenes

because he was a flawed individual in more ways than one 

especially nudity

when people have  they tend to be 

i also didnt understand why a third of the movie was about strauss

there was a huge conflict between the two which lead to oppenheimer losing his security clearance did you not get this in the movie

another complaint i have is how stale and 1d emily blunt and matt damons character were

i like matt damon as a person but i always see matt damon this was the first time i didnt emily blunt will win an oscar im quite sure",2023-07-23 23:46:20
i agree nothing happened very pretentious people act like if you thought it was bad you just don’t have an appreciation for history or something film was boring af,2023-07-24 19:10:38
sure lets make a biopic about oppenheimer without depicting the guy who spitefully and singlehandedly destroyed his public career because of politicalpolicy differences and forced him into exile s,2023-07-25 04:26:04
i mean he was an important part of oppie’s life,2023-07-25 03:00:08
meaning,2023-07-25 05:09:14
 yessss in a post credit scene to set up the controversial scientists universe,2023-07-29 21:05:34
how exactly is this nolans best movie pacing editing audio mixing script,2023-08-04 03:49:38
it’s so interesting to me that a lot of people share your view while i see this as one of his worst films along with tenet i’ll rewatch it but i can already see myself skipping over some of the repetitive dialogue heavy scenes,2023-08-04 11:08:11
" nolans best movie

not sure about that too  long too hectic too little focus on a story too self important to tell one  thing instead of several",2023-08-05 06:02:32
" this is the worst thing humanity has ever done

wait until climate change starts getting serious

 and our destruction is now an inevitability

nah if anything this movie is quite optimistic no other atomic bomb has been used in an armed conflict since then",2023-08-04 22:45:18
i think it was just a way of demonstrating that strauss’ power was well and truly gone and a new guard was shifting the balance of political power,2023-08-09 03:10:26
i love how two comments above yours someone calls nolan very rightwing,2023-08-11 06:33:24
interesting my wife had the opposite opinion  she was far more interested in strauss and oppenheimer and oppenheimers later marriage dynamic she found the first half more of a slog and said it picked up later on,2023-07-21 20:21:52
go see it,2023-07-22 02:34:44
i think the back and forth kept it engaging a linear story would have been much more boring,2023-07-22 12:02:40
it has the present past and past past,2023-07-22 13:33:21
but if they used archival footage nolan wouldnt have  had any excuses to play with explosives and expensive cameras ,2023-07-23 17:10:02
i absolutely agree with your train of thought i also felt the structure of the film was purposefully mirroring the mechanics of a nuclear reaction the fissionfusion captions established this but it culminated at the end when we see the eistein scene in color when weve previously seen it in monochrome the scene is the intersection of the two perspectives it ccrescendos into a fissionfusion reaction depends on how you see it it led strauss to start to doubt oppenheimer which plays to the events of the trials succeeding that scene and concluded oppies journey of creating the atomic bomb whch were the events leading up that scene i probably sound like im the one reading too much into it but agreed fun to think about,2023-07-24 03:27:48
"trinity is shown shockwave is felt consequences are told through character behaviour

what did you want 

theme is power in human hands not the power itself

i bet they loved how much of a big deal that was made about being a communist,2023-07-25 20:37:37
i like how polarizing the actual scene is on one hand i can see how it might seem underwhelming since the whole lead up to the movie and the actual scene is so hyped and leaves you expecting a full on nuke but on the other hand i do respect that they went for creating a sense of what it was like to look at it without relying on any cgi,2023-07-27 22:08:17
this was one of my biggest disconnects while watching it looked so lackluster i thought surely it was a malfunction although i knew about the trinity test,2023-07-28 04:06:15
"



heres a link to the actual trinity test i think the movie matched it pretty well

x200b

on another note i think we should ask ourselves why we want to go see a film thats about the danger of nuclear weapons while wanting to be entertained by a nuclear explosion",2023-07-28 01:24:13
"as a cg artist ive seen on screen nukes yes the explotion would have been more impresive in scale bredth ecetra but it would have lost allot of the realisum in terms of an actual explotion going off the destruction would feel cheep as it often does obiously nolan himslef has proven how impressive cg can be but i verry much respect the choice not to use it

i havent seen a single example of an onscreen nuke in cg that felt even remotely real ok maybe thats going to far the nukes froma  distance in godzilla was pretty good and the one in wolverine was good but your brain just knows its not real the shockwaves are always the hardest to get right this feels real

and i think it needed to feel real to have the impact for the scene",2023-07-27 22:48:10
totally agree with you  seen it on sat and was disappointed was hoping to see more of the science etc but the acting etc was brilliant as you say but doubt i will ever watch again,2023-07-31 13:11:45
"with a linear structure the different stages in his life would feel far more disconnected from each other the final line ties it all together 
i did watch it with someone who speaks english as a second language and she did struggle especially with the more technical jargon associated with the bomb in the first part everyone else in our group did find it easy enough to understand though
i thought it was great havent thought about a film so much after watching it for quite a while",2023-07-31 13:36:02
"i agree with you mostly  


i think i overhyped it for myself but before watching the movie i asked myselfam i really that interesting in seeing a biography about oppenheimer then i remembered that i wasnt interested in seeing dunkirk because it was a war movie but i enjoyed that so i dismissed my thoughts about not wanting to see a biography  


i think the arrangement of the narrative with the time jumps kept the film interesting and kept me involved

all that said and as a person of average intelligence i had trouble keeping up with what was going on certain parts of the movie mostly the post hiroshima stuff though i followed what was going broadly

also glad i saw it also would not watch again",2023-07-31 14:04:27
i feel similarly in that i didn’t love the movie  i don’t even think i liked it  just didn’t care about the trial and confirmation hearing to be such a central point of the movie  too long  blast scene was cool  einstein scenes were cool,2023-08-02 18:33:50

the worst bruh i think it’s his best since the prestige following is my least favorite,2023-07-23 22:52:51
tenet is his worst film,2023-07-23 23:19:47
definitely tenet it takes all the worse things about nolan imo at least and amps it up to 11 horrible sound mixing the concept of time inversion made no sense to me even after seeing the movie twice it was very boring nolan has a propensity to explain rather than show with everything and it was at its worst with tenet imo the spectacle was nice and i thought pattinson and john david washington were good leads but it was just not a good movie imo oppenheimer on the other hand is one of my top 3 nolan movies,2023-07-23 23:50:58

jean tatlock is one of oppenheimers weakest point in his defense to the left wing association she was not only an old fling but he risked to meet her when he was already married and work in a highly top secret project the movie didnt have time to elaborate how significant this woman was so they need to make the encounter bold enough,2023-07-31 23:59:48
the script gave jean tatlock a very raw deal i think it wouldve been better had they eliminated her completely the movie was entirely too long anyway the last third was great the first two hours were just dramatic jumpcuts with a bombastic score as if it was edited for a trailer,2023-07-31 21:03:14
"amazing too that in todays adhd age

i mean the movie has an adhd pace",2023-07-21 19:52:28
" although strauss loses in the movie the subtext is that he teller lawrence groves among others really won

strauss won his battle against oppenheimer by exiling him from ever having any influence in nuclear policy again but it karmatically rebounded against him and his political career ended after he was rejected by the senate so you cant really say strauss unambigiously won in the end notwithstanding the fact that the entire episode is one of the blackest marks of the entirely shameful political witch hunts that mccarthyism brought on in the 50s

teller testifying against oppenheimer was seen as a betrayal by the scientific community at large and he was largely ostracized as a result exiled from academia teller effectively took up oppies old position as a renowned public intellectual advising politicians on scientific policy although in his case he made court with republicans like nixon and reagan",2023-07-21 21:24:21
"i wasnt alive back then so i found it profound to actually contend with a world where these weapons didnt exist

i dont think the question about whether the bombs ultimately have saved lives is an interesting one it clearly has but that can only be said until its used again in which case game over thats the real issue the world is transformed there are enough atomic bombs to wipe out the entire world in less than 24 hours",2023-07-22 14:26:03
"first man with ryan gosling

i dont really know the full history of oppenheimer before this movie are there any parts that were not historically accurate or greatly exaggerated,2023-07-23 12:30:15
yeah i was confused for a little bit but realized that color was from oppenheimers pov and black and white was from a more objective pov time was not linear in either case,2023-07-24 01:16:51
the black and white scenes were from strauss pov,2023-07-24 02:13:54
i think the black and white is from strauss pov while colour is from oppenheimers pov i was confused but i think the turning point is when they showed the same scene from two perspectives  cant remember the document but its the one where he visits nichols and strauss and they wont let him have the unsigned document,2023-07-24 02:13:53
to show how insecure strauss was to the point he set up oppenheimer in the hearing room it was really silly from him to assume they were talking about him,2023-07-31 08:37:47

i really enjoy twelve angry men and didnt enjoy this movie one is 96 minutes that is gripping every moment the other is 180 minutes of stuff ive already seen done better in 100 other movies,2023-07-23 19:39:50
i would definitely hate twelve angry men if it cut every 2 seconds between 5 different timelines and had very loud action music over all the dialogue at all times absolutely i would,2023-07-23 21:14:48
why,2023-07-23 21:02:24
id go as far as to say that 12 angry men is a far more compelling film than oppenheimer i couldnt really get myself to care about most if any of the characters this film also seems to lack a thematic focus at least in my opinion,2023-07-24 00:07:08
"this movie was so full of young white people who pretendage that i couldnt tell one from the other also a lot of these folks are supposed famous i guess because nolan has access to them and they line up to appear in one of his films because of career reasons matt damon proved this by breaking his acting break one of these flashappearances is trond fausa who i recognised from the marvellous bothersome man it bothered me he has such a tiny role buried beneath all those other semi big stars

also also just a hand full of black actors pass quickly i really wonder if they had access to the predominantly white environments we pass during the movie it made it feel all the more forced and fake

it comes across as a flashy stage the whole movie is a fastpaced summary of the book nolan should come up with his own stuff so he can address things in the right pace

i didnt like oppenheimer",2023-07-23 20:27:08
i like nolan but this has quite a few flaws to be considered a masterpiece for me,2023-07-25 01:53:58
its really based on oppenheimer not the bomb the bomb is just a part of his story the marketing gave everyone the idea that the bomb would be the story,2023-07-21 18:50:12
they spoke about the consequences of the japan bombings at length during the third act the moral dilemma over the casualties and potential implications for future war was discussed at length,2023-07-21 18:50:32
nah they didnt shy away from the topic its just seen mostly through oppenheimers perspective,2023-07-21 21:10:34
"i have the same feelings about the explosion it should have been overtly showed to the audience that it was as bright as the sun and not just ‘a very big explosion’ it is a divorce of outrageous power and i don’t think the movie did it justice  

how am i the audience supposed to understand how dangerous and impactful this bomb is without knowing and seeing how powerful it is 

just telling me that 200000 japanese people dies means nothing when we currently have wars going on and i don’t even know how many people are dying there 

the existential crisis of atomic bombs isn’t that they’re just really big it’s that they are outrageously enormously huge wasn’ only like 20 of the fuel even fissioned in the trinity test

ive noticed the same thing watching a lot of content on streaming like netflix amazon hbo max originals none of the characters are sympathetic because theyre all rude and condescending so much media has this unconscious overtone of subtle aggression i watched the movie theres someone inside the house last night and thought at first it was a parody movie but wasnt funny at all and doesnt get to the point of selfawareness just cruel with obnoxiously fake characters that dont exist in the real world but at the end the movie tries to force you to celebrate the good guys theres more than a few others like that its really weird its becoming normalized,2023-08-21 13:13:11
people high up in hollywood and government are generally people who like power people who chase power act this way i’ve worked in both so i’d say it’s highly accurate,2023-08-21 18:00:51

"i got this idea from another comment but it made me change my view on this i was confused as to why they didnt show it too and thought it was missed opportunity too but the thing is the movie is from oppenheimers perspective and by the point the bomb is dropped the entire thing was out of his control and they barely kept him up to date on when it would happen 

not showing it highlighted how once he served his purpose of building the bomb they shoved him aside he wasnt involved in dropping it he didnt see the effect of it until much later that is and so neither do we",2023-07-22 10:50:31
i agree verry much so but those ptsd scenes were very good also,2023-07-22 09:13:41
it wasnt about that,2023-07-22 09:09:00
ah yes like all great films it could be made better by removing the point of the movie entirely,2023-07-23 11:06:20
how can one cut out one of the most important parts of oppenheimers life ,2023-07-23 09:13:22
"but thats a huge part of what happened  it would be like the lion king without the lions

maybe not a story for you tho ofcourse it still has a lot more to it",2023-07-23 08:50:04
idk why but imagining josh from drake and josh pushing the button for the bomb made it so funny,2023-07-23 17:10:49
he looked so confused,2023-07-23 17:59:24
"i wasnt a huge fan of the explosion personally but i dont really hold that against the movie the practical approach is kinda cool

the other criticism though i want to address i get that the pacing was a stylistic choice for the very purpose you describe however i feel that it is an approach that will alienate a lot of people and obscure details that need breathing room for a full depiction of the story for instance the pacing makes characters choices in the film seem to be without motivation because there is no time to give individual perspective on any given decision considering the subject matter the motivations of those involved is vital to understanding the actions taken by many of the characters and i feel the movie failed to make those motivations clear in several instances",2023-07-24 02:32:15
completely agree felt like i was sitting in a car with a modified sound system with the volume at 50,2023-07-25 04:29:23
in my theater the middle and high was okay but that bass rumbling constantly everywhere that was awful and that was nolans intention really dont get it it was totally unnecessary,2023-07-25 07:51:22
completely agree nolan movies should include screenings with subtitles,2023-07-21 08:50:34
if i had a nickel for every time i’ve seen someone say that about a blockbuster i’d be able to fund nolan’s next film,2023-07-22 06:41:14

"another minor gripe did not understand how teller was interpreted as antagonistic i get that the blunt character didnt like himi must have missed exactly why

during the clearance hearing he answered that he thought oppenheimer was loyal to america… but his behavior presented a security risk and he shouldn’t be involved in the decisionmaking for the nuclear program

combined with testifying in strauss’s favor in front of the senate and strauss’s favoring of the hbomb program the overall implication seems to be that teller sold oppenheimer out in favor of his pet project",2023-07-22 13:38:31
" and i dont consider the two other times

i barely want to think about the first time overall the movie was phenomenal but that scene crossed into straight up corny",2023-07-23 23:31:24
nice write up i think the persistence of florence pughs character like the flashbackforward nature of the film was a loose metaphor for the paradoxical nature of quantum physics itself you see this same paradox metaphor many times throughout the film hes a family man who constantly cheated he was a loyal american who was also a commie he invented the atomic bomb and also petitioned against it dropping the bomb killed thousands of people but also saved thousands of americans lives and ended the war  or did it start another,2023-07-24 13:37:09
"i also found florence pughs character kind of pointless other than to demonstrate that oppenheimers relationship with his wife was kind of rocky

i thought shes a real character in his life",2023-07-24 12:54:31
you don’t remember the day the government told us to stay inside cuz nolan was blowing up the whole world,2023-07-24 15:38:21

but the internet has distilled that down into christopher nolan never uses cgi",2023-07-24 16:13:17
"according to nolan yeah maybe theres some argument of hyperbole there but i think we may need to wait for the bluray for better answers

my best guess for the end is the atmosphere burning reminded me of these kinds of videos play around with the scale and include different additives to effect the smoke density and it could be done id think",2023-07-24 18:01:45
"1 it was his code for letting her know the test went was a success because he couldnt say anything directly when he calls her to say dont bring them in hes telling her that they have revoked his security clearance
2 iirc the spy was the british scientist who oppenheimer very briefly spoke to how long have you been british since  told me i was no longer german 
the guy whos hand she refused to shake was the hbomb scientist who turned on oppenheimer in the security clearence appeal because he was mad that oppenheimer opposed the hbomb project",2023-07-27 12:02:37
"1 bring in the sheets was a kind of synonym to we succeeded i believe he told his wife before the test ill phone you after and if we succeed tell you to bring in the sheets after the hearing for his security clearance concluded and he failed to get it renewed he told his wife dont bring in the sheets meaning we didnt succeed in getting the clearance renewed
2 i believe the movie told us it was that one british guy who took over the calculations from the guy teller who was obsessed with the hydrogen bomb",2023-07-27 11:52:04
strauss invited him to take a position at princeton in 1947 which is when the einstein scene takes place strauss had nothing to do with berkeley which oppenheimer started teaching at in 28 or 29 i believe,2023-08-06 03:37:15
" when oppenheimer talked to einstein at the pond wasnt that supposed to be when 

 oppenheimer first started teaching 

no that was when strauss hired oppenheimer to teach at princeton oppenheimer first started teaching in california at berkley and caltech oppenheimer was invited to join princeton in 1947 after the war right before they go out to the pond you see strauss and oppenheimer meet for the first time and strauss tells him about the job at princeton his house etc einstein is out by the pond because einstein taught and lived there at princeton einstein never taught in california 

 there were two scenes one in the beginning and one at the end 

it was the same scene by the pond revisited several times from the perspective of straus then finally at the end revealing what einstein and oppenheimer really talked about they were not at different times it was the same conversation but we see it from strauss perspective until the ending revelation of what einstein and oppenheimer actually spoke about 

 the first scene oppenheimer started his teaching career at berkley and he talked to  einstein at the pond this was before he made the bomb 

no see above it had nothing to do with berkeley and took place in new jersey not california it was after the war in 1947 when strauss offered oppenheimer a job at princeton  

 in the second scene we find out that oppenheimer told einstein that he believes the 

 world will be destroyed implying the pond scene was after the creation of the bomb  is this just a plothole

respectfully you are confused see above that it is the same scene flashed back to several times but also did you miss the scenes earlier in the movie about the chain reaction teller calculated a chance that a nuclear bomb could potentially alight the atmosphere and therefore destroy everything on earth he presented it to the team and oppenheimer in the early days of the project then there is a scene where oppenheimer visits einstein in new jersey and shows him tellers work and solicits his opinion in reality oppenheimer went to arthur compton in chicago but nolan changed it to einstein for dramatic effect 

in that scene einstein suggests to oppenheimer that hans bethe should run the calculations and will arrive at the correct answer whatever that is oppenheimer asks what to do if bethe confirms that the bomb would destroy the world einstein replies that oppenheimer should share those calculations with the nazis in the hopes that the data would be scary enough to stop everyone 

that earlier scene is the one referenced in the dialogue at the end both men now know by the pond scene that the bombs did not set fire to the atmosphere however oppenheimers ending line indicates he believes that nuclear weapons will ultimately destroy the world that comment caused einstein to have a distraught look on his face as he walked away from the pond einstein was so disturbed that he walked past strauss and ignored his greeting strauss was paranoid and concluded that oppenheimer had said something about strauss to einstein to make einstein suddenly ignore him strauss was paranoid and sensitive about not having a scientificacademic background despite working in those fields and was obsessed with having the respect of scientists the thought that oppenheimer and einstein might have been belittling him or making fun of him triggered him though the reality is they were not talking about him at all",2023-08-06 07:09:47

"no it was just a fun moment of history the man that strauss called as someone just trying to make a name for themselves a no name senator would end up becoming the president of the united states 

strauss caused oppenheimer’s downfall jfk caused strauss’ 

if strauss had the means to  the president while he had no political influence whatsoever why didn’t he just off oppenheimer when he devised his downfall just think about it lol

strauss had nothing to do with the assassination and nolan wasn’t implying anything it’s a biopic he’s just stating the facts",2023-07-22 04:34:43
jfk actually did vote against him for the cabinet,2023-07-22 06:10:17
i dont think the movie implied it that would be just unserious but i did make the joke when leaving the theater giving how much they drove home that strauss was a vindictive little  the connection was too funny thats a sequel hook right there should have done a postcredit scene  lewis strauss will return,2023-07-22 06:44:46
you arent just reading into things you are imagining things entirely there is nothing in the movie to suggest or imply this or even anything close to this what the  you been watching ,2023-07-22 04:12:36
lol its time for you to get off weird reddits for a while buddy,2023-07-22 04:51:18
even with clothes on i doubt many families would be satisfied by a family night out to see oppenheimer,2023-07-22 10:26:31
exactly i didnt care whatsoever about strauss and the film did a poor job at making you understand why you should care it made that last hour feel torturous as you had these long meetings that merely resulted in oppenheimer getting his security clearance taken away which considering he no longer wanted to further nuclear weapons creation made sense anyway,2023-07-22 19:42:10
"i agree for the most part pacing was kind of all over the place this wasn’t the generational defining film that people are hyping it out to be

i left the theater happy that i watched it no doubt but it really wasn’t the  tier film i was expecting",2023-07-22 18:41:22
for no cgi i think it was some of the best they could’ve done the quote at the end of the test was chilling,2023-07-24 01:19:31

i thought that helped the movie casey affleck and gary oldman especially absolutely killed it in the limited screentime they had those scenes wouldnt be as impactful with lesser actors,2023-07-27 14:33:50
the movie was called oppenheimer not the end of world war 2,2023-07-30 17:12:02
i disagree the movie is called oppenheimer because it’s a biopic of him and the story is told through him it’s not a broader fatman and littleboy manhattan project movie,2023-07-30 21:50:52

a lot of alcohol can tell a story with a much worse climax and ending

alcohol is always an inherent negative  sure some good can come from it but i suppose that too depends on who you ask  the social partier who isnt opposed to a manhattan on a saturday night  or the drunkard father beltinhand wandering about the house looking for the unlucky son or daughter or wife he finds first",2023-07-22 06:34:32

for the most part,2023-07-23 02:07:47
nolan always has a big appeal but i think the boost from the barbenheimer phenomenon cannot be understated it whipped up a massive cinemagoing craze that no doubt boosted oppenheimers appeal,2023-08-08 12:04:34
possibly but the performance that really stood out for me was downey… i think he runs away with best supporting this year,2023-07-23 20:12:22

i cant wrap my head around why people are so offended by mild nudity theyre  people  without clothes its more distracting when they find ways to cover up or keep a bra on,2023-07-24 20:37:33
"i agree that visually it wasnt fantastic tarantino used the large format for expanding intimidate scenes better in the hateful eight i know its not shoot on imax but its a similar idea also the trinity test was very underwhelming specially for those familiar with the real footage liked exactly like what really was a good old gasoline movie explosion



disagree with the nudity im frankly baffled thats this has become a thing the  scene of him deposing and then having  in front of his wife was a potent metaphor of how exposed he was at the moment and humiliating this must have been for his wife the other one with them taking  also feel like a narrative device to show how comfortable they are with each other frankly i think people forgot what a movie for an adult is with all this infantilization of cinema",2023-07-24 20:36:29
the nudity was bizarre to me too jeans story really wasn’t important at all except when it came to getting his clearance renewed i think they wanted to show he was a womanizer but like they revealed he had an affair with the blonde in alamo with no  scenes,2023-07-24 20:47:44

i agree that the  scenes dont fit i do not agree that he should have shown the bombings in japan the movie is about oppenheimer during the scene with the president he says i am the one who dropped the bombs and not you i think thats nolan way of saying the japan bombings are out of scope for this movie and this is about the story of making the bomb and the life of oppenheimer,2023-08-13 18:50:55
definitely agree the first scene where jean literally stops having  with him so she can pull a book from his shelf and make him recite the infamous vishnu quote before climbing on top of him again was clownshoeslevels of ridiculous,2023-08-14 01:40:23
not sure why you’re getting downvoted i agree with pretty much everything you said,2023-08-13 09:37:49
the psychedelic scenes at the start of the movie could have also been cut it felt hard to understand what the movie was going for at the start with all the jumps everywhere interspersed with loud special effect scenes i enjoyed the movie throughout but there is certainly a lot of trimming you could do without losing anything important,2023-08-13 23:22:40

oppenheimer is 3 hours long and doesnt really benefits from a huge screen perfect for couch and big tv",2023-07-21 20:58:18

depends if you like action  pop corn brainless entertainment go for mi if you like drama with lots of dialogue non linear narrative something to think about after go for oppenheimer,2023-07-21 21:00:03
"is your imax showing it in full 70mm imax if so definitely oppenheimer 

if you have a 70mm nonimax showing which is way more common than the 70mm imax thats a perfectly good option too for oppenheimer i like the look of the film for this movie and most of the movie is people talking so its not like youre missing too much without the expanded aspect ratio

mission impossible is great and has way more action but it doesnt actually use the full imax ratio youre getting 90 of the experience from something like cinemark xd or dolby so while its still a good movie to watch on a huge imax screen its not really necessary",2023-07-21 20:19:40
you’ll be happy with either decision mission impossible is probably a safer pick but i like oppenheimer more,2023-07-21 20:05:48
"its the most historically accurate movie ive seen in a long time since everything was filmed in camera it makes the scenes appear to perfectly match the tone and way of life back then the more you read about oppenheimer and his security clearance hearing as well as strauss and his clearance hearing the greater the impact the movie will make

additionally i think its worthwhile to read about the jews of los alamos namely how many were part of the theoretical division oppenheimer bohr teller charlotte von neumann fermi feynman rabi and many others were all jewish strauss was the president of his temple",2023-07-22 21:02:32
"it’s a codeword between him and his wife 

take the sheets in  success 

don’t take the sheets in  failure

he said ”take the sheets in” after the success of the trinity test and “don’t take the sheets in” after the unsuccessful appeal to get his security clearance back",2023-07-24 22:13:11
it was just a code they had sheets off  success sheets stay out  failure  he had to keep security since he knew his line was always bugged,2023-07-24 22:12:25
it was “are we the baddies”,2023-07-25 06:55:05
barbie and oppenheimer wouldnt have released the same day if they were both wb,2023-07-25 17:14:36
"due to the sheer size of the film itself as in the physical reel they literally cant attach previews to the front of the film 

imax uses 70mm film which is four times the size and thus weight of regular 35mm film as such the 3hour oppenheimer weighs about as much as a regularly printed 12 hour film

nolan had to custom build reels for imax projectors wordlwide to even screen tenet and that was shorter than oppenheimer",2023-07-28 14:16:34
the two that i can think of are the first soviet bomb test in 1949 they showed a graph a few times that allowed them to conclude it was ripped off from the plutonium design from los alamos or the potsdam conference the last major meeting between truman stalin and churchill in 1945,2023-07-30 01:09:26
finally got around to seeing this movie today and couldnt agree with your assessment more  especially the parts about the incredibly fast pacing in the first half of the movie and people not being able to name any characters other than the main three or four  the movie introduced so many characters in such a short amount of time it was nauseating  i also found the score constantly playing was definitely distracting  im surprised to read so many people claiming this was one of their favorite films ever i personally found it to be one of nolans weaker films,2023-11-30 06:39:14
"zimmer didnt even do the score for this  it was all ludwig göransson and while i do think that the final hearing scene gets pretty intenseoverbearing with the music theres a ton of effective silence in the movie 

but different opinions are what make the movie experience and the followup discussions fun it would all be very boring if everyone came away from every movie thinking and liking the same things",2023-08-02 03:41:47

i listened to the audio book of american prometheus  it helped a lot  there are a lot of characters in this movie and 3 or 4 different time periods the story bounces between,2023-07-21 14:45:29
absolutely not for optimum experience read up on the guy maybe watch a yt video or two there’s a great video posted by veritasium 2 days ago take a look at who was working on the manhattan project then you’ll be ready and you’ll fully enjoy the movie it would be a pity not to experience it in its full capacity because it is truly brilliant,2023-07-21 15:42:37
easy watch  the first 20 minutes make you think it might be difficult but just pay attention and then enjoy the incredible ride that follows,2023-07-21 14:38:51
at least read up on oppenheimer  manhattan project world war 2,2023-07-21 15:35:35
"he didnt and i thought that was funny  
also rami malik shows up all bug eyed half way though in a non speaking part for awhile i thought that was kinda crazy the cast was so stacked maybe that could happenthen at the end he got a couple words in",2023-07-21 18:49:57
im 95 sure he was the guy who was tasked with the emergency stop button during the trinity test so i think he said okay in response to oppys instructions and it worked after the test,2023-07-21 18:53:25
yes he spoke quite a bit for a secondary character,2023-07-21 19:04:13
sounds about right,2023-07-22 23:58:35
definitely no need for the imax experience it’s a very loud movie however so if you want to see it in a dolby theater you will literally feel the shockwaves,2023-07-23 18:11:16

"i think it could help to have a rough idea of the names involved in the project its hard to spoil the plot since we all already know whats going to happen

on the other hand its not as confusing as you might think it is watching a documentary beforehand could be interesting but i dont think it is necessary to enjoy the movie",2023-08-12 09:55:06
i watched the movie yesterday and as a european with barely any knowledge on the life of oppenheimer andor the surrounding events that proceeded the bombs it definitely was a bit confusing the movie definitely does assume you have some knowledge of the historical events that took place but i wouldnt say its necessary to enjoy it id say everything still ties up nicely in the end and youll understand what was going on but i definitely did read up on who exactly strauss was after the movie,2023-08-12 13:37:05
if you have a basic understanding of what historical events the film centers around you should be ok it depends whether deeper understanding makes or breaks a film for you or if youre happy to follow along,2023-08-12 12:02:32
i think the first act is where most of the confusion starts because the film jumps all over the place and is interspersed with a lot of loud sound effect scenes and seemingly pointless events within the larger scope of the movie it could be trimmed down considerably and be all the better for it,2023-08-13 23:30:35
the effects on japan are not shown at all,2023-07-21 11:48:06
i think so but curious what others will say the bombings are not shown but there is a moment where its visually implied what happened to the victims without intense gore the number of innocent lives lost is not glossed over  most of the characters including oppy struggle with this immensely could say more but dont want to give too much away,2023-07-21 10:00:48
its glossed over mostly,2023-07-21 10:30:54
i have to disagree with the other person who said it wasn’t handled well the film makes clear early on that there were many scientists including some on the project that had serious ethical concerns early on oppenheimer eventually shared those concerns there is a scene showing how the cities were selected that is impactful and emphasizes how trivial some people took the decision there is a scene where oppenheimer and other scientists see the consequences pictures of victims after the fact but the viewer doesn’t see the gore much of the second half of the film is oppenheimer dealing with the guilt of his actions the film makes it pretty clear that there are no good guys in this and spends a real amount of time criticizing oppenheimer’s moral waffling via multiple perspectives including his wife’s and rdj’s,2023-07-21 13:07:34
it absolutely handles it very well imo,2023-07-21 09:58:19
it is handled appropriately come fight me after if im wrong,2023-07-21 09:45:35
if you consider it tasteful that its not shown and the atrocity is told through the pov of the trauma of the white man who made it happen,2023-08-05 21:56:18

"personally i think it’s a mustsee in imax as the cinematography is just immense 

in my opinion nolan’s best film",2023-07-21 21:25:40
i didnt enjoy it that much but i would definitely recommend seeing it in imax if anything,2023-07-21 21:36:32
i dont think theres much to be gained by paying extra for imax imo the nuke scene itself is a bit underwhelming and the rest is mostly a political drama,2023-07-21 23:25:24
nah you should spend the money people are divided on the scriptpacing etc but the sound and cinematography are amazing and im honestly gutted that i didnt go to an imax for it upon reflection it would have been worth the two hour round trip,2023-07-21 21:58:55
i think it has to do with the genre its a biopic genre about oppenheimer  i totally understand if people arent into this genre and thats fine its not scifi like interstellar or worldbuilding and actionpacked as other big movies such as avatar its a documentary and they try to stay true to the character,2023-07-21 21:04:44
it was one misguided insult and strauss tried to ruin his career over it,2023-07-23 05:54:05
"this was my takeaway maybe i just had the wrong expectations for what this movie would be about or rather how it would portray the story but once i got over that it was still a good movie i still think the imitation game did it better  

for a 3 hr movie about the atomic bomb it shouldnt take 2 hrs to see a lackluster explosion which mind you wasnt even the loudest scene in an imax theater for 20 seconds they dont even show the detonation over either hiroshima or nagisaki and barely even touch on the destruction",2023-07-26 22:41:42
pretty sure you should watch documentaries for nukes instead of a biopic lol,2023-07-27 01:29:45
oppenheimer was a chain  smoker in real life so,2023-07-31 07:23:36

powerful ending einsteins role was respectfully and tactfully handled,2023-07-23 05:17:02
that wasnt what the movie was saying the movie is simply saying jfk was voting against the consensus at the time and actually supported oppenheimers political position thats it,2023-07-24 08:19:15

that’s christopher nolan for you,2023-07-31 07:35:20
felt like the whole movie was a trailer with the score building to something very weird editing and non stop dialogue,2023-07-22 15:04:48
plus for all the time oppenheimer and matt damon spent on trains there wasnt a single dead reckoning style crash,2023-07-22 20:35:03
no 3 hour movie has really been worth its length this year,2023-07-22 21:10:11
my amc had 22 minutes of trailers before oppenheimer tonight assuming the same you’ll walk into barbie at 707pm which should leave you enough time,2023-08-04 06:39:08
why don’t you try calling the amc you’re going to and see if they can give you the exact start time post trailers ending,2023-08-04 11:01:48
you would have to run to barbie  oppenheimer is like 3 hours and 5 minutes long unless you are watching the 70mm imax which had no trailers or ads in my showing there are definitely like 25 minutes of ads and trailers,2023-08-04 06:08:21
i’d probably advise against it not just because of timing but just because oppenheimer is so dense and overwhelming and bleak i think that immediately walking into the tonal polar opposite without allowing some time between to process at least one of your two experiences is gonna be affected  i walked out of oppenheimer feeling quite shaken and afterwards had a long conversation with friends about what we had just seen i can’t imagine just shunting those feelings aside and watching barbie  the effect of one or both films is gonna be blunted barbenheimer is a fun meme and all and i’m glad that it seems to have driven box office for both films but i am very glad i saw them on different days,2023-08-04 11:51:05
just bc you had a hard time keeping timelines straight doesn’t mean it’s pretentious lol,2023-07-25 17:45:50
i’m so glad i didn’t spend the extra for imax on this movie… this ain’t no interstellar not even close,2023-07-23 04:42:18
what do you mean there were no scenes that benefited from the imax experience even the bomb blast looked nothing like a real atomic explosion at least the sound was on point though,2023-07-21 17:33:32
i was gonna say you are completely  but then i read that you were on edibles and shrooms yeah it was probably cool for you people who went sober not worth it,2023-07-23 22:44:28

at any rate i think it was helped and not hurt by barbenheimer",2023-08-17 01:59:22

just came back from seeing it in a theater with lower quality sound systems the dialogue was very easy to hear except for some notable spots like when they were in a rainstorm nothing important was inaudible though,2023-07-22 07:43:50
wow i completely disagree im listening to it right now ive listened to almost the whole thing only 3 songs left til the end i started as soon as i got to my car after the movie i love the main couple motifs its probably one of my favorites up there with the social network,2023-07-26 04:52:15

"you honestly might enjoy it more than the average movie goer  imo one of the biggest flaws of the movie is the too fast pace while simultaneously not giving you the information you need to fully appreciate the situation  if you can fill in the blanks with a ton of background knowledge you might appreciate it more

there are a lot of scenes of people talking a couple scenes with interesting visual effects and thats basically it i would say no to seeing it in imax since the visual effects make up such a small portion of the film,2023-07-24 00:52:47

"its more distasteful for an american film to recreate  another nations trauma for entertainment everyone who has studied history knows the magnitude of what happened to japan after the atomic bomb requiring to see it is just asking for torture

oppenheimer didnt witness the hiroshima bombing",2023-07-22 22:51:29
lawrence was planning to testify against oppenheimer which would have been devastating lawrence would be talking all about the left wing activities in the lab something about the scene either the defeated look or the intentional eyebrow raising from the lawyer persuades him not to do it they mention he came down with colitis an excuse,2023-07-22 00:40:05
he was gonna testify against oppenheimer but when he saw him backed out,2023-07-22 00:40:33
ernest lawrence was a longtime friend of oppenheimer since the berkely days of late 1920s i think but as we see in the movie he had some disagreements with him including regarding h bomb lawrence was proponent of h bomb while oppenheimer wasnt and lawrence was in that board hearing to testify against oppenheimer or say some negative things about him but he couldnt go through with that once he saw oppenheimer,2023-07-22 00:43:39

tenet is a really messy movie and it feels like it was made that way in a misguided attempt to appear more cerebral for no other reason than that nolan has a reputation to maintain that being said for the first 40 or so minutes of tenet i absolutely loved it but it ended up just dropping off a cliff for me,2023-07-24 17:40:50
tenet is not bad at all  i enjoyed it  it is confusing but i think that is kind of intentional and i enjoyed puzzling it all out  it also makes for a good rewatch,2023-07-24 18:19:48

"ok rant time because this movie gets way too much hate imo it’s intentionally confusing and there’s time where the music is mixed up so that the dialogue is unintelligible also intentional i saw this in a theater last week and have a decent audio set up at home and i’ve never had an issue understanding dialogue except occasional accents i think a lot of the mixing complaints of tenet and oppenheimer mostly come down to the individual theater experience 

tenet is also my most rewatched nolan movie it took me like 23 watches to begin to grasp it though i was initially just watching it over and over because the backwards footage is so cool looking he basically just took a cool concept like the zero g hallway fight in inception and turned it into the whole movie while also leaving behind the emotional core a lot of people liked in movies like inception and interstellar some people couldn’t latch onto a movie that’s almost purely concept while also being so confusing which i totally understand 

big fan i’d highly recommend it the set pieces and music are unmatched just follow the direction the movie gives in the beginning “don’t try to understand it feel it” just intuit it until you do begin to understand it might sound like a tall ask but it’s such a rewarding movie with so many great little details",2023-07-24 17:38:43
"those were all based on real people i think it demonstrated how lost in the mess oppenheimer was he had the military the government his fellow scientists multiple love interests and people out to get him so many people to answer to who had their own opinions on what he was doing his life really was that messy toward the end it became clear that the hearing for strauss happened after oppes hearing because rami maleks character spoke out during strauss hearing about his involvement in getting oppes security clearance revoked

it wasnt even about the bomb really we watched a scientist who worked in theoretical ideas be pulled into helping the government develop a dangerous weapon he tries to convince himself its to stop the nazis even though the government cant stop talking about the threat of communism and the soviet union then germany surrenders why do we still need the bomb is japan still that big a threat and while trying to smear oppes character they cant stop bringing up his communist connections he built the  bomb they asked for but they cant stop with the red scare scrap they cant seem to grasp the idea that someone might change their mind about the use for a weapon after seeing the damage it is capable of doing imagine feeling like you owe it to your country to help them develop this technology then they run your reputation through a wood chipper afterwards and you still cant decide whether or not you did the right thing its less about the bomb itself and more about the emotional toll and political games",2023-07-28 17:53:26
"one point the story makes is how all of these impoerant names in science knew each other socially and professionally it was a club as well as a rwaearxh project there were egos and personalities to be managed as well as science and engineering to be achieves the big names had families and lives outside of their work oppenheim missed his brother  there were young post docs enjoying their youth while doing there part and some of them grew up to become big names themselves 

scientists are a tribe as well as a guild the q clearance was a union card as well as an access card

this project created legends unified americas researchers and became a model for how the govt can serve as an engine that fosters innovation ot also transformed our thinking about the nature of war and the value of peace

im glad that 2e have this movie to help inspire our science community once more",2023-07-28 18:16:59

"if you cant comprehend people not all feeling the same way movie criticism and discussion isnt for you

i was disappointed not because it was bad but because it didnt meet the extreme expectations it carries due to its pedigree and being one of the most vital and interesting subjects out there

as a long time nerd over this stuff i felt it lacked detail left out fascinating parts of the actual process of the building of the bomb and reduced it all down to handwavey one liners about physics most of the film was centered around this analogy of how much uranium has been refined so far and then the bowl is full of marbles and the bomb just appears not one mention of the demon core and everything they went through and lives lost just handling the material that went into the bomb

im glad people liked it but you shouldnt discredit peoples opinions as if its the perfect film for everyone id say its solid for mainstream audiences but doesnt do the subject justice in the way i expected it would",2023-07-21 23:25:14

my dude there’s no way you thought this movie was going to be more about the science and less about the politics around the atomic bomb,2023-07-21 12:01:40
the bomb is the main thing they hyped up from the trailers to the poster why do you find that a laughable expectation and i mean the trinity bomb not the japanese ones those are indeed silly to expect,2023-07-22 20:48:09
and the nolan simps will take anything theyre given and love it,2023-07-22 20:10:00
why you felt that,2023-07-25 17:18:57

" and unexpected plot twists

ironic you say this when it is one of the problems of this movie nolan needs to make everything complicated and so he created the unexpcted plot twist with rdjs character which was totally unnecessary and made the movie needlessly convoluted with its many time jumps",2023-07-23 08:58:38
ngl i think this movie kind of suffers from being paired with barbie and making people walk in with less serious  expectations like for instance in my theater the line from truman about removing kyoto from the target list as its his vacation destination made me really upset and harrowed me most people around me audibly smiled and laughed  i know it was supposed to be jarring but to me the most jarring part was the people around me cracking at it like it was one of the actual intended funny lines im not really explaining myself well,2023-07-23 07:03:20
"boring definitely not however my knowledge of the subject basically consisted of i skimmed the manhattan project wikipedia article at some point ie pretty  surfacelevel it felt like the writers did basically the same thing which is fine its not a documentary but then its wrapped up in christopher nolans convoluted nonlinear storytelling style which imo adds nothing aside from making the movie needlessly confusing

it was a solid movie but i didnt find it nearly as impactful or moving as those who think it was a masterpiece apparently did the moral questions around nuclear weapons have been explored in media countless times the film was oriented around those questions but there wasnt any kink or depth to how they were presented here that was different enough to make me think about or feel anything new like no  oppenheimer and a lot of the other people who worked on the manhattan project felt guilty about what they did",2023-07-23 17:45:14
the expectations set by the trailers and the public in general is pretty outlandish tbh is it a must see in imax movie like people are saying no it’s not another interstellar it’s a good biopic but many people are going in expecting nukes and bombs instead of an oscar quality biopic,2023-07-23 07:08:47
sometimes i wish the people who go to see it go and watch a documentary about him first because it would maybe help haha,2023-07-23 12:30:22
"my sneaking suspicion is that were seeing people with money who read the reviews and then gave no thought to whether or not theyd actually be interested in a largely actionless dialogue heavy movie about a project manager and theoretical physicist they took it as some kind of universal truth rather than what most rational consumers do which is read between the lines stick to reviewers with similar tastes and interests etc

its like an incel uncritically rushing out to see barbie on opening weekend because it recieved decent reviews gee of course they didnt like it",2023-07-23 07:03:18
"asking this in good faith because ive seen this sentiment a lot but why exactly i expected the end to be a real gut punch after everything thats been said but oppenheimer expressing that the nuclear weapon might be the destruction of us all is

a objectively true  he would have known that the second he understood the scale of the weapon so why would it be a revelation for him to think that 

and 

b something hed already expressed many times in the film already",2023-07-22 14:27:54

to be fair the wife was portrayed as going through postpartum depression which is a very real thing people go through in real life frankly her life even looked miserable gone and put in the middle of nowhere to he nothing but a caretaker and wife,2023-07-22 08:30:35

so you’re upset the movie called “oppenheimer” was focused on robert oppenheimer interesting take,2023-07-22 20:07:20
perhaps you missed the title of the movie it’s called “oppenheimer”,2023-07-22 20:18:00
a biopic about the man and how hes remembered for inventing the bomb and not the potuss decision to use it is about exactly that,2023-07-22 20:06:13

" uniformative

if you didnt like the movie fine but woah im gonna stop you right here

as someone who has read multiple books on oppenheimer including the one this film is based on nolan knocked it out of the park when it came to how events actually played out he flattens time a bit or will put two scenes together to save time but its honestly probably one of the most historically accurate films ive seen

if you had to do an essay on american prometheus and watched only this film you would absolutely pass

edit unotenglishwobbly responded to me and then immediately blocked me for some reason 

theres lots of things nolan left out of the film  its a pretty  big book there are a lot of things left out that maybe i would have included the oppenheimers late life visit to the chevaliers but other things that i didnt expect him to put in whatsoever very pleasantly surprised they included oppies ask of haakon to take peter  though it was only for 2 months and the film made it seem like 2 years",2023-07-25 17:46:19
i didn’t like the movie as much as the hype suggested i thought it was just okay but uninformative is not the word i’d use at all if anything it was too informative,2023-07-25 18:21:56
uninformative how,2023-07-25 17:41:28
i thought the conflict with strauss was a very effective way of encapsulating the dominant struggle in oppenheimer’s postwar life i found the richness of the film came from seeing the story of oppenheimer’s rise and his creation of the bomb interwoven with scenes from his later life showing his titanic battles with guilt and his attempts to assuage it by preventing further nuclear escalation strauss epitomised the hawkish militaristic proescalation faction who set out to destroy oppenheimer as he fought to resist the development of the hbomb and the acceleration of the arms race and the fact that strauss did ultimately succeed in destroying oppenheimer’s reputation in his lifetime really worked for me in terms of the tragic themes i liked how oppenheimer almost welcomed his destruction and martyrdom at strauss’s hands as punishment for having built the bomb so i don’t see how you could say you didn’t care about the strauss stuff because the strauss stuff is just the escalation of oppenheimer’s own internal conflict which is the heart of the entire film,2023-07-29 11:31:04
felt the same about the 3rd act it felt very shoehorned,2023-07-29 11:01:47
"i’m not sure i understood why it was even important for him to even have “security clearance” at that point in his life

"the movie is about oppenheimer’s rise and fall in that sense it was a tragedy just like prometheus despite all his genius oppie didn’t fully appreciate that threats that were poised against him at home strauss is a composite of the intellectuals and cold war war hawks who felt that oppenheimer in his push for regulation had stepped on their toes and for this they tarred and feathered him

rdj’s strauss was such a self obsessed vindictive lout he acted as a great villain for the story and a great man to have hold and twist the knife",2023-07-29 07:52:12

personally didnt think they showed enough they should have showed oppenheimers nuts,2023-07-22 00:34:10

yes,2023-07-22 00:18:14
im glad they didnt i thought his speech after the bombing with the scream and the charred body on the ground made a bigger impact than a cgi shot of the bomb destroying a city would,2023-07-29 22:53:35

youre in a super minority with that opinion  maybe you just dont enjoy historical movies or biopics  i mean oppenheimers life is well documented the movie does what it says on the tin  if you find oppenheimers life story to be boring and uninteresting why on earth would you choose to watch this   no character development  did we even watch the same movie  poor dialogue  imo this is one of nolans best scripts for that   anticlimatic  again you knew the source material before going in this wasnt a superhero movie this is all in the past and the main players are dead not sure what huge twist youd have liked to see,2023-07-27 02:17:35

i agree that it felt like it was completely out of place in that scene we the audience know of oppenheimer’s association with that particular line so it feels a bit on the nose that he just so happened to read that line out of all possible lines in the middle of having  it felt forced,2023-07-22 15:33:34

"you say it “biopic’d harder than any biopic since the mid 00s” but then later question the decisionmaking surrounding why the film touched on the white men who designed the bomb rather than the japanese victims it’s literally a biopic based on a biography… of oppenheimer 

yes the manhattan project is obviously going to be a defining part of his legacy but it isn’t his whole journey in his life story and i’d argue that if you’re looking to see the manhattan project the trinity test and then the bombings in japan from a more objective perspective then perhaps you’d prefer a documentary or at least a movie not literally called oppenheimer

instead  nolan chose to show us the project and trinity test largely from oppenheimer’s perspective and then the very rapid packingup of his work and subsequent abandonment of him as he began to publicly advocate against the creation of even larger wmds i mean the test was successful they immediately loaded the bombs up on trucks waved goodbye to him and then a few short weeks later killed a massive number of people with them so to return to the original point in which you said it was “a choice” show it from the pov of the white man well… yeah we had seen the rest of it from his perspective so of course nolan shows us oppenheimer’s resulting internal struggle between pride for his work and the terrifying implications about the new world that mankind has just entered

as for not comparing  and oppenheimer enough oppenheimer was a physicist who helped to design the bomb  was a politician systematically leading efforts to perform genocide as efficiently as possible… but sure let’s pretend these two people are comparable for your sake oppenheimer agreed to lead the manhattan project to completion because he was sure heisenberg could allow  the capability of using atomic weapons on many of the allies if  is going to have atomic weapons would it be better or worse for the allies to also have atomic weapons 

finally the film does use other characters and the kangaroo court proceedings to point out that oppenheimer did have questionable timing when it came to his moral objections with the project and acknowledged them in the only way a biopic can through other people",2023-08-05 13:46:57

did you read the book he wasnt responsible for that and he in no way deserved the humiliation of that extrajudicial humiliation he wanted to prevent an arms race and was totally  for it i wish the film had used einsteins best line he said oppenheimers problem is simple he loves a woman who doesnt love him back that woman is the united states government,2023-07-22 17:46:19

lewis strauss and the rest of the conservative nuclear hawks that were now in power with eisenhower wanted to eliminate the most prominent and decorated public intellectual who largely and loudly opposed the policies they wanted to implement and strauss did it by stacking the deck against oppenheimer in a closed door inquisition  it was a political disagreement that became personal because of the petty vainglorious and autocratic nature of strauss",2023-07-22 18:10:34

law and order what do you mean,2023-07-31 02:38:47
i dont think that it was so much that he was seeing white people killed rather just people the people right in front of him currently living their lives the realization that this is exactly the kind of thing that wouldve been happening in hiroshima and nagasaki when thousands of people were killed and anyways it was more so a way for the audience to understand the horror without showing the actual nuclear disaster which just wouldve been downright disrespectful,2023-08-08 22:02:36
the way i see it it’s supposed to be open ended nolan doesn’t know who oppenheimer is and who does know we are left to guess and that makes a movie interesting,2023-08-10 00:25:23

however i personally was satisfied because i knew that it was from the pov of 20 miles away the most violent part for me was the beginning of the detonation — when everything went pure white and silent that was horrifyingly beautiful",2023-07-22 23:21:42
twin peaks 3 did such an incredible job on it anything else would have to fall short two things really bothered me about this film although i liked it and get that it was trying to make you feel like you were opp flashing through all of these memories  a three hour movie where every shot is as short as a tik tok cut made me feel  insane like the longest shot in the movie couldnt have been more than 4 seconds and the score being constantly presentnever ending really ruined the impact of a lot of the scenes imo,2023-07-22 23:36:15
i thought the same i was thinking about taking a two hour car ride to my nearest imax in order to experience the explosion in its full glory im thankful that i did not such an underwhelming moment,2023-07-22 23:11:07
i agree  and it has nothing to do with the movie they started calling it a masterpiece after the movie announcement itself then the trailer just cemented that view,2023-07-24 16:25:12
truly don’t think i have ever seen more than 10 random redditors call tenet a masterpiece a film that got pretty average reviews across the board so your statement is just straight up false lol,2023-07-24 16:24:12
ok but every single kanye album is a masterpiece,2023-07-24 15:33:35
this just reads like a pretentious film student that completely missed the point and fixated on the most useless aspect of the film and then thinks theyre smart for pointing it out,2023-07-28 06:09:22
"why not open by stating you went in with very strong negative opinions about the writerdirector

the worst of all of nolans ambitions

this movie is painful to watch because christopher nolan left his handprints all over

and ill summarize this part

memento  confusing

prestige  bland characters

dunkirk  punishing historical accuracy

dark knight rises  unintelligible sound mixing overbloated soundtrack

tenet  same as dark knight rises

then you describe oppenheimer many negative ways but dont explain any reasoning for your criticisms some of which contradict themselves

how is one of your criticisms of oppenheimer that it has the punishing historical accuracy of dunkirk but also that its not more of a bythenumbers history tale can you tell me where the confusion of memento can be found in this movie

i will never pay to see a christopher nolan film in a theater ever again after this movie

did you say that after tenet as well

i dont care if someone hates the movie as long as they dont lie about why",2023-07-28 06:59:08
just go and watch fast and the furious x17 again let the grownups talk here about actual films,2023-07-31 02:13:33
nolan nailed the timeline in this movie  he presents the characters early and then little by little starts peeling away layers of the story until he gets to the core,2023-08-01 02:31:39
barbie deals with that more,2023-07-21 05:29:47
ironically i did watch barbie and i did have an existential crisis that  made me crying i’m also watching oppenheimer next week so i’m excited to see the difference,2023-07-21 04:11:01
you sound fun at parties,2023-08-13 21:37:51
stick to the mcu bub,2023-08-13 22:20:09
what did you honestly expect he wasnt fighting crime in spandex,2023-08-16 14:20:50
fully agree i wanted to walk out but didn’t tried to sleep through the last hour but couldn’t because of the non stop dialog this was ,2023-08-15 15:17:27
its about the guy not the bomb,2023-07-21 13:23:54
"it isnt a depiction of a literal nuclear war its a depiction of the possibility of nuclear war

oppenheimer died in the 60s smack dab in the middle of the cold war so he never got to see the dissolution of the ussr and the dramatic cooldown in nuclear tensions that came with that so he lived the rest of his days with not only the spectre of nuclear war hanging over his head as it did with everyone else on earth but also with the guilt and responsibility of being instrumental in its creation so if we take it as reflecting oppenheimers mindset its his imagination of what his invention could lead to 

but nolan is making a comment on the world we live in as well the cold war ended but there are still enough nuclear weapons in the world to end human civilization several times over putin and other high level russian officials have made apocalyptic nuclear threats since the invasion of ukraine started for example so its something that hangs over our heads in 2023 as well",2023-07-26 19:04:43
no that’s oppenheimer’s fear of what nuclear weapons will do in the future,2023-07-26 18:53:59
it wasn’t terrible no but it wasn’t “nolan’s masterpiece”,2023-07-22 22:51:09
this movie in no way needed a longer run time,2023-07-23 08:02:35
i’m starting to think a lot of users didn’t even see oppenheimer or barbie this weekend and the ones talking  just want stuff to fail for the sake of failing,2023-07-23 22:54:23
its not for slow witted people honestly watch it again to grasp more cause im sure we didnt watch the same thing,2023-07-23 23:03:01
" we get told he’s this womanising  but we don’t see any personality through his character

we get told he’s a womanizer and observe it throughout the movie 

 then people think it makes them an intellectual for liking it 

i just enjoyed the movie",2023-07-28 18:33:12
well i think they didn’t show the actual bombing because oppenheimer wasn’t there it’s his biopic it wasn’t his decision but he still had to live with it he envisioned what it would have been like many times there’s a scene when oppenheimer is being shown pictures of the japanese after the bomb and he can’t even bare to look at it,2023-07-22 19:39:38
y’all are wild for expecting anything at all like that,2023-07-22 19:23:38
yeah its so confusing in its timelines and because of these timelines and extremely fast pacing the movie doesnt have enough space to build any tension or develop characters its just one scene after another after another which is sooo tedious,2023-07-22 19:24:09
all filmmaking is autobiographical in some way,2023-07-23 20:10:51
oof,2023-07-23 20:41:44
it was like a duty to build the bomb either he does it or russians or someone else i dont think he ever justified his work in fact it felt like he was trying actively to put it down telling others that it was a weapon that could vaporize the planet,2023-08-05 17:35:05
you can read truman by mccullough,2023-07-21 02:34:46
your right watching all this dialog in imax was brutal and the trinity test was not at all what i expected its almost like the distribution company saw the movie and  realized nolan had just wasted a fortune filming it on imax and said we need to push this movie as you need to see in imax to recoup our money,2023-07-22 13:23:41
yea the movie would’ve been so good if they had cillian murphy turn to the camera and hit the audience with an “it’s oppentime” right before the bomb went off just like all those marvel movies you freaks love,2023-08-06 23:13:07
yeah not suited to low iqs,2023-08-06 22:30:55
theres no difference between him and the guy dropping the bomb oppenheimer absolutely has a share of the burden for the destruction without him the bomb would not have been built in time for the end of ww2 truman had no right to belittle him for that,2023-07-24 00:01:16
"certainly the contrarian opinion not in a bad way

i think the question over whether someone should be removed from government due to their political beliefs is an important one oppenheimer was tangentially related to the communist movement but it’s clear he was never a solid anything and certainly at the time hadn’t been in years it’s definitely a slippery  and i think it’s clear that mccarthyism of which this is an extension was negative to many peoples lives 

plus there’s the element that strauss wasn’t trying to have oppy removed out of a genuine fear of his ideological ties he was playing machiavellian politics and removing a rival from a position of influence nobody cares about his political ties until they could use it to gain something themselves at which point they all wanted a piece 


as for the second point i think it’s more complicated maybe if anything it suggests that truman hadn’t faced the weight of the decision to bomb japan or the risk that unleashing nuclear weapons on the world posed 

but i also agree that being weepy about something you e done doesn’t absolve you and definitely shouldn’t absolve oppenheimer of his crimes i’m not entirely sure what i think about it 

i take it as a cautionary tale about being swept up and used by systems of power that will spit you out when done and to be careful about contributing to said system",2023-07-23 23:59:37
" we wanted to see the hiroshima and nagasaki explosions recreated in cgi

no thank you that is very wellworn territory",2023-07-21 21:07:33
"we all came for the atomic explosion so why have it in the middle poor structuring imo 

well i came in to watch a biopic and having the explosion in the middle makes sense since well he lived a quite some time after that",2023-07-21 21:18:49
" we all came for the atomic explosion

well i didnt and i wasnt let down",2023-07-21 21:06:07
its called oppenheimer not hiroshima the movie is about the life of the man not the dropping of the bombs which he didnt do anyway his role was the process through which it was created the testing and the fallout,2023-07-21 21:25:21
the point of not showing it was to mirror oppenheimer’s perspective after he had lost all control and involvement it’s mirroring his loss of control and lack of power and the movie is about him not the bomb or the bombing,2023-07-21 21:54:11
"i strongly disagree the last third postatomic bomb was my favourite section of the movie and i most definitely did not need to see hiroshima or nagasaki recreated 

this film was not about the aftermath in japan so only showcasing the japanese horror would have been incredibly insensitive and plain gratuitous 

this film was not about the bomb it was about the man",2023-07-21 21:22:30
i don’t think you speak for most people at all this film was about the man and not the atom bomb and for that it was amazing,2023-07-21 21:21:21
1 from me,2023-07-21 21:01:56
"or maybe your opinion is just different have you ever considered that possibility 

the amount of people who feel they have the objective good taste is pretty funny",2023-07-24 07:38:12
or more likely you are just trying to have a different opinion no reason that you have to think a movie is good but there is no point in trying to  other people’s enjoyment,2023-07-24 06:40:10
just because you didn’t think it was a good movie doesn’t mean other will agree some people have taste,2023-07-24 07:34:03

 final act was the only good thing about fantastic visuals and perfect encapsulation of oppenheimers guilt perfectly delayed after the trinity test plus the final cross examination by john conner was beautifully done other than that its a slog 

you cant have a poorly placed movie with little to no interesting conflict or tense drama it ruins the film if you dont have pacing you dont have a movie your writing means little if it isnt engaging",2023-08-02 11:57:34

it was his worst imo,2023-07-21 06:35:51

why oppenheimer wasnt there",2023-07-21 21:45:15
i imagine they didnt make much of an effort to keep whos who fresh after the initial introduction is because almost every character is a major historical figure that gets constantly talked about in every class that covers ww2 be a bit like if they kept reintroducing characters in a sequel we know them already no need to waste screen time in return of the jedi going ah hello luke skywalker guy who blew up the death star every time he appears,2023-07-21 21:50:52

incredible you missed the entire point,2023-07-23 06:45:39
its a biopic about oppenheimer lol losing his security clearance was a pretty big deal,2023-07-23 06:37:30
its not about his security clearance its about his loss of control the inner turmoil he experiences and his realization that he created a chain reaction that he cant control and how reckless that may have been,2023-07-23 06:55:57
then it would have ended on huzzah we killed a bunch of japanese and oppenheimer feels bad about it which isnt really third act catharsis material nor i expect the point that nolan wanted to make with the movie,2023-07-23 06:40:30

"not a dude and getting to the point where i might no longer be considered young here also genuinely don’t remember if i’ve seen any marvel movies which ones are those again

anyway i enjoyed it a lot  i have a few criticisms it’s about 20 too long not sure i cared that much about the strauss plot line most of the sexnudity felt gratuitous and parts of it came off as a bit cheesytoo onthenose but those are mostly fairly minor on the other hand the frenetic pacing was very effective for me and i really liked the complicated and nuanced portrayal of oppenheimer’s moral psychology and how it interacted with and came to be shaped by the political and institutional forces surrounding him it’s what i was promised and what i got it is possible to genuinely enjoy that kind of stuff you know",2023-08-06 06:07:06

to be fair plenty of characters both male and female were pretty underdeveloped here the movie was trying to take on too much,2023-07-23 15:16:36
i thought his wife could of been fleshed out more i went to the bathroom during one of his ex scenes and when i came back 5mins later he was with his new wife and i felt they never really showed her she just kinda popped in scenes like when she goes to the woods scene i didt really feel like it was powerful because it didt show that much of there relationship,2023-07-23 16:02:22
he doesnt push the button the button was the abort switch in case the voltage for the trigger or something along those lines dropped below 1 volt,2023-07-24 13:07:22
thats the whole point of the film in the ending as einstein refers to america betrayed oppenheimer they tried to defame and humiliate him,2023-07-25 06:10:52
the movie didnt explicitly say so because thats not how it works most people arent bad or good but a mix of both oppenheimer achieved something brilliant even though he knew that it would be used for a terrible purpose and justified it with flawed reasoning saving american soldiers preventing further war and then wrestled with his decision for the rest of his life whether that makes him a bad person is up to each person to decide its not up to nolan to tell us,2023-07-21 06:36:27
really  they looked normal to me maybe your wife’s  are weird,2023-07-28 04:42:09

japan was not surrendering even after the first nuke they refused to do so that isnt winning

the alternative was massive bombing raids that would have killed hundreds of thousands more and destroyed most of japan

japan themselves were one of the most brutal and destructive regimes in the war look up the  of nanjing and unit 731 two of the most brutal aspects of the entire war


the nukes were the best outcome

because a conclusion is supposed to wrap up a plot,2023-07-27 02:35:19
he was a human being human beings have  if there was a purpose to it my guess is that it was another way to illustrate how oppenheimer could be careless with his relationships we also saw how he was careless and oblivious with his professional relationships and his friendships and how that caused issues he was the same with his romanticsexual relationships interestingly enough einstein was similar with his womanizing,2023-08-02 17:43:48
" why did oppenheimer need an excessive amount of nudity and  scenes

thats like asking why all the feet in tarantino movies artistic choice",2023-08-02 20:39:47

same if they really wanted to make the audience feel oppenheimers regret on making the bomb they should have showed hiroshima and the victims but nope they showed nothing very disappointed i guess they didnt want to get cancelled or whatever,2023-07-25 17:31:39
"at first i was too that they didnt talk about the firebombings they didnt show the atomic bombings they didnt show any of the actual aftermath like when hes watching the slideshow of the victims

but i think that was an extremely intentional choice on nolans part the whole point is the selfcenteredness and selfimportance of these characters warranted or not they think theyre great men but they have no control over the consequences of their actions and the world moves on without them",2023-07-25 20:21:13
dude strauss did everything he was shown doing in the movie have you read american promotheus where do your assertions come from,2023-07-21 17:23:17
"strauss was a cartoon villain in real life put aside the security clearance issue this was not covered in the movie but strauss was also instrumental in having oppies director role not renewed at the ias when he lost this role and had to move out of the housing the trustees promised to sell him a parcel of land next door to build a new home strauss actively pitted the trustees against him to have them walk back their promise to sell him land on the ias grounds to build a new home this ultimately failed in the end and jro was able to get them to sell the land to him 

i wish the movie explored a bit more on the fbi file as well strauss set it up that the file was constantly checked out and being worked on by his goons leading up to the aec hearing whose members were hand selected by strauss",2023-07-21 17:53:02

i dont think the movie portrays the uss actions as heroic,2023-07-22 08:09:51
the actions of the us are definitely condemned a corrupt non trial of a regretful national hero just because he was kinda communist and showed concern is a major part of the movie as is the debate about whether nukes were necessary and the showcase of the effects of these bombs you also get us spying on its own citizens and possibly assassinating one the whole movie is kinda a criticism of the us and just because it doesnt slate them as openly as the nazis doesnt make it not so,2023-07-22 08:25:53
"i mean i think the movie agrees with you there was a few lines about how the japanese had basically already lost and to bomb them wasnt necessary

"from oppenheimers wikipedia article

in june 1942 the us army established the manhattan engineer district to handle its part in the atom bomb project beginning the process of transferring responsibility from the office of scientific research and development to the military106 in september leslie groves was appointed director of what became known as the manhattan project107 he selected oppenheimer to head the projects secret weapons laboratory this choice surprised many because oppenheimer had leftwing political views and no record as a leader of large projects groves was concerned by the fact that oppenheimer did not have a nobel prize and might not have had the prestige to direct fellow scientists108

 groves was impressed by oppenheimers singular grasp of the practical aspects of designing and constructing an atomic bomb and by the breadth of his knowledge as a military engineer groves knew that this would be vital in an interdisciplinary project that would involve not just physics but also chemistry metallurgy ordnance and engineering groves also detected in oppenheimer something that many others did not an overweening ambition that groves reckoned would supply the drive necessary to push the project to a successful conclusion isidor rabi considered the appointment a real  of genius on the part of general groves who was not generally considered to be a genius

long story short oppy wasnt the smartest guy there but the breadth of his knowledge of all aspects of the bombs construction along with his enthusiasm made him uniquely suited to run the project  you could not simply swap him out with another scientist",2023-07-24 17:19:49

crazy how people like you act like its completely incomprehensible that someone has a different opinion than you on something completely subjective especially when the problem seems to be you cant pay attention to anything that isnt spoonfed to you like a toddlers choo choo train dinner",2023-08-03 01:43:31
honestly i liked it much better in my second viewing i thought it was ok the first time but got a bit lost too trying to piece the storylines and timelines together on the second time everything was much clearer in my head and i could enjoy the other aspects of the film more including a lot of subtle details i didn’t catch before,2023-08-03 05:12:20

well made but not for me is true of most of nolans movies in this case the sound and the fury annihilated the dialogue even in the 1570 imax that i saw today at graumans chinese theater which visually was not all that stunning either exterior sequences were gray and washed out ill watch it again at home on my computer screen with headphones and subtitles to try and make sense of it excellent performances when you could hear what the  characters were saying to one another too many quibbles to list beyond that,2023-07-22 06:24:02

its strange how antisemitism is a theme in the story and yet its so blatantly crass with the holy book of hinduism can someone do this with the quran or torah no nolan would have had to publicly apologize while being cancelled by the jewish community hed literally have a fatwa issued in his name a prize on his head if it were the quran

"i really dont like it when people pigeon hole others into saying if you didnt like it it means you didnt get it type sayings its insulting and implies you dont have the same level of intelligence as a viewer as others

thats not necessarily the case i just arrived home from the cinema and am a huge christopher nolan fan and can confidently say this would be this is one of my least favorite movies of his thats not because i didnt get it i just found the pacing to be disjointed 

the three people i went with all checked their phones after the explosion wondering when it would end due to the lack of enticement ive never experienced this in a nolan film and dont use the runtime as an excuse because thats been louded in many reviews and by the actors as not being noticeable 

i found the start to be great like you mentioned discovering the possibilities of creating the bomb and the science behind it to moving out into the desert but once the testing phase is carried out the movie just dries up and theres a twist that is thrown in there for the sake of having one and is completely unnecessary i know nolan likes to have them in there
but it drags the movie on for another hour i feel like this movie was just layered to much and didnt keep the viewer engaged enough to go back for previous viewings to catch all the details missed
like you would with a previous nolan hit

on the other hand if you only saw the movie because of the memesbro really the hype was because of the memes predicting oppenheimer and the barbie movies would be like some other two movies that came out on the same day and had huge turn outs i forgot what the two movies were

if you didnt and were genuinely curious about the movie i guess maybe you should have read something about oppenheimer or the manhattan project before hand so you werent confused",2023-07-25 23:06:50

i could hear the dialogue well theres just a ton of it to digest hopefully you have a background on 20th century history which will help,2023-07-21 08:12:24
black and white is what definitely happened while what’s in color takes a few more historical liberties,2023-07-21 07:36:29
trinity test done very well movie was everything i expected it to be visuals very striking audio design with the exception of some dialogue is toptier there is no traditional mushroom cloud explosion,2023-07-21 10:02:11

standard 70mm was amazing trying to see 70mm imax next,2023-07-24 02:20:19
i dont think theres much to explain  its there because it happened and i guess just to give an insight into oppenheimer being a complicated character,2023-07-25 00:23:11
he hated his teacher and tried to poison him and had second thoughts,2023-07-25 00:22:25
just went to this theater and there were no previews before the showing of oppenheimer hope this helps,2023-07-25 17:26:57
i have not attended an imax 70mm screening and wont be able to but pretty sure they are not showing any previews before those screenings it starts promptly at start time so get there early,2023-07-25 15:58:43
its pretty loud the bomb is practically nothing compared to the rest of the movie lots of musical swells and stuff i would look to see if your local theatre has a showing with closed captions or something for hearing sensitive people my local theatre does on occasion,2023-07-25 15:07:59
it was so loud our seats were vibrating which i thought was awesome,2023-07-25 19:20:45
the bomb part is towards the end of the second third of the movie but there are a lot of very loud moments i would say anyone with sensitive hearing should wait to watch it at home,2023-07-25 15:09:22
for me the sound was so irritating loud and uncomfortable that i had to put earplugs in im pretty sensitive to sound but even my completely unsensitive husband agreed that it was very loud it isnt just the volume though there are sections where the sound i refuse to call it music is so disorganized and chaotic that it made my brain itch,2023-07-25 16:27:52
the bomb scene was quite but everything else was unnecesarily loud imo i dont have sensitive hearing but even i was getting uncomfortable with how loud everything was,2023-07-25 17:34:02
love the movie but it was overly loud in spots blowing up the first atomic bomb gets you a pass for that scene but the other times it happened were unnecessary imo i also saw this with a person w sensitive hearing in imax and she had her fingers in her ears frequently though the movie,2023-07-25 18:18:45
its extremely loud in places the noise serves a purpose each time  often highlighting internal turmoil  but i think it is often deliberately uncomfortable,2023-07-25 19:02:07
hmmm have you tried using earplugs its absolutely no problem to have those on for loud events such as theatersconcerts and i found them to be useful enough when my tinnitus spikes got bad when i worked at a theater,2023-07-25 15:39:10
oppenheimer met strauss after his work on the manhattan project his work was the very reason he was so renowned by then and why strauss was offering him the position,2023-07-27 14:30:38
and the two narratives were called fission and fusion in the hbomb a fission reaction is what sets off the fusion reaction,2023-07-24 03:55:49
i dont think the movie was suggesting they happened at the same time though in strauss black and white scenes where hes explaining what happened with oppenheimer to the prpolitical handler guy hes talking about it in the past tense its not super clear when it happened but my impression was it could be measured in years i think all the jump cutting between time periods left a lot of people thinking those two things were going on at the same time when that wasnt what the film was trying to convey the way it was edited caused a lot of unnecessary confusion imo,2023-07-28 03:50:27
i think the movie was honestly pretty clear that they were not at the same time considering rdjs senate hearing repeatedly refers to the oppie inquiry as if it was something that happened not just in the past but in the past enough for rdj to have a new job and scientists to have been ruminating on it for a while,2023-08-05 07:43:26
oh yeah i know but thanks i didn’t know the specific different dates,2023-07-27 13:11:09
oppenheimer didnt engage in mutually assured destruction though the film doesnt show him influencing the scientists who would later scupper strauss bid for cabinet not against strauss not between the cancellation of his security clearance and strauss senate hearings,2023-08-09 11:45:24
then well have him killed made me chuckle,2023-07-24 03:37:43
my favorite damon line was when oppie was interrupting him about oppie’s communist beliefs and he’s like “i said allegedly” very abruptly  idk what it was but that  flowed so well,2023-07-25 01:32:15
he channeled just the right amount of mark watney for this role,2023-07-23 01:22:46
i really enjoyed the dynamic between groves and oppie they almost seemed like buddies that love to rag on each other but still have a lot of respect at the same time,2023-07-27 03:03:48

my dad reacted to the one liners with a classic heh an approval,2023-07-28 14:57:38
my favorite was when he exploded at that one scientist for being so whiny about going to los alamos and hes just like cause its the most  important thing in your life and walks away he did a great job,2023-12-26 08:33:01
was his yelling when trying to convince that scientist about this being the most important thing in the world supposed to be comical it kinda seemed that way with how suddenly intense that approach was,2023-07-23 22:06:23
i thought the funniest one was when when he says thats not true richard never found out because i might have missed it in the movie though i dont think it was shown i didnt know that he had been banging ruth the entire time,2023-07-22 15:19:42
for me it was the line about graves strauss being a self made man and oppy replying “i can relate to that my father was one”,2023-07-25 22:00:51
"you should worry about his discretion when he leaves this place

oh well have him killed",2023-07-23 22:11:20
at times like this i appreciate being in a nonnative english speaking country every english movie in theaters compulsorily has subtitles usually i hate them but here i was thankful,2023-07-28 06:37:57
" it was that bad in your theatre i surprisingly had very little issues with the dialogue there are times where it was a little low but i believe nolan does that to get you to focus unfortunately it doesn’t work in theatres were the audio isn’t the greatest 

tenant was hilariously bad though",2023-07-29 02:14:43
yeah i agree i heard a couple of people complaining how hard it was to hear the dialogue as well ,2023-07-30 01:54:52
nope those physicists were just  like rabbits they were in a manufactured town in the middle of nowhere with little else to do when work was over for the day also it was a pretty ideal place to raise kids they knew they would be there for multiple years there’s zero crime and they would be raised around some of the smartest people in the world,2023-07-25 20:53:50
wasn’ the opposite i thought the quote was “we had 80 births last year and this year we’re at 10 a month” or something which would explain oppenheimer’s reply and subsequently visible pregnant wife,2023-07-25 11:14:37
i figure it was the stress of the project getting to everyone,2023-07-25 06:27:43
yer  weird pal,2023-07-24 06:44:12
what,2023-07-24 01:49:19
you can feel it a bit after trinity when oppenheimer asks if he can come to washington with the general and he just responds “why” the government no longer needed oppenheimer and that little line felt really heavy to me,2023-07-22 15:17:53
it works great in contrast to the scene where everything is laid on oppies shoulders when chevalier or lawrence tells him you are important like the weight of that truth just sitting on him and strauss just almost wishing he had that meanwhile its killing oppie inside,2023-07-22 04:31:20
like when truman told him you built it i dropped it in japan as a way to give oppenheimer little credit on the whole thing,2023-07-23 12:59:46
i also think this is one of the major themes of the movie and an unexpected one,2023-07-22 19:34:38
"not basking in selfimpotance

missing an r or deliberate",2023-07-22 05:29:50

his selfimportant vindictive nature was evident within the movie but he is also completely correct when he blows his lid to his advisors about how oppenheimer never once admitted regret for hiroshima and nagasaki and that it was also his own self interest that made him start objecting",2023-08-02 15:36:14
isn’t that how twitter and the internet works feels like people always read what i say in the worst possible way online when i was just chatting and they get offended or worse,2023-07-23 00:29:11
we all do it harbor some scarecrow resentment weve conjured up in our heads over things we thought were said or thought about us good stuff,2023-08-01 23:07:20
strauss was angry because he didnt do what he wanted,2023-07-30 11:06:15
but you can see some nuance  there was a point in time where oppie refers to him as a lowly shoe salesman which offended strauss but is also a generally elitist and insensitive thing to say other characters also mention oppies arrogance though i dont think it really came across on screen,2023-08-27 23:31:23
i recognized his face but didn’t put a name to it until afterwards he was really good,2023-07-22 08:04:43
nolan movies always make me tear up it’s the masterclass of his filmmaking,2023-07-23 02:36:28
i thought it was a bit too on the nose to spell it out verbally and then show it,2023-08-06 04:14:37
i actually thought he was weakest actor in the film but the film was filled to to the brink with amazing actors in any case,2023-07-25 17:48:40
huh heel turn is a crazy statement imho i wouldnt call it subtle that he was against him for at least half of the rdj secens,2023-07-22 23:40:54
yeah a few lines of dialogue stick out like that in this movie just a little too on the nose,2023-08-07 01:33:22
i could have done without that character as a whole honestly,2023-07-22 12:17:39
yeah he shares the calculations around when he started the project the scene at the end with einstein occurs when oppenheimer first meets rdj at princeton which takes place after the bombs are dropped it’s a flashback scene shown a second time from a different perspective,2023-07-24 00:35:51
no it was the first time strauss and oppenheimer met but oppenheimer and einstein had known each other for a long time before that their line of work meant they were often running into each other all those guys knew each other,2023-07-25 22:20:37
i think its more like his narcissism confusing them shunning him due to his treatment of oppenheimer with oppenheimer turning them against him in order to justify his treatment of oppenheimer to himself and his aides,2023-07-28 07:00:42
theres also the fact that nolan loves to reuse actors hes worked with before  that 5 min role might lead to a 2 hour role in a future nolan movie,2023-07-21 21:07:40
i believe actors are honored to be part of these movies for scorsese anderson nolan,2023-07-23 12:32:18
but oldman already has that and a more meaty role as well im sure in his case it was nolan asking for a favour of him,2023-07-23 01:16:34
which is funny cause 23 of those actors can technically already be considered nolan vets casey might be a bit of a stretch but i still feel like it counts,2023-07-23 01:22:30
i feel like josh peck  a  to get in that movie lol,2023-07-25 05:34:01
as an actor i agree with the looper,2023-07-25 04:44:30
and he looked like he could,2023-07-22 05:40:32
pash is terrifying,2023-07-22 15:53:14
i was telling my wife that you can kind of see some of robert downey jrs mannerisms that he used with tony stark then i said you have actors like gary oldman that completely inhabit a character didn’t find out to later that he had played truman even with all the close up shots i couldn’t put my finger on who he was while watching,2023-07-23 02:03:48
i quitely loled when i saw it was gary oldman went from playing churchill to now playing truman wont be surprised if he completes the wwii big three set and plays stalin next,2023-07-27 13:06:27
i nearly leo memed in the theater when it hit me,2023-07-24 18:13:58
  damnit how does he do that,2023-07-25 22:21:56
seriously i didn’t know until this comment the man is a chameleon,2023-07-24 03:13:16
 this is sirius black all over again for me,2023-07-25 21:02:42
the twist he brings about is incredible i genuinely didn’t see it coming,2023-07-22 15:53:33
i’m not even a fan of him and his performance gave me goosebumps just no bs straight to the point performed it perfectly,2023-07-23 01:06:42
dude is elliotmr robot in everything,2023-07-23 05:59:14
"i get the opposite impression he always feels like he is playing the same character

unless you were being sarcastic",2023-07-23 00:50:57
i knew in the back of my mind that hed have to have some kind of big scene the way they teased him but for a little bit there i was thinking how funny would it be if josh peck had more lines in a movie than rami malek,2023-07-27 01:23:09
yeah i was like wait a sec is that gilderoy lockhart,2023-07-29 20:45:02
" gary oldman was in this 

 oh my  i didnt recognise him

two of the most common things said about him",2023-07-23 00:14:03
and he killed it too he was so effective,2023-07-23 22:08:11
seems pretty unnecessary,2023-08-01 06:38:53
i forgot he was in the movie and didnt notice him,2023-07-23 11:35:16
dion but yes lol,2023-07-22 17:43:12
he was truman,2023-07-24 17:09:28
he’s like gene parmesan,2023-08-19 06:00:37
"boy would you hate the greatest story ever told then

edit i also somewhat agree more just that it’s not necessary than anything",2023-07-26 04:58:34
i know the movie was trying to portray truman as a  in this scene but i was on his side the president is the one who actually had to make the call to drop the bomb and live with the decision stop feeling sorry for yourself oppenheimer,2023-07-23 23:00:00
i did too just as he went to new mexico with emily blunt did i miss any oppenheimer  scenes,2023-07-22 23:35:38
use the app “runpee” been a game changer for me for years,2023-07-24 20:56:24
i planned on doing it but just held it the whole time in fact in my row of 8 or 9 people i could see left and right of me literally nobody got up at all the whole movie in fact i don’t even remember anyone in the two rows in front getting up either it’s actually insane thinking back on it never had anything close to that happening,2023-07-22 07:50:25
judging from some of the comments i believe i decided to take a  break at the murdersuicide scene as i dont remember that at all,2023-07-23 13:51:25
not a single person got up to  in my theater i was amazed at the collective bladder control,2023-08-02 03:09:53
not sure if theres any good time during this movie to go  i saw it yesterday and went as soon as casey affleck started talking and that was apparently a mistake,2023-08-20 19:10:50
i went after the bomb test when i got back they’d bombed japan,2023-08-12 20:50:08
i just took a leak on the guy in front of me guy was so enthralled in cillians performance he didnt seem to notice lol,2023-08-22 08:23:13
i wish i did that i held my  for the last 30 mins worth it but it did kind of distract me from being in the moment lol,2023-08-09 11:12:57
they really must have had to go you knew that scene was happening for a while probably for the best that sound wave would have made them  a little if they really couldn’t hold it,2023-07-24 01:07:20
yep anytime i go to see one of these 253 hour juggernauts i try not to drink anything an hour prior to the movie doesn’t always work out but it helps for sure,2023-07-25 20:03:54
yep been going into movies dehydrated as  recently but its worth it to not have to squirm lol,2023-11-11 04:58:37
i was honestly about to leave in the last 15 minutes i loved the film but figured i could catch it again on streaming the strauss stuff was obviously important to the overall story but to be honest i felt like i saw a very complete film after they did the test,2023-08-07 14:36:43
"i am honestly shocked they dont have intervals

i did a barbenheimer double feature today and oppenheimer was clearly the better movie",2023-07-28 16:05:02
i want to see it again in an empty theater i’m glad i got to see it early but there were too many distractions,2023-07-22 14:39:09
good luck finding a ticket that isn’t front row i live close to one of the few imaxes showing it in 70mm sold out for over a month except the front row,2023-07-24 18:12:28
those people exist in imax too,2023-08-06 08:03:08
bless this app i tell everyone about it,2023-07-24 05:04:07

geez id be so  ,2023-07-25 13:13:48
in the us they used to have these breaks but that was decades ago for some reason they stopped doing it around the 1970’s i think,2023-08-14 02:05:03
yeah i have managed to see the return of the king extended cut on a cinema without needing a toilet break ,2023-08-31 11:33:43
you listened to someone on here regarding when to take a toilet break and call them a “”,2023-07-29 05:09:25
i know him from numb3rs way back in the day,2023-07-23 00:54:38
the deuce is superb,2023-07-25 13:49:12
seriously lol,2023-08-07 15:01:46
not this big i don’t think,2023-07-24 11:49:02
which one,2023-07-28 20:20:59
perfectly captured a very real aspect of the american population and system men like him armed and trained death squads got the us into direct partnerships with fascist governments and killedruined untold numbers of people around the globe who even flirted with left wing concepts,2023-07-23 03:10:13
the guy who earlier fought the bolsheviks,2023-07-22 18:18:50
ayo,2023-07-23 08:24:27
i had know idea that was hartnett told my wife i needed to look up who the actor was due to him reminding me of josh hartnett after being stung by a bee,2023-07-29 00:31:15
honestly the only 2 wtfs i had about looks were hartnett and oldman i think hartnett looks great as an older guy though,2023-07-28 23:50:28
"i’m reminded by v sauce’s video about fear and what scares us the most or more specifically what terrorizes us is ambiguity it’s why a lot of people don’t like clowns masks even mannequins because we’re not sure if there’s a threat it’s that tense inability to discern what to do between fight or flight

it’s the dead cold smile keeping up appearances and being able to say exactly the right thing to convey both security and the potential for great violence every question they ask or statement they make is equally sincere and threatening they have just enough charisma that the one being interrogated knows they’re in a test of some sort a test that other more gullible people have clearly fallen for given the characters titles and achievement and you’ll notice these characters always have a reputation that precedes them

just fascinating to watch actors do that",2023-08-08 21:20:38
bullseye or nadeem,2023-08-04 10:22:00
"oppenheimer told the military man at school that the gov needed to survey someone the military man either ran it up the chain or knew pash and told him either way pash was notified and came for the meeting the next day to hear it himself pash was the head of surveillance for the manhattan project and was intentionally kept away from oppenheimer prior to this

oppenheimer then told as much as he felt he could to pash but also lied to protect his friend who acted as the intermediary in asking him to share secrets with the commies and commit treason that meeting was recorded and was later used against oppenheimer in his security classification hearing at the end of the movie",2023-07-29 22:16:57
he has range as seen by his previous work don’t think  get typecast,2023-07-23 06:51:24
you should see the tv broadcast when he was announcing the bombing he was laughing,2023-07-27 10:50:13
i mean if you think about it from truman’s perspective he was engaged in total war with an enemy that would make america bleed for every inch of their island his hand is forced to make a massive scale trolly problem decision to slam the door shut on ww2 and save hundreds of thousands of lives and this scientist who’s been completely separated from the day to day decision making of the war and the weight of the presidency narcissistically makes the call all about him,2023-07-24 05:27:15
"i mean when oppenheimer said he had blood on his hands he was accusing truman who made the decision to use the bomb i can understand why truman took offense  and i understand why people today have a different perspective 

i think the movie overstated the amount of angst about using the bomb at the time maybe the scientific community was worried but the politicians and military and the vast majority of the public were ecstatic

today far removed from the war and having seen the arms race that resulted we have a very different perspective",2023-08-12 14:43:42
pretty sure theres an even harsher version of the quote that he may have said never bring that  cretin in here again he didnt drop the bomb i did,2023-08-18 14:07:21
he called him a  cretin i believe,2023-08-09 13:26:21
truman was right,2023-07-22 00:53:37
america went from obama to trump we have always been a country of extremes and likely always will be,2023-07-31 03:20:23
"you don’t get to write your name in the history books by building a bomb and then feeling sorry that it killed people because it was used 

the creation of the abomb was inevitable but it’s eventual manifestation doesn’t release one from the responsibility you committed to by participating in the project to bring it into existence oppenheimer in principle does not even get the honor of being the „father“ of the abomb others thought of it and far more significant people signed of on its creation oppenheimer was a weapons smith and handed people a bomb who ordered them from him he was just the person who had been decided upon to lead the group of inventors history remembers him because he was charismatic enough to be likeable while also dropping a bit of translated sanskrit that emphasizes his participation as well as a  dropping a quote from bohemian rapsody 

if you want to be really cruel to the person that was oppenheimer you could judge him by being just another american that killed a great bunch of other people and it hurt his feelings incredibly deep the only redeeming quality to him was acknowledging that an arms race should be stopped",2023-07-23 23:28:28
same thing happened at steph curry’s first practice his freshman year at davidson,2023-07-25 05:48:44
is there some reason why truman pushing north koreans out after their invasion of south korea is somehow a near genocide or are you referring to the misdeeds of the south korean government,2023-08-04 22:16:25
what ahistorical nonsense,2023-08-26 11:53:00
"you can be right and an a 

sure he was the one who dropped it but you think the guy who invented the bomb cant feel guilty about it",2023-07-23 15:46:15
lol comments like this in here make me despair for some of you people,2023-07-29 14:16:51

"but it actually happened 

just like alan turing oppenheimer saved the world while also starting a chain reaction that may eventually end it i wonder if the writers of endgame used history as a writing aid",2023-07-26 14:14:25
i said this exact thing coming out of the theater they even did the superhero name drop trope when a scene ends with dialogue between two characters bleeding over into the establishing shot of the next scene and the last line is something like well you know if you want to solve that problem you gotta go see superhero name drop here  they did it with heisenberg,2023-07-30 10:15:58
the bit about him watching the trinity test through his truck windshield reasoning that the glass would block the uv light is also an anecdote he liked to tell,2023-07-24 04:17:41

can you elaborate i remember the ripples on the pond tatlock drowning in a bathtub 10 feet vs 1000 feet was there anything else,2023-07-23 22:33:31
the ripples representing the shockwaves of nuclear weapons detonating one after the other,2023-07-21 14:02:58
i took it also also a callback to the quantum realm like the cutaways at the beginning of the film,2023-07-24 03:56:21
it’s happening i’m cumbusting,2023-07-22 07:36:53
after i thought he was reading it during gyrations,2023-07-23 03:58:47
it was kind of ridiculous,2023-07-22 06:00:18
not after he was done during completion she stops in the middle gets the book climbs back on asks him to read it cut to explosion,2023-07-23 02:25:30
guess he must have seen the trinity detonation as the ultimate climax the entire rest of the movie is him having lifelong postnut clarity,2023-07-25 16:49:59

no wonder that line was burned into his head,2023-07-31 05:35:59
honestly the stakes of nailing her are that high so i get him,2023-07-26 02:07:47
technically she was nailiing him,2023-08-17 03:08:57
i swear i saw some  when there is the hallucination of them having  in the hearing all shaft and balls though not the best  angle,2023-07-23 02:27:11

oppenheimer was a total pillow princess she was trying to find something that he’d react to his silence beforehand is what women talk about when we say men don’t moan enough in bed,2023-07-23 20:13:14

i am become deaf",2023-07-22 12:08:44
seriously it felt like they mostly had contempt for eachother,2023-07-22 07:42:30
yeah the first 45 minutes when they mainly focused on the romantic interests in his life were so poorly done i legit thought the movie would be a disaster thank goodness the rest of the film was near top notchif not for the difficult way the dialogue was presented at times,2023-07-24 03:04:45
and the way women are portraited,2023-07-24 05:48:06
its interesting how a movie like this one falls flat in that regard while his science fiction epics inception interstellar have some really great emotional moments,2023-07-27 14:26:15
that will stick with me for a long time,2023-07-22 06:28:23
i thought it was supposed to be cold not something that is necessarily true i constantly feel bad for people after they create horrible situations for themselves it just makes me sad that something influenced them in life to make the decisions they did,2023-07-25 04:34:43
oh boy i see this quote being relevant in a lot of circumstances in our modern age especially in relationships,2023-07-28 14:29:50
i love how she shook him before and the look she gave him when she said everyone here is depending on you always have loved emily blunt and she like everyone else acted her  off in this one,2023-08-09 11:18:07
what sin was she referring to tho cheating,2023-07-22 09:33:32
you dont get to commit to sin ,2023-07-27 17:41:42
"yeah that line was ringing through my ears the whole time hes on trial 

this whole film really is a struggle between him committing the sin and us feeling sorry for him i dont think ive ever had such an even mix of animosity and sympathy for a reallife figure on film",2023-07-23 20:59:29
not similar at all carmela signed up for the goomars and knew the deal shes not one bit sympathetic,2023-07-22 21:08:28
"i noticed that too

i also remember someone in the movie telling another person to go  in your hat i think it was oppenheimer telling groves to tell it to someone else",2023-08-17 00:54:20
exactly what i thought about thank you i thought i was alone on this,2023-08-20 11:01:05
mostly right except she says tar and feather you and it made me laugh coz it was rather british and it reminded me of blunt and krasinskis funny mockarguments on youtube about us vs uk,2023-10-18 09:12:33
yep but it’s a metaphor as well for the bomb too,2023-07-21 20:41:08
yeah that’s why she said he was doing a sin,2023-08-30 23:01:52
tbh if you removed all instances of female characters in the film it would have been better they added nothing at best and were cringe and almost caricature like at worst,2023-07-22 13:10:23
glad i wasn’t the only one who cried i’m heavily pregnant and all i could think during that scene was how terrifying a world i was bringing someone into that mankind could create such incredible but terrible things it’s the first time i’ve ever had to close my eyes during a movie an incredible scene,2023-07-30 03:31:43
it made me want to rewatch grave of the fireflies while it centers on the firebombing of tokyo instead of the abomb it nonetheless still horrifying and shows how the us reacted to the nth degree,2023-08-07 14:49:39
the absolutely existential terror he experiences and then witnesses people making out under the bleachers and a woman sobbing i’m assuming somebody who was intended to be personally tied to somebody that died in ww2 or at least felt tied to them especially given his speech and experience of the moment was awe inspiring,2023-08-26 07:23:14
same  just thinking about it two days later listening to the soundtrack and tearing up again  unreal movie,2023-08-30 18:27:15
"for how insane and genocidal americans can be

i mean you can literally google unit 731the  of nanking and see how insane and genocidal a certain other country was during wwii not that makes nukes any better but dont try and act like america is some sort of naughty kid in a group of innocent kindergarteners",2023-08-06 01:31:23
i agree with you i think it’s his magnum opus  almost like only nolan could make this film in the moment i noticed several nods to his previous films football pitch bomb countdown blood on face but i got the feel most from memento the shame contradictions paranoia anxiety ego isolation and feeling of being lost in depicting science and mankind’s greatest disaster he focused deeply on the psyche at the forefront of it whose artscience imitated his life this was magnificent beyond compare,2023-07-22 09:31:17
agreed driving home i felt like i’d seen a horror film plus the brother from hereditary was in it,2023-08-02 00:13:49
"it felt weird to me because it seemed to have switched to kitty’s perspective 

in the moments before he was  because he felt so insecure and unprepared for these invasive questions 

then the angle changes and jean is taunting kitty by  her husband out in the open there i took it as kitty’s imagination and that’s weird because no other part of the film is told from her perspective 

that’s my issue with the scene and i’m hoping someone can reframe it so i like it better",2023-07-26 19:16:55
what took me out is you could literally see cillian was wearing shorts in the shot from the tableside,2023-07-25 04:35:58
"it was but i thought intentionally so and i enjoyed it for that it was far from sexy i think without that then we dont really know how awful it must have been for kitty her sitting there listening to her husband openly talk about sleeping with another woman whilst married whilst a room full of older men listen completely and utterly humiliating and horribly uncomfortable

i think the way nolan directed that scene put is in kittys shoes far more and really highlighted how horrible that moment was for her and how oppenheimers actions regarding the appeal didnt only affect himself i think kittys defiant answers later on are less impactful if we dont get that visceral display of how uncomfortable the process was for her",2023-07-26 19:29:31
thats what i had expected dont worry darling would be,2023-08-11 23:17:21
nolan tends to bring back actresses i could see her starring in a future nolan flick,2023-07-25 05:23:08
"nolan literally doesnt know how to write and direct women its a recurring problem for him to the point most of his recent movies have a cast of 95 men

at least with his movie we had emily blunt as kitty and they easily made his best female character to date she legit has a shot at the oscar",2023-08-01 03:38:26
wasted yet still slayed her conversations with murphy and especially that shot of her riding him in the hearing were excellent its a shame how underutilized the women were all two of them but they were both tremendous performances if too brief,2023-07-24 03:32:57

i can see that interesting that every other shot depicting oppenheimer’s internal state like his speech to the crowd was highly stylized but felt less incongruous,2023-07-24 11:41:56
they put the line during a  scene which is the sign of a great movie,2023-07-22 23:37:45
yeah my uncreative mind would have just stuck that irl footage before the credits lol nolan did it way better while still adding that line a few times in the movie,2023-07-22 04:54:36
idk man ending with the real tape of him saying it would have been pretty  sick as well,2023-07-25 02:45:35
your comment reminded me of dr strangelove’s ending that was a montage of nuclear bomb explosions set to “we’ll meet again”,2023-07-27 02:52:49
they did say it twice ,2023-08-04 23:32:53
the movie should have ended soon after the extra hour of a senate hearing and trial was really overkill,2023-07-23 22:51:40
you guys are so cringe lol,2023-07-23 08:04:20
and that singular leaders have the power to launch them like there ain’t even really a true prevention system — would potentially just take a single maniac in a single moment,2023-07-22 03:29:21
honestly i’m shaken when you think about it nukes have inly existed since the 40s that’s not even 100 years the moment it got invented was the moment we doomed ourselves,2023-07-22 07:37:38
i would have liked a more visceral depiction of the effects of the bomb in his visions but im glad they had that moment where theyre watching the vids,2023-07-24 11:50:39
i think part of it is that we have so much post apocalyptic media that a lot of people seem to think that theyd be the ones to survive instead of one of the ones to immediately be vaporized within 10 minutes of wwiii starting,2023-07-24 16:53:05
wow you’re so much more intelligent than other people blessed that you divined yourself into this revelation,2023-08-01 23:47:49
it was the same thing in my theatre when i watched today usually you hear the rustling and fussing of people getting out of their seats as soon as the credits hit but there was a palpable silence and pause after this one,2023-07-22 14:49:53
prepare for this line to haunt you you’ll see some tweet about ukraine or notice an album cover with a mushroom cloud and then out of the back of your brain you’ll hear this line i’m a little scared the affect of this line on society from an existential dread perspective,2023-07-21 20:31:59
nolan did a great job reminding me how a push of a button could end the world as we know it,2023-07-27 04:16:01
i had the same expression as einstein after i watched the movie it feels like what is going to happen to the world now,2023-07-25 01:20:18
that’s a perfect comparison honestly,2023-07-25 06:41:14
"the scene that followed after with explosions devouring our planet shell shocked me i was speechless for some time  i mean literally speechless did not talk to my friend on my way back home

nolan at his absolute peak 

and yes this was like a horror movie at some point the speech scene was scarier than some horror movies i have seen in recent years",2023-07-21 09:33:12
yup you were right,2023-07-21 11:27:27
in some ways oppenheimer deserved to be called out for the mistakes he made but it’s made crystal clear that he’s always been that troubled depressed individual that wanted to prove himself it’s pretty telling that the people that he finds comfort in are scientists more often than his own wife,2023-07-22 06:02:16
i felt the exact same i saw the movie with a friend and after the credits rolled i was grappling for words and we both were speechless on our way out to the cars i told her “we gotta dig into this movie later but right now i feel like i just need to go cry”,2023-07-22 19:40:54
"my partner and i definitely cried a fair bit at the end and walking home afterwards whole time watching theres just this immensity of emotion which is hard to describe

i think it hit me in a very particular way since i relate in some ways to portions of oppenheimers journey in rarher personal ways i studied physics and maths and now im finishing my phd on solar geoengineering an area that other grad students in the field have likened kinda to working on the manhattan project much less intense obviously but for climate change 

theres nothing that terrifies me more than the idea of contributing to something i feel and hope will be for the best but may actually turn out existentially terrible for the planet",2023-07-22 12:00:34
i did cry so did multiple people in my showing that ending just…breaks you,2023-07-22 03:35:20
i felt weird too i felt like i was about to cry but i have no idea why the final scene between opp and ein was just perfect,2023-07-22 03:56:33
"i felt nothing we’ve lived with that bomb for nearly 80 years we’ve found a way to make it work thank  america had it to hold the communists accountable look at russia today and you can see why we had to counter balance against crazy 

movie left me proud of what we can do when we don’t let red tape and politics get in the way of innovation 2 billion well spent",2023-07-25 03:22:19
"i honestly felt like crying when it was over not even completely understanding why

thats exactly how i felt i was full of emotion yet i couldnt articulate where or why i was felling such sadness i had such an emotional hangover the next day saw it sat eve where my tears spilled but the weight of the film hasnt left my mind",2023-08-07 13:23:44
"apparently oppenheimer at one point did travel by train meeting someone who he talked with by a lake about his concern of igniting the atmosphere the conversation even had the line of better being enslaved by nazis than destroying humanity but it was not with einstein it was arthur compton

at least if this video on the topic is to be believed i have admittedly not driven into the sources

i highly suspect the talk at the end about a chain reaction beyond igniting the atmosphere was fully made up but i dont really care it made one  of an ending regardless and wonderfully tied together what the movie had set up",2023-07-24 01:36:14
thank you posters are acting like this movie woke them up to this new hypothetical weapon when we have much stronger bombs today yet here we sit at movies free and happy yet here we are with japan and germany as close allies considering what could have happened shot really worked out for mankind,2023-07-25 03:24:32
the cold war thousands and thousands of fissionfusion weapons aimed at targets all over the world,2023-07-23 21:15:59
the first shot was rain on a pond,2023-07-22 17:47:17
symbolism of the them starting with einstein and in the end out of his or even oppenheimers hands,2023-07-23 02:35:30
lol drop the username if you dont mind,2023-07-22 03:34:28
i thought of the exact same thing about the ripples when i watched its not them its you,2023-08-19 21:21:58
" kitty did not give an inch not even robb could touch her calm and yet alert to every nuance she was undoubtedly a better witness than the husband she was defending

this is exactly how i felt after the scene was finished emily blunt demolished that entire scene as i truly felt kitty was better at defending her husband than himself",2023-07-21 20:47:12
"kitty embodies bad  to a t and it shows

she dealt chairman gray’s  with such grace",2023-07-21 13:23:40
far and away blunts best scene she seemed kind of wasted the rest of the film,2023-07-22 19:41:45
"something i agreed with kitty about and couldn’t quite piece together is why oppenheimer let them roll over him in the hearing

all he said when asked was “i have my reasons”

why didn’t he fight like kitty asked him to there are some times where he gets somewhat stirred but he mostly takes the blows and lies on the chin and asks “is anyone going to hear the truth of what’s happening here” 

if it was me i’d definitely be emotional and animated if i was faced with lies and slander was it really that he wanted to be a martyr out of his guilt",2023-07-22 19:48:20
"i love that that’s how history will remember her too she put up with the faults of her husband because she realized it was for the greater good and then she absolutely slayed it on the metaphorical grand stage during that hearing 

all great men were supported by just as great women which is just a portion of all great people are supported by comparatively great people",2023-07-26 14:09:50
“through the communist party not into it”,2023-07-22 23:07:18
and then that old guy was so happy to agree with her about the two different communist parties lol,2023-07-25 21:31:46
that explains why that scene gave her more character than just the bitter alcoholic wife she had been the whole rest of the movie nolan really struggles with writing characters but especially women,2023-07-27 04:47:00
its the classic when did you stop beating your wife question assumes facts not in evidence good for her for catching it,2023-08-12 14:47:19
but did it even matter since it was all a fake hearing,2023-07-22 21:20:08
lucky guy to have such a based wife stood by him as he went through many other women ,2023-12-26 13:23:12
i loved her character i said it here earlier but she was just there to drink hate them kids and to tell oppy to nut up,2023-07-21 08:34:43
for my own sanity i have to believe this comment is in jest…,2023-07-21 16:24:19
what a sad lens to view this wonderful world through i pity you,2023-07-23 23:43:08
i told myself i wouldn’t watch another circle  movie after the revenant but here i am,2023-08-02 03:19:21
because he betrayed her husband for personal gain,2023-07-22 19:43:11
it happened in real life too,2023-07-21 15:11:05
average redditor upon seeing a competent woman,2023-07-29 21:57:40
i was so impressed with the lack of reductive narrative i didn’t come out of the movie hating anyone or having a real hero just complicated characters,2023-07-22 06:41:26
janet was such a large piece of first man because it focuses on each of them mourning both individually and as a family both performances were stellar though and i think a lot of women who have lost children or have had to suffer for their husband’s success saw a glimpse of their own experiences in them,2023-07-24 18:43:47
"i think there are valid points to be had that in a 3 hour movie we could’ve had more depth to them sure but i also think nolan has a lot of respect for both tatlock and kitty and he shows them as almost victims of oppenheimer’s ego and personality and that he doesn’t care for them like he should 

there’s a great sympathy to their characters he mourned them as human beings who had so much to give and deserved so much better than oppenheimer tatlock in her death and kitty in the life she could have lived if her fire and her fight hadn’t been so overshadowed by oppenheimer 

nolan shows the horror of tatlock’s suicide through the directing and editing of the bathtub flashback whilst he also gives kitty these moments to say unequivocally what he thinks of oppenheimer and  him for how he treats these women 

“you don’t get to commits the sin and then ask us all to feel sorry for you when there are consequences”",2023-07-27 01:34:05
i’ve always thought she and cillian murphy look so much alike lol,2023-07-21 17:37:02
you’re very weird for saying this,2023-07-21 15:56:59
nolan’s interpretation of a mic drop,2023-07-23 05:39:17
i looooved the decision to delay bringing in the sound on that test,2023-07-23 07:01:22
same thing when i saw it today  there was like a collective sigh of relief when everyone was allowed to move after the sound came back in,2023-07-23 04:11:06
the scene where they discuss which city to bomb drew a lot of hisses and tuts from our cinema and we’re not even japanese if anything i’m glad that it seems a lot of people empathise with the japanese and grasp how totally irreversible the damage of the bomb wasis,2023-07-29 21:21:47
it was definitely not what i was expecting complete silence for most of it considering how loud the rest of the movie was that was definitely done on purpose to make it stand out more,2023-07-27 00:37:24
i kind of want to find a still of it and use it as my new desktop it’s a gorgeous shot,2023-07-22 08:16:08
i was watching it with my son and i definitely cried extremely quietly in that scene,2023-07-30 22:53:02
that there’s almost an entire hour after the bomb and it’s a lot of procedural and goes back to his marriage which i found beyond boring didn’t help but overall enjoyed it,2023-07-22 13:34:26
lol,2023-07-25 04:28:10

i could see nolan tackling the cold war where  name drop james bond,2023-07-21 05:29:20
the beginning where he is going to assemble all the scientists legit felt like watching the avengers from fury’s pov,2023-07-21 11:31:51
"seriously ive always wanted to see this  a series of biopics about various people that all use the same actors characters that interact  
like if you made a biopic about walt disney and he met julie andrews and then you make a julie andrews biopic and the same actors play those roles  

obviously theres better examples of people to do biopics of but you get the gist of the concept",2023-07-22 23:34:23
aka the universe,2023-08-13 18:07:26
this would honestly go crazy,2023-07-26 19:10:41

unironically a niels bohr movie starring kenneth branagh would be amazing its so obvious,2023-07-23 14:59:46
unironically would  love these actors getting their own movies telling their own stories give me a cinematic adaptation of the play ‘cophengan’ staring kenneth branagh and matthias schweighöfer,2023-07-25 23:51:45
please let this happen far more interesting than another damned superhero movie,2023-07-30 02:20:57
yo i would be down for that,2023-07-29 20:37:22

you should use your initials i like the way it sounds jfk,2023-07-31 14:51:13
that was feynman all through out im wondering where is that guy and there he is sitting in his car seeing the bomb go boom,2023-07-22 06:14:40
"the way they played that one it looked like nolan was setting up a sequel where strauss has now set his target on jfk for denying him his cabinet post and was actually behind the kennedy assassination 

id watch that sequel",2023-11-15 07:57:17
oh i like this angle jfk also gave him an award as president to try to rehabilitate him politically,2023-07-21 04:42:03

wait henry kissinger was in this,2023-07-21 23:11:48
wasnt he more senior in the nixon and ford era,2023-07-23 02:02:23
yeah that plus the “i am become death”  scene were so goofy that they instantly stuck out for me,2023-07-22 09:17:31
"there were also a couple scenes where a character would summarize the revelations of the last few minutes i think the counsel guy did it to strauss once “so you were behind this sabotage and did xyz” etc

to be honest i did kinda need it but could have been more subtle",2023-07-30 10:11:48
i thought it would of been great if they left it at “young senator from massachusetts trying to make a name for himself kennedy” but adding john f kennedy afterwards was a bit cringe like how dumb do you think your audience  is granted the crowd went “ooooo” after the john f part where i was and i saw it in boston so maybe he was right lol,2023-08-03 12:26:29
agreed very similar beats and feel it would be a good double feature with jfk actually going second the nod in oppenheimer could be argued as an early example of jfk pushing against the military industrial complex,2023-07-25 23:02:47
curious how you think jfk influenced oppenheimer,2023-07-27 21:28:19
"profit subsequent school quiet retire berserk arrest materialistic modern concerned

 this post was mass deleted and anonymized with redact",2023-07-22 20:28:01
this was my thought too,2023-07-23 05:48:57
and then jfk jfked all over,2023-07-21 05:24:42
did he forget this was based on real life and isnt just a hollywood movie haha,2023-07-30 14:33:44
part 3 better be stanislav petrov,2023-08-16 06:17:43
he has a waytoofamiliar voice but i thought he skated his role as well as you could ask him to “then we will have him killed” was delivered perfectly,2023-07-21 07:17:31
the martian is a role where being matt damon suited him best i also think bourne is his role where you see him as this brutal efficient spy compared to most of his roles that definitely do feel like thats matt damon,2023-07-21 09:25:27
damon is the kind of actor who just doesnt disappear into his role theres always something that remains on the surface layer that reminds you that you are watching matt damon the actor acting and it especially stands out here because this is a film full of recognizable actors who disappear into their characters completely,2023-07-21 12:35:56
the way he appears in interstellar is always so funny to me because of this first time i watched it i had no idea he was even it so nearly spit my drink out when they unzip the bag and bam matt damon is out,2023-07-21 14:40:03
that was me for 3 hours hey look it’s matt damon hey look it’s rami malek hey look it’s josh peck hey look it’s the bad guy from ghost etc etc,2023-07-22 20:55:56
to be fair im pretty sure this was a continuation of his good will hunting character  they make some comment about how hes not just a soldier but that hes an engineer from mit  its quite possible that will mastered time travel at some point and went back to start the manhattan project  hes just that smaht,2023-07-23 01:55:07
"i was close to separating matt damon from his character since he looked to me as a dumb military official character and though he did great until they dropped in mit in engineering quote 

like can matt damon just be a  in any movie is there a clause in his contract which makes it mandatory for his character to be a genius

edit cmon people you dont have to explain to me that this is a historical drama and that groves was real i was making fun on matt damon and his super genius roles",2023-07-22 07:49:14
i also love damon but youre right he played this role the same as shelby in ford v ferrari,2023-07-21 05:43:57
"matt damon

– matt damon

im just happy they didnt have to retrieve him from somewhere all those tax dollars spent",2023-07-21 23:42:42
matt damon,2023-07-21 20:09:57
soon as he showed up my first thought was jesus christ thats jason bourne,2023-07-23 21:36:48
yeah he was good but i definitely feel the same too i kinda thought similar about downey but reallyeveryone in this film is such a big name its kind of impossible to fully separate them,2023-07-23 14:05:19
"i want to agree with you but when i saw true grit i didnt know it was him until the credits rolled  hes not even disguised and again with the last duel i was most of the way through before i realized it was him more makeup that time though

i think he is incredibly underrated  hes so identifiable and yet can disappear into a role as long as its nothing like his typical persona",2023-07-24 01:07:24
i lold when josh from drake and josh had his first line so unexpected,2023-07-28 03:16:59
i think its cause like outside of the bourne series which came out ages ago he hasnt really played any super defining characters or characters in long running franchises hes always just like a guy,2023-07-23 21:36:51
i feel this way about josh peck,2023-07-24 03:24:04
"i’m the same way he had one line in this that was pure damon 

and that’s not a criticism he always shows up in good movies",2023-07-26 02:00:06
"he mostly felt like matt damon in a mustache

he wasnt bad but he didnt feel like he was playing anyone in particular for the most part",2023-07-25 04:33:41
i do too he did about a good a job as he could inhabiting his role here i almost forgot it was him a few times,2023-07-26 03:11:13
"i had this problem with robert downey jr’s character

he did a great job but by the time they started mentioning him by name near the end i was like “…who”",2023-07-27 16:18:43
team america really did matt damon dirty,2023-08-08 12:30:26
i kind of got this feeling here i love the film based on amanda knox that he was in i never felt that there,2023-07-22 03:44:07
i think he typedcast himself as matt damon,2023-07-21 21:43:47
except deadpool 2,2023-07-22 03:33:07
" like every time hes in any scene in any movie by brain wont stop saying hey look its matt damon lol

i feel this way about several actors i think sometimes their star overshadows their acting presence in a way that theyre no longer able to truly disappear into a role anymore",2023-07-22 14:56:36
agree on this but i think he mostly avoided that here nice job by him,2023-07-24 04:47:31
“ it’s jason bourne”,2023-07-24 06:53:04
dude might as well take a class at mit at this point,2023-07-27 02:54:58
i did too    i hadn’t known he was in it then i was like oh hey it’s matt damon,2023-07-27 03:58:58
samei thought he was about to sign jordan or tell treadstone hes watching them or solve a math problem in angst his best role  true grit,2023-08-02 04:32:23
i have that problem pretty much with any famous actor i always convince myself that the role im watching is what their life is actually like,2023-08-20 22:44:47
thats most films tbh look at blunt compared to the real kitty,2023-07-23 02:25:53
yeah i wish they gave him prosthetics like with gary oldman or something at least make it a little more realistic and less of a oh hey its matt damon vibe,2023-07-24 03:01:53
i also loved how nolan didn’t even show casey’s face cause he knew how recognizable his voice is second i heard it i said “casey affleck”  love his voice,2023-07-21 13:15:47
" damon was right its the best movie hes ever been in

rdj said that not damon",2023-08-21 23:02:41
yes the scene where he said it was the most important thing in the  world should have been put on a gag reel,2023-07-31 07:10:11
he had retired by then,2023-07-25 13:38:46
for multiple reasons alden ehrinreich’s last line to strauss was jawdropping as well,2023-07-22 07:53:20
or it could be argued that nuclear deterrence did work for example the ussr at the time had the largest land army in the world they may have been able to role past central europe and maybe onto western europe nuclear bombs were eventually going to be developed by the most powerful nations without seeing the devastating effects it had on japan who knows when and where it would’ve eventually been dropped,2023-07-22 11:07:57
"the bomb would have always existed the physics didnt change because that particular place and time were where it was first used on humans seeing the horror of the bomb when there were only a few in existence and we couldnt destroy the world may be what has so far kept humanity from burning

if the soviets and the us had both had time to build hundreds before everyone saw how terrible they were somebody may have decided to use them we wouldnt be here in that case",2023-07-23 00:28:47
we manufactured purple hearts before the potential invasion of japan we are still using those same purple hearts today even after the korean war vietnam gulf war iraq afghanistan etc that should give you some perspective on how deadly that war would have been,2023-07-22 20:33:26
well the bomb and its threat to the world wouldve existed regardless arguably using the bombs in japan showcased how powerful and horrible they were decreasing the risk of nuclear escalation this is in the movie too at some point oppenheimer says that the bomb needs to be used for real at least once so people know its power,2023-07-27 14:41:52
"they absolutely consider this because its one of the primary counter arguments the counter to that counter is the nuclear bomb was likely to be created anyway because science finds a way 

why not then put it in the hands of someone like the united states and its allies and build international treaties and alliances around safeguarding and counter proliferation

the second half of the 1900s was historically one of the most peaceful periods in history between major nation states it just happened a sword of damocles was hanging over humanity with the policy of mutually assured destruction",2023-07-25 02:05:47
"one thing the movie didnt get into is that japan was going to surrender soon anyway they even offered to but the us didnt like the terms then the us set their own terms japan agreed thus surrending and then the us only enforced the terms japan had originally set out

i think truman hated communism so much he spun the japan will never surrender lie to keep the scientists working so that the us would have the bomb first",2023-07-22 13:35:46
the chance is smaller because of the atomic bombings of japan nuclear weapons were always going to be made at some point imagine if the world had gone into the korean war with nuclear weapons but no real proof of the devastation they caused and instead of 2 of them there were hundreds,2023-07-27 00:51:10
the lesser or two evils is still evil a trolley problem with hundreds of thousands on either side is still a mass tragedy the likes humanity should hope to never replicate choosing the most violent possible end for hundreds of thousands of confused civilians over giving hundreds of thousands of soldiers the choice to fight or flee is certainly a choice,2023-08-13 05:18:42
there is another layer those are soldiers dying they are choosing to fight but the bombs killed innocent people children that makes it much worse you can’t equate soldiers with them,2023-07-24 22:49:25
or that japan wouldve probably surrendered without the bomb anyway,2023-07-22 16:03:43
from what this film captured hindsight is 2020,2023-07-25 01:56:26
not sure if i’m misreading your comment but he shows einstein the math of the potential “atmospheric ignition” while the bomb is in development the conversation next to the pond happens after the war,2023-07-30 10:30:29
"‘i think we did’
in reference to the original question of will we destroy the world  whether the trinity test will result in uncontrolled chain reaction setting the atmosphere on fire",2023-07-21 13:49:31
"kinda at the end of the film its being used to allude to the idea that the invention and dropping of the bomb by the us lead to a chain reaction of cause and effect that has brought us to where we are today thousands of nuclear weapons in silos all around the world and that that chain reaction is still ongoing and may yet lead to the destruction of the world

whether that makes it a metaphor or not im not sure but its certainly not being used in the same sense it was used in the rest of the film",2023-07-22 20:56:02
"yep originally they theorized that the bomb would set a literal chain reaction of elements that will set the atmosphere on fire thus destroying the world

but in the end oppie implied that while the literal chain reaction of elements did not occur the bomb created a chain reaction of events that will ultimately lead to us destroying the world like the nations racing to make their own super bombs",2023-07-23 11:35:08
that must have been a  of a marathon for murphy hes in  near every scene with constant dialogue,2023-07-26 06:41:01
literally the thing that i disliked most about the movie,2023-07-31 11:19:22
having rami malek as the side character everyone brushed off til the end of the movie shows the strength of this casting,2023-07-22 09:12:43
a week late here also her flask falls out when she’s upset with oppie after he talked about piggy character in his questioning now the affair is officially written down in history not something she can pretend to ignore that wasn’t after her interview,2023-08-06 13:43:14
her questioning scene was amazing,2023-07-22 17:55:23
they tie to the themes of flawed decisionmaking guilt consequences and responsibility emily blunts line about not getting to sin and have people for sorry for you is a direct tie to his conversation with truman where truman responds the same way to oppenheimers feelings of guilt,2023-07-23 21:06:33
i dont think ill ever get over the first time i watched the prestige this is a close second,2023-08-07 02:02:08
for the people in the back,2023-07-22 04:02:04
full stop,2023-07-30 02:23:40
i just read it as oppenheimer thinking about his own hands being apart of it,2023-07-22 04:24:54
sounds like reality made it ambiguous lol,2023-07-21 14:32:02
she may have been killed as oppenheimer didn’t gave the name and she must have been first on their suspect list the officer also mentions he had used extensive resources to find who that is,2023-07-27 20:34:00
ooh that makes sense i thought the hands represented roberts guilt that he saw himself killing her in the tub,2023-07-23 11:54:18
but she left a suicide note i think it was oppenheimer symbolically feeling like he did it to her,2023-07-28 07:02:59
we did see a gloved hand she was prob compromised after he visited her,2023-07-27 00:26:03
matt damon describing how casey affleck’s character was a cold killer felt to me like an implication that her death was orchestrated,2023-07-21 19:32:29
well not suspected theorized that she could have been yes but all evidence for the most part says otherwise,2023-07-21 07:12:03
management was restructuring,2023-07-22 08:19:36
that’s how i took it too he didn’t answer her call like he promised so she died by his hands,2023-07-26 04:25:47
you dont have to swear its explicitly in the movie everyone saw the hands lol,2023-07-22 17:49:46
i was stoked to see dehaan on screen,2023-07-21 06:06:53
wait the rodrick heffley was in it which one was he,2023-07-21 08:19:08
i didnt even recognize josh hartnett  was totally surprised at the credits,2023-07-22 03:56:03
i feel like having such big actors play such minor parts helped show the importance of every single scientist they werent just common lab folk lackies they were leading scientists in their fields and came together for the importance of the world even if it didnt turn out how they wanted,2023-07-23 17:17:04
i heard josh hartnett was in it but i didn’t realize he played ernest his look was so different it didn’t even occur to me i just kept thinking “why does he look so familiar”,2023-07-22 09:24:27
for me it was josh zuckerman im like  is  drive doing in this film,2023-07-22 22:41:28
and there is jack quaid towering over everyone save for the one swede there are no short skarsgards,2023-07-25 00:05:17
oh britta’s in this,2023-07-30 21:15:01
shout out to dane havent seen him in a lot lately hope i can see more,2023-07-26 07:29:43
oh brittas in this,2023-08-07 12:04:20
one of nolans most annoying calling cards matt damon in interstellar was the worst example of it,2023-07-27 23:31:36
sean avery was also in tenet he must be friends with nolan,2023-07-29 05:35:13
he was also really really good in the new season of black mirror was so surprised to see him in it here for the josh harnett renaissance,2023-07-24 11:58:25
"which is a shame because his character kenneth bainbridge had the second best reaction to the trinity test quote
now were all sons of ",2023-07-21 06:07:45
he got more lines than richard feynman,2023-07-21 08:30:54
mad only works until it doesn’t no guarantee that humanity wont destroy itself with nuclear weapons,2023-07-21 04:30:58
the whole last act of the movie was about 2 foes destroying each other oppenheimer got his clearance denied strauss got denied by the senate 2 guys who didnt have to fight retaliating and escalating until they were both professionally destroyed,2023-07-22 18:35:08
i think the point of that is that watching it today as a modern audience it is still something that could be the case ever since the arms race began we have had nuclear annihilation hanging over our heads and its not a totally wild position to believe that it will happen at some point even if thats not soon mad isnt really super  relevant that effects the probability only,2023-07-22 00:51:28
no one couldve predicted the horror brought by alfred p neuman,2023-07-21 04:03:02
they literally mention mad in the movie not by name but the concept,2023-07-22 06:41:49
"can’t remember who said it but mad is like walking a tightrope in that asking somebody to do it for 10 minutes is easy

now have them do it for 100 years",2023-07-21 14:14:06
i thought he did later on with the scorpion analogy,2023-07-21 22:34:12
it hasn’t been that long since the last time one was dropped and they’re only proliferating eventually in our lifetime we’ll see it again if not in a formal war then from a rogue state or terrorist group i really doubt humanity’s ability to not play with its biggest toy,2023-07-21 04:24:41
well the story of history is still being written only time will tell,2023-07-21 06:44:22
"thats just it he and his former colleague go mad on each other and its why he thinks the nations will do the same thing

hes wrong because the people making the decisions end up with far better political judgement than him  brilliant scientist complete walking disaster when it comes to people and politics",2023-07-30 20:40:53
or that climate change is looking to be the most likely thing to do us in,2023-07-23 02:52:12
the shot in the white clouds,2023-07-21 22:51:30
definitely,2023-07-23 03:21:17
im putting together a team,2023-07-24 02:38:56
yes he basically recalls the fear they had of an unstoppable chain reaction according to the math that stated there was a small chance of ending the world he’s basically saying its already happened just not in the way he thought it would ie the nuclear arms race,2023-07-21 22:03:09
" i couldn’t make it out 

could the say the same for about 60 of dialog in all of nolans movies ",2023-07-23 00:53:46
there was a non zero chance detonateing the bomb would cause a chain reaction igniteing the atmosphere and ending the world so when he says detonateing the bomb csused a chain reaction that would end the world hes talking about the cold war,2023-07-21 09:13:50
the trinity test didn’t start the chain reaction igniting the atmosphere and destroy the world they thought it might but he did start the chain reaction of everyone acquiring nukes  mutually assured destruction that oppenheimer feared will destroy the world,2023-07-21 13:27:04
"he was afraid creation of atomic bomb can create chain reaction which will end all life 
which is what happened we are one press of the button away from finishing it",2023-07-21 14:25:21
definitely hit hard and the cheering i was feeling sick to my stomach watching it really reminded me of a bad trip i had once where it felt like there was a darkness underneath people celebrating,2023-07-21 21:44:05
that little moment was more terrifying that a lot of horror movies i’ve watched incredible,2023-07-23 02:41:23
it was so jarring that at first i thought i heard wrong but man that scream was definitely haunting,2023-07-29 22:29:33
same i thought it was someone in my theater,2023-07-31 02:32:26
me too,2023-07-22 03:12:51
so well done man like nothing else nolan has done,2023-08-05 22:52:29
that was the thing that stuck out to me the most,2023-08-07 03:52:56
i literally thought i made that sound yawning i knew it was a scream,2023-08-06 05:23:09
you did imagine that it wasn’t in the movie,2023-08-04 04:45:54
imho it deliberately echoed the screaming of oppy’s own kids at home hinting that no one is safe once the power of the bomb has been unleashed,2023-09-11 15:49:56
i was expecting there to be more screams throughout the speech occasionally but just having the one had a profound effect,2023-07-21 04:24:36
definitely sounded like the imagined scream of a bomb victim,2023-07-21 05:25:43
you know its memorable because how many movies can you be like yeah that scream was crazy and everyone else knows exactly which one you mean because it struck everyone,2023-07-21 15:51:01
thats true i didnt recall if i had seen that effect in inception or somewhere else of his but you are right it was with scarecrow,2023-07-21 04:52:27
"it’s all part of cillian and nolan’s arc the script was written in the first person scene directions written as “i walk to the table and place both hands on it” etc 

to conquer oppenheimer he had to become oppenheimer",2023-07-21 08:52:53
"isn’t this considered cgi use i’ve seen nolan saying in interviews no cgi was used but the vibrating background during this moment and many other moments in the film would suggest otherwise if they somehow did that effect practical then i’m impressed

edited to make more sense",2023-07-21 15:11:34
i caught that too the blur of the background with the camera shake,2023-07-23 18:29:12
how did i forget about that,2023-07-21 20:08:27
pretty sure they showed more charred bodies mixed in with the revelers as oppenheimer left the building too it was such a nightmare sequence,2023-07-31 03:43:33
people were laughing in my theatre during this scene when the president was being a  to him and when he was crying under the rock,2023-07-25 04:25:05
sound editing was great the mix was very bad i feel like it’s a choice at this point like nolan wants audiences to really lean in and listen closely haha,2023-07-24 11:10:57
im glad im not the only one who thought that especially when he goes outside and sees one student vomiting and then two others sobbing in each others arms while the rest of them are cheering as loud as possible,2023-08-20 18:48:41
also the groves  oppenheimer dynamic reminds me a lot of the shcherbina  legasov dynamic neurotic nerds and their gruff normie minderspartnersfriends,2023-07-24 04:23:29
watch threads,2023-07-25 04:28:39
multiuse room its a big building so you use it for whatever you can,2023-07-24 13:01:05
you have my sympathies it was skincrawling stuff for me and i was sober even had a bit trouble shaking it off before bed last night…,2023-07-24 14:17:55
it did though the only reason why theres any ambiguity at all around the ethics of having let alone using a weapon like that is because of the men and quite rarely women sitting in rooms like that who try to leverage the facts and outcomes of horrific events to their own personal advantage,2023-07-23 00:47:51
yeah it’s weird that the third act be about a guy who got his feeling hurt by oppy and tried to bring him down but failed…,2023-07-22 23:01:46
yea honestly if the movie ended there i would have been satisfied,2023-07-22 06:23:51
it’s to show how corrupt politics can be taking brilliant minds like him and einstein and changing history most people today do not even know who oppenheimer is,2023-07-22 03:19:26
"you’re getting downvoted which is a shame but i almost agree the implication was rdj’s character destroyed oppenheimer’s reputation and ruined his chance of …working for the military again oh no he got his clearance removed why would he want to work for the government again is he now without a job and homeless did he suddenly lose his ability to teach

the movie didn’t really explain how it impacted oppenheimer in any way so the third act seemed kinda pointless",2023-07-23 04:02:52
personally prefer the subtlety it would’ve been easy to just turn everyone into disfigured corpses i thought the way it was done was much more unsettling,2023-07-22 01:16:47
wow you really want to see those japanese dying and burning dont you ,2023-07-22 02:22:47
i feel like the movie was pretty unambiguously on the side of saying it’s horrible what happened to the japanese people what you’re asking for is the exact opposite of subtlety,2023-07-25 21:27:45
very curious as to what you mean by this,2023-07-22 08:09:28
scientists stick together they know if it can happen to him can happen to them,2023-07-23 16:19:28
what i didnt even know gary oldman was here which one was he,2023-07-21 14:36:48
greendale is where i belong is forever goated i love that song and everything it means to me,2023-07-23 15:48:53
the whole movie reminded me of twbb mainly because of that unsettling tense score,2023-07-23 04:06:17
 i miss johan johansson,2023-07-29 00:44:56
it was greenwood mixed with philip glass with just a little john adams,2023-08-05 04:51:52
he was gambino’s roommate in college they’ve both come a long way he’s composed some of my favorite movie and tv scores in the last few years oppenheimer black panther 12 the mandalorian and creed,2023-07-22 23:00:20
the scene where we’re introduced to rami malek’s character i was like there is no need for the score to be this stressful right now hahahah,2023-07-24 12:21:45
the main theme of the score was overused,2023-07-29 00:46:16
ludwig has incredible range he really complements the directors’ visions well,2023-07-24 12:18:28
the last scene is one of the most memorable ending of nolan’s filmography so i disagree,2023-07-23 04:04:05
i am seeing this a lot of places was he rumoured to do the soundtrack,2023-07-31 20:54:54
yeah i found that particularly in imax during the scene where he imagines an atomic bomb while being questioned in a regular screen i found it a lot easier to hear everything,2023-07-25 01:36:53
of all the currently acclaimed film composers his score for oppenheimer is definitely closest to zimmer people often “criticize” or describe his work as much more flat long and sounddesigny compared to other composers i’m not saying this just saying zimmer is described this way often long heavy notes his score is just as hummable,2023-07-22 04:49:32
black panther and mandalorians themes would both fit that category,2023-07-22 12:43:44
"you completely nailed it goransson to me is very different from zimmer that difference is songs that become such earworms that by the end of the movie it’s what you associate almost the most with with all of the movies score by hans if you just gave me the title of the movie i with confidence could hum a tune even if it’s been years since my last view 

goransson adds the the movie creates great tone but i’ve yet to see that zimmer moment with his nolan movies mando and creed films are a completely different story which makes me wonder if nolan has wanted to change how scores fit into his movies",2023-07-29 00:42:23
i love ludwig’s work and he has made many hanslevel themes but i agree with you in regards to his nolan work the score is great but tenet and oppenheimer don’t have any memorable themes like interstellarinceptiontdk do which is a bummer,2023-07-22 13:19:20
agreed parts of it were really good  but the music led the viewer a little too much for my liking emotionally,2023-07-24 01:32:15
yep i consciously noticed the score too much for me that isnt a good sign,2023-07-25 05:50:09
thank you i’m reading these comments in disbelief it was so distracting at times like trust in the actors ability to deliver the lines without the nolan suspense music pulsing,2023-07-24 06:41:32
great for a movie like tenant absolutely unnecessary for this style of film,2023-07-29 00:47:27
"
dumbest take ever",2023-07-29 12:44:45
yea for me it’s either him hans zimmer or henry jackman,2023-07-22 23:00:42
can you hear the music meeting kitty manhattan project and destroyer of worlds are on repeat for me,2023-07-24 15:37:04
zimmer was probably working for dune 2 plus ludwig did such a good job for tenet it would be a shame to not have him score oppenheimer as well,2023-07-23 23:00:36
howd the figure that out,2023-07-25 04:39:05
i think the footage at the beginning of the movie may have been from an actual nuclear test or at least something rendered from one it looks a lot like some of the videos of megaton yield fusion bombs and those are a lot scarier looking than the early devices,2023-07-22 03:20:06
interesting i  felt it it almost made me cry seeing how intense and white the fire was knowing that after that they still dropped it on cities of people the slow mo as it pans up and you see all the layers was absolutely jaw dropping for me,2023-07-23 14:48:23
"i think what nolan did was far more effective and greater act of cinema 

we are focalizing from oppenheimer and the rest they felt anxious up to the bombing so did we but they were in awe when they saw the bomb from that distance as did we 

it was fantastic way to pull us into the minds of the characters and their perspective  shame it didn’t work for you",2023-07-21 21:57:41
guessing you didnt get imax,2023-08-14 00:03:02
i feel like the movie was just lacking some scale in truth the explosion was massive but from 5 miles away in a flat desert it’s not going to look like that if we could see the fireball next to an object on the ground it would make a difference but also the trinity test was quite small compared to later bombs and if course the hydrogen bombs,2023-07-23 07:06:32
"i think nolan went for how it would feel to be at the test site not how some imaginary version would be portrayed

also the footage we have is taken closer to the explosion than where oppenheimer was and he was 5 miles away

the scale and impact was taken from witness reports",2023-07-21 10:45:59
"i dont know anything about twin peaks why the  is there a bomb test haha

dont spoil it pls ill get to watch it eventually",2023-07-21 23:56:32
yeah the twin peaks trinity scene is masterful,2023-07-21 18:13:43
isn’t he the one who was sitting in the car saying the glass protects against uv,2023-07-25 23:42:40
"feynman arguably one of the greatest american physicists was known to be quite a character he had a very large personality not only among people in general but especially among physicists who tend to be more reserved leading him to stand out there are many really funny stories about him a classic one being that he was notorious for having a set of bongos lying around and would play them frequently in the movie it’s funny how he barely had any dialogue but had a presence in the background of many scenes often with his bongos see the video linked below of him playing

",2023-07-21 15:04:35
if you read his books i forget which he talks about how he didnt want to just be a physicist  so he taught himself to be charming to hit on women dance play instruments bongos and paint  when he was in las alamos he got in trouble a lot  with everyone and picking where he taught himself that too classified cabinets and safes honestly nolan should do a movie about him because hes just as important as oppybombs,2023-07-24 00:07:50
yeah but feynman was decent at the bongos quaid seemed like he’d just picked them up for the first time the day they shot that scene,2023-07-26 09:38:51
i was thinking this too i knew he was feinman but i couldn’t help but see boimler playing the bongos lol,2023-07-27 22:53:19
"oh i think it totally works thematically and how the characters got there 

but if we knew he literally calls himself the destroyer of worlds in the scene everyone was memeing he would hang  in the internet would’ve went wild",2023-07-21 03:38:53
"didn’t see this in the moment but it tracks

good point",2023-07-21 04:56:41
she was murdered in the film right in the scene showing her suicide while it was only a single shot that was maybe a second long i believe i saw a hand wearing a black glove behind her head,2023-07-22 01:57:39
i just am not sure it’s really true to character or understanding to have him read religious hindu scripture during a  scene my understanding is that oppenheimer had a lot of respect for hindu scripture,2023-07-21 06:14:33
thank you and she was also his undoing in a way,2023-07-22 18:53:28
pretty sure it was the  scene during the security clearance hearing and not the basic one in the bedroom,2023-08-05 04:28:27

same in india they covered her in a black dress and cropped the shots during the love scenes,2023-07-22 11:13:45
thats amazing nolan lied about the cgi did the audience laugh,2023-07-21 20:37:36
they cut the whole section here in nepal  prudish morality police,2023-07-22 06:10:11
what thats  absurd lol,2023-07-23 00:29:19
i watched it last night in saudi arabia that cgi dress looked horrible ,2023-07-23 09:06:29
can’t have the locals throwing stones at the screen i guess,2023-07-21 23:47:14
no  pugh pulls the movie down to like a 510 for me,2023-08-06 07:54:01
in india too lol but it was fine i don’t know why she would’ve had to be  for that,2023-07-25 19:14:30
same here in indonesia,2023-07-23 02:51:26
yes same here in south east asia,2023-07-23 19:15:36
haha can you describe what kind of dress,2023-07-23 09:32:39
i watched it today 8 am in the morning imax show was packed yo,2023-07-22 10:57:50
i am become  destroyer of dat ,2023-07-22 04:54:59
also why was i to believe that out of what were probably thousands of lines in that book she magically and accidentally pointed out the line ,2023-08-02 10:29:22
"i was gonna say she had her clothes more off than on

apparently she loves being  she even signed a contract that forced them to show her  for at least 15 seconds",2023-07-21 19:34:04
it hit different though after she killed herself and it affected him greatly being ‘death’ and the ‘destroyer’ of jean’s world,2023-07-21 15:57:23
i think it was a great swerve from what people expected,2023-07-22 13:37:40
agreed i feel there was a bit of studio hand in many scenes that being one of them it felt soapy for the purpose of making the movie more approachable for the masses,2023-07-21 16:03:31
i thought kitty was handled quite well,2023-07-24 02:57:00
one of the greatest albums too right has to be heard from the start to end in one sitting such an experience,2023-07-23 23:02:11
for fun,2023-07-21 09:19:07
i mean looking at it that way its hard to find it funny since it also connects to the deaths of hundreds of thousands,2023-07-21 17:58:13
"also “we’ll have him killed ” “nah i’m just kidding” 

he handled it in a wink wink way for sure honestly this film’s portrayal of the us government was for sure not positive anyhow though not to conspiracy levels",2023-07-22 18:45:06
that sounds like a great analysis tbh i haven’t even thought of looking at it that way,2023-07-24 02:30:59
"other way around the a bomb is a fission bomb the h bomb is a fusion bomb

that being said i had the same question about why they did the 12 numbering thing and your explanation is helpful",2023-07-22 03:08:00
other way around,2023-07-22 03:03:16
fission was a bomb color fusion was h bomb black and white,2023-07-22 03:04:07
"i thought it had something to do with oppenheimer was fine with the a bomb since it was to help stop the nazis but the h bomb was when he was against with what was happening helping illustrate the 2 storylines

but i also feel like maybe that is not a strong enough connection and maybe there’s a better explanation out there",2023-07-22 02:45:17
wondered what the fission bit was about and yeah i also missed the fusion part not that i would have understood what it meant anyway lol,2023-09-06 17:10:52
i thought it was piers morgan,2023-08-20 19:07:23
oh my  it isn’t gahahahaha took me until this comment to realise,2023-08-03 11:00:40
same haha,2023-07-23 10:32:44
how can you forget terminator genisys and white house down,2023-07-25 15:20:12
fun fact with the bunkers being 5 miles away from the bomb itd take about 25 seconds for the sound to reach them,2023-07-21 07:09:01
if you read first hand reports from survivors in japan that was exactly what happened a silent expolosion my girlfriend held my hand in expectation of a big bang at that point but knew it was gonna play out in silence,2023-07-21 22:44:45
nolan used that bit in the interstellar docking scene too and it was also extremely effective,2023-07-22 23:53:24
yeah everyone expected the bomb to make a big bang and then youre like oh right it takes time for sound to travel that far,2023-07-21 13:08:28
the whole movie was blasting soundtracks almost from start to finish,2023-07-21 15:32:58
dont forget how it was silence with slow panting truly chilling,2023-07-24 23:18:20
 youre a  lol go study some physics kiddo speed of sound does not equal speed of light,2023-08-01 22:14:02
it was not an artistic decision that is how it is in real life,2023-08-03 00:31:33
i was  horrified in the theater at this my  what a classic scene i started getting this random insane creeping dread when the countdown started when i realized that i absolutely did not want to see this happen even though i knew it was a test and not even the devastating event that follows in history i plugged my ears and opened them repeatedly in the last 30 seconds not sure if i wanted to brave it i kept my ears unplugged and was shocked to hear nothing,2023-07-23 02:55:09
"it would have been in silence 

they were in a desert and sound travels slower than light 

your comment does not deserve 30 upvotes and you are likely a studio shill",2023-07-21 04:58:45
me too that’s what i really like about that scene,2023-07-22 23:12:54
followed by only the sound of breathing very well done,2023-08-09 04:06:09
seeing in it in 70mm imax was totally worth it and immersive visually aurally and tactilely  when the sound of the blast finally kicked it not only was it overwhelmingly loud but the violent shaking could be felt  it was as if nolan made a 4d movie but without the cheesy rumble seats,2023-08-14 16:54:24
nolan was getting slick with this because yeah in retrospect it makes total sense why he chose to drown out any sounds because any bomb that goes off is automatically loud thats a given nolan just needed the visuals to depict one of the greatest powers ever invented by man just the sheer power of it and its terrifying implications just a brilliant scene all in all,2023-11-15 08:28:18
we could hear the film rolling with how quiet the audience was during this scene absolutely amazing,2023-07-22 12:04:57
just came out of a 70mm screening the movie is absolutely beautiful,2023-07-21 05:26:18
"i just got done today seeing it in imax it was beautiful

edit once the explosion sound hit i jumped in my seat i was expecting it but i didn’t expect it",2023-07-25 03:04:58
i want to find a still of the bomb exploding and set it as my desktop such a hauntingly beautiful shot,2023-07-22 16:32:48
if the 70mm theater near me wasn’t sold out for the next 2 weeks i’d see it again i just ended up going to a dolby cinema,2023-07-30 07:26:39
just saw this film last night in imax 70mm too my first one amazing,2023-09-29 04:29:53
watching this shows me just how much cillian encapsulated the real oppenheimer,2023-07-22 00:56:38
"this famous footage was from an nbc interview taken in 1965 two years before his death

us secretary of energy jennifer granholm ordered that the 1954 decision to revoke oppenheimers security clearance be vacated on december 16 2022 according to her order the atomic energy commission failed to follow its own rules and those failures were material to the fairness of the proceeding",2023-07-23 23:23:20
shoutout to linkin park’s album a thousand suns for helping me memorize this quote,2023-07-21 13:23:16
i’m pretty sure they gave his words to a different guy in the bunker because if i remember the only thing he actually said after the bomb went off was just “it worked”,2023-07-30 07:25:46
what a pretentious  really,2023-07-21 04:14:54
i honestly thought it was my friend breathing cause of how quiet it was,2023-07-21 03:49:32
how earlylate into the movie is it i need to know when the best time for a restroom break is and want to plan around it lol,2023-07-21 04:26:39
yeah except other people   guy next to me got up before the bomb went off and came back during the blowing up scene made a bunch of noise super distracting,2023-07-31 02:08:57
"yes 
the scene is dead silent and visually stunning but it’s let up to in such a brilliant way in part through the audio score that the entire theatre was in tense silent anticipation my companion keep edging forward until they were on the literal edge of their seat",2023-07-21 04:50:25
thankful that mine was the same i did hear a few gasps though which was cool love cinema,2023-07-23 02:54:01
i was drenched in sweat,2023-07-26 04:15:36
"paid £12 for a big screen showing when a standard showing would cost £5… and the people right next to me talked all the way through it including going “boom” during the bomb silence 

i don’t get why you would talk all the way through a screening you’ve paid over double to see",2023-07-21 22:36:19
some dude set a timer off in my theater and let it ring,2023-07-22 01:27:05
i remember years ago being in screening of prisoners which is obviously not a loud film and the cinema being very quiet and this guy eating potato chips very loudly like each crunch just echoed throughout the cinema it was a small cinema after finishing the packet he got up and left then came back shortly with a fresh packet found it hard not to giggle,2023-07-23 03:03:46
they allow 10 year olds into films with  scenes in the us,2023-08-01 09:24:15
"there would have been no sound

they were in a desert and sound travels slower than light 

the fact that the trinity test was quiet is like being amazed that the theater was quiet at the time 

good  nolan is not some genius for this",2023-07-21 05:00:48
that actually happened to me as well for interstellar so it was a big deja vu aha,2023-07-21 13:38:37
what a cliffhanger you got,2023-09-01 06:50:11
yup,2023-07-22 03:22:07
"i thought i was going crazy  major flicker at our 70mm screening  i got used to it mostly but not entirely and it distracted me off and on the whole film

honestly i couldnt tell it was 70mm  there are no true imax screens in my state so i thought 70mm would be the next best thing but it didnt seem much different than anything else imo",2023-07-30 21:15:41
i heard this happened in ny,2023-07-30 05:07:02
"i think that was done on purpose 

when we see him from oppenheimer’s perspective he’s a minor character who serves no reason but from strauss’ m perspective he gets a big role because he’s the one who ruined his hearing",2023-07-26 20:46:58
it was pretty creepy for a movie trailer in a film like this lol i liked it but i definitely know some friends who wouldve felt as wronged as your friend,2023-07-21 04:34:56
they really shouldn’t my mom was like who’s parents let their kids be in that movie,2023-07-21 07:06:17
did the same lol surprised that was the trailer they decided to pay right before the movie once everyone is sitting down ready for the movie,2023-07-23 07:21:09
yeah in my opinion i wish theyd keep horror movie trailers out of movies like this  i dont like horror movies and dont like jump scares so  i really dont like seeing that stuff especially at such a high intensity  like  man,2023-07-21 06:05:11
lol my wife did the same she is very close to being due with our first kid and she already hates horror movies so seeing the kids go missing then become satanfied did not make her happy,2023-07-26 04:01:29
lol  i said the same thing,2023-07-21 05:45:11
that’s exactly what i did,2023-07-24 04:03:33
i mean oppenheimer is kind of a horror movie too,2023-08-06 09:59:28
it’s me i was your buddy,2023-07-27 03:46:29
they showed some talking dog adult comedy trailer one or two before that one when i saw it afterwards i leaned over to my friend and said they should have played the talking dog trailer after that one,2023-07-30 22:26:06
it was way to much for a trailer dont force me to watch that ,2023-08-05 14:15:10
i saw the movie with my dad who is a complete wuss when it comes to supernatural horror movies thankfully the theater we saw it in didn’t play any trailers before the movie it just started as soon as they turned on the projector i can only imagine how he would react if they played that trailer in the theater,2023-07-23 21:05:31
,2023-07-22 07:12:21
i thought i was living in the 80’s,2023-07-21 14:25:51
my screening led with that one then both of the jason statham trailers back to back really set the mood,2023-07-22 21:57:01
im one of those 3,2023-07-23 00:12:18
they are both universal they want to advertise it to a wide platform,2023-07-22 22:14:57
im stoked for that sideways was excellent,2023-07-24 03:40:49
i was waiting for an i think you should leave transition after that trailer,2023-07-24 04:23:43
ill be one of em,2023-07-23 05:12:33
they actually filmed part of that in my store not overly interested in the movie but i’ll likely see it just to see if my store made it into the final cut,2023-07-25 23:17:31
alexander payne is great the descendants election sideways,2023-07-27 06:46:52
the holdovers looks good actually i’m kind of down,2023-08-28 03:40:05
i thought it was a romantic movie of the teacher falling in love with his student,2023-07-24 21:03:15
i rolled my eyes bc it just feels like the whole exorcist possession thing starting creepy children with demented voice is so played out by now,2023-07-25 21:59:01
im just done with  ip based movies and they already beat the exorcist to  death in the mid 2000s i was however stoked to see the killers of the flower moon trailer although the music choice was odd the native american chanting was fine but with a trap beat for a movie about genocide dont know about that movie looked great though and leo will  it as always,2023-07-28 23:57:45
when people realized what it was my theater kinda sighed like they werent interested and then at the end of the trailer they seemed to like it it was a very weird reaction but kinda cool,2023-07-21 03:47:49
everyone in my theater laughed when that ended and said no way i heard a guy loudly say “that’s gonna be a hard pass” ,2023-07-21 12:25:10
everyone in my theater was laughing and kind of like what the  at that trailer,2023-07-22 07:27:54
lol same it eeminded me how good the exorcist theme is,2023-07-21 05:07:33
im surprised blumhouse got a hold of such an ip,2023-07-24 09:28:08
naw dawg,2023-07-24 11:12:44
"hahaha

i watched mi7 barbie and oppenheimer one day after another three days in succession and i had to sit through meg 2 the trench and disneys haunted mansion trailers the latter looked absolutely horrendous  at least the meg 2 trailer had a shark eating a dinosaur lol",2023-07-22 15:14:16
the lady next to me was freaking out at that trailer she was so scared,2023-07-21 02:48:29
ive heard they do that for the 70mm showings,2023-07-21 22:13:06
at my amc they didn’t even show nicole kidman it was just nothing straight to the movie,2023-08-10 07:30:57
,2023-07-22 10:48:48
ill be in dc the weekend that movie comes out and am planning to see it at a theatre just a few blocks from the exorcist steps,2023-07-22 02:50:33
,2023-07-21 23:34:54
oh interesting my imax showing had the dune 2 trailer as well,2023-07-21 11:15:19
i saw that trailer in imax when i watched dead reckoning last week,2023-07-22 02:50:57
so i saw it today imax but not 70mm i got a sci fi movie about ai coming to  us all that i thought was hilarious to put before a movie like opp also got dune 2 which was incredible looking and my soul is ready then the excorcist then it ended with killers of the flower moon which also looked amazing,2023-07-29 00:00:10
they’re making another one,2023-07-22 16:31:08
im going to bite his  off ,2023-07-23 20:49:27
same,2023-07-24 01:57:25
i like exorcist 3,2023-07-24 01:42:19
its quite the freaky trailer,2023-07-21 04:53:26
it has david gordon greens name on it so im guessing probably so,2023-07-21 05:01:00
difficult to say from the trailer tbh,2023-07-21 04:31:36
pretty good honestly i didnt realize it was the exorcist trailer until about halfway through when the piano theme started playing,2023-07-21 11:14:39
yeah it was hilarious to see everyones reactions,2023-07-21 23:35:14
its not that the trailer was funny many people who are squeamish with horror were looking down at their phones and laughing nervously some people straight up covered their eyes ,2023-07-25 12:09:21
oppenheimer is very vulnerable in his character which adds to the isolation and anxiety i find it so poignant yet heart breaking how theres rarely any time for him to repose he has to constantly deal with stress and tension at every step of the way,2023-07-21 03:07:26
even more so waiting for the boom i knew it was coming but still scared the  out of me lol,2023-07-21 05:27:52
my heart rate was literally going up when the countdown was ticking to its final seconds  incredible scene,2023-07-21 05:23:42
bro someone in my theater left for that bathroom from right before the countdown until post explosion i was dumfounded,2023-07-23 01:47:28
watch this short documentary  its only about 23 mins and worth a watch especially after seeing this movie ive seen it quite a few times and now paired with this movie i just cant imagine the horror in the movie it was already a very tense thing to see knowing its absolute power but these first hand experiences will shake you the monstrosities our countries commit are unbelievable,2023-07-22 07:17:10
the bomb countdown was the least anxietyinducing for me  it literally is showing you when ‘the big thing’ is going to happen  the intense interrogation scene where the room begins to shake behind oppenheimer on the other hand had me so anxious that i was having trouble breathing  holy  what a tense scene,2023-07-23 04:14:19
props to the composer for the gripping score that kept getting more and more intense as it got closer to the detonation,2023-07-23 04:41:20
jesus christ that scene gave me a minor panic attack so terrifying and haunting,2023-07-23 19:58:24
i had my ears plugged from the countdown through the silence all the way until the boom i kept my fingers in my ears because i  knew it was coming,2023-07-25 02:53:04
its so strange isnt it like anyone that saw the movie knew the test was a success but somehow nolan and the composer made me feel like something could go wrong they made us feel what the people that actually experienced it feel of course not the same degree but still,2023-07-26 06:19:53
ooof,2023-07-21 12:20:41
was looking for this comment  the first hour of beau is afraid was the most anxiety inducing movie experience out there,2023-07-29 15:28:09
and his look of utter betrayal right before he has to put the mask on and go talk to the press,2023-07-22 18:46:55
he was basically the main villain so it makes sense to have a segment of the film focused on him also rdj killed it in that final act,2023-07-21 17:42:47
he orchestrated the downfall of oppenheimer its part of the main characters story  how he grew what he did how he fell,2023-08-01 14:08:47
that was the most interesting part of the film to me,2023-07-29 22:56:26
"yep no idea why youre being downvoted when you are absolutely correct


robert downey jr did a fantastic playing a character that has pretty much nothing to do with the most important part of the film the entire story arc was a footnote in the life of oppenheimer who will be remembered forever solely for creating the atomic bomb",2023-07-22 22:03:49
"oppie i need you now

not my diagnosis",2023-07-21 04:44:59
pugh says he always answers when she calls,2023-07-21 02:53:48
have you seen florence pugh’s  though,2023-07-26 00:43:22
the crazy part is that’s it’s true too,2023-07-23 01:04:55
honeymooning in kyoto before the war must have pretty difficult right would they have taken a boat there,2023-07-24 03:29:53
wasnt kyoto still the seat of the emperor as well way more than just cultural significance could you imagine if we killed their emperor,2023-07-25 04:54:04
 i can’t confirm it’s accuracy but it seems fairly well researched,2023-08-02 12:13:20
hey as a physicist what did you think about the copenhagen movie from 2002 staring daniel craig,2023-07-22 05:59:14
the name of the score is can you hear the music its part of the official soundtrack its my favorite track,2023-07-23 06:08:03
i didn’t know strauss’s background and i thought the leak came from j edgar hoover cos he was mentioned a few times,2023-07-25 15:17:01
i saw it coming but i didnt know the history there so i sort of assumed it was gonna be left up to interpretation or something very satisfying to see his rat  come to light and it nicely tied in the theme of mutually assured destruction there at the end,2023-07-25 15:16:05
i personally thought that mccarthy had given oppenheimer’s documents to that investigator…it would totally have been within mccarthy’s character to do so,2023-07-30 13:28:57
same i wish they didn’t have that scene so that i would have been surprised by the twist,2023-07-24 16:56:13
the scene where he is raising the bongos when the project was successful was equal to cap picking up thors hammer for me,2023-07-21 15:18:55
all leading to the perfect young sheldon endgame captain marvel moment,2023-07-23 19:05:57
thats the joke,2023-07-28 03:04:02
i think the studios underestimate audiences and their tastes and i think audiences for a long time have just been willing to go along with whatever studios want to be the biggest but i think there is a ton of room for different stuff to be received well by a lot of different types of people,2023-07-21 07:09:22
i think this is partly why succession was such a hit a modern day shakespeare that also involved business finance and politics,2023-07-22 01:33:44
i’m a fan of comic book movies… and even i’m kinda getting tired of them i hope this helps usher in thought provoking blockbusters the last few mcu movies i’ve caught myself checking my watch every 20 minutes first i checked my watch in this was 2 hours in i don’t know how a 3 hr movie flys by but this absolutely did i was worried the 3rd act would drag after the frenetic pace of the first two hours but nope it hums along just as fast incredibly paced film,2023-07-22 01:29:42
my little sister chose to see oppenheimer over barbie and i got a text after the movie i think this is the best movie ive ever seen,2023-07-23 17:12:30
i mean i just turned 16 and i believe this is the best movie of the year so far ,2023-07-22 02:30:59
yes the audience is craving something intelligent and sensitive that isn’t telling you how to feel it simply gives you no other option but to feel what the character feels in a genuine and thoughtful way,2023-07-22 07:36:48
you’re a good dad he won’t forget that,2023-07-22 03:01:26
eeaao proved that imo,2023-07-29 21:42:03
no we need another mcu part 87 crossover where redditors stand up and clap,2023-07-22 06:21:04
you can thank florence pugh for that…,2023-07-22 09:44:03
dune part 2 coming at the end of this year it bugs me how surprised everyone always is every time a moderately intelligent blockbuster comes out and does well pretty much every nolan villenueve and reeves film that comes out all the articles are like who knew people liked good movies,2023-07-31 10:08:56
youhe should dive more into independent and foreign films documentaries attend the sundance film festival virtually  90 of these films blow mainstream films out of the water,2023-07-23 22:00:28
exactly this,2023-07-23 00:31:27
my girlfriend who would fall asleep in action movies was fully awake and hung on every word for 3 hours for our 70mm imax showing,2023-09-01 08:26:53
match made in heaven,2023-07-21 07:30:20
it’s somewhere between the two imo it wasn’t sold as such but it’s also not a typical kind of dialogue drama at all,2023-07-21 07:04:29
"i felt the same way too the marketing portrayed a very different type of movie i honestly wasn’t ready for i knew going in it was gonna be a long but i just wasn’t mentally prepared for the amount of heavy dialogue i needed to follow to really grasp the drama and politics of what was happening 

it didn’t help the ac was out in my theatre but i think i would appreciate the movie much more in a second viewing but i don’t know when i’d be ready to dive into a movie like that again",2023-07-22 04:09:26
"definitely fooled me i was expecting it to be a lot faster paced and more “action” but what we got is miles better than that 

i remember checking my watch about an hour and a half into the movie and realizing we’re not even close to the trinity bomb lol not what i expected but so much better for it",2023-07-22 10:30:15
"lot of young fellas and teenagers had no business being in your screening

about  time that r rating meant something",2023-07-21 10:03:37
no one was expecting this level of success most estimates heading into the week before it’s release were hovering around 4050 mil it just hit 80 mil thats a lot of butts in seats watching a very nontraditional “blockbuster”,2023-07-24 13:44:41
it literally won the academy award for best picture,2023-07-21 11:04:03
"as someone who loves movies and the communal experience of watching a great movie in a theater yeah it was emotional especially while watching a movie that on paper would not draw that kind of crowd i fully believe that this movie alone is going to open so many eyes to wide swaths of cinema that are rarely looked at by the general public and i’ll give it to you the theater experience has massively declined these past few years run by corporations that couldn’t give two  about cinema as long as it makes them money leading to crowded and dirty lobbies out of focus projectors broken speakers and ungodly amounts of ads and trailers we have also become an extremely selfish culture leading to any number of rude behaviors by other patrons but by some miracle on thursday night i experienced almost none of that and on top of it the movie we were watching was unlike anything else that typically would pack a theater like that so yes i felt deep emotions and i’m not ashamed of it cheers

edit downvote but no rebuttal classy",2023-07-22 20:31:32
what’s baffling though is how low oppenheimer’s budget is compared to most hollywood movies he literally made it for 100 mil versus something like quantumania that was 200 mil or the flash which was 220 mil or fast x which was a mind numbing 340 mil and all of those bombed big time so in actuality he’s working with a much lower budget than many other less established directors and i know those are all sequels but they are  up the dollars studios can spend i hope studios learn from this and start seriously looking at these absurd budgets they’ve been handing out like candy for projects that don’t require or even deserve that kind of money,2023-07-24 19:19:36
i definitely think it’s that caliber of a film even if i can’t say the same as a film fan though i’m very interested to know what it knocked off the perch of number one for you,2023-07-24 19:25:26
my favorite part was when he said its oppin time and then he nuked all the bad guys,2023-07-23 14:22:28
sorry what genuinely zero clue how you could walk away from this movie with that take,2023-07-21 20:26:45
marvel tried to make a dialogue drive spy show and it turned out so pathetic it had one of the worst viewership for a big budget show,2023-07-23 17:13:35
yeah i loved the jfk name drop you could tell they’re building up to a 20th century american history cinematic universe,2023-07-27 04:10:40
i wish they dwelled on the science behind it a little more its my one complaint with the movie  we know developing the bomb was this near impossible task and we know they were racing against the germans to get it done but we never really are shown much about the actual discoveries at los alamos that got it there so the whole thing felt more inevitable in the movie than it probably did in real life,2023-07-21 20:33:44
that and the slow construction of the demon core and the last part being put on mere hours before testing was so good,2023-07-21 17:30:34
i liked that they changed sizeintensity depending on the moment just really basic but brilliant movie making,2023-07-21 12:11:24
i feel like it’s also meant to serve as visualization of oppenheimer trying to understand the wavelike form of particles note that much of quantum physics or at least one branch of it that i’ve learned of is based on crystallography and i suspect the scene where he was breaking glasses and listening to the smashing was him trying to gain some knowledge of the release of energy by listening to the sound it’s why in the scene directly preceding the glass smashing oppenheimer gets asked if he hears the music,2023-07-21 22:22:06
the last scene is so beautiful with those raindrops,2023-07-21 15:19:43
wow cant believe i missed that interpretation i thought it was more akin to the energywaves of the quantum world but maybe it could be both,2023-07-22 13:07:24
maybe a stretch but i noticed a motif of patterns in the background of the scenes that have shapes similar to the mushroom cloud of an atomic explosion and the relationship with plants there’s a scene in los alamos where these little things on the window oppenheimer is looking through have a mushroom shape another scene has curtains in the window in front of the sink where oppenheimer is washing his handsdishes the plant design looks like a mushroom cloud when einstein is walking with the other scientist in the woods “trees have the most perfect structure” if i recall correctly,2023-07-22 21:49:46
yup definitely shows nolans growth,2023-07-23 01:14:35

the bowls arent some metaphor to eli5a a concept theyre just a convenient way of showing progress without marbles they would have drawn a beaker on a blackboard with it filling up progressively or something,2023-07-26 07:03:36
yes he did but thats the point the commenter was making why its a bad representation compared to marbles in bowls i dont know because its a perfectly decent way of representing something as weird as wormholes but then i guess thats why im not a director or teacher,2023-08-04 15:46:36
"trinity and  man both used plutonium little boy used uranium 

everyone was pretty confident that little boy would work so it was never even tested before they dropped it 

plutoniumbased bomb needed testing 

can’t remember completely but i assume they factored in the need for enough plutonium for both trinity and  man when doing the marbles 

not quite sure why they needed to use both plutonium and uranium bombs given that the plutonium bomb needed testing and also sourcing the plutonium was a difficulty",2023-07-24 00:33:24
it was to show the audience the project progress and also how much enriched uranium they had available in order to actually make the bomb,2023-07-27 01:50:22
when i heard that and then strauss started ranting about how egotistical opp was i was like “i mean yeah he’s right” dude cheated 3 times and always acted better then most people he talked to,2023-07-22 05:32:20
as someone that doesnt like legal drama i hated the last act lol,2023-07-23 10:48:03
i think just knowing the influence jfk would have on usa as whole years later and strauss scoffs at some young giddy senator was a nice callbackforeshadow moment,2023-07-21 09:10:58
it also had the exact same feeling when nolan ended the dark knight rises with the women mentioning robin i was laughing thinking to myself “did christopher nolan just use jfk as his robin in this film” it was perfect and perfectly nolan,2023-07-21 11:23:04
"jfk would go to have to deal with nuclear arms race during the cuban missile crisis

thirteen days is a really good movie about it",2023-08-25 07:39:27
thirteen days would be more in line with the themes of oppenheimer,2023-07-23 12:58:56
this i saw this as wink to stones movie more than a nod to the man,2023-07-27 22:03:08
my biggest worry for this film was how it would handle the weight of hiroshima and nagasaki and holy  the way they did it was so unexpected and brilliant to only hear about it on the radio to feel cut out of the loop like oppenheimer was and then that gym scene oh my ,2023-07-21 05:05:26
that scene the scene when the  guy is questioning him and it all goes white and he starts yelling the trinity test the scene where he feels  in the room in front of the questioners just wow so good,2023-07-21 03:39:53
100 this scene is nolan’s magnum opus and definitely the scene that will stay with me the most that was the true nuclear explosion not the trinity test,2023-07-21 04:34:41
interesting note nolan made the movie because his kids revealed they didn’t really worry about nuclear holocaust do not only did he make a movie about its importance to scare them he cast his own daughter to melt her face off in this scene yup that’s flora nolan,2023-07-21 20:28:11
yep especially with the sound of the stamping feet being included throughout the movie when it was finally that scene i was very much on the edge of my seat,2023-07-21 06:07:27
i think that and the final scene with einstein will be talked about for years as a masterclass on how to create suspense and dread never have i been as haunted as i was during those moments in any other movie nolan did a phonemoneal job at reasserting how monumental and devastating the creation of the atomic bomb was,2023-07-22 14:37:20
i cant really explain it but i found myself actually tearing up a bit at both that scene and the test scene just the weight of everything not shown in those scenes was clear as day,2023-07-22 00:52:14
"i’m missing a couple of nolan films in my repertoire but i feel like this is the only time i’ve seen him use purely emotion to inform heightened reality like there have been some trippy scenes in the past but there’s always an inworld explanation spacetime wormhole drugs dreams otherwise it’s more straightforward

so many scenes in the back half of this one have these effects that are based in the emotions of the protagonist his anxiety his guilt i think it was extremely effective",2023-07-22 06:54:49
he kept staving off the guilt until that moment he knew the bomb wasn’t necessary to end the war but he kept telling himself that it was necessary to let the public know what power it wielded he couldn’t keep lying to himself during the speech his ego abandoned him,2023-07-22 07:53:14
"i liked nolans interpretation of how deeply affected oppenheimer was almost at the exact same time realising the extent of what was done and how powerless he is to stop what is to come

then of course he tries to fight against it and never really gets far",2023-07-22 13:00:54
i want to know how nolan did the shaky background effect in those scenes seems like cgi but he’s been such an anticgi advocate,2023-07-21 06:27:52
is that a feat of directing or editing,2023-07-21 10:40:03
of course thats when i had to  ,2023-07-22 04:33:34
yup this was a classic  scene on all levels,2023-07-22 07:53:10
and then the dead silence when he disassociates,2023-07-21 02:25:13
"i think thats the point

technically the explosion was an achievement we saw it and felt the shockwave but the real power was the rest the explosion was cool but it wasnt nearly as emotional and visceral as what came later

just as written technically the a bomb was a success but it wasnt a moral success",2023-07-21 06:13:40
for me it was that stomping sound during the hearing scene at the end part when we switched between opp and rdj,2023-07-21 05:06:24
for me it was when roger rob kept interrogating oppenheimer,2023-07-21 06:29:15
i feel like my theater dropped the ball i was anticipating it but was underwhelmed that’s what i get for not going for the dolby digital…,2023-07-21 06:38:07
because the reaction of humans to the bomb could be as destructive a force as the bomb itself,2023-07-21 07:42:46
the bomb blast from the bunker was a bit loud as well  was waiting for it,2023-07-21 07:51:38
it felt like sounds of a steam locomotive were used during the stomping sequences,2023-07-22 05:17:26
i saw it in imax 70mm in pretty much the best theater you can see it in and my experience was the same i believe this was intentional,2023-07-23 22:21:44
i jumped when the people were grabbing him and celebrating that scene was absolutely horrific closest nolans gotten to horror i suppose dunkirk has some horrific scenes too,2023-07-21 02:38:45
that was the most terrifying ending of a film ive ever seen,2023-07-21 03:33:10
it’s a bio horror epic feels like it’s own  genre,2023-07-21 05:01:27
really well done horror,2023-07-21 03:33:41
the last hour felt like a high strung thrillerhorror movie it was so anxiety inducing,2023-07-21 19:02:35
it filled me with so much existential anxiety i feel awful after seeing it,2023-07-21 22:13:15
like when einstein appears out of nowhere in the dark,2023-07-23 03:38:22
no it was definitely in the movie i had the exact same thought,2023-07-21 16:09:16
it was definitely the movie,2023-07-22 08:26:48
no there was definitely a scream that scream scared the  out of me,2023-07-23 10:18:24
"bro thank you for sharing that those were fascinating 

the underwater one was just insane and people in the comments said that was a small bombi can’t even imagine a bigger bomb",2023-07-21 04:53:17
i also think david lynchs version of the trinity test from twin peaks the return is worth mentioning as another film depiction of the explosion and as equally compelling as anything i have seen here,2023-07-21 13:21:30
"ive seen some of them but it is still insane seeing them again and the sheer scale of these things

right now us alone apparently has 3700 active thats what they are declaring as active militaries always hid a good number of their assets so that might not even be the real number like when the us had battleships carry nuclear shells in their guns

russia wont even declare theirs

seeing these bombs doing so much while everybody has so many of these to wipe the population of the world even if they dont wipe the world they make it inhabitable enough and the chaos it would ensue",2023-07-25 00:09:41
"the movie already gave me intense dread these vids just increased that please please please let me die before we destroy this planet 

but thanks for the share i hadnt seen all of these",2023-07-21 04:38:17
these are so much better than what nolan filmed  he forgot to include sense of scale and it fell almost completely flat,2023-07-21 05:59:18

light travels faster than sound and sound travels faster through different mediums youd feel ithere through the ground first before hearing it through the air sound travels 4x faster though the ground see the beirut explosion a couple years ago which was 125th the size of trinity,2023-07-21 02:55:33
the silence made it more eerie,2023-07-21 03:38:23
seemed too boringly obvious to me,2023-07-21 04:14:24
i will never be above to read those words again without thinking about  florence pugh nolan what were you cooking,2023-07-21 07:01:31
his hairline was set so far back it kind of looked like zorgs hair from 5th element,2023-07-25 00:32:16
was truman the trunp of his time oldman played him as a bit of a hick,2023-07-23 04:04:19
he is check the imdb,2023-07-21 16:54:35
as soon as he sat back and did oldmans classic pursed lips look i knew it lol,2023-07-21 04:01:12
"this time gary oldman had the higher ground to cillian murphy 

last time we saw them together murphy sentenced gary oldman to exile in the dark knight rises lol",2023-07-21 07:49:57
i thought truman was initially becoming emotional and saying the blood isnt on your hands its on mine but then his comment about keeping the crybaby out of the room changed my opinion  unless he was using bravado to mask his own guilt,2023-07-21 15:56:02
"dont let that crybaby in here again

that made me so sad for oppenheimer the freakin president acting like a jock bully x",2023-07-21 23:46:48
i thought he sounded similar to churchill in darkest hour,2023-07-21 12:52:45
hes done churchill and truman cant wait for his eventual  movie,2023-07-25 07:33:45

the truman scene was awful i thought the movie overall was great but the truman scene seemed extremely out of place,2023-07-22 07:13:34

i watched oppenheimer at 8am and barbie at 1130 barely had 5 minutes in between one of the best things ive ever done,2023-07-22 11:03:39
japan,2023-07-22 03:01:35
both discuss mermaids,2023-07-23 21:41:01
honestly they both had a lot of deep lore references for the nerds the poisoned apple truman calling oppenheimer a weepy sad sack stimson taking kyoto off the list all stuff that made me and other nerds go yes i do remember that just as barbie fans liked the discontinued vintage dolls,2023-07-22 18:37:10
i think watching barbie second would have been too big of a tonal jump and would have taken me a while to get into it,2023-07-21 14:51:13
"i actually watched barbie second for me it worked out mainly because i was stunned into silence by oppenheimer and ended up laughing quite a bit during barbie that said barbie also did also deal with things like anxiety depression and existential crisis but i still needed the fantasy aspect

absolutely loved the doublefeature experience",2023-07-22 11:07:48
i did oppenheimer first and im glad i did barbie which was just as existential as oppenheimer was a needed fantastical immersion after how heavy oppenheimer was,2023-07-22 03:03:59
he should meet churchill in the next movie,2023-07-21 05:04:08

the cast is so big rami malek is in 3 scenes and doesnt speak in 2 of them,2023-07-21 05:31:35
truman per the credits,2023-07-21 03:29:20
i generally don’t have trouble following films especially in theaters but i will say for such a dialogue heavy movie it flowed right through the plot like scene after scene especially in the beginning was all flowing together so well,2023-07-21 02:47:36
ive seen these tiktok brains on my screening  during that silent scene people just started making jokes and talk in that  tense moment and it just threw me off so much ugh like haha did they forgot the sound lol or maybe its a silent mode ahahaha  that really ruined that moment for me,2023-07-21 08:18:04
"but the movie moves so fast no one would be walking away bored

i should say no one reasonable",2023-07-21 03:14:45
i had 4 sets of people walk out of my showing last night almost all of them were past the 2 hour mark though so like they were almost done but i dont know how you go to see a movie without knowing its 3 hours if you had other plansneeded to get to the sitter,2023-07-21 12:34:03
unfortunately there were a few of these in my theatre and i kept seeing them just mindlessly scrolling through instagram and twitter while the movie was on i hate them,2023-07-22 03:17:13
seen multiple bad tik tok takes so far about it from people with absolutely zero media literacy,2023-07-21 21:12:19

the burden of genius,2023-07-21 07:04:25
i love that the whole movie you think it was because he talked some  but then in reality it was because he said something truly haunting especially for einstein given that he truly created the space to some degree,2023-07-22 23:31:39
the funny thing is that modern breakthroughs suggest that einstein was actually right regarding lots of the things the new science was criticizing him about in that era before his death,2023-07-23 03:52:14
thats basically every scientist who actually knows  theyre talking about when the truth is inconvenient i feel similarly bad for climate scientists back in the day who were like uh climate change is going to be a serious issue and then got undermined for political reasons,2023-07-24 17:17:16
wasnt oppenheimer also lowkey calling him crazy with the whole it was published 40 years ago statement,2023-07-22 22:25:43
why was the scientific community calling einstein crazy,2023-07-24 13:43:34
in the birdsherwij book they make a bunch of cinematic allusions—notably calling the various recollections of the conversation between oppenheimer and chevalier a rashomon effect  i love seeing this visualized on screen with the multiple perspectives as with the trinity test,2023-07-21 03:38:08
when einstein walked out of the shadows after the taxi pulled away i couldnt help but giggle like nick fury coming over to talk to him about the avengers initiative,2023-07-21 09:01:38
"i think it has to do with einstein being one of the few widely recognizable people that the movie shows not a lot of famous movies or shows portraying einstein so despite his being a household name we don’t have a saturation of einstein performances so when he appears on screen it gave the same feeling as seeing a crossover superhero movie 

i think the other really famous person depicted was harry truman but that’s about it the rest are somewhat known in academichistorical circles but you go to any random household in america and they won’t know majority of the real life people being portrayed",2023-07-21 07:49:34
"einstein is kinda next level famous to the point where he has almost become a character rather than a real person

the dudes name became a synonym for genius thats beyond fame imo",2023-07-21 14:27:58
i swear like a tenth of my theater was giggling everytime he showed up especially in that crewneck i guess we think of einstein as a legend and we forget he was an actual person,2023-07-21 08:57:20
when oppenheimer took off the military clothes and put on his own clothes it felt like watching a suit up in some superhero movie lol,2023-07-22 03:59:32
honestly all of the scientists were kind of like that for me it was like watching an avengers movie and trying to pick out all of the cameos,2023-07-21 23:24:21
nolan is a blockbuster filmmaker so he employs those techniques a lot of the mcu which is aping off of spielberg and others lol,2023-07-21 07:09:53
the name drop of jfk was hilarious because it felt like it was a set up to a jfk movie next ,2023-07-22 14:33:24

i’d just seen something similar in secret invasion so i found it just as funny as it was badass",2023-07-22 23:34:03
that’s how i felt with the jfk drop some above said he dropped it like the joker reveal and that cracked me up,2023-07-22 09:36:49
and bohr and heisenberg and fermi and gödel,2023-07-22 07:06:16
i loved that so much it was just so fun in such a serious movie it’s things like that which make me love nolan he knows how it’d play,2023-07-22 10:34:11
"the scene with kurt gödel gave that vibe pretty heavily even mentioned his mental illness

makes me sad we didnt even get a von neumann name drop",2023-07-22 20:26:33
it’s probably partly because einstein has become pop culture in a way and his “iconic look” is the blank template for all mad scientist type tropes,2023-07-23 09:03:03
same and i dont even follow that whole mcu thing,2023-07-21 18:22:58
was it the popular meme going around that held the same sentiment,2023-07-25 19:13:24
"in a way im so glad so many people are upvoting this because i felt like such a  nerd thinking that too 

i need to stop watching those  marvel movies",2023-07-24 07:30:32
same because i saw some memes of it kinda before going to watch it and my friends would turn and look at me like “they’re just talking it’s not funny”,2023-07-24 23:23:03
felt the exact same way,2023-07-25 21:35:02
everytime matt damon spoke i thought it was a marvel movie or a spoof,2023-07-31 07:04:35
"strauss i have an army

oppie we have an einstein",2023-11-15 08:14:59
i’m months late but i just saw it and thought the same thing  when he says “ them all” and the music starts playing i burst out laughing because it felt like he was one of the avengers hyping oppenheimer up to go out and fight the villain,2024-01-09 15:59:55
i remembered the scene in color from a trailer i was wondering when it was going to happen the first time we see him it’s in bw and ultrawide angle,2023-07-21 06:35:12
clever how nolan shows it earlier in bw and einsteins hat blows off when i saw that in the trailer i wondered why but then its obvious when he see the scene again at the end of the film in colour it helps people by giving that visual cue that its the same scene,2023-07-23 04:48:22
can you explain i did not fully understand the use of black and white scenes in the film,2023-07-21 08:21:48
it was really important for me that they convey that these two men destroyed each other because of their selfimportance and egos im not sure the entire third act would have worked without it,2023-07-21 15:34:54
"so i kinda got the gist of it but i couldnt hear einstein that well so i guess it didnt really hit for me that much

could you explain it more",2023-07-21 23:20:49
nolan always nails the ending only tenet had a badly executed ending,2023-07-21 21:37:58
well they do say “write the ending work backwards from there”,2023-07-22 06:46:37
"what does this even mean

its a scene in a movie made for people to watch

edit im dumb",2023-07-21 19:23:18
sure buddy you’ll forget about it in a few months ,2023-07-24 13:54:43
im surprised people take this much from it it was a very on the nose nukes could destroy us message,2023-08-06 07:50:17
he said i think we did after asking einstein if he remembered their conversation about the bomb possibly destroying the world,2023-07-21 02:38:47
he was talking about the chain reaction the bomb didnt light the atmosphere on fire but the invention did start a chain reaction that brings the world closer to nuclear annihilation the final images is no longer the world being destroyed by a burning atmosphere but devastated by nuclear missiles so the bomb did started a chain reaction,2023-07-21 05:51:45
"actual answer hyperbole can be useful to convey emotion to convey the context and depths of a given statement to emphasize a given point 

it’s not meant to be taken literally like op isn’t literally going to have a ghost going around him going “ooooooooo that scene in nolan’s 2023 film oppenheimer oooooooooooooooo” 

it means that op is going to think about the scene it’s meanings and the themes of death destruction ego and humankind’s innate ability to … for a long time 

people use hyperbole because we’re storytellers by nature we use emotion to connect and relate with others we’ve all been hungry enough to eat a horse at some point in our lives",2023-07-22 06:54:07
you seem like the type of person who refuses to take anything away because you think you already know everything,2023-07-27 13:01:01
it was to show us that strauss set up oppenheimers downfall due to him thinking that one conversation was about turning einstein and all the scientist against him but in actuality it was never about him he wasn’t even a thought in the grand scheme of all of it no action was ever about one man it was about the world and how by ‘playing ’ they started something that will humanity to their demise,2023-07-21 06:06:20
"basically that oppenheimer and atomic science really did start a chain reaction of destruction not a literal burning of the atmosphere but the nuclear arms race that defined politics for the rest of the cold war and beyond

einstein wasnt avoiding strauss eye because he was  at strauss he was reflecting on what had happened to the world",2023-08-08 23:19:27
my brothers in the end on barbie camp because itd be more lighthearted and funny especially with friends and a drink but given the ending of this and barbies own ending youre getting a sober ending either way you might as well commit to oppenheimers gut punch,2023-07-21 04:51:57
this is all i wanted to do but was already locked into barbie by friends going back in vmax to do it again properly,2023-07-23 13:17:16
"we manufacture artificial proteins  things that took billions of years to evolve in the wild in just mere months weeks even 

no body ever talks about it",2023-07-22 10:48:54
were the people in this movie especially famous because of the war or was there just a generally different attitude towards scienceacademics in those days,2023-07-21 08:08:27
" we do its just that most people dont care

i also think because ww2 quite literally was a sliding doors type moment the world would be fundamentally different if the nazis or the soviets got the bombs first theres just as many capable people today just no real need for them because were in a much better place thanks to these people who came before us",2023-07-24 03:18:12
goes to the state of journalism nowadays theres no equivalent of life magazine or anything like that where you could expect to see a copy on everyones coffee table explaining who the big names are in science at the moment,2023-07-24 03:47:13
except almost none of the current quantum research has actually amounted to anything societally relevant yet especially quantum computing if someone can actually build a real quantum computer and demonstrate a significant advantage over classical computers for an actually relevant problem they will become as famous as people like bohr or heisenberg the invention of the laser has a much more relevant impact yet most people have never heard of schawlow townes or maiman,2023-07-22 03:12:28
its also one of those things where science is sufficiently advanced that its unlikely for one guy to come out of nowhere and fundamentally revolutionize everything anymore,2023-07-24 17:21:56
nah its more because physics research done today is less individualised and has massive research teams spreading out the credit,2023-07-25 23:33:58
theory can only take you so far it takes massive resources scale and non existent technology to catch up to where theoretical physics is currently the more we expand our physics the harder it is to prove we’re on the right track,2023-07-24 05:46:00
"yes exactly but even within an ocean of notable advancements several have been able to stand out from the crowd the sequencing of the human genome the engineering of the first induced pluripotent stem cell the discovery of crisprcas9 and the world’s first fda approved mrna vaccines that debuted during a global pandemic to name a few in terms of physics we’ve also had the discovery of various new subatomic particles like the higgs boson the first observation of gravitational waves the recent nobel prize about the universe not being locally “real”

science is everywhere and as a result many people are deadened to the wonder of such discoveries science is also much more widespread not confined to an exclusive group of largely white male geniuses who then become celebrity because pop stars don’t yet exist",2023-07-31 20:10:02
or there are projects they won’t tell us about until it is too late,2023-07-26 03:39:07
from what i understand the problem is that the theory is way ahead of the experiments string theory for example is brilliant and has been around for decades but no one has figured out how to prove or disprove it,2023-08-12 15:19:01
"the moat famous people in the world used to be scientists inventors and war heroes

now it’s entertainers athletes and ceos",2023-07-23 02:51:27
nowdays science can be a bit…wordy,2023-07-22 10:56:42
i saw one of the winners of that nobel prize give a talk on that topic and i still have no  clue what it means,2023-07-24 04:45:00
"yeah people live with rose tainted glasses 

that vaccine creation was insanely fast and a testament to our scientific prowess",2023-07-22 10:53:23
to be fair for covid19 there were many different vaccines being developed simultaneously by different people the fact that the pfizer and moderna vaccines both got authorized around the same time means that its hard to point to a single scientist responsible for the vaccine compare that to say jonas salk who became a household name because his individual contributions to science created a breakthrough that led to the polio vaccine if people dont know who made the covid19 vaccine now i seriously doubt they still will in 20 years,2023-07-22 21:37:42
didn’ only take them a couple days to make the vaccine it just took a year to test it and get approvals,2023-07-22 23:58:02
katalin karikó is already famous now for her research of mrns based vaccines she is one name i learned during covid that i think will probably be remembered,2023-07-26 21:00:23
this is my favorite quote about the movie lol,2023-07-22 05:00:11
avengers endgame for stem majors,2023-07-23 18:18:18
wasnt avengers the avengers for nerds,2023-08-08 02:33:28
im not sure nerds is the right word for the group of people that discovered the surface wiping killing weapon,2023-07-22 10:50:50
is neil degrasse tyson bad i love the way he explains things,2024-02-12 17:10:38
i believe they did,2023-07-29 19:32:46
yea he really did say that exact thing about oppenheimer i love also that it ties back to his initial loneliness they dont show it the movie but he was really bullied as a kid and this scene shows that so well,2023-07-21 03:01:34
thats putting it lightly truman called oppenheimer a  who he never wanted to hear from again lol,2023-07-21 03:37:33
one of my favorite scenes in the movie mirrored the scene in which oppenheimer confesses his guilt to his wife the notion that people unburden their guilt to someone that has to live with just as much pain if not more also it’s touched upon in the day after trinity doc,2023-07-21 03:42:45
well this is the whole thing i struggle with as a historian i think it was the best option to drop the bombs it was also horrible did truman truly feel guilt did oppenheimer or were they both such megalomaniacs that they felt they had to feel bad but didnt actually  we can never be sure,2023-07-21 03:13:30
it also goes back to kitty’s line about jean “you don’t get to sin and make everyone feel sorry for you,2023-07-23 04:16:46
you made the bullet but i put it into the revolver aimed it and pulled the trigger,2023-07-21 09:07:56
i didnt think of it as attempting to upstage him i thought he was trying to shift the burden of guilt,2023-07-22 05:49:24
i think whats amazing about the movie is how it discusses theory versus reality im a history teacher and i talk to my students about theory all the time but people can be wicked like  scientists and historians and theorists in general simply dont know how to deal with these people of course we dont want to destroy our species but a few men can come along and ruin all weve built and then we have to live with the consequences,2023-07-22 02:10:21
it definitely was ego on both sides from my modern standpoint it would be great if they used it as a bonding moment but the movie made a good point of showing both men’s flaws,2023-07-21 10:44:20
he was looking forward towards a realistic future while oppenheimer was wallowing in his guilt and too much of an idealist,2023-08-05 16:37:20
its amazing how few depictions of einstein there are in film and television for how iconic and famous he is,2023-07-24 19:01:29
hes so warm and humble and yet brilliant,2023-07-24 01:20:19
i think for me its his comment as oppie is leaving that seems completely unnecessary,2023-07-21 15:01:25
yea i teach 7th grade history and its hard to convey to them how complicated all this is,2023-07-22 02:11:30
i agree he would be surprised that we have survived this long with the bomb it does make one wonder if we can survive long enough to make it to a future were atomic weapons cant destroy us bc were too spread out thats the hope and for me its where i think nuclear energy will eventually lead but we just dont know,2023-07-25 02:14:08
not sure any of them have been maybe carter certainly not the president who dropped a nuclear bomb on two cities killing hundreds of thousands of civilians,2023-08-15 15:00:13
he should he was outstanding,2023-07-22 02:10:51
"one great one is the making of the aromic bomb by richard rhodes it won a pulitzer and its 800 pages but it feels like historical fiction he starts by discussing the discover of the atom then the atomic atom heisenbergs uncertainty principle lawrences atomic collisions and keeps going it covers some 75 years of physics and chemistry before it even gets to the bomb its an amazing book 

hiroshima by john hersey talks about hiroshima and its bombing from the perspective of survivors 

its not a book but if youre an audio fan id recommend dan carlins hardcore history blitz called destroyer of worlds it comes with a million book recommendations and it discusses the years after ww2 and why this stuff is so complicated and what it was like to be alive in those years which does a lot to explain why the bombs were so terrifying and why america felt it had to use them 

id also recommend downfall by richard b frank which shows japan was not going to surrender and how the bombs were morally horrible but necessary in a war like that 

personally i think americans should come away from all this recognizing yes we did it yes we should feel bad yes japan in that era had to bestopped and no there were no options that would have led to an outcome with few more deaths and yes we spent the cold war trying to ensure the bombs were never used again both for selfish and unselfish reasons",2023-07-24 01:07:31
"id also infer this thread on twitter by someone who put together a historiography of thre various books that have argued different perspectives on using the bomb 

",2023-07-24 01:19:53
well thats how i feel the dread at the end is also ever present as well though,2023-07-26 01:43:32
well documented firsthand accounts how was he not,2023-07-21 13:51:03
youre probably too harsh here but i agree with you generally i didnt care for the performance as truman i revere oldman like many but this wasnt it my opinion of course,2023-07-23 04:40:29
i do think they serve a purpose it highlights just how much of a frontier of science they were on particularly the use of einstein the one guy everyone in the theater will know at one point oppenheimer is asked why einstein wasn’t part of the project he responds something like his ideas were outdated the basic message being the universally know smartest guy to ever live didn’t understand what these guys were doing i think as you go down the list there are probably some people included just as a bit of an easter egg to the bigger nerds in the audience and lastly they are included because they were actually there these guys have nobel prizes for a reason and the manhattan project did assemble the smartest if’s they had access to at the time,2023-07-23 03:06:42
"i know youre joking but many of them dont serve much purpose 

richard feynman is a character but he coulda basically been scientist number 5 i dont remember his character doing much of anything i didnt even realize it was feynman until i looked at the cast list after the movie",2023-07-22 08:45:54

there might be more but these are the ones i could sift through the cast list",2023-07-22 19:31:58
whoosh,2023-07-24 14:27:43
it’s a joke lol,2023-07-22 18:32:06
we spent the whole movie watching these brilliant minds creating these amazing scientific marvels and then they’re just out of their hands and control ready to be dropped asap,2023-07-23 12:54:12
the scene where we see the scientists viewing the slides of the aftermath and opp can’t even look up  the gasps mixed with the exposition was another haunting and guilt invoking scene and it was all we needed,2023-07-23 12:55:25
"i do get what you’re saying but in that scene he is seeing the outcome and i’m not sure if it would’ve been more powerful to show at least a glimpse of that as well you shouldn’t need to pander and show the guts to get across that nuclear bombs have a bad outcome but i do wonder if people have perhaps forgotten if they ever really processed it to begin with the numbers at the end are powerful but even a brief flit image i think could’ve taken that up a little 

i’m just thinking out loud here i don’t really know that i’m married to that opinion lol",2023-07-22 14:15:30
does it include thus i became the destroyer of worlds line,2023-07-21 11:39:56
agreed completely,2023-07-28 03:54:49
in a movie with a lot of small parts jack quaid has a small part,2023-07-21 15:12:40
jack quaid had a small role but he really shined imo there’s this one shot of him almost in tears that creeped into my soul,2023-07-21 15:54:23
no he didnt he stood out as much as every other famous actor that you leonardopointatscreend while watching the film,2023-07-25 05:02:13
that’s how i felt at first but after awhile he kinda grew on me,2023-07-30 10:00:41
"correct me if i’m wrong but i don’t know there watch much “writing” needed there

as far as i understand a lot of that convo was verbatim",2023-07-21 12:25:14
i knew he was in it but it’s funny because for a brief second when they flashed back he looked exactly like jeremy irons,2023-07-21 07:45:46
"thank you the first comment i found in this thread to make me not feel like an idiot for unsuccessfully looking for rdj half the movie d

even now looking at images of rdjs portrayal online my brain refuses to make the connection fascinating",2023-07-23 00:03:50
i drew it right here,2023-07-21 06:48:39
probably in the peruvian puff peppers,2023-08-05 21:42:16
i wanted to turn to my friend and ask if that was him so badly lol one of the first things i looked up when i got home,2023-07-21 03:58:43
doesn’t he look a lot like jeremy strong lately,2023-07-21 07:11:42
hes not really given a huge amount of focus the only scene where hes really relevant is the trinity test since he hits the button beyond that hes mostly just in the background of the los alamos scenes,2023-07-23 17:45:41
i knew i could recognize him but all my neurons were focused on the meter like i was the one that needed to abort the explosion,2023-07-22 03:44:16
i took the throwing up as a sign of guilt all these scientists were heads down for three years unrelenting towards a shared goal only to achieve it yet the raucous celebration and cheering gave release and in doing so freed the uncomfortable realization that forever more they will harbour this dreadful weight,2023-07-21 03:16:36
i dont think that was from drinking i interpreted it as guilt,2023-07-21 03:36:34
yeah the audience represented what people would have experienced  immediately under oppenheimerthe bomb they were turned to ash further out burned from the radiation and blown away a little further   out the people under the bleachersburied in debris outside and further away from the speechbomb the vomiting from guilt or partyingradiation sickness,2023-07-21 16:26:24
i interpreted that vomiting as guilt and processing the horror which they just unleashed upon the world,2023-07-22 07:21:46
"was that alex wolff vomiting

that dude loves to be in movies where he gets to be all snotty and slimy faced",2023-07-21 22:13:00
i really liked the scene when hes living the classroomgym space after giving the speech where he is in a dark hallway and the only light is from the windows the distorted people through the windows looked like they were on fire mixed with the screamscheers sounds carrying over from earlier really gave me chills,2023-07-22 10:49:54
and that was nolan’s daughter’s face that melted,2023-07-21 12:12:45
i really think he pitched this film to wb and they wanted to change it too much and thats why he left them i honestly believe universal saiddo what ever the f you want which is why this feels so much more unhinged then anything else hes made,2023-07-26 07:07:14
i still think interstellar and dunkirk are masterpieces imo,2023-07-21 03:05:16
best period imo,2023-07-21 03:50:24
i would say best since the prestige absolute masterclass after the dud that was tenet,2023-07-21 04:48:23
i know right,2023-07-21 02:50:11
i think its my favorite film period,2023-07-26 07:09:09
honestly i was surprised by how much krumholtz was in it thought it was only gonna be like 2 scenes but no hes in a good chunk of the movie,2023-07-21 23:47:54
i didn’t recognize her and her face made me mad for a lot of the movie but her performance was still incredible,2023-07-22 18:43:13
i figured it was due to universal giving more reign over his work compared to wb maybe im wrong,2023-07-26 07:14:42
not op but also a physicist they sidestepped more than dumbed down they perfectly captured the attitude of physicists without having to talk about science a lot i was very pleased by it,2023-07-22 17:22:54
"i would’ve enjoyed if they tried to talk about some of the math but quantum mechanics is so far removed from the average person’s grasp of math that i understand that just wasn’t going to happen

i will say the part where oppy is flirting with his eventual wife where he talks about the forces preventing us from phasing through each other even though matter is mostly empty space was exceptionally well done i couldn’t have put it better myself",2023-07-21 20:03:56
this period in time was the golden age of both experimental and theoretical physics i dont think weve seen such a brilliant group of minds since astounding levels of genius happening during a very dire time in history einstein heisenberg bohr fermi oppenheimer lawrence feynman fuchs bohmincredible,2023-07-22 05:05:07
i liked the rest of it it was a lot of dialogue but it was also very inspiring with great visuals and pacing and i now have a lot more respect for oppenheimer  also jack quiad cast as the goatrichard feynmann was probably the most unexpected for me definitely worth a rewatch from me,2023-07-21 19:55:55

he will get a ton of nominations but killers could be an upset i think cillian murphy has the best shot to win since he’s been respected for years but never had a shot at an oscar like this leo will be undoubtably great but unless he brings his best performance of his career which he could i think cillian being the titular character of a box office hit drama puts him as the favorite right now unless theres some other buzz i haven’t heard yet i haven’t looked at gold derby this year yet,2023-07-23 12:57:45

i think those two and editing are favorites for them score as well potentially nolan should have a chance at director strong shots at adapted screenplay and both rdj and cillian being acting contenders rly think this will sweep the oscar’s,2023-07-23 05:40:25
observation posts were 10000 yards away which is 9144 meters based on the speed of light 300000000 ms and the speed of sound 343 ms the light from the explosion took 003 ms to reach them and 267 seconds for the sound to reach them i didn’t time it but i wouldn’t be surprised if nolan matched that timing near perfectly,2023-07-21 16:02:42

how long were the previews me and my gf got there like 20 mins late the end of a scene with fire and text was on the screen when we walked in did we miss much,2023-07-21 07:46:22
funny i could have done with completely cutting her out of the film it felt like a caricature straight out of snl,2023-07-22 13:37:26
ohhh is that what that long stretch of darkness was,2023-07-30 16:05:25
i think you make really good points here i found the focus on oppenheimer’s reputation at the end odd like we just got to this huge explosion and commie accusations just feel like small potatoes in comparison still very well done and i loved the ending even if i feel like it could’ve been juxtaposed a bit closer to the trinity test,2023-07-24 14:04:44
most of those videos use superhero  and act like all people go to see at cinemas are easy to digest blockbusters it’s always been a dumb take,2023-07-21 18:57:50
well they are video essaysby very nature most of them are going to wildly miss the mark lol,2023-07-21 02:34:43
you got it were from the philippines,2023-07-21 14:37:43
also anime exists because of the nuke,2023-07-23 11:03:03
you mean young people and marvel fans i think most older people who watch movies outside the mcu know him for other stuff i hope because hes got some gold in his filmography,2023-07-21 11:55:35
millennials remember him as the coked out dude from natural born killers,2023-07-21 11:56:09
"seemed pretty clear to me dude the story is almost ‘narrated’ from the ‘definitely not a trial’ by oppenheimer and rdj in his similar situation the movie distinguishes this by using the black and white scenes for the recollections of strauss rdj and the colour scenes for oppenheimer it doesn’t need to be directly stated to you for this to be obvious to call this “all over the place” is straight up lunacy each placement of the rdj scenes against the oppenheimer scenes were absolutely purposeful and worked to compliment each other perfectly 

even the first act where the movie moves at lightning pace jumping from one scene to the next without giving you a chance to rest or even contemplate what you just saw is all by design these scenes are being told by oppenheimer while he is sat in that conference room watching these people tear down his character and credibility at that same lightning pace that the movie drags you through with 

if you are by chance referring to the dialogue when  you say you were confused this is somewhat be design to there are plenty of times where the dialogue is difficult to make out i point again to the first act but this is done for the same reason as i said in my last paragraph you’d notice that when the dialogue is really imperative to understanding a scene it is much easier to hear it in all the most important moments the film slows itself down to allow you to soak it in before accelerating again to the blinding pace oppenheimer’s very life is changing 

so you may be confused because the movie wanted you to be or you could have just not paid enough attention to it it was definitely not all over the place this movie without a doubt is a cinematic masterpiece",2023-07-21 20:05:55
how can you get confused by this,2023-07-21 20:27:33
it’s pretty much the same narrative device as the social network actually this one is even more obvious bc it’s color coded,2023-07-23 00:14:54
krumholtz impressed me almost as much as rdj and damon did,2023-07-22 00:48:42
where you hear that he’s gotta have a decent nest egg at this point,2023-07-24 11:48:44
ahh i had to look up who gary oldman was makes so much sense now i couldnt quite put my finger on it at the time but i knew it was someone i was familiar with,2023-07-21 21:56:21
i thought it looked like donald sumpter but on looking it up it seems it was john gowans,2023-07-21 22:51:49
wrong bush glasses from full metal jacket is vannevar bush who went on to found the national science foundation the father of george hw bush and grandfather to w was prescott bush who was a senator after wwii,2023-08-03 20:24:35
wow thats where i knew him from in retrospect i also missed the rookie cop from dredd,2023-07-29 05:40:02
i love that the theme of the movie is that they were giving a weapon of massive devestation to humans not gods,2023-07-21 06:39:02
what intrigued me was how they are so casual talking about wiping out tens of thousands of people like it was just another monday scheduling,2023-07-22 19:35:18
"i was reminded of the hbo film conspiracy its about a bunch of lawyers and politicians sitting around a table quietly discussing some legal issues 

it just happens that theyre nazis discussing how to make the holocaust legal and how to select who exactly counts as jewish",2023-08-01 19:28:33
i kept thinking couldn’t they just as well have dropped at least the first one in a relatively upopulated area of japan and it would have still had a powerful psychological effect like drop the first one onto a symbolic place like mt fuji or off shore of a major city and see if they surrender vs going straight for a dense civilian target was this even considered i guess they only had 2 bombs and they couldn’t take chances but the japanese wouldn’t know that…any way you cut it war is ,2023-07-24 06:28:27
theres a great youtube video that goes deep into how the target cities were chosen,2023-07-21 09:12:48
"i used to know a guy whose job was to figure out where to drop nuclear weapons

he was an interesting fellow",2023-07-31 01:34:47
"i was mentioning it in some other comment but i was wondering who jack quaid was playing as they hadnt named him but then i saw his character going ham on the bongos in the christmas party and i was like yeah thats definitely richard feynman

they did finally say his name during the windshield  test prelude scene",2023-07-23 16:45:41
id recommend the making of the atomic bomb first much more entertaining read and covers a lot more of the characters and history that appear in the movie,2023-07-21 08:13:57
i never read it i know of those anecdotes from various other sources or them spread as factoids on the internet,2023-07-21 13:03:05
i was considering saying factoid but instead opted for the word legend,2023-07-22 00:32:10
"i said legend

not all legends are true",2023-07-24 00:54:21
"are you from a hindu tradition whether you are or not i want to extend my sincerest apologies if i misrepresented your or anyone elses faith in my previous comment

what i said was from the perspective of westerners engaging with hinduism as oppenheimer would be rather than a definitive statement on that religion

as to your last point i think youre right i only wish you were more right i myself am not jewish but i wish there was more to fight for the marginalised and oppressed whoever they may be

edit i also want to thank you for providing more context to my remarks about the bhagavadgita if you would be so kind as to teach me more im all ears

edit 2 it was oppenheimer that first inspired me to read the bhagavadgita and the upanishads i even tried to read the rig veda",2023-08-01 05:48:48
this is gonna sound so dumb but keep in mind these are two attractive white people who have no cross cultural knowledge they also seemingly are getting off cause its wrong to read ‘bible’ like book in bed i also think they get a slight let off as she did not say “is this bhagavad gita” so she just grabbed a book to read and it happened to be in sanskrit,2023-08-01 21:51:25
yeah but good luck holding in your 2000 psi of bladder pressure during the last act,2023-07-21 18:42:21
sadly nolan doesnt release extended cuts he views the cut you see in theaters as his directors cut,2023-07-25 02:52:27
barbers third act was a little off interms of pacing it worked great but it was a little slow oppenheimer was relentless i was amazed at how it was able to get and hold my attention for 3 full hours vs the batman where it definitely felt like it went on too long,2023-07-22 16:11:47
this movie absolutely had aspects of horror,2023-07-23 21:24:25
i could not disagree more the soundlack there of the image of the burning fire and everyone so tiny knowing what you know about history you are seeing pandora’s box opening never to be closed again  goosebumps,2023-07-23 21:23:46
watch the day after trinity it helps with some of the names,2023-07-21 03:39:03
definitely not a quick read but get around to reading american prometheus it’s what nolan based the film off of  it won a pulitzer prize for biography or autobiography in 2006,2023-07-21 04:12:17
i would highly recommend the documentary to end all war oppenheimer and the atomic bomb i think it only came out a couple of weeks ago but christopher nolan also talks in it,2023-07-21 09:14:06
the making of the atomic bomb  richard rhodes  won a pulitzer fantastic book,2023-07-23 14:12:23
i know about those things from high school but i haven’t read all three volumes of das kapital lol,2023-07-21 09:10:20
the hilarious thing about him reading capital is that he had absolutely no interest in political or economic anything whatsoever for the first thirty years of his life,2023-07-21 04:56:09
and he read it in german,2023-07-21 16:01:59
you dont have to be a genius to read das kapital,2023-07-21 23:13:54
he also apparently has no problem reading extremely boring books because as fascinating as marxs insights into capitalism generally are those books aint page turners,2023-07-24 05:45:25
as a history teacher definitely have more of an appreciation and understanding of such terms and historical setting as opposed if i was watching this movie during my high school years,2023-07-25 07:09:59
he was a lonely child who replaced human interaction with reading he was absolutely voracious probably one of the most wellread people ive ever heard of,2023-07-23 01:32:40
i could be privileged in having learned about most of that stuff throughout middle and high school but i also feel like i learned about a lot of that through social media as well maybe if you’re the type to be interested in this film you might have a good foundation of knowledge already,2023-07-21 07:24:36
he says he’s read all three volumes but then she has to correct him on a very basic takeaway from it that was a pretty dumb scene,2023-07-26 10:00:41
a lot of his later life was steeped in controversy because of his ties to communism lots of it was overblown but it wasn’t completely unfounded due to his undeniable ties with the cpusa,2023-07-21 07:12:27
the research they do for every history episode is amazing but the manhattan project one was on a different level it was the best episode theyve ever done imo their comedypresentation style isnt for everyone but i think everyone should at least give it a shot just for how well researched every topic they present is,2023-07-21 05:27:08
listened to the whole thing as ive gone back and forth visiting my parents this summer it was pretty fun connecting the actors to the people ive learned about and spent so many gd hours doing so that pod is long lol,2023-07-21 04:17:44
or read the book the movie was based off  of  or if your inclined to listening grab it on audible,2023-07-21 06:41:01
i kept waiting for a ja this is niels whenever bohr showed up,2023-07-21 13:30:26
and if you need an abbreviated onceover the rest is history just did a quick twoparter,2023-07-21 03:16:12
nolan loves to intercut footage of people referenced in his movies anyway so it fit quite well normally i hate it but it fit for both of those reasons here quite well it’s usually pretty tacky and feels like it’s for the audience who ain’t following it as it is,2023-07-21 07:26:18
the first 10 mins i couldnt understand nothing and i was like well this is gonna be 3 hours of me squinting my ears it improved later tho,2023-08-28 16:28:44
at one point his wife does say that if he loses his security clearance he will lose his job and they will lose the house,2023-07-22 00:24:15
i got that point pretty clearly actually and i had no knowledge on that part of his story going in they convey it mostly through strauss,2023-07-21 21:31:38
"i remember only one scene where the sound mix was difficult the clothesline scene for some reason music dialogue and sfx of the sheets blowing in the wind were all at the same level making it difficult to focus 

that said i have pretty crappy hearing so 1 scene in a 3 hour nolan movie with poor sound is a massive upgrade from his last movie",2023-07-22 06:53:51
that part of the book american prometheus bored me as well tbh  i think nolan could’ve cut 1015m from that sequence and been ok  strauss is interesting but we spend a lot of time with him for some reason when as the movie itself concludes he wasn’t that important,2023-07-24 01:15:59
welcome to mid20th century physics this film def did not pass the bechdel test but i mean you can’t rewrite history physics then and to a big extent now too was a white man’s game,2023-07-22 01:52:26
i know haha they shouldve had id badges or different hair color lol,2023-07-22 00:40:29
"i read it this summer quite frankly it’s just ok  it sits firmly on top of rhodes’ book which won the pulitzer prize 20 years before american prometheus

the movie does a great job covering oppenheimer’s life but barely touches on the other incredible stories surrounding the the actual bomb program  fermi probably gets the shortest straw of the film relegated to a single scene and an offhand “well i guess you did it”

in reality chicago pile 1 was the greatest science experiment ever conducted up to that time and fermi did it with college kids and almost no resources  after he built that he went to hanford and ran the plutonium separation team which was an incredible accomplishment  they build a factory to separate kilograms of plutonium at a time when separating plutonium had only been done in a lab and in micrograms  the factory was entirely built to be remotely operated and it worked

there we’re probably only two people who could have run the bomb program other than oppenheimer ernest lawrence and enrico fermi",2023-07-24 01:25:51
i still believe both scenes were quite unnecessary while i kind of understand what nolan wanted to do for the testimony one,2023-07-21 15:36:26
there’s an appreciation for the symbolism and nonlinear elements and their ability to convey the layers behind people’s thoughts desires and motivations shrug,2023-07-22 14:57:34
haha it just hit me an i was amazed no one else here said it first,2023-07-22 22:33:01
if that happens then i feel i’m owed at least 1 pizza,2023-07-23 02:04:22
he never vacationed in dresden with his wife,2023-07-24 12:59:47
"oh we went there for a vacation and it was really nice lets not  them all lets  a different city because obviously were still doing that

it is a funny line but it is also a horrifying line",2023-07-23 15:53:05
men playing  deciding who lives and dies over jokes and fond memories,2023-07-23 21:28:26
it’s supposed to come off as culturally insensitive,2023-07-21 20:11:32
i think it was just the point being like i had this really nice soup while i was there so i decided i wont  them all,2023-07-21 20:11:32
he did remove it from the list against the militarys wishes because he said it was culturally significant many scholars believe that this was just his justification when it was actually more personally driven including that he maybe took his honeymoon there,2023-07-21 20:50:47
considering how horrific japans actions were during wwii especially towards the countries it invaded and occupied,2023-07-22 03:33:18
"oppie i am not in charge of pregnancy control in los alamos sergent

pregnant emily blunt passes by

sergent yes i can see that

film had lots of little quips and jokes that were hilarious",2023-07-21 12:46:28
" strauss is jewish and feels like oppenheimer is reducing his jewish heritage by being an adulterer and not following his religion enough

it was a lot more than that antisemitism was rampant at the time especially in american politics the fact strauss was able to be as successful as he was while openly embracing being jewish was a major anomaly of that era and he thought oppenheimer was wasting his platform by not doing the same",2023-07-21 20:46:23
also strauss had the support of several people that were jealous of oppenheimer success building his hate even more,2023-07-21 03:14:10
strauss was also ultra conservative and oppenheimer was left leaning,2023-07-21 21:35:46
good memory i don’t recall your 2nd point but i believe you it was hazy about this and then revealed when the mr robot actor brought it all up at the hearing,2023-07-21 04:00:55
so let me get this straight einstein oppenheimer rabi strauss and fermi were all jews nazis can burn in ,2023-07-21 08:07:39
also oppenheimer embarrassed him at a conference about isotopes or something i didnt fully understand the nuances of what they were talking about but it was clear that was a big deal to strauss whose ego could not handle that humiliation,2023-07-22 18:51:14
honestly the second point sounds really interesting i wish they could’ve explored it more but this probably isn’t the right film for it,2023-07-22 04:26:40
" they didn’t explain it well

that might be my only beef with the film  it felt like there was a disconnect in the plot at this moment and the jump was sudden",2023-07-22 05:25:36
wasn’t congress originally grilling strauss for his associations with oppenheimer why would strauss want to destroy oppenheimers reputation when strauss himself is getting hurt by that,2023-07-22 02:36:11
yeah this movie does a good job of conveying the fact that every single importantnotable event in history is either the direct results of egotistical thinking or at least massively influenced by the very human desire to protect ones own image of the world,2023-07-21 03:20:17
even at high levels of civilization there is personal vindictiveness to smear somebody’s reputation based out of feeling wronged ie cain and abel,2023-07-21 04:31:52
i purposely went in blind without researching and would recommend to anyone who hasn’t seen the movie not do that wish i had watch the doco before because i would have understood a lot more about characters intentions,2023-07-21 03:16:00
they mention in the movie that he supported the h bomb between 1945 and 1949 but they didnt give a great reason why he changed his mind do they explain why,2023-07-21 07:40:46
nolan’s films are very dense and the pacing never lets up some people argue that his films benefiting from rewatches is somehow a con i wish there were more films that begged viewers to rewatch and pick up more details and intentions,2023-07-22 13:51:51
"i think there was more to it than that they essentially were trying to deplatform him for using his position to publicly criticize how the us was escalating the cold war with russia

if oppenheimer loses his clearance and his reputation is ruined nobody will listen to his dire warnings about arms races and developing the h bomb which is what happens",2023-07-21 05:13:52
were gonna find out aaron sorkin was a an uncredited ghostwriter lol,2023-07-22 05:19:48
idk i think the closed room hearing stuff could have been edited down or somehow simplified it felt very repetitive,2023-07-31 08:05:23
"yeah i didnt mind oppenheimers 3 hour run time but social network did it in 2 hours and it was better for it

social network is a much better film and thats not a discredit to oppenheimer social network is nearly flawless imo",2023-07-23 04:52:22
i don’t agree in the slightest the acting cinematography sound design score are all better here,2023-07-24 00:55:14
100,2023-07-22 04:54:52
i’ve seen bait healthier than you ,2023-07-21 07:55:30
theyre clearly talking about the filmmaking not the subject matter they even elaborated with bullet points,2023-07-21 05:48:37
i mean those 5 minutes tho amiright,2023-07-21 04:09:00
"it seems so 

people probably wanted an ending where wong opens a portal and in comes through neil degrasse tyson carl sagan stephan hawking michio kaku and bill nye the  science guy just to tell oppenheimer doctor were building a team we need you 

roll credits okay that was a joke i doubt anyone actually wanted that lol",2023-12-30 06:11:08
some people genuinely didnt like it but i suspect many of these comments come from contrarians that either hate nolan the fact that this is one of the most popular movies this year or the fact that its getting tons of critical and popular praise,2024-02-05 08:34:52
he fought as a soldier for the white army against the reds and lived to see the end of the soviet union crazy,2023-07-21 03:18:59
he was born in the us and his family was recalled to russia in 1912 then got to  communists in a revolution he was drug into then supervised the dismantling of the  nuclear program and lived to send the dismantling of the soviet union that displaced his family from their homes sounds like a great movie,2023-07-21 04:39:32
,2023-07-29 23:23:50
how is it possible to make kyle rittenhouse seem more based,2023-07-21 07:14:17
to be fair it’s a three hour historical fiction film that’s dialogue heavy you’re never going to take that all in on first watch,2023-07-21 18:39:15
i would probably believe that if nolan didn’t have a crappy track record with audio mixing,2023-07-22 00:26:55
"this is an interesting take actually 

i wonder if this is what nolan was thinking if yes genius because i was feeling an added layer of anxiety due to the fact that i couldn’t keep up",2023-07-21 12:14:05
theres even recognizable unnamed scientists like feynman,2023-08-05 05:59:27
i went in completely blind and didnt know anything about the story or the characters and it was definitely hard to follow especially for the first third of it a lot of these threads are dominated by people who already are familiar with the characters or the plotline on some level and hence theyre downvoting you,2023-07-22 15:39:37
i liked everything else about the movie but the editing took a lot of points off for me it felt bloated and i was lost for a lot of it,2023-07-23 09:17:03
but i’ll also say i loved it can’t wait to see it again and follow it better,2023-07-22 00:51:45
not smarter  just more familiar with history and the lives of some of these people the book this is based on is a great read,2023-08-02 05:05:17
there was a very real and immediate and desperate need by the scientific community to try to prevent armageddon that i think the movie really soft pedalled,2023-08-05 06:03:14
"right like i said i was able to piece it together

im wondering if others had that same issue",2023-07-21 18:57:29
i forgot my apple watch at home and i really regretted it,2023-07-26 06:54:24
i was gripping my fists together and i already knew how this whole story played out but  the build up was just so brilliant and his hand trembling before hitting the button the countdown and then silence and then bang  so good everyone was just collectively silent and frozen in their seats,2023-07-26 08:56:57
for real i just got done seeing this about 30 minutes ago i felt as if all the air and gravity got  out of the room with how silent it got and this was in a theater where there was annoyingly quite a bit of talking coming from the row behind me,2023-07-26 09:35:56
right when the movie started a guy down in the handicapped seats in front of my started playing solitaire on his phone i said to myself oh no not today not when i just drove 2 hours to see oppenheimer in imax so i tapped him on the shoulder and told him to put it away he did,2023-07-22 22:51:35
a few people started whispering next to me but fortunately it was a bit after the silence so i got to experience it pretty well unfortunate for you though i really wish people understood theater etiquette and took it seriously i for one put my phone on silent every time,2023-07-22 22:11:08
dude thats awful im sorry,2023-07-22 22:39:31
"oh yeh didnt think that far i was just curious how nolan would pull off the explosion bit i think everyone knew there would be one and there was a huge amount of talk into how people would feel it or how it was a big part of the movie personally i was worried on whether it would be as impactful as people were expecting or how it may end up being disappointing if not pulled correctly 

nope best way possible to do it definitely",2023-07-22 22:13:43
nope,2023-07-22 00:38:06
we do not,2023-07-22 00:48:07
thank  i never look at marketing or trailers  just went in there seeing the title and knowing who oppenheimer was  only expectation was that it would be about him,2023-07-22 14:29:24
that’s an interpretation because it definitely wasn’t the subject matter of the movie,2023-07-22 10:58:22
" honestly im not afraid of sentient ai as theres no reason to believe thats possible

thats a mistake many make you dont need sentient ai for it to be dangerous just an effective enough tool for someone to commit significant damage to society",2023-07-22 11:37:13
what damage did the a bomb actually do if anything since its invention there hasnt been any global major war between 2 superpowersmajor powers if anything although the bomb in itself is a horrible weapon it helped halt wars,2023-07-22 11:58:03
"fair i just feel like 2 or 3 of the interviews hit the same points about him having ties to communism i guess like “ok we established that why repeat it” 

i liked it overall just felt like it could have been trimmed a bit",2023-08-30 21:19:30
besides that follows the book its based on,2023-08-30 01:31:42
that was the main part tho,2023-08-29 03:14:32
til thanks that’s cool,2023-08-30 02:43:30
im convinced that 90 of those only thought it was good because they were told they should think it was good not because they actually enjoyed it,2024-01-29 18:07:55
thank you i’m excited to see it,2023-07-21 02:41:30
yes i was feeling a tad uncomfortable because i brought my dad and sexnudity is a bit offensive to him but i was blown away i love how theres a slow drip of surrealism in this movie,2023-07-21 02:28:03
i wonder did that do that scene for real in front of all those people if so kudos must have taken guts or they just edited later,2023-07-21 02:33:13
nolan definitely figured out what the people want when it came to flo,2023-07-21 02:21:43
reminded me of the master,2023-07-21 03:00:47
i was surprised when she was composed she was a bit nervous but then she really found her backbone,2023-07-21 04:56:41
especially since jean is a ghost by that point her memory haunts both robert and his wife just in different ways,2023-07-23 01:57:46
 right i was like is this mf really playing another major historical figure loved his scene,2023-07-21 02:24:48
the moment when he sat back and pursed his lips was just classic oldman i loved that,2023-07-21 04:26:31
it ain’t hoover day is it,2023-07-21 06:25:40
when he was first on screen i was sure it was nathan lane because i watched the german dub so i didn’t have the voice to pinpoint it,2023-07-21 05:54:41
it’s when they’re asking oppenheimer about exporting isotopes,2023-07-22 20:03:51
dont get me wrong that scene was perfect just wasnt ready,2023-07-23 04:01:57
reminds me of that chris hemsworth movie where they slapped glasses on a literal  bod and said “nah it’s cool he’s a nerd” ,2023-07-21 03:17:06
he knows about it he talked about with tenet,2023-07-21 02:42:37
a few of robert downey scenes had that effect like he’s clearly upset and flabbergasted and everyone is talking at once and you can’t really make out  is happening same with maleks character and the “gotcha” moments they came very fast and didn’t leave long to catch up but you still understood what was happening,2023-07-21 14:25:29
if youve ever listened to someone tell a story dissociated during the middle and snapped back to reality at the end only to understand the feeling that you should have gotten from that story then you understand if you havent then you wont not necessarily a good thing but definitely what nolan is going for,2023-07-21 05:22:08
" we were talking about how it was difficult to understand what people were saying at certain points while walking out of the movie

i almost walked out of the movie 15 minutes in because i only understood about 70 of the dialogue it was like the bass completely overshadowed the mids and it sounded like someone talking under a blanket 

it eventually cleared up well enough to enjoy the film but never totally went away",2023-07-22 05:20:15
"was thinking the same one of the best roles rdj has ever had 

honestly this film could sweep as far as im concerned one of the best films ive seen in ages",2023-07-22 05:22:14
yeah i didnt have any issues with the dialogue here but tenets was a disaster,2023-07-21 05:46:39
just wait till he regresses to the mean,2023-07-21 02:54:11
joe montana for the old folks,2023-07-21 02:56:36
no clue how anyone could doubt him and his work he’s proven himself time and time again,2023-07-21 03:16:03
mahomes has 5 seasons nolan has 20 years and like 10 movies…,2023-07-30 17:19:21
"i thought the same thing i knew he looked familiar but i couldn’t place him i asked my spouse and she didn’t know either but he was my guess i couldn’t believe i was right

also either he’s a giant or murphy is much smaller than i thought because he towers over him",2023-07-22 02:00:57
i think they dub their own voices over for pretty much any imax film almost none of the audio during actual filming is kept due to the giant clicky monster hovering near them,2023-07-21 03:25:44
the same as you see in the posters,2023-07-21 10:26:58
nolan always does this ,2023-07-26 10:07:55
it was too loud for me too didnt know i needed earplugs for movies now like when going to concerts,2023-07-26 14:09:26
"i see what youre saying but theory of everything is a much more straightforward singlecharacterfocused film they were able to spend a lot more time on it because it was a major focal point of the character development even that got much of his theory wrong and really glossed over what made it important to the point they even removed the team that helped hawking come up with hawking radiation they changed it so he was looking into a fire and had a eureka moment which was definitely not how it happened 

if they were to make a parallel attempt in this film it wouldnt be about the manhattan project but instead about his leading the team who explored the idea of a dark star aka a black hole as we saw this took up maybe 3 minutes of runtime in this movie so to extrapolate on that would be really tiresome  now consider doing that with all the concepts that were introduced throughout the film dark stars splitting the atom superpositions collision cascades etc i just dont think you can do that successfully in this film that already spends the first 2 hours running full speed through the story",2023-08-02 14:11:44
cant disagree more its thrilling to learn about this science and it takes a smart director to find the right balance of information and entertainment the fact that he hardly attempted it was a missed opportunity and suggests a dim view of the audiences intellectual appetite,2023-08-03 20:02:25
" that they were working on two bombs at once 

they did explain this when they discussed the difficulties of manufacturing the plutonium and uranium it was the first marble scene 

the waves are a solid example of what im talking about they did mention that they would use force to compress the core uniformly from all sides they didnt need to explain the physics behind it because thats not the critical part people understand",2023-08-05 17:46:27
i can see that and the general curiosity people have is i feel a sign that nolan made you give a  about some morally questionable people i just didnt see the movie being about the bomb though it felt like an observation of the consequences of ego receding back behind ethics too late,2023-08-06 12:50:08
oh  i hated the attempt at human emotions in interstellar,2023-08-08 15:13:16
yeah i was seeing mirrors about ai i dont think the movie intended that though it just happens to line up great with the coming upheaval,2023-08-08 06:04:08
the theme and point of the movie is consequences of one’s actions which he was under constant assault of any choice he made,2023-08-08 23:36:43
"does every movie need a message more than what we may already know does that make it a bad message

i enjoyed it the dialogue was interesting and dense and i enjoyed seeing both sides of the making of the bomb that final scene with einstein seems to really be the big message and yes we may know it already  but that doesnt make it bad

editufrecklie describes exactly what i mean link",2023-08-08 15:12:46
"i didn’t really leave the movie with the feeling the atomic bombs were bad 

i left the theater with the feeling that they should’ve never been used the movie left me in a state where i could really see how oppenheimer was torn in between the possibilities and the dangers that such power brings",2023-08-09 09:50:44
not really for the general public if you need to have a degree to understand it,2024-02-04 02:48:59
i mean let’s not act like oppenheimer was a short movie it was 3 hours yes chernobyl was 55 hours but 3 hours is plenty of time for 5 mins of explaining the science,2023-12-08 15:53:02
eh when they’re talking about fission and fusion all throughout the movie i guarantee 90 of the audience has no idea what that means,2023-12-08 15:53:41
"it was very noticeable to me during the interviewinquiry scenes sorry forget the right word but when they’re in the small room being grilled by the panel

the visuals in those scenes are actually quite bland and repetitive the same shot of whoever is being interrogated often with someone else in the background behind them it’s oppenheimer when he’s not talking or emily blunt behind oppenheimer etc…

it’s very stale for a movie yet the most intense music is played in the background to the point where it gets a bit farcical",2023-08-03 20:34:31
i watched a few videos on atomic bomb tests on youtube this past week because its not something that i have a lot of knowledge on i gotta say that the actually explosion in the film felt way smaller than it should have been the sound design was incredible but i didnt feel like the extra few dollars i spent for an imax ticket added anything visually,2023-07-23 20:41:57
i saw it at just a regular theater obviously nothing to compare it to but i didnt feel like the setup impacted my enjoyment at all,2023-07-21 05:01:03
i drove 4 hours to watch it in imax and in my opinion i think i couldve just watched it in my local theater,2023-07-22 13:54:13
"imax 70mm

70mm

imax 

regular theater",2023-07-21 02:32:58
there’s like 30 theaters nationwide that have it and none in chicago,2023-07-21 03:55:19
i think it would be unless you really care about the extra screen height ive never seen a movie on film before and i thought it was super cool and interesting on just 70mm i think i could see the film perforations sometimes i think its nolans recommendation to especially since some of the imax digital options near you might not be as good,2023-07-23 00:53:09
praying for u,2023-07-25 21:30:44
the theatre was dead silent when i left i caught someone asking google how many wmds are in the world,2023-07-21 21:58:23
why do you say this obviously more movies to come but that’s a pretty spectacular and haunting performance you think leo is going to win,2023-07-25 13:40:20

colonel boris pash,2023-07-23 18:41:32
what do you mean by “first full imax film” the film isn’t shot entirely on imax,2023-08-03 17:04:51
umm its historically accurate and a big deal in oppenheimers life good grief,2023-08-14 04:33:25
i always bring my loop earplugs making movies more enjoyable at the theatre,2023-08-28 08:22:26
"after 10–15ish minutes i was mostly able to figure out what was going on but i didn’t care for feeling thrown off from the getgo we seem to almost open on oppenheimer having an anxiety attack so that must’ve been purposeful 

it didn’t help that i couldn’t hear much of the dialogue felt like there was nothing to grab on to i’ve got a real bone to pick with these filmmakers who believe clear dialogue is optional",2023-08-28 04:52:38
as a physics nerd i was giddy to see so many people i recognized never figured i’d see any of them depicted in a movie,2023-08-30 01:38:30
its what ive consistently read and heard everywhere that they couldnt tell it was him,2023-08-31 08:04:03
pretty understandable tbh,2023-09-03 22:28:09
the only one i remember balding throughout the movie was david krumholtzs rabi,2023-08-31 08:06:34
seeing it in a regular digital theater the loud moments were loud enough so much that when the second big boom at the post explosion ralley went off it made me jump in my seat obviously theaters tend to put a little more care and attention into imax screens so theres a chance you might get a  sound system if theyre not maintaining it properly but again not essential to go out of your way to find an imax,2023-07-21 02:53:16
i watched dunkirk in imax and missed most of the dialogue because of how loud the background music was same with dark knight rises cant imagine watching a 3 hour dialogue driven movie this way,2023-07-21 09:40:53
"
every movie shot for imax frames their shots for standard projection since it has to be seen that way too you gain nothing of actual value seeing the extra top and bottom of the frame",2023-07-21 03:15:30
your adjust to the screen no matter what i didn’t find 70 mm that different,2023-07-21 03:56:21
thisis factually incorrect,2023-07-21 13:19:53
my theatre was loud as  any louder would have been toooo much like i’m used to watching movies on my ipad a regular theatre was more then enough for me,2023-07-22 13:26:45
i watched it in imax and with captions in my native language and it definitely helps i don’t think i could handle a nolan movie without them,2023-07-21 13:04:59
hes an important historical figure that people have interest in  its not about deserves  youre acting like only heroes should have movies about their lives which is a pretty juvenile attitude  there have been tons of historical biographies about people that werent exactly saints  its nothing new,2023-07-23 14:50:38
"he created the atomic bomb its the most important thing that has ever happened in human history and changed the course of humanity forever we are still at the whims of world leaders that could drop one at any moment

of course hes important enough to get his own movie thats why there are countless books about him as well

are you ",2023-07-23 14:55:12
"making a movie about a person does not equal endorsement of that person

also why would a white director covering the indigenous or japanese perspective be a good thing isn’ better that people from those communities tell their own story",2023-07-23 14:46:21
"thats kind of a brilliant interpretation actually



thanks",2023-07-29 14:14:28
yeah it was mutually assured career destruction,2023-08-01 02:28:49
in real life no but in the context of the film it did almost come across that way  strauss seemed to share the policy differences that motivated nichols and borden and teller but also to be moved to his extreme actions mostly by personal animus,2023-07-23 16:19:05
yeah i had a feeling someone here would try and pull the pretention card there but i figured trying to reword it in a way that would placate them wouldve been a lost cause,2023-07-23 22:40:46

ive long been fascinated by the story of the manhattan project and oppenheimer so when i saw it there were a lot of oblique references in there that might not be obvious on a first viewing,2023-08-01 03:28:47
saying oppenheimer will hurt cinema after coming through a decade of remakes and superhero movies dominating the box office is just wild,2023-07-28 00:53:38
oppenheimer has already been doing well and will continue to do well the different opinions and discussions and so forth that people take away from it is the business of those who go see it but it looks like the movie is doing pretty successfully for now,2023-07-28 00:27:50
"yeah i saw dune in imax and think it was my best cinema experience ever  it was so immersive and so many shots worthy of the huge screen

oppenheimer only has a handful and the majority of the film would look fine on a small screen  some of it felt more like a tv show than a movie",2023-08-04 11:03:37
"true its not really necessary to watch this in 70mm imax but i will say if someone has an opportunity to watch it in 70mm imax and the theater is less than lets say a 2 hour drive i think itd be worthwhile if youre flying or driving many hours just to see this film like ive read people have done that is wild but more power to them 

id imagine watching it in dolby would be a great alternative too",2023-08-04 19:47:08
"i don’t get the point of imax for a movie that’s mostly board room meetings

the background is its own character in this film  if you are looking for marvel bang bang scenes you are going to be disappointed  if you are looking for how the entire frame can be used by a master then you will have a good time at the imax",2023-08-05 16:55:54
"i feel like it might be nolans time to be recognized by the academy

over the years ive come to realize the oscars reward careers more than they do actual best pictures directors etc in any given year",2023-07-21 05:26:05
"oscar bait never gets nominated thats what makes it oscar bait people know its oscar bait


scorsese just rarely ever makes a  film",2023-07-21 08:04:47
no it was suicide but oppenheimer felt guilty and in his imagining of her death he was there doing it,2023-07-21 04:06:24
there was hand in glove in one scene,2023-07-21 20:20:10
there are real conspiracy theories that she was murdered by intelligence agents and that they just staged it as a suicide i think it’s a fair interpretation that nolan meant for it to be ambiguous,2023-07-21 04:17:29
there was a hand with black gloves pushing her head into the tub it was intercut quickly with her drowning,2023-07-21 03:24:28
who could,2023-07-22 20:43:00
"even more spoilers

they do it twice",2023-07-21 14:35:42
what,2023-07-21 14:14:47
she might have been applauding murphys performance we dont know lol,2023-07-21 19:26:15
 what,2023-07-22 20:45:46
well the title is truth in advertising,2023-07-24 01:54:34
"it was never about science who said that i think the main issue here was the atomic bomb and not the life of oppenheimer especially when his life wasn´t all that interesting except for the bomb 

and lets be honest when people sees a poster of oppenheimer with a giant bomb in the background i dont expect they think its a movie about politics",2023-07-24 01:30:20
ultimately its a movie about its title character rather than thr abomb itself  and much of the film was focused on his life and changing perspective after,2023-07-24 01:53:57
apparently manhattan is fictional lol my dad played me,2023-07-23 23:49:07
the story was barely about oppenheimer though he was the narrative vehicle for the creation of the bomb and the political effects of it the movie spent no time on his scientific brilliance he brought the science to america we are supposed to believe he’s a genius but the film never shows this to us just tells us what happened after he lost his clearance which is what the film was building to and foreshadowing the whole time when did he die how did he feel about the arms race and the cold war there wasn’t even text at the end to explain the rippling effects the movie felt like it wanted to tell his involvement in the manhattan project and the immediate after effects but not a story of his whole life it also wanted to explore the political implications of the bomb and what it means for the world we live in today but felt like it did both half baked,2023-07-24 00:17:27
literally all the trailers were about the bomb and that’s the most important part of his life and what he’s most known for don’t be disingenuous,2023-07-24 01:11:43
lets be honest the bomb is absolutely central to oppenheimers story,2023-07-24 01:18:31
apparently he said that in real life this movie makes truman look like a real demon lol,2023-07-21 13:08:27
"it wasnt far from the truth of how it played out 

oppenheimer had already antagonized truman during an october 1945 meeting according to a note which truman sent to under secretary of state dean acheson the crybaby scientist had spent much of his time wringing his hands and telling me they had blood on them


it wasnt a long meeting  and from oppenheimers perspective which is what the scene in the movie is showing it probably felt that way",2023-08-10 05:15:30
" instead oppenheimer is sad and truman comes off as a simple minded  rather than the talented and burdened politician he was

so accurate",2023-08-11 06:25:04
agree that it was a weak scene and there were many in the movie but it did play well into the theme of the bomb being outside of oppenheimers control once it was built  truman didnt know the bomb even existed until after fdr died he certainly didnt understand exactly how it worked didnt risk his neck flying the enola  and didnt even know the nagasaki bomb was being dropped until after the fact  but still he gloats about getting credit for the mass killing of civilians and is confident the russians wont be able to build a bomb at any point  a strong effigy for the backwards attitudes that america would adopt around our nuclear weapons,2023-08-11 16:56:41
thats how truman and oppenheimers interaction was like historically in real life it was even worse truman said do you want to wipe your tears after offering the handkerchief and called him a ct instead of crybaby,2023-08-19 10:32:40
they went to great lengths to mention that those scenes aren’t cg i can see how you’d do it practically,2023-07-26 11:22:35
if you think those scenes are unnecessary i think a large chunk of the film’s themes blew over your head,2023-07-21 17:12:03
raunchy would absolutely not be my wording for it,2023-07-23 04:26:27
dont forget the random flashbacks it shows to those scenes,2023-07-21 15:32:33
ive never seen any batman movies is it alright to watch dark knight trilogy out of context ill most likely stream it at home since you know they dont show these moves anymore on big screens,2023-07-23 17:52:19

i saw interstellar in imax and it still remains one of my most unforgettable cinema experiences seeing the endurance as just a dot floating through space on that massive screen just amazing,2023-07-23 20:06:37
plus just before hed made a big deal about how he could introduce einstein to oppenheimer but oppenheimer had known him for years strauss probably felt oneupped by that,2023-08-05 08:06:04
it was mentioned in the movie that it was dutch,2023-08-17 19:38:01
 were they screaming about i would be livid,2023-07-24 20:50:40
"one of the main criticisms is that he is very elitist about his view on how films should be

main complaints are always about how  terrible his sound mixing is with the score constantly drowning out the dialogue to where it is unintelligible",2023-08-17 06:17:41
the movie might be hurt by the weight of expectations having never seen anything of nolans i was very impressed with this film,2023-08-16 19:44:16
nobody is above criticism,2023-08-16 21:56:54
they should have hired a different director would have made a better movie,2023-08-20 13:07:50
okay so go watch one of the hundreds of films that deal with that subject instead of criticizing a movie you clearly didnt understand for not being that,2023-08-20 17:33:09
dude he was such a vital element of this movie the way he started to unravel a bit and get heated with opp simultaneously with the reveal to the audience that he was personally selected by strauss and perhaps had some skin in the game worked so perfectly,2023-07-21 02:47:02
where is bin laden,2023-07-21 03:27:46
i will say this i went for a better av experience showing over comfort and that was a mistake the av was excellent but 25 hours in the uncomfy chairs definitely started to take me out of it wish i went to a more standard showing with recliners but movie itself wasnt taking me out of it at all the third act was an excellent courtroom drama,2023-07-21 06:14:40
my brain could but my bladder couldnt,2023-07-21 13:51:35
yeah the time went quick for me,2023-07-21 03:47:39
"we had some claps at amc citywalk i feel like the people who got opening day tickets are generally going to be film nerds and it doesn’t seem like such an odd thing for me if i’m honest

i see it pretty often at one of the art house theaters in santa monica i go to pretty sure there were some claps at the end of roma in 70mm a few weeks ago it’s almost like clapping for the projection format celebrating that there’s still film being used and the effort for projecting it 

there’s definitely more clapping when there’s a qa of some sort of course",2023-07-23 08:02:03
you’re getting downvoted but the focal length of the closeup shots took me out a bit too that was really my only grievance with the thing,2023-07-21 03:57:54
i found it too boring i 100 agree with you that teasertrailers were extremely misguiding i wanted the abstract imagery more but we only get them in bits and pieces moreover i couldnt handle the expository dialogue it is indeed a good drama but i think nolan got a bit overindulgent,2023-07-21 10:25:50
"i get what your saying but the security clearance wasn’t really the point the point was oppenheimer’s reputation sure historically that probably wasn’t the point but in the movie his legacy was everything

it’s the same idea as the imitation game and chernobyl what came after is where the drama is",2023-07-21 10:39:21
very well said nobody cared about the security clearance  it was just uncomfortable and unnecessary id love to see the bombs being dropped in japan and the effects it had on the population without being too graphic thats the whole point of the movie the atomic bomb,2023-07-21 11:33:47
"i think would i have been a japanese person seeing that would be extremely emotionally difficult

whereas chinese korean vietnamese malaysian thai cambodian philippine and indonesian audiences would have cheered",2023-07-22 03:44:04
i forgot to mention benny he was great too crazy how everyone just killed their roles,2023-07-23 03:24:09
he had like 2 minutes of screen time and killed it during that limited time,2023-07-23 03:25:12
i mean the movie was centered around cillian and it was about as starstudded as a cast gets not sure what youd expect his role was quite impactful despite limited screen time,2023-07-23 03:44:53
for what  reason he did great in mr robot and that wasn’t too long ago and he was great as freddie mercury,2023-07-23 03:52:51
that dude is a waste in everything hes in,2023-07-23 04:00:07

im sure i only saw 2 people out of a packed cinema get up to take a  and 23 of the people in the group i was in was crossing their legs in that last 30 it was worth suffering the queue to get into the toilet after wards ,2023-07-23 14:33:31
lol right i started to develop a migraine halfway through but i was so into it i stuck it out and just ran out as soon as it was over guy next to me fell asleep at one point ,2023-07-23 14:52:19
when i watched barbie 2 teenage girls got up and left even dumped their popcorn and everything literally 510 minutes before the movie ended i was so confused,2023-07-23 18:08:15
"i agree  the actual nuclear explosion was unimpressive  if they went with practical effects for authenticity it was a bad call  i know the regular viewer is not super into physics but a step by step sequence ala tom clancys sum of all fears three shakes chapter wouldve given the public an idea of how  complicated is detonating an atomic bomb  include the double flash the brightness of a thousand sunsall we got was an embiggened fireball   throw in a scene where a soldier or scientist sees the bones in his hands because of the great light

it’s about the making of the most dangerous weapon the worlds ever seen it’s not supposed to be fun,2023-07-27 03:45:28
i don’t understand how you can complain on the explosion scene when it was historically accurate what are you waiting for thanos to pop out i don’t get it,2023-07-27 04:58:06
i actually started thinking that the bomb hadn’t worked properly it looked so small haha,2023-07-28 17:33:09
"if he got the security clearance he would be able to get a major role in regulating nuclear wepons in the future this is a really big deal especially considering hes the lead scientist who created them   


they wanted to keep him out to continue the research and go the route of the more destructive hydrogen bombs that he was reluctant to pursue   


strauss represents the military industrial complex and everything eisenhower warned us about in his famous beware the military industrial complex speech   


now take a look at where we are with nuclear weapons and the tension throughout the world regarding them on a regular basis",2023-07-28 00:51:11
losing security clearance meant that he was cut off from all of atomic research in the us effectively ending his career i agree that it wasnt explained enough in the movie,2023-07-28 00:20:25
it was more about how the very government that he served and helped to win the war turned their back on him tarnished his name and didnt afford him the right to influence policy regarding atomic energy even though he was one of the foremost figures in the world on the subject,2023-07-28 00:19:21
"oppenheimer had spent 30 years of his life studying and teaching physics by the time of the clearance hearings he had devoted the hulk of his professional life to theorizing experimenting teaching about the bomb it defined his life he pulled off the impossible and built a theoretically infeasible bomb in 3 years leading the cream of the crop in his field in doing the impossibleit can be argued that fee bomb ended wwii 

with the revocation of his clearance he was abruptly expelled from of the conversations he had led for 30 years a wall was put up between him and the only people who understood the things he cared about the most

it would have been kinder to  him",2023-07-28 06:00:54
i dont think it can get much clearer than if you lose the clearance well lose the house,2023-07-28 00:42:16
"cancelled before they get to the bomb

jesus christ ",2023-08-22 23:58:35
what did you feel wasnt resolved,2023-08-20 17:16:14
i mean that’s pretty much how oppenheimer’s life went lol you expect them to twist history,2023-08-20 15:15:01
not just policy making but research too  he was effectively cut off from his lifes work,2023-08-05 19:37:18
meh its a biopic exploring j robert oppenheimer in particular it was not designed to be a dramatized documentary about the history of atomic warfare  no doubt an interesting movie could be made about that topic but oppenheimer was not designed to be that movie  really its long and complicated enough with enough different scientists over many decades going back to before oppenheimer was born that its more a topic for a ken burnsstyle miniseries,2023-07-24 20:34:04
this was what i thought as well however i dont think we need a three hour movie to drive home a message this simple i did notice that later shots of the movie were much more close up and narrow but i feel like thats just a visual representation of the weight on the characters increasing if i recall correctly it was mostly done on frames and scenes with oppenheimer and strauss,2023-07-24 21:18:12
do you think the general audience would come anywhere close to understanding how an abomb is made in 3 hours,2023-07-24 19:46:06
"the basic principles of how the original abombs worked is both very public and not particularly difficult to understand

fission reactions work when you have a mass of fissile material of sufficient mass and density to start a chain reaction this is called a critical mass  this is what they did under the bleachers in chicago  if go from subcritical to wellbeyondcritical very quickly youve made a fission bomb  if you do it very slowly in a controlled fashion you have a nuclear reactor  if you do it slowly but in an uncontrolled fashion you have a nuclear meltdown

liitle boy the hiroshima weapon worked by firing using a singleuse cannon to fire a slug of u235 fired into the side of a sphere of u235 with a hole in it for the slug the completed sphere being a critical mass while each separate part is relatively inert  man the style of weapon used for the trinity test used shaped charges to implode a sphere of plutonium so it is of sufficient density to start an explosive chain reaction

there you now know how to create a fission bomb  i havent told you anything classified or indeed anything not routinely taught in undergradlevel physics classes or detailed in books and articles about the manhattan project  of course you cant actually build anything based on a few paragraphs because theres a lot of complicated math to actually build something that will explode when you want it to and not turn your bomb factory into a pile of glowing slag

the thing is explaining basic principles is simple enough but it triggers a lot of other questions with a general audience whats plutonium  whats uranium  why is a chain reaction important  what exactly is reacting here  and really in the end the science isnt really that important to the story its a biopic not the history of atomic energy which would have encompassed a lot more people and many more decades than would fit in a 3hour movie

if youd like to know more i can highly recommend the book the making of the atomic bomb by richard rhodes its my single favorite nonfiction book",2023-07-24 20:26:23
yeah the trailer was very misleading then also in filmmaking there is a a common saying what is the most interesting moment of a characters life and why arent you showing the audience that strauss was not the most interesting element of his story it should have been relegated to a side element,2023-07-24 20:21:26
more explosions no to do the films single explosion – one that was built up over the source of 2 hours – justice that would have been nice,2023-07-24 20:53:25
if you have a story about a man with two conflicts one about a personal quarrel and one that literally changed the world forever why would you focus on the less important conflict,2023-07-24 21:50:34
the film isn’t primarily about the atomic bomb it’s about oppenheimer i think that’s what people are forgetting strauss was the man who used oppenheimer’s guilt to destroy his reputation while simultaneously destroying his own it’s a symbolic mutually assured destruction scenario his part in the movie is to play apart of the eternal torment granted to the american prometheus,2023-07-23 06:16:57
"the book the film is based on has three parts how oppenheimer became oppenheimer the brilliant scientist oppenheimer and the manhattan project and strauss confirmation hearing

strauss v oppenheimer mirrors oppenheimers worst fear of everincreasing escalation of might and the strauss confirmation hearings were a big moment for the cultural understanding of oppenheimer given some distance from the war",2023-07-23 06:16:22
myopic take it helped explore the political destruction and fallout globally that followed the creation of the bomb which really is a key point of the movie,2023-07-23 06:20:24
i do agree with all this but to be honest everything post the trinity test was so much more engaging to me lol,2023-07-23 06:14:37
it was unexpected to me that id be leaving the cinema with another dude strauss being the villain in a movie about a guy who was the father of the atomic bomb it was definitely an interesting way to explore what happened to oppenheimer post wwii anyway,2023-07-23 08:00:35
the movie is not about the invention of the atomic bomb the movie is about oppenheimer strauss ruined his career,2023-07-23 12:33:12
doubtful as you get a digital feed from the cameras too the out of focus shots were strange there was no obvious artistic merit to justify it they were using a very narrow depth of field and i guess the sheer amount of shots meant a few clangers slipped through,2023-07-26 05:19:47
they do many takes and the focus pullers can never be 100 accurate on all of them especially with actors moving back and forth between a perfectly focused take and a perfectly executed acting performance editors would usually go with the latter,2023-07-26 06:04:40
shallow depth of field is a trend but filmmakers do not want fully soft shots,2023-07-26 11:07:44
did these interviews say the japanese would surrender without the bombs or would it still require at least an invasion on the mainland i always thought it was like they were strategically beaten but wouldn’t give up until it got much worse,2023-07-29 15:33:34
"also bc every person who died invadingblockading japan could be saved and thats 20k or more letters that wont have to be sent to grieving parents  

also if they waited a few more weeks russia was obliged to enter the pacific theater to help us and they would have lost even more people in the effort",2023-07-29 18:50:24
"you do realize the diehards launched an actual coup attempt to stop the surrender there were soldiers running around the japanese imperial palace trying to find the surrender recording so they could destroy it


the japanese were not going to surrender it was atomic bombs a genocidal starvation or an invasion with tens of millions dead

and the russians declaring war was more the japanese loosing the last chance of a mediator than an actual military threat",2023-07-30 03:12:37
exactly agree 100 i hate studios as much as the next movie fan but nolan having final cut left too much unnecessary filler the last hour,2023-07-21 20:41:09
as did i the whole vilification of oppenheimer was exhausting by design and it was brilliant to see the entire complexity of the ramifications of trinity,2023-07-22 04:50:33
thats too bad though isnt it,2023-07-21 20:31:10
unfortunately so there was a scene towards the end with some incredible dialogue that just got drowned out by the score really annoyed me,2023-07-22 13:36:58
sadly yes i thought he was gonna tone it down because the movie is dialogue heavy but nah,2023-07-22 13:27:10
i can usually get past nolans poor sound mixing since his other recent movies were more actionset piece heavy but this was a character drama with tons of important dialogue and i couldnt hear about 20 of it so the nonlinear plot was a struggle to follow it definitely dampened my enjoyment of the film a bit,2023-07-22 16:27:59
a bit in a few places yes,2023-07-22 13:29:53
youve just summed up how i feel perfectly the third act just felt meh it couldve easily been 2 hours,2023-07-22 17:52:14
the third act brought the film down from a 910 to a 610 for me frankly it was that bad,2023-07-22 20:17:16
 yall are so sad lol,2023-07-22 18:04:22
that isnt what they said though,2023-07-22 18:22:39
i wasn’t bored due to the lack of explosions i think nolan did something very ambitious here and took a page out of oliver stone’s jfk i just wasn’t enthralled like i was hoping i would be,2023-07-22 18:16:38
you dont have to be demeaning with the claim that people just wanted kabooms cmon the 3rd act was painfully monotonous and not set up enough to make us care about strauss at all it could have been cut down to a half hour at least but it wasnt sadly it definitely brought the film down for many,2023-07-22 20:14:43
dont they show his face briefly when hes mentioned at one point to avoid specifically this problem when he appears again later,2023-07-22 22:09:42
i think casey stood out too much and drake and josh it looks like his eyes are melting,2023-07-23 00:06:13
oh i truly liked the film i just wish hollywood would stop sprinkling in random famous people to play historical background figures and have us not get taken out of it,2023-07-22 22:02:54
that was the weirdest cameo ever,2023-07-22 22:39:01
oh yeah truman was a giant dickbag at this particular point in history especially,2023-07-23 23:18:51
really really good extremely funny and a great message thoroughly enjoyed it,2023-07-23 22:27:06
for me it was disappointing  i dont think it lived up to the fun of the trailer at all i am obviously in the minority on this  ryan gosling as ken was incredible though  and his big musical number is one of the funniest most entertaining things ive ever seen in a movie,2023-07-23 22:36:15
i loved it the humour isn’t really for kids so i think there will be some confused parents but i thought it was really fun and actually so moving as well,2023-07-23 23:31:17
the beginning of the cockroach civilization,2023-09-22 07:09:38
"do you think it helped highlight his integrity the guy took an absolute beating for 15 hr your calc it helped a dimwit like me see him struggle with the political world vs the academic which really felt like a valuable story it felt like a reminder to everyone when there may have been a certain level of integrity in us politics a stretch yes but it felt nice seeing a slimy politician go down in flames 

completely agree with the powerful gym scene i really felt submerged in the emotions of that room while watching

i respect your opinion im honestly just asking questions looking for more feedback",2023-11-28 06:41:54
it was almost like social network in structure,2023-07-25 04:33:18
titanic was a real event and that last hour of it sinking was spectacular and very realistic and true to what happened i still feel that nolan left a lot of the table with the trinity scene i expected to be floored,2023-07-25 01:40:27
"i think that scene youre talking about is easily the best scene in the movie on a filmmaking level but for me just didnt do enough to really make me feel the true horror of this monstrous invention the girls face with the little flappy skin made me laugh actually it was very cheap looking like they glued some paper on her face and blew on it with a fan

i just feel like a movie like this shouldnt be subtle it should make us really reckon with what weve unleashed on the world",2023-07-25 01:23:14
i am not signing in for a bam bam explosion bs i was well aware this is more of a philosophy  bio life kind of a movie if anything i am disappointed they dont show more on how oppie react to the casualty of japan and show more disturbing thing to illustrate the impact of that change his mind of hbom,2023-11-14 18:28:14
" it felt like a big gasoline explosion like they used to do in movies

probably because thats what it was",2023-11-22 10:43:11
but i think on this one he should have gone for it i think it would have paid off i mean he used plenty on other movies i didnt let that bother me but i was a bit let down,2023-12-25 17:24:30
its based on his life though,2023-07-21 14:58:01
kek,2023-07-24 14:06:51
you’re right and you should say it it was very cringey,2023-07-21 14:27:47
i mean its what happened,2023-07-21 13:25:43
"for casual moviegoers who arent expecting a dialogue heavy film i thought the twist was very well done and necessary even though i didnt see it coming unfamiliar with the manhattan project history

at some point even a biopic has to be entertaining enough for the audience regurgitating wikipedia pages on screen doesnt make for good entertainment",2023-07-22 19:07:20
thanks i updated it,2023-07-22 22:08:19
it is a biography made in the political drama genre tho so youre not wrong in guessing,2023-07-21 05:08:43
i would’ve been disappointed if it wasn’t a slow burn that’s exactly what a movie like this is supposed to be,2023-07-21 09:14:57
"i mean granted at the time feynman himself said he was doing grunt work for other scientists and for a movie about oppenheimer they generously also showed his classic bongo drumming and also him not using eye protection and instead looking through a glass car window

fermi and his work during the time was mentioned and shown a few times

the big wig of the era was the likes of bohr 

at the end of the day the movie isnt “the manhattan project” or “scientists who changed the 20th century” rather a character study of oppenheimer including the people be interacted with or managed during the manhattan project however all revolving around oppenheimer the biography its based off is similar  its a biography of the man his controversies his views and regrets not of the atomic age there’s other books for that",2023-07-29 04:29:57
well the movies about oppenheimer feynman could have a show all to himself and in fact did produce a lot of interesting shows he hosted,2023-07-29 07:26:23
they shouldnt have shown that i almost cried during the testing showing a literal tragedy on screen wouldve been disrespectful,2023-07-22 02:59:27
"critiquing the lack of clarity as to why oppie decides to suddenly tie his life to this woman and she to him and the lack of onscreen justification for him being labeled a womanizer are direct critiques of the screenwriting that are perfectly reasonable specifically because this is based on a true story not the other way around

critiquing the explosion after the amount of build up around it from the marketing and the movie itself is a perfectly reasonable critique and hurr durr sorry he couldnt blow up an actual nuclear bomb is a ludicrous strawman that couldnt even be called a counterargument as a joke

your negatives concern me friendo you need to retune your critique brain a bit

your personal attacks are completely illogical nonsense at best and childish and masturbatory at worst tldr get over yourself christ what an embarassing comment",2023-07-22 03:30:41
probably for it to look somewhat like it did in real life instead of just a collection of zoomed in explosions which looked like some oil barrels exploding,2023-07-22 13:54:49
idk maybe it should have looked like the actual mushroom cloud id say its an important detail,2023-07-22 13:58:49
they spent the entire movie talking about how powerful the bomb was then they showed bright flash a close up of some fire wholly underwhelming and didn’t come close to depicting how utterly terrifying these weapons are,2023-07-22 15:52:37
"with cgi he could’ve replicated the look of the actual trinity explosion

that’s not the point

his guilt over building the most lethal weapon in all of mankind was the point and it would’ve been more compellingdramatic had the explosion shown that",2023-07-22 13:53:36
ah good to know never saw that one in the cinema,2023-07-23 12:01:27
yeah i guess so but made it seem like she was going to jail for  lol,2023-07-23 19:53:40
or maybe asks a little more from its audience felt pretty clear what the stakes were  movie spends a lot of time with the atomic energy commission and talks about colleagues  family whose reputations were ruined by similar red scare overreaches strauss also explicitly spells out what the consequences of the review would be,2023-07-23 21:18:07
"losing your house your job and livelihood is pretty big stakes and kitty said that explicitly 

then there’s the subtext which no amount of exposition would have solved a greater narrative on science the government and his fall",2023-07-24 03:17:26
they were pretty clear that it threatened their livelihood and reputation,2023-07-23 21:39:08
cant believe the ending of this move was about if a man would lose his work id,2023-07-23 21:57:12
"because the project was of national importance you need clearance to get in

pay more attention to the movie",2023-07-23 21:54:47
i think the issue with the focus on the security clearance was it never really focused on why it was so important the film literally jumped from trinity to the tail end of the questioning we never got much scenes if at all in between the 2 events of what oppie would use his clearance for and the little we got it was sprinkled in between with nonlinear story telling and with how fast paced the film is its easy to miss a ton of info like that,2023-07-24 18:31:47
the movie having little room to breath is apart of the point though oppenheimer could never stop and come to terms with things he was hopping from one thing to the next,2023-07-24 01:43:18
i came into the movie knowing a lot though not all of the story and i hated having to explain missing elements of the story to my friends especially when it was parts of the story that i didnt know it really highlighted the flaws of the movie to me,2023-07-24 01:37:45
i hadnt read american prometheus but had read the making of the atomic bomb and was also hoping for more science than political drama still i really appreciated the film in every way while i would love to see a highend miniseries like hbo did with chernobyl that focused more on the science and development of the bomb,2023-07-24 02:10:41
"absolutely and perfectly said the movie left me with more questions than understanding

 im now suffering through watching 1989  man and little boy this is helping somewhat but not really lol",2023-07-24 02:41:42
"the man clearly loves his own written word its so wild that he will actively fight against it being clear

is he doing the mixing they need to hire someone betterthe biggest problem with auteurs is when they dont have someone telling them something is bad",2023-07-25 05:17:33
imax is a sound standard as well by the way,2023-07-26 15:20:39
" not sure why they decided to market so heavily for imax viewing

because they shot the movie on imax film meaning seeing it projected in imax 70mm or film gives you the highest picture clarity",2023-07-26 20:24:37
was oppenheimer there,2023-07-27 17:48:19
op is gonna get taken into a room and asked how long hes know his brother for,2023-07-29 23:37:34
"in theory communism is great if such a utopia can exist it would be the ideal form of economics but the reality is that people can be greedy evil and distrusting and any time impurities like that exists the type of system like communism as proposed by karl marx simply can’t exist

it’s not a difficult concept to understand",2023-07-30 01:10:16
"a big part of the point of oppenheimer is theory vs practice

defenders of communism love to cite communist theory like marx but they ignore communist practice like stalin",2023-07-30 13:46:22
"i’d recommend talking to people who have actually lived under it and you’ll get plenty of answers

but basically government taking your property making everyone poor destroying its economy banning freedom of speech and movement and perpetuating a sycophantic ruling party are things that most welladjusted people think are bad",2023-07-30 04:01:56
literally the first part of what you wrote are complaints about capitalism it’s not the systems that are bad it’s animal instinct to hoard,2023-07-30 04:56:22
the scenes were probably edited there were multiple  scenes with florence pugh the actress who played as jean,2023-08-11 16:22:55
i wish we had gotten more depth into jean tatlock instead of just her  she seemed like a badass woman that struggled with her sexuality in a time that frowned upon everything she was,2023-08-09 06:27:34
i think at least cillian murphys nudity was warranted in the board interrogation scene that was a nice i guess visual metaphor they probably needed the  to really hammer it home more where they cut to  chatting on armchairs was a little less necessary in my opinion,2023-08-12 21:30:54
"did they really  not the bed scene but the hallucination part in the office

in front of multiple people",2023-08-09 23:41:54
after thinking about it that isn’t a reach at all and infact probably what nolan was aiming for oppenheimer was desperately trying to be involved and find out information about the actual bombing when it took place was it effective what did it do and he was shrugged off once the army used him he was no longer needed by them and dumped to the sidelines and since the movie is from oppenheimers point of view thats a great point you make,2023-08-14 18:28:28
"agreed going forward to me this is what the movies need to become

amazing cinematic experiences with both amazing stories cinematography and visual spectacles",2023-08-17 15:43:34
volume levels were good at my theater sf metreon  i always carry a pair of concert ear plugs to theaters that reduce volume without impacting the sound just in case  didnt need them,2023-08-15 18:50:45
tenet was genuinely bad in terms of sound design but oppenheimer was perfectly fine watched it regular nonimax probably your theatre had a sound balance issue,2023-08-19 09:50:50
agreed if you’re a movie buff then yes go for imax but for the average movie goer a regular screen would do,2023-08-17 23:07:34
yeah im with you there was no reason for this to be shot in imax this is christopher nolans style eating itself if imax had refused to make their film platters larger to accomodate a 3 hour movie we all could have saved some time,2023-08-20 13:04:15
absolutely agreed didnt see this in a true imax screen but the imax screen i saw it on didnt seem to add much to the overall experience beyond the sound turned up to 11,2023-08-17 02:02:20
"i knew the film was about oppenheimer but the film let me know how uninteresting his story was compared to the actual bomb and us itself

that’s what i didn’t like the story typically a film like this would make me do more research like the social network had me looking deeper into what happened this film made me somehow care even less about oppenheimer",2023-11-24 09:43:22
im not going to lie we do for all that we have been through they were the nazis of asia however i did want to say that as a human with basic decency i am not ignoring the tragedy of civilian deaths at hiroshima and nagasaki as the internet is so fond of pointing out whenever this conversation is brought up two wrongs dont make a right im not condoning the killing of civilians however i just wanted to say that japan is not a total victim of ww2 and wanted to see an americans perspective,2023-07-24 21:38:32
if the news are fake imagine history we dont know a single thing about what was going around in hitlers mind and also what is interesting is the nazis surrendered before they completed working on the bomb so id say nazis were an excuse for the us to do what they always wanted to to become the powerfull those japanese lives were not responsible for our ancestors wellbeing also a big question since they killed the japanese did the war end no we know who is still attacking innocent lives theres no justification for what us has done,2023-07-24 21:17:23

it was a reprieve  so quiet,2023-08-14 02:30:53
it helped that many of them were recognizable actors,2023-08-13 23:01:34
he did take the job offer though i thought at the end when he went to tell kitty how the clearance hearing went that they were living in that “great commute” house,2024-03-03 02:15:34
"cant really watch nolans movie while having attention span of average tiktok enjoyer

i mean its perfect for the tiktok audience the whole editing of the film feels unpatient always moving always screaming for attention",2023-07-31 12:49:18
“if you don’t have the same feelings as me about this movie you must be dumb”,2023-08-01 03:26:19
the opposite is true  the movie is very jumpy and things happened extremely fast,2023-07-31 16:20:30
or more simply people are dismissing criticism because they dont believe it is an average movie,2023-07-21 16:08:32
it’s not average though was impeccably directed and written,2023-07-21 15:23:20
"frankly i kind of agree  i have a stem degree and had read some about the manhattan project so i was able to follow along well enough  but i could sense while watching it that it would likely confuse many people who werent already somewhat familiar with the story

and i dont think its impossible to tell this story in a way that includes more people so this movie smacks a little of elitism  but also weirdly sophomoric  many of the anecdotes nolan throws in are stories every stem undergrad hears a million times

basically i wouldnt give this movie an unqualified recommendation to general audiences  id recommend it to the sorts of people who like veratisium videos  its more up their alley",2023-07-21 16:42:04
thanks for proving my point,2023-07-21 15:43:05
yikes kinda like walking into a wall that has a sign that reads caution wall,2023-07-21 15:54:17
this comment was written for you,2023-07-21 16:07:38
right nolan doesn’t make particularly smart films and being able to follow them doesn’t make someone smart by a long shot those who have trouble following them must have a goldfish level attention span,2023-07-22 01:22:06
 we have actual real life footage of the trinity explosion he could have used that and i would have been perfectly happy,2023-07-23 23:44:26
agreed agreed part of the visual horror of nukes is the combination of scale and otherworldliness of the explosion the uncanny valley nature of a sphere of exotic stuff expanding outwards to form a spectacle nobody had ever seen before the trinity test wasnt just a much bigger bomb than unleashed before this aspect did get kind of lost in the excitement,2023-07-23 23:09:47
the scientists themselves described a lot more range of wild colors from the radiation,2023-07-24 02:02:51
i just think it would have really driven home the idea of what on earth have we unleashed on this world if it captured some more of the scale and otherwordlyness of a nuclear test even if theyd just used the recently remastered stock footage it would have been incredible,2023-07-24 11:02:31
"the first bomb was dropped on august 6 1945 the second was dropped on august 9 and the japanese didnt surrender until august 15 i read that the american government expected japan to surrender right after the first bomb but when they didnt they decided to deploy the second and threatened the japanese with more bombs to come if they didnt drop the bombs the americans expected that the war would continue into the spring of the following year and they would lose more than a million troops

this does not justify either bomb just explaining why 2 bombs were dropped",2023-08-08 01:51:32
the explanation they offer is so weird too they say the 2nd one is important to prove the us can keep dropping these bombs forever if need be but like why wouldnt japan assume thats the case anyway if it truly was the only bomb the allies had the target would most likely be tokyo or something like that by destroying hiroshima isnt that enough evidence that they feel comfortable enough with the arsenal,2023-08-08 01:43:28
"it seems so obvious 

i dont think the second bomb was necessary either",2023-08-08 00:40:02
"ww2 is so strange  

britishfrench declared war on germany because they attacked an ally in poland  

soviet union also attacked poland at the same time but britishfrench ultimately ignored that little fact

if we hated the soviets so much whyd we help them so much  why not just let the sovietsgermans exhaust each other even more",2023-08-08 20:34:18
yeah that was the whole maybe the conversation wasnt about you part,2023-08-12 15:55:09
yeah this is one of those things where his representation could have been done to emphasize the anxiety oppenheimer felt but could have also been a half way honest example of truman as someone who knows nothing about him im not sure which,2023-08-26 01:11:22
" my understanding was that the reason hiroshima and nagasaki were chosen as opposed to tokyo and kyoto were not because they were dear to the president but because theyd already been firebombed nearly to oblivion by conventional us bombing runs and they were no longer impactful targets

pretty much none of this is accurate theres a wikipedia page that goes into more detail both of them had legitimate targets for war visibility etc they had no intention of dropping a nuke on the emperor which proved prescient as it was necessary for him to quit rping a member of the house of windsor long enough to push the war council from voting to continue the war after the 2nd bombing",2023-07-23 13:58:33
they’re wrong and also dumb,2023-07-23 19:19:30
literally the only moment that really makes the imax shine is the bomb test other than that  lets just say nolan dropped a nuke on the film budget to film 70mm imax to capture a bunch of 1 and 2 shot dialog scenes in tiny rooms,2023-07-25 02:52:49
hmm thx my mom is in her early 70s so i could see her complaining about it being too loud 3 hours is a long time too shes a james bond fan and i saw the last couple daniel craigbond films in the same imax theater with her but i cant remember if she complained about the sound being too loud but nolans films seem to be much louder with the vfx in general,2023-07-25 02:29:14
helpful to know my mom is in her early 70s shes more enthusiastic about seeing it than i am because her deceased sisterwho was ukrainian worked as an interpreter to the russians in the nuclear lab in new mexico not during oppenheimers time though many decades later so because of that sentimental connection my mom thinks seeing it in imax would be the best experience,2023-07-25 02:38:35
oh so there was a ii fusion that i didnt see right,2023-07-27 00:22:09
i think the biggest problem people have with the movie is that they thought it was going to be a bomb movie while it really was a biopic it was about oppenheimer the person and not his catastrophic creation,2023-08-08 12:31:14
i guess i disagree they couldve cut a lot of scenes in favor of lengthening other ones for example keeping both the oppenheimer hands his baby away and oppenheimer courts kitty in new mexico sequences cheapened both 3 hours is enough to do plenty without rushing the way they did,2023-07-24 03:33:19
he was also a true homie to oppenhiemer through to the end what a g,2023-07-29 04:37:05
they were neighbours though,2023-12-24 19:29:53
it has so many superhero movie tropes lol origin story assembling the team jfk name drop acting as a teaser for a sequel,2023-07-22 23:43:04
"thats the conundrum isnt it history isnt that simple so you either make it accurate and turn people off due to its complexity or make it simple and risk inaccuracies

both options arent wrong they just have very different goals and expectations unfortunately for those who found oppenheimer boring they expected another hbos chernobyl but got pretty much an almost 11 documentary",2023-07-24 04:24:38
"chernobyl doesnt have very many inaccuracies at all that arent explicitly mentioned in the text of the show the biggest one that was made was the removal of legasovs family but that was the only one that would have any sort of important impact on how you view the story

as far as the explanation of the events that led to the disaster once we get to the courtroom in episode five the only way you get a more thorough explanation on why the reactor blew up would be to take a college course on the function of rbmktype soviet reactors",2023-07-24 04:28:18
you’re really going to you say you have little patience… for people with no patience… a little hypocritical wouldn’t you say ,2023-07-24 04:26:26
"modern education makes little to no attempts to teach people these things and essentially the only reason most people went to see the movie in the first place is because it was trending on the internet but its not the movies responsibility to make sure the viewers understand what theyre looking at 

mix these two and what you get is people thinking the movie is boring when its far from it or simply not understanding anything",2023-07-24 03:56:40
same here no one other than the two random hindi guys in my central european theater spoke,2023-07-30 21:53:40
i was also in a very full cinema and i was positively surprised at how silent the guests were,2023-07-30 18:06:54
yes being bored can be tough,2023-08-20 17:21:16
i knew what was going on but it was trying to make it too intense bouncing back and forth and it became tedious,2023-08-20 17:27:09
dune did such a great job with explosions that i cant help but feel nolan wouldve had access to the same technology,2023-07-23 02:49:54
"david lynch has him beat with a cable tv budget on this one

the scientists all described much wider range of colors and much more linger light and effects than nolan portrayed",2023-07-23 03:28:30
"trinity was quite small in fairness the footage of the test looks atomic but without the scale of other tests recorded like castle bravo which is distinctly more massive  

i’ll need to rewatch it but i felt it was more about the emotion than the pure spectacle",2023-07-23 02:52:26
i saw some footage of the real trinity test and it was close though im not sure if thats due to crappy filming back then,2023-07-23 03:10:25
there’s something to be said about a film full of practical effects refusing to use cgi to enhance its biggest spectacle though gotta sorta respect nolan for sticking to his guns imo,2023-07-23 02:01:47
"couldnt disagree more

in the words of truman

do you think the japanese in hiroshima give a  about the man who made the bomb

oppenheimer is a biopic about him he did not see the bodies and the bulk of his life was contained in the us the movie was not about the morality of the bomb it was about oppenheimers life his rise and near fall due to his  complex",2023-07-31 03:08:42
this is very likely due to the cinema rather than the film a good rule of thumb is that imax theatres with 70mm or failing that laser projection will offer the clearest picture dolby cinemas will have the sharpest sound i saw it in imax and could hear 95 of the dialogue clearly so admittedly not perfect,2023-07-22 13:32:42
i thought the scene happened before the trinity bomb that’s why i’m confused if i remember correctly strauss even says “they beat us to it”,2023-07-24 23:58:28
"before the bombing he justified it with that he was morally obligated to make the bomb to make sure nazis are kept in check once they got out of the way he became bit uncertain acknowledged scientist opposition for it to be used on japan but still didnt oppose it himself and then came the consequences of his actions where he felt the burden of bombing actually happening

he didnt want ethical stain but thought he was doing the right thing only to end up with ethical stain at the end nonetheless his opinion is asked again and again by scientists friends and his wife about what he feels but he keeps avoiding stating it for the right thing

thats a good point about his humiliation it definitely worked in the way he wanted kind of but the movie and im assuming the book made sure to show him as a flawed man and criticise him for it the main one coming from his wife about how he shouldnt commit sins then hope to be pitied and forgiven which works for the on multiple levels for oppenheimer",2023-08-06 15:07:50
"5 million pounds of tnt seem like an awful lot

not even the beirut harbor explosion was that large",2023-07-22 01:00:26
twin peaks the return had a very good one  i read they spent a lot of money on it,2023-07-22 00:07:17
for me it was the  scene with the scripture quote it felt like a combination of an entirely generic  scene and we need to explain this original quote thatll be played during one of the most important scenes of the movie,2023-07-22 07:12:50
thats interesting what did she like about it what was missing for you,2023-07-22 09:05:57
thats my point though  the movie is not about the atomic bomb or the manhatten project or the trinity test its about the life of robert oppenheimer and the revoking of his security clearance is  besides the development of the actual bomb  the most controversial and among the most important aspects of his life,2023-07-23 12:32:24
its really not about that i simply truly believe that if you dont care about the story thats going on you wont enjoy the movie its a well made movie but its biggest advantage is that its a true if i hadnt had that in the back of my mind the entire film i dont think itd be as harrowing as it is,2023-07-22 07:34:15
that’s probably more of an older gentleman thing in general though,2023-08-13 01:40:13
i agree this why we experience it through trumans speech on the radio just like oppenheimer its almost an entirely subjective pov throughout,2023-08-28 04:11:31
"repeatedly explain it undermines him as being noncredible 

yeah the guy weve been following for half the movie as the leader of the manhatten project and who people in america recognise as the inventor of the atomic bomb  which ended ww2  is somehow undermined and not credible anymore 

hes credible enough to have a movie made about him by christopher  nolan 

they could have been more clear the consequences of him losing his security clearance it would then justify him losing it but all we see is a celebrated old man and an ominous ending about nukes",2023-10-17 23:44:22
robert downey jr is almost the exact age that strauss was at the time why would they cast someone older,2024-01-12 02:34:24
the payoff did feel good in the end classic ambiguous nolan,2023-07-22 21:54:14
i can see that the payoff did feel good i just think it might have felt even better if i understood the motivations from the start there was so much clicking at the same time it was hard to remember all of the subtleties that occurred throughout the film i imagine this film will age like fine wine with repeated viewings,2023-07-22 21:55:56
i don’t want to sound dumb but i agree it was hard to follow and because of that hard to completely engage with for different reasons than tenet,2023-07-23 02:31:00
that was me during interstellar until i watched it a few times,2023-07-23 02:10:54
given how much the film emphasizes the chevalier incident i think it shouldve reminded us of what they meant with a flashback to that conversation which on its own really does seem like a nonevent,2023-07-23 02:28:10
yea i got pretty switched up when they confronted him about the person who tried getting classified information to the russians mainly because that character had like one 15 second dialogue and his personal relations with communist party sympathizers at los alamos were constantly brought up but i struggled to distinctly remember who those characters were from earlier on in the film due to the volume and the characters the pace and the relatively minor role they served in scenes,2023-07-23 02:19:30
"i agree with all of those and even though i think tenet is probably one of if not his worst films if i were scrolling through tv and that was playing id choose to watch it over oppenheimer too all things considered

i liked oppenheimer and can enjoy it for what it was but longterm value i see no enjoyment in it",2023-07-23 23:22:10
i really dont care if people share my opinion or not i just think its utterly bizarre how the comments dont even reflect the poll,2023-07-22 21:50:53
a little bit yeah i like when people enjoy great movies,2023-07-22 21:49:03
yeah did they mention he was feynman at any point i was waiting for him to show up lol,2023-07-27 11:50:29
i liked his pick up line about people being mostly empty space held together by the forces of attraction,2023-07-27 17:39:14
doesnt the second half of the book specifically cover his work on the manhattan project,2023-07-27 13:43:42
"“after excelling in mathematics as a student at far rockaway high school feynman earned his bachelor’s degree in 1939 from the massachusetts institute of technology and his phd from princeton university three years later while at princeton feynman was recruited for the theoretical division of the manhattan project the secret us army laboratory set up in los alamos nm for the purpose of developing the atomic bomb

feynman was present at the first detonation of an atomic bomb the achievement excited him at first but he ultimately expressed concerns about the implications of the technology feynman later developed safer methods for storing radioactive waste an innovation responsible for saving the lives of many power plant workers”

he was still in his twenties when he was at los alamos",2023-07-27 13:09:02
humblebrag,2023-07-27 17:38:25
"what would have been the most crucial moments like the japan bombings hitlers invasion and the german surrender are mentioned in passing

except oppenheimer had very little to do with the first one and nothing to do with the other two

as soon as the trinity test was successful they show the army boxing up the other bombs his only involvement was giving his input on the japanese target

the movie was about oppenheimer not about the german invasion once germany surrendered the next use case for the bomb would be japan

makes it feel really rushed at the end

a third of the movie was post trinity test the test was at about the two hour mark of a three hour movie",2023-11-20 01:31:12
"everything is random for  reddit posters the man who literally pushed america to create h bomb and there by began the most dangerous arms race russia made their own h bomb 10 effing months later is a random politician 

dr david hill who was part of the dr enrico fermi team credited with the first artificial nuclear reactor is again a random scientist 

and we should start punishing people for having communist connections now 

also do you blame the knife manufacturer for the murders that happen with it why are you insinuating that those deaths were on dr oppenheimer everyone is random and criminal because a random  reddit poster says so shove your review where the sun doesnt shine you wouldnt be enlisted as the water boy in such projects ungrateful schmuck",2023-11-23 10:05:30
"i think youre the kind of nolan fan that everyone despises the heh im so much smarter than you kid attitude is awful

and i say this as somebody who enjoyed the movie",2023-11-28 09:50:30
the movie was not just about the bomb if that is what you were mainly looking to see,2023-07-21 20:58:10
you thought the biopic about the development of the nuclear bombs main theme would be “beauty”…,2023-07-26 12:09:38
just saw the movie in imax 70mm it was no different from other nolans movies  80 of the movie on regular film and a few money shots in the imax format,2023-08-12 00:04:42
id actually advise against watching it on a large screen i went to imax to see it and man all those zoomed in faces looked distorted as  and they have those face like every 90 seconds this movie is a perfect watch on a tv honestly,2023-08-11 18:26:13
my screening was 70mm not imax imax 70mm is the ultimate experience option for this film,2023-07-22 07:52:56
they clearly mean film vs digital,2023-07-22 08:12:31
right  but strauss still had interactions with oppie throughout the manhattan project the last scene implies the first meeting between oppie and strauss — yet oppies interaction with einstein suggests they’ve interacted during the manhattan project — a time where strauss knew oppie …,2023-07-22 18:48:58
ya that’s exactly my point — oppie met einstein before when he showed him the calculations during trinity but why was this meeting at the pond the same scene where he met strauss for the appointment,2023-07-22 18:36:10
and not a complete waste as by 1962 so a bit over a decade later hed be working for new mexico tech and would become the chair of the physics department  he lived to the age of 81 2002,2023-07-28 06:33:42

"allegedly he more or less actually said all that too

they really thought america would have monopoly on the bomb",2023-07-24 01:21:32
some of that is  straight from trumans journals,2023-07-24 01:59:05

ive got bad news about the capabilities of modern surveillance technology",2023-07-23 23:58:15
"i said it in another comment but it probably makes more sense here the red scare is looked back on as ridiculous nowadays because the modern world doesnt see communists as a threat anymore and for good reason the ideology has failed miserably and our 2023 lenses show that its not a threat because any nation that deploys it will just become a meme

in the earlymid 20th century though different story people had no idea what those nations were capable of",2023-07-24 02:03:45
lol i got up after the testingcheering part and the moment kitty showed up and came back just in time for the nagasaki and hiroshima bombing speech,2023-07-22 03:58:04
that would just  me off lol,2023-07-22 04:17:38
seriously they made the movie insanely longer than it needed to be,2023-07-22 04:00:43
seriously,2023-07-22 03:54:56
my biggest gripe with this film,2023-07-22 04:48:08
i think the real story was the first time oppenheimer heard it he dismissed it and then his student did the experiment the next day,2023-07-26 05:14:20
i did i find tarantinos dialogue more captivating and organic than nolans i suppose  ,2023-07-22 05:51:56
"i love sports movies raunchy comedys and saw just about every superhero movie in theaters before i burnt out in 2020 

i love most christopher nolan movies too memento prestige inception the dark knight trilogy all brilliant

 i even said oppenheimer super well made in my review this just wasnt for me",2023-07-22 05:55:07
nobody realizes were in a new era of movies except alivead4164 everybody  wake up and listen to what hes telling us,2023-07-23 01:26:22
i really thought the film peaked at the bomb test i thought that was genius filmmaking from a visual audio and performance standpoint,2023-07-23 05:40:07
felt very flat the trinity explosion was extremely underwhelming and with all the imax promo just did not feel worth it i did absolutely love gary oldman as truman and rdj stole the show but even then strauss and his beef with oppenheimer was something i didn’t understand the origins of overall i was sat there watching and just not feeling anything in school we studied wwii and the cold war for years even that felt higher stakes this just felt so scaled down,2023-07-22 08:50:15
around 13 of the movie,2023-07-22 10:31:01
glad you liked barbie,2023-07-22 10:40:08
they also make it pretty clear that hes going to lose his clearance no matter what which makes the hours worth of scenes in the conference room rather arbitrary,2023-07-23 04:06:40
"well stated being a man of science myself i would have loved more heres how we made the bomb that wasnt just two guys in lab coats playing spherical perfection

like yourself i am still wondering what the end game of clearance issue was i mean he ended up getting the medal of freedom later so like you said why should i care",2023-07-23 04:02:27
fully agreed the movie definitely sags in the third act but finished strong could have spent a lot more time at los alamos and give some more sciencey scenes i would personally have liked a scene or two with the scientists discussing dday or watching news reel footage of berlin falling there also wasn’t as much new mexico beauty— if you’ve been there the seasons and sunsets are very distinct and the film didn’t quite capture it showing native americans would have been interesting too,2023-07-24 06:48:32
yes not even a mention of little boy or  man,2023-07-23 02:53:07
same here  love so much of his previous work but i just do not get all the rave reviews and comments saying how it’s a life changing movie  i was disappointed leaving the theatre,2023-07-25 05:21:40
that strauss was the one backstabbing oppenheimer up until that point everyone in the movie is all like who could do such a thing  and then it is revealed and you have kitty being like omfg you guys are all geniuses yet so dumb its clearly strauss ive been telling you all along,2023-07-25 09:45:01
during the trinity test and during the movie the soundwave takes 140 to hit,2023-07-26 23:43:08
yeah saw it before the movie it looked way more intense in the real trinity test footage,2023-07-26 19:56:35
"yeah true it does look like a star but watching the trailer again there were two shots of it the other shows like a star impacting a ground i guess it wouldnt be realistic but  that looks so cool and what i was expecting


but like the other guy said nolan was not going for cgi so yeah i guess thats close to what he could get with practical effects


its just after seeing interstellar the visuals left my jaw dropping from it i had such high expectations of atomic bomb going off at least the sound effects was amazing


on an additional note this video shows the fireball in the milliseconds of a nuke going off kinda looks like what i was talking about
",2023-07-26 19:46:49
on the other hand here we are watching a movie about oppenheimer making the bomb not truman dropping it,2023-08-04 06:07:39
"doesnt like cgi  dude who directed interstellar

dunno sounds wrong",2023-07-21 22:52:21
as a physicist a lot of us flirt like that i had that conversation almost verbatim with my partner,2023-07-22 18:29:19
"its very in to make hard sciences seem romantic and sexy i remember bryan cranstons character in breaking bad doing the same thing with his love interest but the topic was chemistry

or in beautiful mind with russel crowe im pretty sure he woos her with math

problem is it doesnt land well math physics and chemistry might be interesting but theyre not sexy",2023-07-22 09:18:50
i thought the movie was about oppy not just the bombs those scenes were vital to show how the goverment used him as a scapegoat when the tides changed and everyone hated commies then,2023-07-27 10:20:41
i must be an idiot because it wasnt completely clear to me from the film why strauss was doing what he was doing guessing to satisfy his own ambitioncareer aspirations because oppie was an easy target for him,2023-07-27 11:02:12
i think it’ll get nominated for screenplay,2023-07-27 06:19:43
yup my assessment too i saw a review that said the movie lost steam after the bomb and i disagree the movie is about the legacy of oppenheimer inclusive of his work on the bomb as it made him but not totally,2023-07-27 15:57:13
steven spielberg,2023-07-27 05:15:41
i dont know about direct but would like to see what sorkin could do writing it,2023-07-27 06:42:34
"100 the explosion should have been bigger and we didnt even get to see the real bombings really missed the meaning of the movie and only wanted bomb  and a war movie 

i partially blame the whole barbieheimer meme",2023-07-22 22:08:24
i dont think its jarring when this scene has been heavily promoted their expectations are fair,2023-07-23 00:00:21
it dragged a lot after the abomb test it would have helped if they made that part the climax and had the hearing wrap up soon after,2023-08-06 09:12:49
for sure that is what i was referring to with subtle references they do some smaller artistic nods towards the horror of it like at the gymnasium it is just in my humble opinion insufficient it is a story which intimately wishes to chill you to the bones about the threat of nuclear holocaust show the nuclear holocaust dont shy away from it,2023-08-07 17:14:46
nope but the movie leaves oppenheimers pov plenty of times so that is no barrier,2023-08-07 23:51:29
 nothing hes done has better than the prestige,2023-12-06 17:32:30
"its obvious that it was important to him personally irl but its just a bad storyb to tell its irrelevant compared to the enormous changes the world was going through and there were so many other good stories to tell maybe give feynman more room or tell more about the war or about other things in his life but focusing on this neverending childs play was bizarre and a frustrating exercise i wish i would have walked out after the test

and whats up with those jump scares every other filmmaker would get called cheap for those",2023-08-20 18:12:00
chronological would be a realistic start making it easy to filter out the strauss scenes,2023-08-20 19:47:37
you just be so clever,2023-08-22 03:47:17
"i mean i don’t really know how to respond to that other than you’re just all around incorrect people complain about the character study cop out when they wish what they were watching was narrative driven instead of the narrative being a framework for character exploration 

succession may be the worst example you could give because that’s another piece of media that is at its core a character study yeah the business dealings and moves and drama were there and interesting but at its heart they only existed to serve the primary purpose of the show which was to explore the roys as people and as a family i promise you that if you could be a fly on the wall of the writer’s room nobody actually gave a  about the business minutia of the gojo deal they only cared about it as far as it let them explore the nature of the characters listen to literally any interview with any of the show creatorsrunners if you think i’m wrong 

same is true for oppenheimer “make no mistake this was a narrative driven movie” based on what your own expectations because it worked beautifully as a character study maybe it in your eyes failed as a narrative driven movie because that isn’t what it was intended to be and you viewed it through the lens of your own anticipation",2023-07-28 05:28:41
"seeing a lot of this in the comments but honestly how was it confusing 

it was incredibly clear what was happening and he realized as he was giving them the info hed  up but had no way out of it",2023-07-21 15:41:29
perhaps they were talking about something more important than you,2023-07-25 03:29:23
from someone who saw the movie in the uk what was it if you mind me asking,2023-07-23 02:01:44
also some future vision predictions from opph during that time  he is riding the plane and crowd cheering for him when he tenses is this director point of view or he can foresee future events,2023-07-23 12:45:10
ok thats make sense  oppi visiting truman and left muted after that time his point of view the image goes back to black and white then how to confirm bw for strauss and iam curious to know how you get this during the movie time because so fast paced and dialog heavy ,2023-07-23 12:36:21
"is he said it an interview am i right  the movie should unfold itself instead of telling in an intervw chris has a knack for his movies can grasp any one and it occurs  naturally  here that element is missing  i am minority here i like movie without lot of reserch and stuff the movies should reveal its purpose not the materials that the purpose watching films  previous all his movies justifies not for telnet but i actually like it because of  some genuine thrills

for example 12 angry man sidney lumet such a class movie dialog drive smart and sharp but also deep dialog s its serves well the movie nature explains in the  start and the viewer into   that naturally also feels like real peoples 

schindlers list  drama that uses all area of its genre each interactions feels like natural

for oppenheimer  drama section turn into thriller  fast paced no time to feel emotions one dialog to another  i know here chris uses that on  purpose he change the genre into fast pace drama instead of fast drama the events should be faster  the development and drama would be deep we can feel the emotions  even strauss ego hurt has more meaning than heimers",2023-07-23 16:00:50
i’m pretty sure it’s the different perspectives black and white being strauss and color being oppenheimer i noticed that during the movie too and was trying to think of the reasoning,2023-07-23 12:22:54
i am not the only one  i think its suppose not a time line  something else its director duty to explain what he is intended  or mention any clue to connect to it  same ways oppenheimer predict some future in a dejavu way,2023-07-23 12:22:11
small correction he had just found out that his security clearance was not going to be renewed after which he told her not to take in the sheets so he knew already,2023-07-24 04:02:20
"they also reward him and shake his hand to smooth over what they did to oppenheimer in the past no hard feelings despite ruining his security clearance his job and his life

it makes them feel better",2023-07-24 19:31:07
"yeah the guy who was asked when did you become british
and answered when  told me i wasnt a german",2023-07-26 02:33:30
i give props to nolan for not wanting to use cgi but without cgi or something close to the real thing youre not gonna get close i do wish he would have relented because as much as i loved the scene the depiction of the detonation was underwhelming still a great film though,2023-07-23 03:00:17
"im not sure the purpose was to make it look amazing rather instead terrifying this film was not about americas greatness for creating the weapon rather the terror that this may lead to in regards to potential for human destruction  tbh there was a good contrast of us personele there celebrating when oppenheimer is having a bit of an existential crisis  
if anything nolan was trying to recreate the trepidation and feeling of the scientists watching a test that may have led to the destruction of the worldatmosphere not trying to show spectacle thus the choice to not show some oorah style footage of a distant explosion  
and the explosion he depicted looks akin to the pictures we have of the real test  it is not a hydrogen bomb or thermonuclear weapon",2023-07-23 03:42:11

yeah sorry man the scientists first hand descriptions of the light and the range of colors was not at all on display in this film,2023-07-23 03:14:48
" so you paid money to see 10 seconds of explosions you probably record fireworks with your phone wow such big boom

go to youtube to watch some real nuclear bombs if thats all you wanted",2023-07-23 03:51:52
i think that was the point to make it look terrifyingly awesome is to make it look awesome,2023-07-22 13:53:29
he knew the bomb was going to be dropped on civilians and helped pick the target and optimal drop distance,2024-03-22 22:11:30
"i just didnt feel anything at all during oppenheimer theres no emotional connection to any of it


there are far too many characters to really invest in any of them  theyre just scientist number 1 scientist number 2 even with florence pughs character her plight didnt really seem important",2023-07-26 22:50:22
thanks for the kind words ,2023-08-01 09:09:27
they created an intensity for every scene that 38 minute scene of him making an omelet had me on the edge of may seat,2023-07-22 23:57:53
i thought it not being built up more was the point showing how small and petty of a man he was if he was willing to ruin a mans life over such trivial things,2023-07-28 07:33:46
all the reasons you didnt like the film were reasons that i actually loved it lol i thought it was masterful how the story was told in nonlinear fashion and the 3 hour run time went by fast the music was phenomenal and added so much suspense,2023-08-17 22:30:52
i feel much the same way i found absolutely zero issues with the acting a lot of great performances throughout the whole movie but man everything else was some degree of an issue for me i didnt enjoy it overall despite it having some really fantastic moments worse than anything i ultimately ended up finding it pretty boring the constant assault of tension ended up taking away any tension for me and then the cuts between the storylines kept me from really investing in any of them i found he used a very similar filmmaking style as dunkirk but i loved its use there and it also made so much more sense to have these 3 separate timelines as they all coalesced on one moment not to mention that level of tension was more sustainable at 1h45m than 3 freaking hours,2023-08-18 02:58:42
it felt like 3 hours of 30 second scenes cut together the score was unnecessarily suspenseful the entire film there were too many threads with no depth to the majority of the characters and then they tried to force a twist ending on us plus it was boring generously giving it 410,2023-08-05 08:37:55
isnt the whole last hour about the consequences,2023-07-22 11:39:07
just because it doesnt literally show hiroshima being bombed doesnt mean it divorces it from the consequences what,2023-07-22 11:56:51
this is exactly what i was feeling throughout the last ⅓ of the movie and its not like there werent so many more things left to explore in oppies lifemind that we need to pivot to the trial scenes instead of letting us sit with oppie and his mindframe at that point we are subjected to this  i feel so disappointed by the underutilisation of this whole thing,2023-07-25 03:07:55
agreed and tho i loved the score in and of itself  as in i would love it if i played it on spotify i felt the score was ever present in this movie  wall to wall music is not a good thing,2023-07-25 02:56:10
"as far as marketing i think what you mention was sort of inevitable with this movie first like you say its kind of hard to market a biopic especially with christopher nolans name on it and all the expectations that comes with second its oppenheimer so naturally the specter of the bomb looms large you cant exactly market the film without that once thats out and its nolans made an atomic bomb movie in imax with practical effects its hard to reel those expectations back in

having said that im still just a little surprised that someone could sit through the 3 hours of this film and come away unimpressed because the visuals didnt match up with what they expected i get the other criticisms even if i dont share them didnt care about the strauss character couldnt follow what was happening because of the confusing structure didnt care much about the events post trinity test etc but the the nuke in this movie looked better needed some cg to beef it up comments are strange to me",2023-07-25 10:18:57
youre getting downvoted for sharing your opinion which i share the movie was a dreadful slog for a great portion and i would have walked out had i known thats how it would be,2023-08-03 16:47:34
that hour is literally the best and most important part of the whole movie though,2023-08-06 18:39:18
lol,2023-08-03 17:49:17
i understand the idea like i mention at the beginning my post  themes and ideas were there but poor execution imo i think if they built the chemistry and relationship out better so were more invested then the deterioration and neglect of that relationship becomes more poignant it just felt so forced to me,2023-08-21 18:49:56
 this film was so tedious and honestly i didn’t really think the story was all that good also feels like nolan is just trying too hard to make the film deep like peter griffin said about the godfather “it insists upon itself” that’s the way i feel about nolan’s oppenheimer,2023-10-17 17:00:46
or maybe i’m allowed to have an opinion this movie doesn’t even come close to interstellar or any of his other movies,2023-10-13 00:41:41
i was so confused about the point of the third act until mr robot explained it 45 minutes into it,2023-07-23 08:35:54
"and the bomb test scene was just 

id prefer if they just had a white flash and then cut to  peoples reactions

the fireball looked like a budget hollywood gasoline explosion i get that nolan only likes using practical effects but in this case you cant recreate what a nuclear bomb looks like using regular explosives",2023-07-21 11:45:48
yeah although rdj was brilliant that whole subplot could have been cut for time with the film climaxing with his speech to the scientist audience and the flash using that same effect twice  of intense moments culmination to a flashback to the explosion  felt like it diminished it not to mention its second use in the interrogation room was majorly anticlimactic,2023-07-21 23:43:24
"i really don’t think this movie is hard to understand in the slightest if you pay attention especially coming from the man that made tenet that was one of the most annoyingly convoluted movies i’ve ever seen this was super impressive

i think this is nolan’s best film full stop",2023-07-22 21:18:35
im glad i got a movie that showed me things i have never seen before and not another shot of a nuke going off that weve all seen a million times before,2023-07-22 23:04:23
mmm the movie was hyped to the moon and back and it actually delivered,2023-07-22 22:53:12
by being the best nolan film in years,2023-07-22 23:01:25
yeah i can see why people would’ve wanted a little bit more than that but in nolan’s defense it’s already been made,2023-07-25 04:50:40
what do you mean true to life i thought the scene was good on its own what else do you think could’ve been added,2023-07-25 14:40:08
"i have never seen that trailer before i can see a reasonable argument that it was misleading to people not interested in the biopic part i wouldnt be surprised if they spun it that way on purpose to get the views to be honest i wanted to watch it once i heard the title then hearing the director just made more amped

i think nolan intended the how to be implied by the mood shift once the test was over despite the rest of los alamos being excited and oppenheimer shaking hands the mood changes to the feeling that something is wrong part of it i think was to show that oppenheimer and other scientists didnt need to see the affects of the bomb to know what its capable of this is hinted at when he discusses when they discuss that every physicist already knew they were building a bomb once the message got out the the germans split the atom also oppie is shut down each time he tries to voice his concerns his rally speeches and his discussion with groves on the train already show his ideas we cant know anything else that mightve happened because his main story ends irl and in the movie when strauss successfully revokes his clearance the discussion of whether or not he is a communist literally decides his ending the biopic cares if he was a communist because its a biopic not a discussion on the cold war or ww2",2023-07-25 16:00:41
yah he’s not the best screenwriter sometimes he is memento sometimes he isn’t tenet,2023-07-25 17:22:00
"it can get overwhelming at times for sure but the veritasium video had it’s own faults too it focused much too on the science portion of the bomb by the middle and end of the video rather than discussing strauss and oppenheimer’s conflict and all the hearing details about other main scientist’s testimonies and how some people hated oppenheimer and planned alongside strauss to degrade his reputation after what he had done for the country just to satisfy their egos those portions however long and exhausting were depicted in the movie
and social network doesn’t stand a leg compared to this movie this one was a thorough character study to an extent of the knowledge available with insights on strauss’s views revealed why he ratted out oppenheimer to fbi",2023-07-25 18:03:34
you need to judge the movie you saw not the movie you wanted tothought you would see,2023-07-25 15:19:31
nolan is in many ways bay without the lensflare or the dumb humor,2023-07-21 11:31:56
true i am an indian and couldnt relate to the political conflicts at all,2023-07-21 10:32:20
i know nothing it was good,2023-07-21 20:35:42
"i must say i liked the movie but the detonation felt a bit dunno i guess i just expected more after all the hype leading up to this movie and how much they were detonating for realz hm

i also agree with that they wanted to show how badly he feels they did and obviously it makes sense but they didnt show even an arial photo of the destruction of both cities

it seemed that a viewer has to more think in memory about different videos and photos of the detonation to scratch that itch of seeing the teased detonation and probably the destruction that was pushed a bit more",2023-07-21 20:39:28
 give it up the explosion was flimsy there is no fault in pointing that out,2023-07-22 16:22:53
i mean i guess that was relevant but it didnt answer the question at all,2023-07-22 19:51:30
the black and white is objective and the color scenes are subjective they are also forced perspective oppenheimer vs strauss,2023-07-22 20:00:42
"there is literally no reason to watch this in imax lol 98 of the movie is dialogue in shot reverseshot and closeups about 3 minutes of the movie benefit from premium technologies

i actually regret watching it in dolby because the dialogue and sound effects were so loud it hurt my ears my experience would overall have been better in a regular room",2023-07-22 19:46:09
"what’s your opinion on all of rdj’s scenes are in black and white i’m still thinking on that

with the amount of people complaining in this thread that they couldnt follow the two timelines even with the color vs black  white visual shorthand id imagine that this sub would have a meltdown if it was all in color",2023-07-22 20:40:37
i think the use of black and white was to show when we were skipping through time eventually the meeting at the table became in color when we reached that point in oppenheimers main timeline that the movie was following it was helpful for me at least,2023-07-22 19:42:31
theres a reason why documentaries arent edited in nolan style,2023-07-23 09:38:21
yeah i guess thats where the disagreement comes in i by no means think its a bad movie quite the opposite just not a masterpiece because of those reasons,2023-07-23 09:29:52
the nonlinear timeline is great for setting up the oppenheimer vs strauss conflict and lets us see their respective downfalls in parallel i really enjoyed that aspect and i dont think that story would have worked quite so well if the movie had gone birth  manhattan project  death,2023-07-23 15:09:23
not to mention that in dunkirk which i love the beach is inexplicably empty because nolan didnt want to use cg to fill in the 300k soldiers who should have been there end of the day he sacrificed historical accuracy for filmmaking purity i respect his dedication to the craft but historical accuracy of that magnitude is not to be cast aside lightly,2023-07-24 09:55:27
"so did you feel the exposition and info was digestible or not necessarily the point what impact did you get while maybe not necessarily knowing the full backgroundins and outs of various characters

hard for me to separate the book from the movie so im morbidly curious on this",2023-07-24 10:32:54
i felt the same but i also felt that a 3hr film should be enough time to tell me what i need to know i shouldnt come out of the film feeling like i need to go read a book now to understand what was going on i know everyone tends to worship nolan and i say this as a fan of his but thats him not doing a good job,2023-07-24 13:25:20
yeah that audio was frustrating to say the least i basically could get by with just kinda knowing what part of the book we were at and not needing to listen too closely,2023-07-24 10:34:27
usually biopics follow a plot line like main character is rising action becoming famous climax gets famous resolution deals with fame but oppenheimer doesnt really there isnt really a resolution to his story which in real life there is usually no resolution after the bomb works he just goes on with guilt the rest of his life but life just goes on,2023-07-26 00:18:05
"ive seen other biopics usually the movie does have some sort of resolution at the end such as the main character achieves fame and fortune or some sort of ending oppenheimer does not after the bomb works his goes on with his life still haunted by the people he indirectly killed but life just goes on it doesnt matter that oppenheimer feels guilty there is another war the cold war coming there is a lot of communist hunts 

the movie doesnt feel like a story it feels like were watching a real humans life unfold but we dont see him overcome his guilt or some sort of resolution where oppenheimer keeps fighting to keep nuclear bombs from being developed it just follows a certain portion of his life",2023-07-26 00:24:34
didnt expect an action movie but also didnt expect a movie thats 95 one minute perpetual expositions upon expositions i thought this was a movie not a podcast,2023-07-25 15:20:21
if you look how this has rated it on the poll i don’t think many movies are better received here,2023-07-25 17:30:47
unless youre cillian murphy working as a scientist in gotham city,2023-07-25 19:24:39
i mean that’s what they showed sorta but not really lol,2023-08-01 14:34:25
neither did i until i read the cast list,2023-08-07 14:46:15
the master of disguise,2023-08-08 11:42:39
"framing oppenheimers life around two separate hearings running along three timelines was the issue 

giving two minutes of screen time to the antagonist for the first 130 minutes of the movie then having him dominate the third act to reveal some hollow twists and get his comeuppance from an assistant telling him hes not important was ridiculous

we could have gotten a great exploration of oppenheimer and his struggle had nolan made different narrative choices or found a way to condense his choices artfully

given the last two minutes of the movie nolan really seems to think the bomb itself and the ripples it created in history are pretty important and what we should walk away thinking about he just decided to take an hour detour frantically jumping around timelines before abruptly tying things back together",2023-08-07 13:03:38
i said that,2023-08-07 13:45:37
we saw plenty that oppenheimer didnt see,2023-08-13 23:13:47
because its a movie,2023-08-13 19:41:38
not about changing plot but the decision to tell the story that way did it need to be a political intrigue plot with that level of intensity i felt the way they were handling the clearance and hearing was good enough but then nolan decided to amp up the drama post trinity it works within the movie but a bit silly outside it,2023-08-24 07:39:25
i feel like his switch in mentality is fairly understandable especially with the notion that he felt that seeing the bomb in action would deter the world from ever using it again just to see the biggest nations of the time fervently pursuing making even stronger bombs i also think its valid to stop thinking differently about your invention immediately after its actually been utilized to  100s of thousands of people it does echo kittys line about his breakdown over his mistress though you cant commit the sin and then lament the consequences definitely paraphrasing,2023-08-26 01:25:35
see now thats totally fair critiscm and i completely agree with that tbh,2023-07-22 01:47:10
"thats such a contemptuous take  
you can have a firm grasp of editing acting sound design and appreciation of film whilst still finding a film boring  
you can have an avid interest in an individual and still disagree with a films execution",2023-07-22 01:38:54
honestly just sad seeing so many people being so negative on the movie here i thought it was phenomenal  and thats from someone who knew nothing about oppenheimer after the movie i researched his real background and was amazed at how accurate it was,2023-07-22 01:36:43
audio is like 80 of the reason i go to see certain movies in imax sure a big screen is nice but it really is the sound that i personally cant replicate at home,2023-08-01 22:09:51
completely agree with you i think the trinity test scene could’ve been a little more nerve wrecking and they could’ve had some more scenes around the hiroshima nagasaki bombings,2023-07-21 19:18:49
had me on a rope bonkers performance,2023-07-22 05:07:43
"that isnt the point of the movie is it now 

big explosions look cool to smooth brains though i guess",2023-11-25 04:38:15
"barbie i prefer lighter material before eating a hearty meal…plus barbie had an earlier showing  

but yeah i think it watches better if you see barbie first i feel like the heaviness from oppenheimer can offset the enjoyment of barbie but that could just be me",2023-07-21 22:08:37
if someone calls it barbenheimer i assume barbie otherwise its oppenarbie,2023-07-21 22:08:06
he never saw the world become destroyed but they showed that too,2023-07-22 06:59:03
my favourite female character in a nolan movie is carrie anne moss in memento,2023-07-21 15:13:28
i could grasp their emotional performances but it still left me cold i thought they were great and killed the work they were given but i personally felt emotionally disconnected,2023-07-21 15:13:18
not complaints just personal criticisms i find the theme of nuclear war devastating but this movie never got me there emotionally threads jackson 1984 was much more effective for me personally,2023-07-21 15:18:30
idk if the  scenes necessarily were needed but him being a womanizer and kinda an  is an important part of his story he’s a flawed dude who seems to be unable to see the consequences of his actions throughout the story and it culminates with the strauss stuff,2023-07-21 19:13:49
ill say that while i disagree with op on some stuff including his final rating the first half of the movie felt like a supercut of all the best scenes from some hypothetical oppenheimer hbo tv miniseries just breakneck nonstop action that makes it seem like there is a show somewhere containing all the scenes where we get to know the characters better,2023-07-22 01:55:30
youll keep waiting because im not obligated to defend my tastes to you just because i didnt like a movie you liked ,2023-07-21 21:39:32
i imagine you have your arms crossed with a smirk on your face saying this,2023-07-22 00:54:58
at the end of the film they explain that it occurs after the war and is one of the setups for why strauss doesn’t get to be on the cabinet it’s all the leadup for his security clearance being taken away,2023-07-21 17:11:53

"source i cant possibly believe thats true i havent seen the movie yet but i work in vfx and adding a dress to a body is no easy task unless the shot is very wide and she has almost no movement

there is also almost no way nolan who avoids cgi at all costs would allow it so unless universal risked severely  off their new golden goose i cant imagine theyd do it without his consent",2023-07-22 03:19:38
no way is that really true,2023-07-22 03:10:57
i liked all the  in the script they added and werent gratuitous but i dont think this movie needed the nudity at all,2023-07-22 04:06:19

good to hear though you never know these days though what directors may or may not be interested in showing to the viewer a lot of stories are being reframed for the modern audience,2023-07-22 17:43:36
absolutely,2023-07-23 04:06:03
i think she was great  but really only had a few minutes at the end where she really stole the show,2023-07-23 04:06:19
is it a mistake or by request of the studio i can’t tell strange choice if it was made by the theaters or the studio,2023-07-26 03:18:44
"its unfortunate that there wasnt any aside that this was a mistranslation from the bhagavad gita the actual phrase translated should be i am time the destroyer of worlds 

that could have been a great metaphor towards the film as well",2023-08-04 09:21:40
scientists can often do this mathematicians for instance can walk through the number space and even visualize more than 3 dimensions,2023-08-06 06:32:49
those are the best kind of movies imho   they arent overtly trying to push you one way or the other  they present you the film  warts and all and you make that call,2023-08-06 19:58:30
they definitely could have shown more of the disagreements and conflicts between strauss and oppenheimer strauss was portrayed as a hater and a jealous opportunistic where’s he supposedly also hated oppenheimer for his promiscuity and lack of religiousness and such iirc,2023-07-21 15:48:26
yes thank you that is better way to phrase it,2023-07-21 12:14:16
"i didnt sign up to watch a 3hour film lamenting the construction of the nuclear bomb for the to whitewash the actual victims during his lucid dream sequence while giving the bleacher speech

the movie wasnt about the bomb though it was about oppenheimer and how he dealt with the fallout pun not intended from what he created everyone knows those bombs caused incredible damage but one of the bigger points of this movie was to show how oppenheimer went from having this goal that consumed him to almost hating being associated with it showing the audience a bunch of people burning and melting doesnt do a whole lot to add to his inner turmoil 

unfortunately for rdj i know exactly which 30 minutes to cut

again i would have to disagree strauss played a huge part in oppenheimers post los alamos lifeperception plus rdj acted incredibly well",2023-08-01 20:06:52
nobody seems to get it its all about the bomb its alegory its about the fallacy or madness of mutually assured destruction oppenheimer level headed cool his wife urging him to fight all the time strauss jealous ambitious devious who would stop at nothing to destroy oppenheimer even though he destroyed himself in the end             its about handing the immense destructive power of an atom bomb to people like strauss thats why in the final scene oppenheimer says we were afraid we would set the world on fire i think we may have just done it,2023-08-01 21:15:07
i agree that was my least favorite part of the movie but it was five seconds of a three hour film and they had to give context to the quote somehow,2023-08-03 18:54:26
"margin call was a pretty generic movie not gonna lie i liked it but found it all pretty surface level 

and i guess character “study” isn’t exactly accurate no first post was my immediate post theater reaction but it’s a three hour biopic about an incredibly fascinating historical figure released as a mega summer blockbuster has that ever happened i thought the dialogue was on the nose in the first half a bit as they’re establishing his background like the scene with his brother but as it gets past the bomb i thought the movie just really excelled 

nolan obviously isn’t a guy that does subtlety well so he went as big as possible and i thought for what the movie deals with it worked perfect and the themes revolved more around oppenheimer as a personhow he feels than the actual morality behind making and using a nuke which i also really liked and kept it grounded in the character",2023-08-05 15:34:02
i don’t even like most of nolan’s movies maybe 3 total including this one…and those criticisms aren’t obvious at all,2023-08-06 18:43:07
gatekeeping movies now are we,2023-08-03 20:19:18
"i feel like every opinion im reading is calling the movie too pretentious or too dumbed down like it cant be both

the worst ive seen is someone saying the whole third act was a waste of time and all it amounted to was him getting his security clearance revoked theres so much more going on than that",2023-08-03 18:58:02
i don’t understand why this is surprising to you our own personal views on the movie aside it is widely considered a masterpiece in the film community isn’,2023-08-03 17:15:40
i mean its my favorite film of the 2010s yes it’s a masterpiece,2023-08-03 12:36:31
out of curiosity what do you think is a good one,2023-08-03 08:02:44
parassite is the most overrated movie of the last 2 decades,2023-08-03 19:47:56
yes i agree so much with this the movie didn’t immerse me in a fictional dream i never lost myself in the story or the world because there was never time to linger or feel like this world was real i was hyper cognizant that i was watching a movie the entire time,2023-07-22 00:08:52
its to appeal to the average person who gives a  who oppenheimer  this isnt the kardashians it reminds me of when dd removed the fantasy elements from game of thrones to appeal to mothers nfl players except this time its adding something not removing it,2023-07-21 22:56:44
i feel like it could have worked if the film was more experimental and explored themes differently but it felt so jarring and out of place,2023-07-23 23:51:44
" i really really really dont get why you would include a intimate scene on a movie that is focused on an important historical human existencial event

maybe what you dont get is why oppenheimer felt the need to take a break from leading an important human historical event to end a literal world war and go hook up with his communist exgirlfriend

but as a matter of historical fact he did and it shines some light on his complex character and it had serious consequences for him later on if it feels outofplace and unnecessary the fault is with oppie not nolan",2023-07-21 16:30:32
i don’t know why everyone has been hyping the 70mm imax thing there’s nothing in the movie that requires that,2023-07-21 15:53:35
for real,2023-08-05 09:23:23
theres no denying though that it appeals to a lot of right wing people,2023-07-25 01:43:23
i mean i watched it and cant begin to fathom where you get that idea,2023-07-25 02:38:12
honestly it’s a movie i thoroughly enjoyed but would have enjoyed more if some parts of it were better i completely agree with you that’s it’s a pretty flawed movie my enjoyment of that doesn’t change that fact i actually enjoyed it despite the problems it has and how slow some parts of it are to me it’s a pretty good movie but not superb it could have been so much better,2023-07-24 05:17:56
definitely agreed with you man it definitely could have been better in so many ways but i still thoroughly enjoyed it,2023-07-24 03:15:50
nolans weakness is his movies turn out with the characters seeming like they were created by ai,2023-07-24 04:55:25

"agree it was unneeded

that said i thought the scene when they were in the chairs was very classy and well done

i was also very surprised and impressed by the surrealism including the third  scene with them in the interrogation room",2023-07-22 04:00:51
" why show  scenes then

to show his cheating on his wife and mirror the dualities of his allegiances

additionally jean tatlock was possible an intelsoviet swallowsparrow or some sort of wedge to get to oppenheimer the movie seemed to insinuate nefarious aspects

jean tatlock was under surveillance by the fbi as well

 at the time of her death she was under surveillance by the fbi and her phone had been tapped so one of the first people informed about it was fbi director j edgar hoover via a teletype link",2023-07-22 04:28:26

his choices in tenet are awful though absolutely the worst sound design in any film ive ever seen in a theater,2023-07-27 21:57:23
yup best example i can think of relatively recently is peoples disappointment with the northman not being a viking action war movie complaining about what the film was not is pointless instead of critiquing the film for what it isdid,2023-07-22 01:14:34
i loved the irishman but not this,2023-07-22 01:35:55
they didnt brag about how great their practical effects were they said they preferred not to use cgi and people made a meme out of it the bomb test scene was incredibly unbelievably powerful and profound and absolutely would not have benefitted one single iota from having a fake looking cgi megaexplosion,2023-08-03 10:53:34

i think you are damned if you do damned if you dont showing it on a theater screen is still coding it as entertainment despite it being a biopic,2023-08-14 07:54:51
feynman was in the car during the test he wasnt the one who ran out,2023-07-21 19:58:56

at the dinner where strauss argues that the russians have the h bomb that was after the bomb drops and after strauss hired oppenheimer,2023-08-06 21:34:28
of course i read what the movie was about i also read what tenet was about didnt help in either instances,2023-11-30 04:17:05
"yeah the thing you said about the second most important thing to happen in someones life is very apt


a film should always be about the most important thing to happen in someones life period if its not then why does the audience care its inconsequential and just wastes our time when we could be watching the most important thing to happen instead


and thats assuming this inquiry was the 2nd most important thing to happen in oppenheimers life i dont even know that it was since it was more about strauss than anyone",2023-07-22 22:14:33
no this story was 50 about the political fight between oppenheimer and strauss which is not important at all and nobody cares about it 70 years later we learned nothing new about the development of the bomb,2023-07-22 04:10:28
i think it’ll be a good rewatch just because of the timeline jumping around,2023-07-24 06:50:34
i just saw it and i want to go watch it again this week storytelling is made easier by a fantastic story but it was excellent,2023-07-24 04:19:43
never,2023-07-26 21:03:15
what was there to like cinematographer was weak story skipped all the coolimportant parts of the actual history and every female character only served the male gaze the part of the story that nolan chose to tell was done poorly because he left out so much information i left being more confused about the manhattan project than when i went in based off the movie could you me who was involved in the manhattan project i literally learned from barbie and oppenheimer i left dumber,2023-07-24 13:56:24
"it needed to not be a film but be a mini biopic drama series you might find on bbc or netflix ironically considering the strikes and all it had too many characters given so little screen time it needed to be double the length and like you said more time to each character the twist at the end was the best bit as that was the sole focus of the narrative no jumping around dropping random scenes in 

if it wasnt visually stunning i think it would have been panned the acting was very good though",2023-07-30 21:46:59
"this felt like a recap that went on for three hours

this is how i felt too i was reminded of roger eberts review of armageddon something to the effect of theyve finally gone and done it theyve made a featurelength movie trailer so much of the whirlwind editing felt like movie trailer editing rather than an actual film itself 

sure it made the pacing feel fast and the movie go by quicker but it also meant we never really had time to sit with the characters and events and have them sink in emotionally",2023-07-30 19:34:23
thank you that is a great description,2023-07-30 19:14:12
this movie was a biopic without the depth and character study of a biopic the same way inception was a heist film without any of the joy and humor of a heist film,2023-07-30 19:15:10
so a christopher nolan movie,2023-07-22 16:43:57

sorry but that extra hour was pointless nolan focused too much on the communiststrauss angle much better would have been to focus on the project itself the lives of the geniuses that were part of it like szilard fermi teller feymann they were reduced to just cameos i agree with other post einstein should have appeared at the end of the film only,2023-07-23 15:36:21
which i thought was a great way to do it actually all of the scenes in color are supposed to be from oppenheimer’s pov so why didn’t we see any of the victims because he wasn’t thinking about itturning away from it,2023-07-23 20:17:37
in junior high it was a post911 nyc education so they were never gonna say anything to paint the us in a bad light  and in high school my history teacher had a civill war special interest so that’s where the majority of his time went,2023-07-23 20:20:16

its almost as if that isnt what i said,2023-07-29 14:12:09
it wasnt strauss that was a pivotal part of history it was the taking down of an american hero which is part of history the confirmation trial was a bit of moviemagic for the audience to feel redemption even if it really isnt and closure,2023-07-28 23:06:27
yea i didn’t really care about strauss at all and he kind of took over the third act,2023-07-28 23:30:29

yet nolan cut it to only 10 seconds",2023-07-21 13:04:58
dune blade runner arrivalare as loud as oppenheimer but they are far sloower and contemplative its what a biopic character study should be instead we got a frantic panic inducing nightmare,2023-07-22 15:12:16
almost like i acknowledge this very fact in my review,2023-07-21 16:11:25
if i have to read something to enjoy a movie idk about that,2023-08-31 14:32:39

also you cant say that after watching a movie about the dude who straight up built the bomb lol",2023-08-31 14:34:11

just how it was framed of the car leaving the shot and him already being there made like he was a secret agent in a spy film",2023-07-22 02:36:48
they set up for the car windshield to shatter and it never happened total letdown the bomb was the most disappointing part of the movie for me,2023-07-21 16:53:55

im looking at the doco now and will be looking into more about oppenheimer as i feel the movie didnt really educate me on the political side or scientific side ",2023-07-21 11:27:20

,2023-07-22 13:23:56
i tend to agree with op its not that i need nolan or any director to falsify the prominence of women in the time period its that whenever a woman is on screen its in service to the male character over and over theyre used as props to help their male counterparts have some kind of emotional growth but we are never invited into the inner workings of their lives the women also only ever talk to the men almost never to other women,2023-07-22 02:05:12
the characters were awfully written it felt like they were meant to be important in his story but they way they were written was a terrible let down and idk why you would say that even if behind the scenes women have played very important roles in history not misguided at all to expect that from the most popular filmmaker in 2023,2023-07-21 10:29:50
shouldn’t expect the women to be featured in a historical movie lol these women literally had a bigger role in real life though and an important one nolan for some reason gave them less to do and changed their entire personality to something less realistic that also just happens to make them less prominent and more crazy in the story then they actually were if he was actually going for historical accuracy they would have been featured more prominently and also been more level headed then he made them instead of some  pixie,2023-07-23 17:46:11
agree i am happy to see truly well written  independently standing female characters but independent standing is not something i would expect from a film centered around one man’s pov all of the characters male and female are going to relate back to his own perceptions,2023-07-22 15:04:31
assssstonnishingly good i agree ,2023-07-22 11:04:57
oh dear,2023-07-21 11:52:16
this is a men movie yet openheimer is a crybaby curious,2023-07-21 19:55:04
 all the women who were in my screening watching oppenheimer musnt have gotten the memo,2023-07-28 09:53:09
his security clearance was a significant plot thread in the book this is based on he had flirted with communism earlier in his life and that hung over him for the entire project and the period after,2023-07-21 03:32:06
everyone keeps saying it’s about oppenheimer not the bomb well the creation of the bomb was an eighth of his life and the culmination of the rest of his life before hand his magnum opus,2023-07-21 22:58:12
"if youre making a movie about neil armstrong the climax is him landing on the moon


everything else he did after that is irrelevant as far as history is concerned",2023-07-22 23:11:20

dunkirk is the worst piece of  that are nolans later movies,2023-07-21 20:52:30
i think it does when it comes to oscars they tend to appreciate biopics of slightly faulted geniuses from yesterday heavy with dialogue drama and accurate portrayal of that timeperiod,2023-07-21 20:47:44
yes,2023-07-21 21:10:53
"for the first two no… there was no emotional connection built between oppenheimer and the baby ”peter” and for jean she was oppenheimer’s first lover and was forgotten for an hour before bringing her back for few quick scenes

interstellar yeah there we go with some emotion and inception has it too in batman movies i cared about joker bane alfred gordon  but not the main character

and i think that nolan is the best modern director he is just not there with spielberg or cameron at least not yet",2023-07-21 20:58:01
i thought it was perfect he felt  being exposed like that his personal  life in front of everyone and his wife you felt  with him because its uncomfortable from his perspective he feels  and from his wife while hearing it can only imagine the  act of being cheated on thats why she appears when the camera switches to her view,2023-08-28 04:23:58
i agree him being  afterwards did indicate that he was being exposed and forced to be vulnerable in front of the committee so it did make some sense but i feel good actors can show the same feelings and emotions without literally stripping down nolan just wanted a few  scenes in this movie and decided to keep them even though they served no specific purpose,2023-08-28 01:51:57
the stakes were what was going to happen to the world now that nations had access to power that could wipe civilizations off the world oppe hoped the atomic bomb would lead to world wide peace not a version 1 version 2 being the hydrogen bomb ultimately the personal vendetta between strauss and oppe was the idea of military secrecy and power vs worldwide knowledge and mutually assured destruction mad this set the stage for the cold war and the us vs ussr struggle moving forward it was much bigger than egos,2023-07-28 16:08:24
"that doesnt track the movie was full of exposition for politics and geopolitics russia japan the white house why jump back that far for this why the apple even

i know its a biopic but artistic license exists we knew the story was framed around some sort of trial but the stakes were not communicated until the last quarter you dont see a problem with that

oh nolans great with writing obsession but with the rest of the human emotions not so much not to the extent of m night shyamalan of course but by a difference of degrees not type thankfully it had fantastic actors and a great score to make up for it",2023-07-28 16:12:45
lol  his movies is flawed and it makes him even more a genius,2023-07-28 19:43:26
all these faults do is prove how brilliant nolan is,2023-07-28 17:36:41
ironically though one of the biggest flaws of the movie was choosing to show the explosion during the trinity test the explosion in the film was underwhelming considering i’ve been hearing about it for years and fails to hold up to the ancient black and white footage of the actual test,2023-08-11 03:34:39

the tldr is that in order to maintain an engaging story it isnt enough to string together the events of the plot as they happen instead they should lead into each other through consequence its the difference between a list of events and a chain of events",2023-09-21 15:55:52
"the point of that example wasnt that oppie won every round the point was that the rounds were too short problems were resolved before they could become engaging like defusing a bomb only seconds after the audience finds out there is a bomb

theyre gonna chew your wife up if she testifies cut to wife handling it like a boss after one minute of difficulty things like this happened nearly every couple of scenes few conflicts lasted longer than that",2023-07-28 22:17:57
ignoring who they are do you disagree with their premise,2023-07-30 02:28:17
uh yeah as someone who was excited about the fact that they were using practical effectsi still expected it to be way more visually stunning maybe they shouldve used cgi because it was so underwhelming,2023-07-21 05:24:40
the movie dramaticizes it a bit as a whodunnit with a motive of a couple specific personal sleights but overall strauss did lead the charge against oppenheimer and seems to have disliked him for a litany of reasons both personal and political,2023-07-21 21:41:39
"but did strauss really have it in for oppenheimer

yes 

",2023-07-21 23:11:30
for 3 hours actually no its not a horror movie at all but a lot of the scenes and the music are quite anxietyinducing,2023-07-21 21:04:54
im not sure why youre quite this angry  i just saw the movie and had watched a lot of explosions including the trinity test footage and on rewatching via your links right now the test scene was absolutely amazing but the explosion footage did not convey anywhere near the scale of what this real test footage conveyed just now on rewatch so the recreation of the test part for me was underwhelming but the fear awe joy dread part was excellent,2023-07-22 05:49:38
"did you actually take a loom at footage from the beirut explosion it is way way more impressive than the bomb in oppenheimer

take a look at this video for example it actually looks like a nuke went off
",2023-07-22 18:15:23
there were black people army outside of the room during the generals meeting to decide the targets for the drops and i know the film is foccused on oppenheimer but im surprise we never saw the 19 black scientists that worked for the project when he was doing the rounds of recruit,2023-07-22 06:42:32
i said it to one of my friends and it was his response to a tee lol,2023-07-22 06:07:32
"thats fair 

i grew up in the us while we were taught about american atrocities it was usually done in the context of this was done and now we moved on from it neutral tone nuking japan was one of the few things that was taught as this needed to be done to save lives like it was a positive thing the way that the movie directly countered that assertion is similar to a piece of media saying that the us deserved 911",2023-07-22 13:45:40
a lot of these people don’t want to be bothered on reading the history,2023-07-23 21:04:39
the only way i can explain tenet is that each scene exists in its own universe instead of being part of a coherent flowing plot line,2023-07-24 00:27:48
the color wasn’t to tell the timelines apart it was to tell us if the scene was from oppenheimer’s perspective ie when strauss is seeing oppenheimer and einstein talk and then the actual conversation,2023-07-24 01:30:19
i didnt expect it to be half about catching commies thats what ruined it for me,2023-07-30 22:08:30
i expected more of a coherent story it was really hard to follow the different characters and understand their motivations as they barely had any screen time the plot jumped all over the place and really what it needed was more time maybe setting the story around the hearing would have given the narrative an anchor to pivot from the ending section was by far the best part of the film  ironically i felt it was rushed,2023-07-30 21:42:23
"that scene is shown to us in two different perspectives too the first time strauss talks about it you see it more as oppenheimer wittingly beat strauss in court you see strauss smile but he doesnt look furious

but in the third act you realize he was furious and he couldnt stand that embarrassment",2023-07-30 22:49:16
"i thought rdj was fine but it wasnt groundbreaking from him

there were definitely points where it felt like nolan said just act like tony stark in civil war when hes not suited up",2023-07-31 22:08:28
"came off looking unrealistically childish and petty in the final scenes

ive got some terrible news about the entirely of the american political class for the last 250 years or so",2023-08-01 07:51:13
im pretty sure thats the point to show hiw petty and pathetic he was for playing politics to destroy oppenheimer,2023-08-01 07:25:01
"people are on the hype train i think opinion will modify downward in a few days when peoples ears stop wringing

and to be fair i did like parts of it they were just mostly towards the beginning of a very long movie",2023-07-22 05:35:13
"lol yes that is exactly how humans talk they just announce exactly what plot twist has just occurred to them for the benefit of an unseen audience

from my perspective the jedi are evil",2023-07-22 05:34:24
kinda yeah when its nothing but factoids usually movies try to weave the factoids in with some dalliances about the characters life maybe see them live a little bit have emotions connect with things this movie is just an unending list like a very fast powerpoint,2023-07-22 05:33:10
you really arent sure it doesnt take a genius to read his comment and get that out of it yet here you are lost,2023-07-23 01:28:21
same for me  i see nolan and pre tdkr and post  nowhere near the same in quality,2023-07-26 21:55:51
"i loved the middle third — the part at los alamos that was actually about the bomb the first third was so rushed and felt like a montage of random events the last third was boring af — literally no one cares about this senate hearing 

the movie would have been much better if it was half the length",2023-07-23 23:03:27
i wish it were average its way below average,2023-07-21 22:53:19
try not to get his  stuck in your  bro,2023-07-26 06:49:57
nolan isnt popular  this sub is not a valid representation of the average movie goer,2023-07-26 21:54:59
lol imagine being this wrong,2023-07-26 03:05:29
interstellar is still hands down one of the worst films ive ever seen in my life,2023-07-21 22:54:01
at least spell the title of the movie right,2023-07-21 14:08:05
the downvotes state otherwise kid sorry,2023-07-26 21:53:54
i agree completely it’s insensitive to have that document in a  scene to begin with but from a movie perspective i just don’t think it’s really true to the character who had alot of respect for hinduism maybe an oversight by nolan or something i am missing idk,2023-07-21 13:39:25
i’d agree it’s good but it’s a classic case of “visionary creator needed a downtoearth editor” nolan got carried away trying to make a biopic politicallegal thriller and philosophical thinkpiece but there isn’t enough meat on any of those bones alone to drive the film yet they don’t really serve to complement each other here either,2023-07-23 05:16:24
agree wholeheartedly,2023-07-23 04:22:26
right i can still hear the weird interstellar violin spamming after the interview with old murph my dad was a farmer ddduuuuunnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn interstellar,2023-07-23 04:43:44
"feels like walking in on strangers whove known each other for years having a conversation after youve just woken up from a nap

amazing thank you",2023-07-26 21:40:42
"hi found the scene underwhelming here because it did not look like an atomic explosion not because i was expecting a crazy action movie everything about the scene and leading up to the explosion was great and i was holding my breath on the edge of my seat during the countdown the visuals themselves is what was disappointing to me and i am far from the only one with this opinion not being contrarian thats just how i felt as the scene played out might seem like a nitpick to you but a lot of us were expecting more 

your criticism of others not being impressed and how they all must be uneducated teenagers comes off as pretty condescending not going to lie i was decently educated on the events of this film prior to seeing the movie and quantum physics and theory has always been a strong interest of mine so its not like i dont appreciate the subject matter in fact i was hoping the movie would focus more on these aspects rather than the controversies of oppies ties to communism",2023-07-26 19:18:27
"i mean hes clearly shown in the movie to have done some important work — several characters say oh i read your paper about molecules so his reputation precedes him he wrote a seminal early work on black holes which they depicted in the movie and he founded the largest most influential school of theoretical physics in the us at the time which is clearly shown in the movie too

but i guess if you think they didnt do enough to show why oppenheimer was famous enough to direct the manhattan project i guess you must be right",2023-07-26 19:56:00
im really tired of his refusal to correctly mix audio   its hurting his films   the violin in this movie is an assault to the ears,2024-01-05 00:18:05
really all of them ,2023-07-29 01:55:25
oh my that makes so much sense thank you  however they did meet during that one meeting about the project right  they were talking about how the bomb was leaked and that there were proof that the german started creating the same bomb as them or something like that strauss talked to oppenheimer as if he knew him well and then after rabi ask him if hes sure he want to talk instead of strauss because what he say will be considered absolute and there will be no place to any error while strauss can afford to make a mistake something around that it was in the middle of the project they didnt finish the bomb yet and were scared that the german would finish it first and the way strauss acted and talked to oppenheimer really did seem like acquaintance he even put his hand on oppenheimers shoulder and told him something i clearly remember oppenheimer specifically telling groves that he would absolutely go to the manhattan meeting even if they wouldnt let him when they were in los almos so before the bombing or did i also get the chronology of this scene wrong  was it actually after the bombing after meeting with strauss  were they talking about the russian and not the german like i thought i remembered it   thank you so much for your answer btw i really appreciate it,2023-08-20 05:26:13
"sort of agreed but dune imax was better in terms of delivery and utilization of the big screen 

also",2023-08-30 05:12:54
"yes but it is such a strange thing to focus on what felt like the larger half of then movie to me it felt like it tried to juggle remorse and weltschmerz with oppies career dreams and reputation and maybe there is a point that is attempted here on strauss being right in that oppie would do it all over if he could but its a weird dynamic to give the viewer who is simultaneously watching oppie imagine hes stepping into the charred remains of a human body in any case it doesnt come off very clear what it wants to say

the final moments of the movie is getting the reveal his security clearance isnt being renewed and he calls his wife to tell her to not take in the sheets implying that was as important to him as the trinity test then at the same time were told strauss thought too much about himself thinking einstein was talking about him that there might be bigger things at hand here but its so frustrating because that is what i want to tell the whole movie i understand the security clearance was important for his credibility and gives leverage to making a court drama the worlds most lovedhated genre but i think it was a poor choice for being about the person who spearheaded the atom bomb that it focuses on his career and affair rather than just how much the invention changed the world the victims and him personally it goes a little into that but far too little to feel like it knows what it wants to say in my opinion anyway",2023-07-28 09:12:32
"i get that it just feels so insignificant like a formality i realized during the movie that it has an impact on oppenheimer‘s career and reputation but i didn’t care much about his character either 

that might be a major point in the movie i didn’t care about trinity being successful because i knew the outcome before i entered the cinema i didn’t care about the main character because he doesn’t seem to struggle at any point the early university scenes cyanide apple era felt so artificial and fabricated  no you’re not the antihero i root for just because you’re laughed at in class once i subsequently didn’t care about his q clearance actually i was puzzled why it was even an option to keep it after the project shouldn’ be on a need to know basis shouldn’t  happy to be able to return to university

i also didn‘t care much about the mccarthy era thing because… i don’t know why i didn’t care 

the main thing i cared about in the movie was the marble glass filling up because i believed the glass being full would mean trinity andor hiroshima and the end of my suffering but i was wrong",2023-07-28 10:16:10
" the security clearance gave him credibility and knowledge of what was going on with bomb development

not really keep in mind that one of the main reasons strauss tried to undermine oppenheimer was because of their ideological differences on the hbomb so the issue of his security clearance was a manifestation of the more important conflict not an independent conflict and one mans opinion about the hbomb even if that one man was oppenheimer hardly made a difference the drama over the security clearance seems to have had much bigger implications for ego than for geopolitics",2023-07-28 16:21:46
the amount of down votes im seeing on completely level headed negative critiques tells me that some people just dont think nolan can ever make a boring movie,2023-07-28 15:11:44
i envy you,2023-07-28 15:29:11
fdr was a visionary and kept the interests of the common man and woman at heart while truman was a puppet for the ruling classes and their interests that’s what it comes down to,2023-07-22 14:45:10
fuchs was part of the british contingent that worked on the manhattan project and los alamos he was not brought on by oppenheimer and no there has never been any evidence oppenheimer was a cardcarrying member of the communist party he was certainly a left wing liberal who associated with communists but outside of people like ernest lawrence that was very much the norm for berkeley academics in the 1930s,2023-07-22 14:56:21
and thank  for fuchs and the other atomic spies like the rosenbergs they were heroes for all of humanity can you imagine a world in which only one country has atomic weapons dystopian nightmare,2023-07-22 14:46:47
lol oops,2023-08-04 05:25:46
"thank you i feel like sweeping away inconvenient details of historical figures comes up a lot but like a lot of the historical facts of the situation couldve enhanced the story

truman was a bonafide villain so i suspect the exclusion was more for plot and pacing reasons rather than trying to make the government look like good guys",2023-07-22 18:38:38
3,2023-07-23 03:15:31
yeah perhaps i came in a little too hot im a real a bomb history stan so i think that made me extra disappointed honestly nolan managed to cram a lot of stuff in there and making truman so vile was really cool,2023-07-22 18:27:02
quite aggressive is an understatement that first paragraph is a  joke seeing it on a laptop screen ugh,2023-07-22 19:05:50
right i was really trying to pay attention the whole time and i was just positively pooped at the end,2023-07-22 19:36:05
yeah that was really interesting i wonder if it was cg,2023-07-22 18:23:30
exactly there are so many moments in the history of the bomb that leap out from the pages if you havent already id implore you to read the making of the atomic bomb by richard rhodes its possibly my favorite book,2023-07-23 03:13:53
" unlike the movie the berkeley scientists wouldnt have learned about it from the newspaper

as it says in the book luis alvarez the very character in the movie was sitting in a barber chair reading the paper when he read a blurb about the hahnstrassmann experiment and then he went next door to oppie in the radiation lab and recreated the experiment

edit the source they attribute for this story is alvarezs autobiography and they put the date as jan 29th 1939 that will have been the timescale it took for information to cross the continent via letters so its not really out of line with the columbia experiment",2023-07-23 19:20:24
sounds like dunkirk which felt like one extended battle scene,2023-07-22 23:12:06
"sure but again i attribute that more to public ignorance of history than anything personally i like being challenged by a film and having to look things up it makes you appreciate the research that went into making the film this is definitely a movie mad for those interested in the art of cinema and history 

i disagree that the film was hard to follow the films visual cues clearly illustrated when it was a different time period either through the costumes or the usage of black and white i think way too many people are confusing this for a four quadrant movie when it definitely has an intended audience its not endgame or missioon impossible where you can just turn off your brain and view it nolan as a filmmaker makes most of his films require multiple viewings again people are entitled to their opinions but if people go in expecting everything to be spoonfed to them or that they wont have to work to engage with the material its going to feel that way to people",2023-07-22 22:53:54
"yes you just summed up everything i was feeling when i walked out but couldnt articulate into words thank you

i wanted to love this movie but i just cant because of this",2023-07-22 23:20:39
including the filmmaker,2023-07-22 22:50:52
"im sorry is that not implicitly understood 

if youre looking for an action movie then yeah of course youre going to view it as boring its about a mans internal conflict about wrestling with his own creation that killed thousands and the way its forever shaped the history of our species 

the acting set design costume design score direction and cinematography were excellent",2023-07-22 22:41:59
i feel like you’ve never seen a truly boring moving if you thought this was flat out boring,2023-07-23 00:17:26
this man is coming in here with the i study political science sir and actually this movie isnt boring and it is hilarious,2023-07-22 22:45:08
thats not what hes saying lol,2023-07-22 22:59:26
"has laughably low stakes

x200b

not how i view it  the stakes set in that last hour is that the power of mass destruction is now in the hands of opportunistic  who want to keep pushing things further and further shattering any hope of world peace that oppenheimer deluded himself into thinking was possible  he was wrong he was used and discarded and now the world is now probably a worse place because of what he did  the whole message of the movie hinges on this part and the stakes are high because theres no putting pandora back in the box",2023-07-24 14:11:42
eh i disagree seeing it in theaters was cool and all like all movies but there wasn’t nothing in it that needed to be seen on the big screen as opposed to watching it on a tv,2023-07-30 03:47:41

thats fine i still thought it was dumb,2023-07-30 03:59:42
he does it so that he can make smart movies for dumb people its his thing and people eat it up when its genuinely just bad film making at its core,2023-07-21 23:36:06
"exactly if you untangle the last third it would be an excruciatingly boring series of meetings they used editing to try and make it suspenseful when the denial of his clearance is basically foretold the entire movie over and over again

the einstein conversation at the end was a perfect ending though",2023-07-21 14:04:33
he does it with every  movie to try to make things absurdly straight foward seem complex when theyre still just straight forward in the end and told poorly to be intentionally confusing to most,2023-07-21 23:35:27
what about his other movies all generic,2023-07-21 14:02:50
not to be rude genuine interest but what do you consider a clever movie with nuance just so i can compare both and know,2023-07-24 19:26:50
"e  mc² is literally part of the pop culture everyone’s heard of it so an explanation of what it really means would’ve been cool

louis slotin is only remembered for being a meme but him being killed by the nuclear core would further emphasize the lethality of the bomb that they’re working on it would make the death  destruction personal slotin died at los alamos which makes it tangential to oppy’s story

oppy translated the bhagavad gita to english oppy isn’t the only one who’s ever read the bhagavad gita everyone’s obsessed with the “i am become death” quote so the bhagavad gita isn’t irrelevant

i didn’t mention anything about oppy’s later travels because you’re right—it’s not important to the trinity test and its resulting world events

what are you talking about with hiroshima and nagasaki oppy was mortified by news of both cities being nuked it affected oppy’s decision making which led to him being ousted from los alamos",2023-07-24 23:49:49

to be fair i was expecting more of a visual treat than what we got that being said i still really enjoyed the movie,2023-07-23 04:01:56
i was personally expecting more than just a scene of people talking then another then another then another then another there wasnt even much of a narrative this happens and then this and then this,2023-07-23 05:01:03
"of course not i expected to see footage from hiroshima and nagasaki

this is a big movie from my favorite director and i hadn’t been in a theater since 2012 so i had high hopes maybe unattainable",2023-07-23 03:45:58
most likely he went in expecting more focus on the bomb and big explosions,2023-07-24 13:51:04

extrapolate yourself disappointment perhaps",2023-07-24 14:20:06

well sadly for you this movie isn’t about the world  and part of oppenheimers biography is… you guessed it love drama,2023-07-24 23:26:25
didn’t miss anything this is my opinion on what i paid to see,2023-07-23 21:52:09
but was he  or it was supposed to be radiation sickness i was confused by this too,2023-07-22 00:04:13
"i stand corrected but its still not like it was a character with much screentime 

regardless of who it was my point was that it was an underwhelming way to end the scene  there was something clumsyawkward about it if they were trying to convey radiation sickness imagery",2023-07-22 00:56:54
nolan made the dark knight lol,2023-07-22 00:06:02
"i don’t even like nolan and this his best movie to me 

i can just make the same argument that the only reason you don’t like it is bc it’s nolan and we can be here all day",2023-07-22 21:29:40
i completely disagree i think oppenheimers moral qualms that are thoroughly explored throughout the film is the most important part also adds to the story of how the us can flip on you after you’re not useful anymore he was the perfect surrogate to tell this story through imo,2023-07-22 21:26:36
"since you’re so educated and smart what was boring about it to you and what biopics do you find better

im not talking about those people because that is fine some people who are into these films probably wont enjoy it and thats cool but some people are just unreasonably mad at this movie like its the movies fault that it was dialogue heavy 3 hour long movie when in reality that is what it was always gonna be,2023-07-23 07:11:15

"i also didnt like tenet dunkirk and tdkr i didnt like dunkirk because it was so slow and boring oppenheimer is like that except it has constant dialogue dialogue that i couldnt even follow there were a few scenes that were 1010 but so much of it had me thinking i dont care about any of this lets  get on with it 

once i thought the movie was about to be over i looked at my watch and went holy  theres a whole other hour and that last hour was such a drag",2023-07-21 23:57:43
i think for many it will depend on the subject matter like are you interested in the life of the man who created the atom bomb as simple as that if you get bored by such movies with lots of dialogues then not for you,2023-07-22 00:55:35
"im not comparing the people which is why i didnt say oskar schindler but the title of the movie and yes i wanted to see the bombs drop because we deserved an unfiltered and unbiased depiction of the catastrophe we brought on the japanese civilians

instead we got oppenheimer the quest for security clearance",2023-07-22 15:37:16

its literally just a 3 hour long word soup it is both a marathon because its so long and a sprint because it never stop going as fast as possible its exhausting and impossible to follow",2023-07-22 16:17:23
"it was realllly chunky

i laughed when rdj said the greatest triumph of my career is about to become the biggest humiliation of my life or whatever

thats some george lucas writing right there",2023-07-22 16:27:29
"what is so significant about the bomb is the politics behind it

cmon now is that really the case

a potentially species ending bomb with unimaginable destructive power scientific history with the first splitting of an atom which is literally the basic fabric of all matter an arms race against  germany

it didnt even really focus on the big picture politics like i wouldnt have minded it being about cold war politics jewish science the arms race but that all was second place to some random american politician with a grudge and oppenheimers security clearance",2023-07-24 13:57:10
"cmon now the only way anybody outside of physics knows the name oppenheimer is because he worked on the first atomic bomb

you can understand why people might be disappointed it focused on the politics rather than the science",2023-07-24 13:50:46
"it felt to me like they were trying too hard to make this into some artsy human drama

i think the creating of a potentially species ending weapon has the aspect covered almost by default the way they set the film out ended up taking away from that",2023-07-24 08:48:58
it wasnt as bad as other films but definitely a few bits where i was struggling to hear what they were saying because of the soundtrack,2023-07-24 09:03:26
"i get it and the reasons im just saying i dont like it

i just find it irritating to watch

like i said to someone else i think they tried to hard to make it artsy and profound when the subject matter was profound enough

so to include just ww2 bombing

i never mentioned ww2 bombing",2023-07-24 13:52:12
aside from his role in the development of the bomb it really made me wonder what exactly the hook was for nolan to focus on him,2023-07-21 12:23:31
because he’s the father of the atomic bomb and the movie was very heavily advertised as a bombcentric film if you have a 3hour movie about lee harvey oswald and make 60 of it about his relationship with his mom you might get some people who find that boring,2023-07-25 13:00:45
almost all the promotional materials and trailers of the film have focused on the bomb you cant blame people for having the expectation,2023-07-25 15:29:36
i couldnt agree more i thought that was going to be the turning point i was expecting the noise to swell as oppenheimer leaves the room and him see a city on fire instead we just got the parallel between radiation sickness and drunkenness and then he snapped out of it again it was clever and well executed but just didnt go far enough imo,2023-07-23 05:09:15
thats maybe my biggest frustration with this movie it seemed like everything was building to some big payoff that never came if i knew the movie was just going to be a straight forward story i would have felt more satisfied at the end,2023-07-24 12:06:05
"that was such a great scene 

i love when oppenheimer leaves the office and truman says something like dont let that crybaby back in here",2023-07-27 14:22:16
"he started crying at the opening scene

man just loves apples",2023-07-22 16:39:59
"literally the same thing can be said to the nolanfanatic shmucks that think just because evidently  tons of people found the characters entirely uncompelling that it means they just wanted to see explosions

instead of yknow remotely wellwritten scripts",2023-07-27 04:33:25
"the one in the interrogation room is the one  scene i would have kept it was a rare nolan surrealist take and it added to kittys pov

the other ones i thought were unneeded",2023-07-22 04:09:34
"i find it fit really well as it was in the eyes of kitty being told  and it was from the couples too  oppenheimer was laid bare for the world to see with what he did    
and i think it was fitting immensely",2023-07-22 03:35:55
they’re not very long and don’t drag on or anything there is some nudity here and there which might be uncomfortable but i still recommend seeing it,2023-07-22 03:14:18

made the same mistake again watching this and instantly felt like i should have saved the money and gone to a regular showing",2023-07-26 19:27:38

oppen deez,2023-07-21 11:43:17
 amazing finale,2023-07-22 02:16:24
right nothing in the movie explains why he was sympathetic to communism or what his real interests are i just know that he’s a womanizer and a bit prickly,2023-07-24 08:42:46
i didnt hate it but it felt like i was a pretty surface level biopic which was pretty frustrating for such an interesting person,2023-07-24 08:35:15
"i think you nailed this opinion and i agree with it 

i was mostly shocked that they managed to cram pretty much the entire book into the runtime having read the book i started with an idea of the background of each character but cant imagine anyone in the audience getting that purely from the film

i enjoyed it but only as a complement to the book but not as a standalone

i was able to kind of relax during certain scenes because i knew from the book what they were trying to do but i dont know if id have been able to follow it otherwise",2023-07-24 10:00:40
the dialogue thing is exactly my problem with this movie,2023-07-24 14:08:32
but i bet if they included all that they people would complain about it being too much talking and not enough “action” i watched a documentary about him a week before it and it helped a lot more to understand,2023-07-24 09:35:10
thanks must have missed that,2023-08-14 01:36:49
" the security meeting and congressional hearing were mostly used as a means to deliver the plot

exactly as a result i thought the delivery was superficial and was not as deepmoving as it could have been the hearing became the primary focus and the nuclear topic secondary the last scene with einstein for example was moving and great but unfortunately it only lasted like 30 seconds",2023-07-21 11:10:34
yeah i get more chills watching historic videos than the way nolan showed it the build up was great though,2023-07-21 04:08:04
i think you’re missing the significance of the third act of the movie it wasn’t just about him losing security clearance it was about him losing his ability to influence the direction of nuclear weapons and nuclear energy in the world and about how his concerns about the future were twisted and used to attack him as being a communist sympathizer,2023-07-21 04:43:10
theres a solid 2 hour political and government spy thriller wrapped around the development at los alamos in there somewhere and 1 hour of a pretty decent courtroom drama and thirty minutes of nonsense relationship dynamics and clunky character building,2023-07-21 08:24:46
" i hate watching alcoholic characters on screen always comes off as super cliche and pretentious 

takes dramatic hit from the bottle and wipes mouth",2023-07-21 12:25:55
every character does not need an ending also she couldn’t take care of her own kid at one point…,2023-07-21 04:17:07
"if you’re going to make a film talking about how nuclear weapons can potentially destroy the planet it would certainly help if you convey the actual scale of things especially if you’re going to do a whole minute of suspenseful build up right before

reply to your edit totally disagree here’s another video with the empire state building as reference first 20 seconds —  size aside nolan’s explosion was missing some obvious characteristics of an atom bomb obviously there’s only so much explosives you can get your hands on as a film maker",2023-07-21 03:40:20
he didnt say it was the whole point,2023-07-21 05:35:58
"my brother the atomic explosion is not the point of the whole movie you are missing the point

why is this the goto language for redditors when they read criticisms of things they like",2023-07-21 09:26:15
that’s a fair take but idk why they marketed the bomb as the big scene of the movie then they had countdowns hyped it up in the trailer everyone hyped it up because it wasn’t cgi the sound design was amazing for it but we got no sense of scale of the explosions because all the shots of it were from so far,2023-07-24 15:41:44
maybe but with the amount of hype built into this specific sequence and the marketing of the need to be in the 70mm format to experience it fully you sorta expect it to be the cinematic experience of the summer that its touting itself to be but then it just ends up being 4k closeups of what looks like a regular explosion in slomo ive only seen the film once but i dont even remember seeing the explosion from afar to really scale this thing up,2023-07-24 17:08:29
agree was holding my breath the whole time,2023-07-24 06:07:59
to me it seemed like the goal of the scene was to give it impact without just showing a big explosion the lead up to this major event culminating in a silent flash with the explosive sound and wave following moments layer is meant to show the range of the bomb,2023-07-24 06:14:59
yeah i did i’ve seen so many people say it’s nolan’s best and one of the best films ever made even rdj said something like that but i kept my expectations low so they were met,2023-07-24 15:42:32
he really tried to make oppenheimers wikipedia article as interesting as possible during that last half,2023-07-22 05:08:59
" thats a great summarization

what a brilliant film need to go see it again",2023-07-21 07:29:24
he was a character who was an amalgamation in that he was expressing a viewpoint held by many in the scientific community regarding the persecution of oppenheimer because oppenheimer dared to speak his mind i had always heard that teller the father of the hbomb was a controversial figure in the scientific communitythis movie showcases perfectly why,2023-07-21 12:15:22
ahhh cool makes sense,2023-07-21 23:48:56
"yea give us the dead shadow prints although oppenheimer wouldnt fully comprehend how awful it must have been at the time of speech but face peeling and the charred body just wasnt enough

then a again with all the nolan time skips oppenheimer sees the aftermath pictures then he is able to fully visualizes how awful it was 

with the sequence everyone cheering and then sudden silence and that scream i really got startled scared even with what i was about to see not into gore but do wish he would have gone brutal 

concerning jean what ruins it is the flow kitty is reminded about the affair at the hearing the way oppenheimer mentioned it was the last time it alludes to suicide then we get a whole other plot sequence before coming back to jean suicide or assassination 

emily blunt was great i was engaged along with matt damon and david krumholtz he played bernard the head elf in the santa clause

also david dastmalchian as the letter instigator really glad he is finally well hopefully getting his due",2023-07-26 05:20:41
lesson for the future  always present your cities as attractive honeymoon destinations as much as possible,2023-07-28 00:31:21
the people who wanted to see a 3 hour biopic of oppenheimer are the omes who went on a thursday and wensday the week it came out  general audiences will watch it froday and saturday and will have more varied reviews,2023-07-21 06:30:06
said the exact same thing they told the story through the incorrect lense it was jumping too much,2023-07-22 08:45:45
"okay average redditor

its just my opinion

you seemed to assume a lot of things out of what i said

you dont have to systematically take every opinion i said down

im glad you enjoyed the movie",2023-07-22 08:33:45
"the film showed nothing of japan and the trinity test was so underwhelming i think a lot of people will come away feeling the same way about the lack of explosions

the courtroom scenes were okay but all the marketing is fire and brimstone and the film was actually a low stakes courtroom drama with too many characters and murky motivations",2023-07-22 08:54:47
" wdym though by wanting to see more of the nuclear side of things like you want to see the nukes being used

yes

 also nolan is intentional af with his storyboarding and the final cut 

nolan prefers to shoot without a planned list of shots or storyboards",2023-07-22 10:35:43
if the postwar politics were the whole point of the film then it shouldnt have spent so much time on the manhattan project and his early life,2023-07-23 14:31:29
if it focused on the manhattan project then the movie couldve focused on his conflicted emotions at having unleashed this terrible weapon thats a powerful arc but then the movie keeps going and it tacks on a second arc about him being betrayed were left with a movie that doesnt do justice to either of these,2023-07-23 14:11:59
post war stuff could have been made in 15 minutes it took nolan an hour and that didnt work well with most people of the audience,2023-07-23 15:45:01
then it spent too much time depicting the manhattan project it tried to do both but this just gave the movie a muddled identity,2023-07-23 14:16:48
oh that’s really good i’d picked up on the differing perspectives aspect but the bit about binarynonbinary perceptions is really interesting i love that interpretation,2023-08-16 19:36:16
the future wasn’t in black in white though only the scenes from strauss’s perspective the last scene chronologically with oppenheimer receiving the award from the president was in color because it was in the perspective of oppenheimer,2023-08-16 14:43:17
i think the scenes in blackandwhite are to show that they’re from strauss’ perspective and the ones in colour are from oppenheimer’s perspective for the most part it tracks with the pastpresent but some scenes we see from both their perspectives at different points in the movie and their colour changes respectively  the hearing where oppenheimer humiliates strauss about exporting isotopes is shown in both ways as is oppenheimer’s brief conversation with einstein before strauss is ignored by einstein,2023-08-16 19:35:28
dont you think thats part of the point he lived in that din for years and likely his only moment of silence was in that same moment it would have been exhausting,2023-08-17 03:06:26
i actually found this kind of exhausting there was no ebb and flow at all just this constant dramatic tension this can be used to good effect when the movie is not so  long i was beat down by this movie and actually found it kind of boring how nolan had ratcheted up the tension for hours he basically used the same technique as dunkirk only dunkirk was 1h15m shorter and it was so much more effective in dunkirk,2023-08-17 21:10:03
i kind of get what youre saying and id have loved to feel that feeling and intensity in that scene but the implementation left me sort of feeling nothing i think thats why i had a problem with that scene also imo tatlocks character in the movie seemed very one dimensional even kitty for that matter we mostly just saw her  and angry and maybe thats why it couldnt have made me feel anything anyway,2023-08-17 17:24:53
the trailers kinda made it seem like it revolved around the bomb though and not oppenheimer himself the trailers dont show anything about anything that happens after the bombs been dropped only the buildup,2023-07-22 03:40:57
this is so much cope that i keep seeing repeated it could’ve been about both — focusing on oppenheimer made it boring vs what it could’ve been,2023-07-22 02:42:44
if i wanted to know about the political  match that went on 75 years ago i would wander down a wikipedia rabbit hole,2023-07-22 04:21:36
then the intended climax completely misses the mark  by the time the kangaroo court and his award year later you dont give a   this movie is average,2023-07-22 13:26:34
people seem to be missing this point,2023-07-22 04:15:43
what did you enjoy about the minute where matthew modine got interviewed in a conference room,2023-07-23 02:23:57
definitely a big criticism of his historically not exactly acing the bechdel test,2023-07-24 16:16:51
i had this breakthrough recently one day in therapy i just blurted out is my problem with women any movie directed by christopher nolan because yes women are involved but its really never about the women its about me,2023-07-31 09:42:48
you may be right but i didnt see it that way that quote was repeated several times in oppys head and played into his guilt i did think both  scenes were a bit unnecessary but hilarious at the same time,2023-07-24 16:04:10
i think youre reading some slight into it that wasnt there a big part of oppenheimers story was the way in which creation and destruction life and death was intrinsically and paradoxically linked introducing that quote and its impact on oppenheimer in that particular scene illustrates that link desire death life destruction all existing in a network of each other,2023-07-24 19:34:17
so eyes for the balls and balls for the eyes,2023-07-21 16:07:10
"thats really upsetting during the credits my friend commented that some words appeared to be out of focus and we theorized then that it couldve been the projectors fault all along


guess that wasnt the case i know bloopers and mistakes happen all the time but that amount of shots out of focus for this kind of film thats an oof",2023-07-21 18:31:37
"yeah 100 what i mean by editing is almost exclusively in regards to scenes where characters are talking to each other the way it was cut the constant back and forth some shots even lasted less than a second sometimes those scenes simply werent done in a visually interesting manner almost as if they all shot each actors scenes separately from all of the rest or something which i found really grating


even something as simple as keeping 23 actors within the frame and just slowly push the camera in wouldve been something i dont know


i can understand if on a conceptual basis you want to make it appear fast and snappy so the audience doesnt feel the 3h runtime but i have to be honest when i was seeing the film said editing in my eyes was hurting the actors performances


they are absolutely great throughout cillian murphy especiallyobviously but i really felt like the editing was holding everyone back when in certain sequences the camera shouldve stayed focus a little longer on their face reaction and so on


its a great film but it bothers me that something so basic yet important as the editing appears to have been neglected to such a degree",2023-07-21 18:30:11
"he orchestrated the entire smear campaign against oppenheimer to keep him from getting his q clearance renewed this is what the entire hearing was about if denied renewal oppenheimer would not be able to be a part of nuclear weapons regulations going forward

strauss sent the military guy to interrogate oppenheimer while the room was bugged he used the communist leaning friends in his life against him he made his questionable choices in his love life public etc

strauss also wanted to pursue the more destructive hydrogen bomb that oppenheimer didnt want to pursue oppenheimer wanted heavy regulations on nuclear weapons strauss wanted them for military might more political power and to further the military industrial complex

the whole dynamic is highlighted by the discussion between oppenheimer and einstein near the pond at the college strauss thinks that einstein and oppie are plotting against him and this is what eventually sets strauss over the edge and begins his campaign to destroy oppies life in reality its revealed they were discussing the calculations that would determine if a nuclear detonation would destroy the world this entire scene is shown multiple times to highlight the differences in motivations between oppenheimer and strauss  


the entire movie is revolving around the hearing regarding oppenheimers security clearance renewal that is truly the central point in the film not the bomb it focuses more on the future implications for the world after the detonation",2023-07-28 01:01:01
just so i understood that exchange oppenheimer is referring to the fact that developing the abomb has created a chain reaction in the meta sense of the world pushing to build larger and larger bombs and thus inevitably destroying itself,2023-07-31 13:28:51
i know it was likely nolan taking creative license because that scene played a central part of the anger that krauss drove him to be bitter of oppenheimer but i am curious how einstein would have reacted in real life,2023-07-31 13:30:48
"i didn’t like the movie i generally like nolan and am reasonably familiar with oppenheimer and the manhattan project i was really keen on watching it on imax and bought the recommended middle seats 

the movie was  blah it was pretentious self important and superficial other than acting and a few great shots the rest of the movie was mediocre the amount of importance given to strauss and the two hearings is an odd and jarring narrative choice especially when the subject matter was as heavy as the creation of the atomic bomb this was a mediocre movie and if i was watching it at home i wouldn’t have finished it we were at the theatre stuck in middle seats so we felt compelled to see it through there was also a glimmer of hope that watching it through may salvage the movie it didn’t",2023-08-07 05:18:13
for someone who hasnt seen the movie youre pretty spot on imo i saw it last night and thought about 40  50 of it couldve been cut,2023-07-21 17:46:08
"i think its a good movie if you you temper your expectations a bit it is not perfect it is unfortunately not only about the manhattan project which is its strongest part theres an hour devoted to what i think was irrelevant nonsense but some people apparently enjoyed


the parts i enjoyed were very good it was cool seeing the big loud parts on a big screen the rest of the film ismeh",2023-07-22 23:15:32
i felt the same too lot of the communist parts get unnecessary could have just focused on the bomb,2023-07-21 18:35:07
personally i don’t think so and won’t be recommending it to anyone i know in real life but with that being said a lot of people seem to really like this movie and i would hate for you to miss out on seeing a film you could potentially like in the cinema,2023-07-21 18:40:18
there is absolutely nothing about this movie outside of maybe 10 total minutes that warrants seeing it on a big screen 2 hours and 50 minutes of it is just white dudes in suits talking im dead serious,2023-07-21 23:33:56
you would genuinely miss out on nothing watching this on an old ipod video even theres 10 minutes of stunning footage visually in the whole thing and even then its not even amazing just squarely good,2023-07-21 23:32:38
"most of what works best in the movie should be seen on a big screen
def see it in theaters",2023-07-21 16:57:32
i stopped reading your comment halfway through for a snack break,2023-07-25 06:41:40
yea been thinking about this a lot  does loud intense music over conversations make the conversations better,2023-07-27 03:49:15
so basically we have to be ok with their relation not being explored at all not showing why they actually cared for each other then being shown that he is devastated by her dead although we only know that they hooked up once and she rejected him but not really and then we forget about her because her only purpose is to be one of the hundred examples of his martyr complex their relation sounds interesting and maybe it could have been developed and actually amount to something putting so much importance on their relation without actually telling us anything about it is just lazy writing,2023-07-26 23:01:50
or the power to save civilization if harnessed properly,2023-07-27 05:17:44
in its supreme pretentiousness emphasizing technique over soul every line from every character displaying presumed omniscience and making some supposed deepity there were no humans in this film just a phalanx of earnest judges,2023-07-27 14:06:24
"he was anything but soulless 



this movie was soulless and clinical it didn’t capture oppenheimer or the issues in any dramatic fashion i don’t need a 100 million dollar movie to provide a list of events",2023-07-27 18:05:30
it was too much about his womanizing i thought at times the only way it was really necessary to show was the first girl had ties to the communist party as did the current wife i didn’t find it necessary and thought her asking him to read scene was wildly out of place,2023-07-27 12:31:06
the only nudity required was the court scene and by that the previous scene is also needed to tie it in narratively i agree on the earlier scene though especially with the quote,2023-07-27 09:35:33

" yeah i dont get the hype around the imax 100mm thing for oppenheimer i mean yeah it looks crisp but it doesnt need the 8k resolution since the movie is mostly dialogue

i think it had a really interesting effect by using imax for court scenes and close ups it made the audience feel surrounded i felt like i had no escape no where to turn no where to go i felt suffocated by the screen a lot of the times especially the trial since the room is so small

you wouldnt get that same effect on a standard screen or at least to that effect",2023-08-03 15:56:37

i  picked up on this too it was tiring af every single scene in the entire movie was short fastpaced af dramatic music just exploding and oppenheimer running everywhere or short on breathe it felt like we didnt have a single scene longer than 5 minutes the movie was just really jumpy and it was really not that interesting to ride along with that for 3 hours,2023-07-26 16:33:48
its a movie about oppenheimer oppenheimer did not witness the bomb drop you get it the way he did anything else would be creatively dishonest,2023-07-30 06:46:22
the funny thing about einstein was they portrayed him as this washed up old mentor but really his physics today is what is still most relevant,2023-07-31 03:59:32
same here i was completely underwhelmed i think my expectations were too high from this movie ill be rewatching it in a few days but tbh im not looking forward to that 3 hour run time,2023-07-21 23:02:24
 youre not alone ive seen so many it was so chilling that it stayed with me and i couldnt forget it comments i was really confused but for me script is everythingthe movies scriptcompared to how tight nolans previous ones were is average to just good at best its not comparable to his greatest hits probably cause theres not much liberty he could take story or graphics wise he excels at that making original set pieces the speech scene here is a testament to that with everything else there wasnt much he could do since its basically just a lot of two and fro,2023-07-21 23:07:14
pretty much everything after oppenheimer gives his speech after the bombing felt like 30 minutes tacked on to the end of the movie they could have wrapped it up in 10 minutes and got the same message across,2023-07-22 02:22:01
strauss was a distraction and not a good addition,2023-07-22 02:37:25
i didn’t care for the political stuff at the end just seemed redundant,2023-07-22 01:53:05
i mean the movie was about oppenheimer and oppenheimer wasnt involved in the dropping of the bomb the fact that we dont see it is purposeful so you can resonate with oppenheimer in the fact that it was a thing he missed out and wasnt kept in the loop on,2023-07-23 11:00:11
yeahinstead we get cillian pacing around then hearing it from truman via radio felt like a cop out,2023-07-23 11:07:24
i wouldn’t have wanted to see that to be honest,2023-07-23 12:24:13
yeah i really wanted to see the bombing or at least the plane flying with it,2023-07-23 08:45:09
"what should i think the movie is going to be after watching that trailer and reading articles titled oppenheimer star emily blunt says nolans latest is a thriller disguised as a biopic

yes i expected it to be a thrilling movie about him building the atomic bomb not half a movie of dialogue in a room i also expected the story to be told in a cohesive way not jumping around 3 different timelines from scene to scene it was extremely misrepresented",2023-07-23 08:02:19
"for a guy who is or has been widely regarded as such a genius filmmaker this particular problem of having a complete lack of cohesion between scenes for half of a three hour movie seems incredibly amateurish

to be fair i kind of had the same impression of avatar 2 to be quite honest but a bunch of people seem to have loved that",2023-07-23 15:11:54
shred that dork,2023-07-23 16:47:13
lol it seems like the only way fans of this movie know how to defend it is by implying that people who werent into it were transformersmarvel fans,2023-07-23 16:48:12
nolan hasnt done a 10 movie since what inception and i really liked dunkirk but its not a 1010,2023-07-25 09:53:07
this genuinely looks like a copy pasta especially after how mid the movie was,2023-07-25 03:06:00
compared to the action movies of last decade excluding a few top gun maverick is a genuine 1010,2023-07-25 03:08:18
"what is this top gun maverick confirmation bias situation thing

i saw it recently at home and im not a top gun type of film fan at all and i found it a very good movie maybe not a 1010 but for sure 910 it knows what it wants to do and it nails it the only reason why i dont give it 1010 is because that movie is not trying to be a masterpiece compared to oppenheimer it is better in pretty much every single way i wished i had seen that in the theaters instead of having it watched at home and vice versa for oppie",2023-07-25 09:51:33
people are tired man,2023-07-27 12:44:09
nope this is a common complain with nolan movies he claims its intentional a lot of people myself included can find it annoying,2023-07-27 12:02:13
i dont really know if helpful is the right word there would be nothing lost if shes wearing clothing in the two previous scenes shes  in in general i dont think the relationship between the two is particularly well established since the film spends so little time between the two of them,2023-07-31 22:08:28
each to their own,2023-11-21 19:19:07
"one of the most important movies ever made a film about oppenheimer and his quest for security clearance

thats a stretch",2023-07-24 00:54:04
"i disagree but a lot of that has come from listening to 6 hours of the last podcast on the left deep dive on the manhatten project theyve been doing over the last month and a half leading up to it

the point of this movie is oppenheimer was a genius who was loyal to his country who was ostracized for his political beliefs disagreeing with the military industrial conmplex

lpol paints a picture more akin to yeah he wasnt a  spy thats   but he was amazingly high on himself a womanizer and spent years trying to debunk radiation poisoning both for national propaganda and the sake of his own conscience so i dunno  him probably

im also in the opinion that any movie about the atomic bomb that doesnt include accounts or details from hiroshima and nagaski is at best dishonest and at worst propaganda",2023-07-24 00:56:23
"is perfectly reasonable to compare one movie to another if its done by the same director saying that im tonedeaf is just more or less telling me that im right because youre being defensive and dont want me comparing the two

oppenheimer and the dark knight are both based off preexisting source materials both of which he adapted for film one was a graphic novel the other a piece of literature how the  is it tonedeaf to compare the two

i think youre just  because i think oppenheimer isnt a 1010 utter and complete masterpiece like others are saying its a good movie dont get me wrong but the soundstage overpowers the dialogue in several scenes the opening act moves at breakneck speed much to the detriment of setting up a foundation of characters other than  oppenheimer and much of the film relies on visual and audio grandiosity to entice its audience through the monotonous scenes of oppenheimer and his quest for security clearance

its a 710 at best",2023-07-24 01:27:48
theyre made by the same guy comparing them makes total sense,2023-07-24 01:31:19
don’t let him know titanic and terminator 2 were the same guy too,2023-07-24 03:17:03
acted maybe but written you cannot convince me with the dialog in the first quarter of the film,2023-07-24 03:17:22
"no it isnt memento the prestige the dark knight and dunkirk are all better films overall then this one is

its a very good film with quite good acting especially from rdj but the best nolan has offered us so far is still for the most part from his previous movies",2023-07-24 04:48:19
memento is peak nolan at his most artistic in my opinion the opening scene where hes shaking the polaroid picture only to have the photo decrease with exposure fade over time with that melancholic score man i knew i was in for a treat what a great  movie and it also did timeskips vastly better than oppenheimer,2023-07-24 01:37:24
i think the best moment hes put on film is the docking scene in interstellar  i just saw oppenheimer so ill need time to process it but its definitely an achievement  theres nothing as exciting in it as the highway chase in dark knight or the hotel fight in inception but its a different kind of movie  as a wwiimidcentury era biopic its incredibly kinetic and cinematic  the score and sound design alone are worth experiencing in a theater  compare it to theory of everything or the imitation game other movies about scientists of the time  i like both of those movies but they arent on the scale of oppenheimer,2023-07-24 01:45:26
maybe im schizophrenic but actually it felt like watching a really  mix between memento done very wrong and an even more boring version of the good sheppard,2023-11-24 15:06:47
"theres only so much you can show with the explosion

why",2023-07-25 03:11:27
its genuinely one of the most visually boring movies ive ever seen in my life,2023-07-21 23:30:00
because nolan is nowhere near finchers level he could make the phone book the most riveting experience,2023-07-26 08:29:31
losing the clearance is framed mostly as a superficial political stunt to help in the whole neutering his political power initiative from rdj and it wasn’t necessary to spend an hour just to tell me that politics is involved in science the whole movie bashes that over your head from the start,2023-08-03 11:09:42
"the movies have very different plots and themes this is true and the choice to make only light use of music in no country for old men was to make the movie feel more lifelike i agree there as well 

however the nuclear bomb was invented in real life too there is no orchestra when bombs go off it shouldn’t have been necessary for the director to scream “this is a high tension scene hear the violins” when the nuke is fired

i think we just have different tastes to a degree i have grown to detest the over reliance on music in movies it reveals the invisible hand of the director and breaks the illusion of immersion in the film for me now but to each his own",2023-08-04 10:17:35
i must say this did make me crave a movie that is a historical drama about the making of the bomb i’d love to see someone like ridley or spielberg do that i miss big historical movies done in a classical style,2023-08-04 11:19:08
"the thing i take issue with here is that the opposite stance on what oppenheimer and his scientists did was portrayed through the eyes of selfish egotistical politicians with an axe to grind which greatly delegitimizes their point of view and perhaps their point of view is indeed worthless and everyone should be fully in favor of what oppenheimer and his scientists achieved which is honestly a fair way to judge it but it becomes incredibly unfair when one side of this discussion is being pedaled by the worst kinds of people for the exact wrong reasons it was a way of making the audience think poor oppenheimer when it would have been more interesting to see him be pressured by people with unbiased reasons to be skeptical about the use of nuclear weapons and the development of them which should be treated as a completely valid point of view imo it really took away from the complexity of the issue by taking this angle

at the very least it sure wasnt worth an entire hour of the movie tacked on after the execution of the trinity test to explore this maybe a half hour tops",2023-08-03 12:05:41
i get that the movie is about oppenheimer and not just the bomb however it doesn’t matter the plot they chose to zoom in on for the last third of the movie wasn’t interesting to me it would be like if in the george foreman movie they chose to dedicate an hour talking about his life post boxing and on the grille talk about it sure not for an hour,2023-08-03 11:05:08
unfortunately this is what i fell for and was super let down luckily there is already a solid movie that filled my needs   man and little boy ,2023-08-04 12:53:32
those were literally what the movie was about those were the entire movie,2023-07-22 20:18:19
but the movie is about oppenheimer it’s not about the bomb,2023-07-22 21:34:59
absolutely i think i spent the last 45min just waiting for the word soup to end,2023-07-22 16:45:46
"of course i didnt mean that a lot of dialogue is bad my problem is that they way its presented makes it impossible to understand 

they wouldnt allow any beats between lines in most movies editors allow a brief moment of silence between lines so that you have time to process whats being said also the rhythm feels more natural because its the way we talk in real life

in oppenheimer it feels like the editor was on a quest to shave off as many tenths of seconds as possible so you end up with cuts just as the soundwave for the last word has ended its a 3 hour dialogue sprint it hurt my ears and my brain",2023-07-22 16:48:18
i dont care about expecting a particular technique or not what i expect is a coherent result the technique should be a tool to achieve a good result,2023-07-22 17:01:01
that style works very well when you are doing a high concept scifi action thriller when you are doing a very dialogue heavy character study it doesn’t work,2023-07-22 17:33:10
"saying that this is your favorite movie instantly makes you look smart in the eyes of everyone else who also says the same thing

liking complexity means being smart for a lot of people

nolan once made a movie through the editing with memento which can not exist without its editing in this movie he ruined everything with the editing for the sake of demonstrating his talent at complexity its just a waste",2023-07-22 16:44:41
"me spends 20 minutes writing the most detailed criticism that i can using technical terms and explaining my reasoning

you well actually people say its the best so youre wrong",2023-07-22 17:34:27
"too blunt im finnish thats how we are 

i liked the movie in case people wonder but not nolans best",2023-07-21 19:00:12
i felt so cheated i actually thought nolan was going to film miniature objects up close and splice it together with some nifty effects to give us a look at what the inside of an a bomb might be like during detonation but all i got was jason clark yelling and rdj undoing his tie about 80 times,2023-07-22 06:55:20
no no it wasn’t deceptive,2023-07-22 20:33:49
exactly the second half was just meetings about his communist affiliation  explain how that makes for interesting viewing  disappointing,2023-07-22 19:14:33
wait nevermind i clicked on the wrong thread i wanna talk about barbie,2023-07-23 06:43:41
its absurd to hype of seeing it in imax when a huge portion of the movie is dialogue in a room do you really need to see their faces for 2 hours on a 50 foot tall screen vs 30,2023-07-23 06:45:48
and at home you can put on subtitles and understand more of what the actors are saying,2023-07-23 18:39:46
wow you really needed that how tiny,2023-07-23 18:40:29
do you disagree more than half the movie is people talking in rooms the sound for imax was good but you can say that about most any movie’s sound standard vs imax,2023-07-23 06:49:38
above all else it shows the lack of control oppenheimer had after the test he was completely cut out from the process after the test was successful it was really effective,2023-07-21 04:03:21
seemed out of place for me he is said to be a womanizer but every other affair was implied his second wife and the blond  not shown,2023-07-22 05:09:04
similar sequence as in different timelines also,2023-07-22 05:02:02
and i loved imitation game this movie gave me the exact same vibe when i walked out of the theatre i think it was the idea i walked into the theatre with that made it seem off to me,2023-07-28 00:27:58
yes,2023-07-21 15:21:06
the point was that he was being rebuked by the very government he had helped usher into the atomic age he was using his position to try to positively influence the course of history and they shut him out its very insulting and amounts to professional assassination because you cannot work on these things without clearance,2023-07-21 14:55:26
"he loses his job if he loses the clearance can no longer work for the government in a similar capacity

i dont think it would matter for his financial prospects every university on the planet would put him as head of physics but it felt clear to me why it mattered",2023-07-21 15:07:52
oppenheimers ousting from the aec informs scientists opinions on working for and informing the govt on issues of policy to this day given that oppenheimer is the subject of the film and not just the manhattan project seems like a sound decision to me,2023-07-21 15:00:32
i shouldn’t have to read a wikipedia page to enjoy a movie i get that the movie was based on real events but i thought the story arc of his moral dilemma of building the bomb should have been the main focus i felt like the trial took away from that especially since it’s at the end for a solid 40 minutes,2023-07-21 15:50:54
it felt more about strauss than it did oppenheimer to me,2023-07-22 02:35:56
he killed that role the character was polite in the interviewinterrogation with oppenheimer but you could almost feel there was a menace behind it,2023-07-29 17:58:31
"the unfortunate thing is it really wasnt how it would look trinity was one of the most scientifically documented things in human history at the time it went off we have plenty of reference of how it and many later singlestage nuclear devices look when they went off and they really dont resemble what he did what he did was still great but it was one real lacking point in the film for me

the more artistic representational stuff was perfectly fine and did a good job of communicating feeling but because human brains are really good at pattern recognition it was super super obvious that the actual fire in the explosions they set off practically was a thousandth the size of the real trinity blast very much the opposite of the biggerthanreality fire that old supermarionation stuff like thunderbirds had

like it looked good and it served the point but for a movie that had been trying to limit its use of cg and enhancement it would have probably served the message better to go absolutely as hard as possible in recreating the most visually accurate explosion in that scene as well as the most visually accurate gore in the hallucination scenes as that would have looked better imo than latexmaskflapsinthewind and would have massively helped service the message of  better",2023-07-22 10:49:50
bruh check the actual test footage on yt it’s massive there nolan’s try felt more like a mythbusters boom,2023-07-22 09:10:07
i get that he was going for realism i was just saying as far as pure entertainment spectacle is concerned i was expecting something more like the opening shot of the movie when they first detonate it,2023-07-22 09:06:49
thanks yeah exactly he did a great job but his character was totally unnecessary that last part about it not being about himright so why was he in this movie,2023-07-22 21:00:03
oh i think they should still show oppie in europe and the aftermath right until his meeting with truman is very crucial to the movie of course the scene where he was wrestling with his own guilt while every one else was cheering was great i just think that the whole strauss ordeal just really drags the movie,2023-08-06 06:38:54
100 agree it was just loud and relentless 0 time for anything to settle in or focus on just a mad dash to get from one historical event to another i was exhausted by the end of it and didnt feel like i understood j robert oppenheimer as a person any more than i did at the start,2023-08-06 02:23:59
i actually appreciated the pacing in the first half i think it helped convey a sense of things just happening one after another with little pause for reflection which i think reflects oppenheimer’s involvement with the project if he had taken time to reflect he may have had second thoughts but he just kept going even after the original moral justification for his participation fighting the nazis became moot he was just kind of carried along by the flow of events which i think is a pretty realistic depiction of how people sometimes end up doing and being involved in things that they regret,2023-08-06 05:44:01
"to cover the significance of events that were portrayed the historical background the society at the time and the various physics chemistry and ideological concepts

but that wasnt the story youre asking for an entirely different kind of movie this was a story about the total destruction and ethical implications of creating this thing at all it wasnt meant to be a historical document about the science of the abomb",2023-08-06 11:58:41
going by that same logic the movie couldve ended shortly after the bomb dropped,2023-07-28 00:04:51
no need for insults if it is meant to be a biopic about oppenheimer  then you dont need an hour or so of runtime to center around rdjs character instead of oppenheimer couldve made a much better biopic by cutting most of that i maintain that this is a movie that tried to do multiple things at once instead of commiting to one thing and doing that well,2023-07-28 16:04:18
by same logic it should have been titled oppenheimer vs strauss the security clearance since thats pretty much what its all about i dont see it being a biopic about oppenheimer when a good chunk of the film focuses on this one other character instead,2023-07-28 17:21:44
who is oppenheimer without the bomb it should c murphy best actor  atomic b for best supporting actor but they missed the target,2023-07-27 23:34:57
the different parts of it simply dont work together as a whole thats why i suggested ways in which it couldve worked,2023-07-28 00:09:04
"yeah people still acting like downvotes are an attack on your persona instead of a simple i dont like your comment 

just say what you have to say and be done with it or dont and keep it to yourself",2023-08-26 00:14:15
"how can they be similar there wasnt even a mushroom cloud in the movie it was just an mediocre explosion shown for 5 seconds so the viewer couldnt see the flaws

the small explosion is due to the no cgi attitude however the graphics are so realistic these days that nolan could easily spend a bit more money to make it look even more realistic",2023-07-26 00:25:04
"

this is nothing like whats in the film",2023-07-25 22:18:46
the explosion was terribly underwhelming honestly can’t see this movie losing impact on audiences by just waiting for streaming,2023-08-11 03:18:35
3 down votes on my comment  are oppenheimer bots running this thread,2023-07-28 05:05:36
yeah the first 15 minutes was made of scene after scene with like two lines of dialogue each it didnt feel like there was any cohesion just the result of editing things down to the bone to get the story going,2023-07-21 11:07:47
i’m saying that the way that that accurate quote is interspersed in the middle of the real climax the bomb is cliche it’s felt like morbius saying it’s morbing time unironically not to mention the other time he says it while florence pugh starts riding him is that historical fact too or just fan service florence’s character irl was tracked by the fbi for years because of her connection to oppenheimer phone tapped followed house was bugged hoover was one of the first ppl to know of her death bc of this this is a very important detail because it directly leads to oppenheimer having his q clearance revoked  being blackballed bc mccarthyism in the climax of the movie but this isn’t mentioned foreshadowed nothing imo this film j feels like an excuse to make a big bomb bc there’s barely any connection between act 1 2  3,2023-07-21 20:24:41
while it wasn’t an issue for me last night i wouldn’t have minded a roadshow version with an intermission,2023-07-23 17:43:50
i wouldnt quite say that l he does make good movies,2023-07-24 05:17:20
which is exactly the point i feel like people are  to seeing big action set pieces in these big budget movies and oppenheimer is such a change of pace after all the superhero garbage  that not having big moments like these are now a bad thing for the movie lol,2023-07-21 21:02:06
no exactly why didn’t they show any footage of japan,2023-07-21 20:02:07
thank you i can see why people will be impressed with this but it just didnt scratch the manhattan projectoppenheimer itch ive had for years,2023-07-22 00:05:41
i think the scale coulda been shown better to if we got a good physical look at where everyone was in relation to the bomb sure we know how far they were on the map but doing something like a tophigh angle view of the bombs distance to everyone else woulda done wonders in going oh theyre really really far,2023-07-25 08:55:52
"this is the sort of pretentiousness i think op was talking about

i’ve read two books about the manhattan project one of which was more about the dropping of the bomb itself and one of which was much more heavily focused on oppenheimer i have two degrees in mathematics and understand the physics as well as anyone who isn’t actually a nuclear physicist i do not need context to understand this film

i also thought that it was bloated slow and was not at all the movie that was advertised half of it took place in the 50s and was centered around a security clearance meeting that i just couldn’t care about",2023-07-25 11:13:15
strauss was already the chair of the aec he was going for a higher cabinet position in eisenhowers administration as secretary of commerce,2023-07-26 01:31:51
yeah but think of how unsubtle seeing thousands of japanese being vaporized would be that was the reality if the movie is about judging his character isnt that the key point,2023-08-20 23:22:24
i loved the shockwave the boom was powerful can only imagine what it felt like in person but yea overall just underwhelmed sadly,2023-08-19 17:47:49
conspicuously leaving out the suffering of the victims to get you to sympathize with the villain,2023-08-20 23:51:42
its another thing to see it dramatized on screen which nolan had no appetite for because hes obsessed with his first person narrative,2023-08-20 21:03:53
obnoxious fans and crowds my heart goes out to all theater employees working this weekend,2023-07-21 10:42:38
it could could have been a lot more deep on the ethical and moral aspect of the use of nuclear weapons instead of a nonstop political drama with fast paced dialogues for me its a 310,2023-07-21 11:19:11
yes,2023-07-21 11:27:41
exactly did people not read the book the movie is based on its not the movies fault that people lack knowledge about the subject matter,2023-07-21 11:18:23
as someone nonwestern putside of american history almost everything except the los alamos and the actual bomb to the point that i still dont know what the role of rdj was,2023-07-21 10:56:57
"im thinking because it was mini imax the theatre tried to compensate with turning up the volume 
ill rent it when it comes out so i can enjoy it properly",2023-08-11 04:19:32
i’m pretty sure his grandmother has seen  before too,2023-07-21 14:14:58
"oppenheimer i am become death destroyer of worlds

also oppenheimer boo hoo i done an affair pwease fogive me i am so ashamed

like really who gives a  that he had an affair i guess obviously his wife did but they they completely discard that plot line it was only brought a few times at random for shock value and in attempt to make you against oppie",2023-07-25 08:33:28
hes trying too hard to be kubrick when he has the sensibilities of michael bay,2023-07-22 00:53:12
yes your point is tons of movies do similar things,2023-07-22 18:27:05
"its not to show time jumps its to show strauss perspective

and colors for oppenheimer perspective",2023-07-22 18:33:58
yeah i tried to phrase it as palatably as i could but cest la vie,2023-07-26 03:17:15
"first off women physicists existed and participated in the making of the bomb 

that said i never said i expected them to take up 50 of screentime but i did hope that if there were going to be women portrayed they might have a little more substance than fantasy  object and nagging wife

ill also reinforce my original points that this is a trend for nolan and not all of his movies are historical",2023-07-26 05:34:57
"they didnt mean that at all and you know it its just really noticeable that the women in this film barely have any substance 

take jean for an instance oppenheimer apparently loved her a lot but what do we learn about her other than that she looks good  and seems mentally unstable 

kittys backbone and integrity imo only comes through due to emily blunt acting her  off 

nolan gave us a few tiny crumbs hinting that theres more to these women but crumbs arent character development",2023-07-26 10:54:41
"fair enough women arent a monolith and i dont expect every woman to agree with me 

imo emily blunt was only on screen to nag and florence pugh only existed to be his tragic pixie dream girl and fulfilled largely the same role women have in a lot of nolans films i wouldnt see it as such an issue if it wasnt a trend in his movies now like i said i just dont think his work is for me anymore",2023-07-26 03:16:01
"of course i understood the film it was a very simple film i just did not like the choices the screenplay made the film “talks” about politics but is not political no main character in the film is really a political figure oppenheimer himself seems political in some scenes but acts completely apolitical in others so he seemed like he was political until the room requires him not to be he seems to be upset about hiroshima until he’s not

so he seemed to be an ordinary phsicist who did not have any strong opinions about making the bomb one way or another that’s what makes him uninteresting",2023-07-26 16:56:22
as someone in the field to this day physicists still blame strauss for what happened to oppenheimer,2023-07-22 08:04:25
the bongo guy that was my guess,2023-07-24 07:19:15
"this is what imitation game could have been

a 3 hour waste of time",2023-07-23 18:07:53
what does “mid” mean is this gen z speak,2023-07-24 12:41:39
" oppenheimer is the one that seems incapable and unwilling to shoulder up and really fight against his opposition 

my take on oppies unwillingness to fight back against strauss and aec inquisition is this he thought that the entire ordeal was the necessary penance the suffering he would need to go through to receive absolution for the sin of unleashing nuclear weapons upon the world when kitty tells him you really think by letting them tar and feather you that they would forgive you  oppie was seeking forgiveness but not from strauss and his aec lackeys he was looking for it from the rest of us from future generations

its an ironically catholic interpretation given he was a secular jew but not covered in the film oppenheimer also did say at a postwar lecture that physicists have known sin as a result of the creation of the abomb",2023-07-25 02:07:37
oo i love that take from this scene i can see how that would be presented too especially with the close up screen time they gave her the slow zoom or pan cant remember and the music beginning to rumble made me think that the film was building to something and i interpreted it differently thanks for this ,2023-07-24 23:19:29
hahahaha thank you for this comment,2023-08-05 13:37:16
i think they copied a bullet from their barbie review accidentally,2023-07-22 05:01:36
leo apparently is great in his next movie,2023-07-21 16:12:38
i think i could make out a yellow chevy symbol on the car which is a logo they’ve only used since 2002 unfortunately i couldn’t pause the movie to verify that though,2023-07-22 06:08:23
so so agree i sat most of that 3 hours with my jaw agape thinking youve got to be kidding why would anyone build a movie like this just the strangest dialogs and back and forth close ups of actors speaking back and forth back and forth and the whole time loud mood music not just some times the whole movie,2023-07-21 13:51:32
definitely made sense at the end but throughout the movie i was trying to solve the puzzle and it took away from movie i felt like those kind of back and forth time plots work better with psychological thrillers over biodocs i’ll have to watch the movie again knowing the time jumps and hopefully i enjoy it more,2023-07-22 00:13:52
as a citizen of earth you should know to not reply like a  for no reason it seems to be a problem with your education,2023-07-21 15:48:15
my bad should have focused on physics over medicine and biology can you give me a detailed run down on the discovery and recreation of penicillin with the chemical formulas and how specifically they work pretty important part of history that i’m expecting you to know in detail,2023-07-21 15:57:49
hard disagree  movies need to set up characters for their audience,2023-07-21 15:47:16
it seems you were not educated on politeness,2023-07-21 15:48:02
not everyone is into physicshistory ¯⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠¯ and its not like the characters were playing themselves the actors were recognisable not everyone will know all the historical figures,2023-07-21 15:45:05
whoa thats a little harsh,2023-07-21 15:41:05
i should have known who very specific scientific people were and what all their rolls were ok mate,2023-07-21 15:43:37
it’s a movie about part of his life dude,2023-07-21 19:16:48
lol a topless man and a topless woman isnt the same and you know it,2023-07-21 22:31:56
i just think it was strange that you didnt get to actually see it the blast itself didnt look like a nuclear explosion either just a bad gas leak pretty much,2023-07-22 10:49:41
what the end wasnt the worst,2023-07-22 15:25:07
at first i was confused why they didn’t show either hiroshima or nagasaki we get oppenheimer’s terrible visions of destruction during his speech after only hearing truman on the radio but if you think about it oppenheimer wouldn’t have needed to see any footage of the bombings he made the bombs he already knew the second he heard about it the level of destruction it caused,2023-08-03 02:37:09
that john f kennedy drop was so  it felt like they really wanted that to be a jaw dropping scene kennedy had nothing to do with anything literally just wanted to throw a big name in there really unnecessary,2023-08-02 23:24:02
it’s also not a part of the movie but when kennedy later became president he kept those involved in  over oppenheimer out of government positions,2023-08-14 00:29:46
"i expected a biopic and really enjoyed the first 23 it’s just that the last 13 changed pacing and narrative style and the endingpayoff didn’t work to justify the chaotic editing

i think it could have been done in 25 hours or so 3 was just excessive

i’m really torn because i think everyone’s performances were basically perfect and the direction was great incredible cinematography it was just the editing that really  it up for me the fake suspense about whether he’s get clearance felt so forced obviously he wasn’t going to get clearance they spent so much time saying everyone didn’t trust his communist ties",2023-07-21 13:49:28
"it was not even a little incoherent its quite easy to follow nor is it a puzzle

the structure is rather ingenious in how it allows nolan to cover a huge expanse of time without falling into normal biopic drudgery and also allows key characters to be present throughout the film rather than being isolated in certain segments it reminds me a lot of what gerwig did with little women actually",2023-07-21 17:36:38
i was discussing this with my brother biopics really don’t have to cover the central characters whole life for instance we don’t ever see his childhood the film covers the book beat for beat which makes the movie feel so much longer,2023-07-23 22:42:52
its a film begging to be a miniseries,2023-07-24 06:28:10
"its a shame that a lotta people here are parrotingthat sentiment too   


oh well the movies called oppenheimer not the manhattan project chump  
and im just like  
almost all of the marketing is about seeing the test bomb on screen the trailers try to lead up to that scene the posters are pretty much oppie standing in flames itd be fair if people thought that part was underwhelming i personally thought it was weaker part of the film with how well the sound design banged your ears 2 hours before it everything from the start of the countdown masterful the build up 1010 the actual drop ehhhhh  


its not much different with the criticism that doctor strange 2 had where the multiverse of madness really only has like one 15 second sequence of going through different universes even when they do go into a different universe oops red is go green is stop or the latest mis big wahoo bike off a cliff stunt not being nearly as cool as it should have been in the final product",2023-07-25 16:02:21
"i understand that but it lost my attention after the bomb test just way too much sitting in a room talking for me to hold my attention with zero action outside of the test and no i’m not a marvel fanboy that needs explosions to find a movie good just maybe expected more explosions in a movie about the atomic bomb creator

i thought for sure they’d show some nagasaki or hiroshima action or aftermath but instead we got a ‘trial’ or whatever that was for an hour straight",2023-07-25 14:47:57
theres no such thing as the manhatten project the film is boring and super disappointing i have waited for three years for the new nolan movie and we got this thing memento tenet interstellar and inception are my favourite movies ever lets wait for the next one i guess,2023-07-25 17:52:10
"i was literally in shock when they got to the bombings and it became clear they weren’t gonna show anything from the actual blast sites i assumed it was gonna be the climax of the movie and they didn’t even show anything at all from either bomb site yes it’s horrific and that’s the  point of the film

once they brushed past that and expected me to care about them arguing in a conference room for another hour i was throughly checked out looking at my watch

and yeah florence is super hot but…literally zero reason she had to be  at all much less for half of her scenes ",2023-07-25 17:07:01
dr oppenheimer its not a court ,2023-07-23 01:59:10
except we do see the horror sure we don’t see a field of bloody incinerated corpses but we do see what oppenheimer can only imagined happened to the bombing victims such as the woman’s face who peeled off or the ashen corpse that oppenheimer stepped on,2023-07-22 13:01:02
i dunno i thought postbomb stuff in the film was riveting,2023-07-22 15:38:22
you expected it but your expectations cant change the fact that oppenheimer didnt actually see it focus is on him not effects of atomic bomb the limited effect it had on oppenheimer is what can be seen in the movie once again like the movies of our time you want message to be hammered home whereas its just not that kind of a movie,2023-07-22 15:28:45
"did we watch the same movie i was sitting in the theater having already seen footage of the actual trinity test thinking about how underwhelming it was compared to footage of the real thing

edit dude actually blocked me for this comment holy moly ",2023-07-25 14:43:38
"yes i have and it is far far more grand and exciting than the film and with the way that it was being hyped up i was expecting a lot more in fact my friends who i watched the film with who enjoyed the movie very much also had the same complaints about the explosion

and what do you mean by these dumb nitpicks i’m not looking to pick apart films in order to dislike them i went in to this film being a fan of christopher nolan and excited to watch it thinking that i would enjoy it however i found it like it said boring and pretentious i don’t think my issues with the film are the result of nitpicks i think they are genuine criticism

 your comment is almost as pretentious as the film",2023-07-25 12:42:48
honestly no it’s mainly faces and tables and boardrooms it looks crisp and the cinematography is fine there is one explosion and a bunch of abstract shots of something that looks like stars and vortexes  it’s fine but i honestly could’ve watched it at home it reminded me of a few good men or jfk  basically unremarkable lacking spectacle and just felt a bit weird being so big,2023-07-21 15:08:47
"we spend a long time in small rooms and watching people testifying or having discussions around tables

the cinematography is very good but no need for imax here except for a few scenes which you might guess what they are",2023-07-21 15:12:28
it impacts cinema in general if budgets continue to increase and they don’t make their money back,2023-07-21 15:15:06
"no he didnt oppenheimer received the atomic energy commissions fermi prize just a few years after strausss failed confirmation hearing in the very city you claim he was exiled out of

strauss at worst contributed to oppenheimers security clearance not being renewed thats it",2023-07-23 01:19:36
"im not saying there shouldnt have been a bomb  showing the trinity  relevant 

showing the japan bombings is not and thats what ive seen some people getting weirdly irked about",2023-07-22 20:35:05
congratulations on not being able to read and understand the effing title of the movie,2023-07-22 20:23:16
" in a movie about bombs

wow thank you for proving my point

this is not a movie about bombs this is a movie about oppenheimer there is a difference",2023-07-22 19:53:57
yeah it’s not a movie about bombs some people seem to think this was an action film or something it’s a biopic about a physicist,2023-07-22 20:04:08
nolan has never passed the bechdel test was mostly joking on his behalf  i do feel like a nolan and gerwig film releasing on the same day is pretty ironic however especially considering nolan’s public distaste for barbie,2023-07-23 15:10:51
"the part of the movie i’m describing was only an hour and fifteen of the actual movie we got a lot of relationship stuff and courtroom politics that added a lot of fluff i wanted a movie about oppenheimer not a rushed biopic

edit i read your comment thinking i had made an error on my part i’m not explaining myself thoroughly i reread my comment and it turns out a paragraph below of what you quoted i explained further in depth of what i meant",2023-07-23 07:50:48
right the movie hes describing is essentially the movie we got the entire final act is about oppenheimer coming to terms with the moral ramifications of what he did the final scene is about that,2023-07-23 07:40:04
oppenheimer isn’t famous because he had  with a communist woman whilst married he’s famous because he managed the team that created the new era of weaponry the first of its kind that could destroy the world that’s the movie i wanted to see not the melodrama and rushed dialogue of trying to explain mccarthyism in 1950s america,2023-07-23 07:55:10
this has been annoying me so much haha why are people annoyed at a film called oppenheimer and it shockingly being about oppenheimers life lol,2023-07-23 12:25:49
i wish we got a longer scene involving which cities they would bomb including the bit about how on two separate occasions a city was saved from the bombs because of cloudy weather that’s the dialogue and conflict i wanted,2023-07-23 15:23:38
that’s how i felt it’s a great biopic but doesn’t have that extra edge that nolan brings in that makes his movies unique,2023-07-23 12:42:01
it’s not and neither is reddit adding a real world experience of someone i know who is only watching it cause of the attention,2023-07-23 20:15:12
i also enjoyed barbie more,2023-07-24 03:52:32
that’s wild,2023-07-23 20:39:28
yeah the colorbw was super confusing because its usually used to denote time period differences but in this in was oppies perspective vs stausss perspective,2023-08-01 00:42:17
but strauss asks oppenheimer why he hadnt involved einstein in the manhattan project that alone should suggest when it took place,2023-08-01 03:32:12
same for me,2023-08-01 00:07:19
"i expected more focus on physics and science

and less focus on 

the trials and hearings took like half the movie it just felt dragged

dont get me wrong its not like i didnt like the movie i  loved it i just expected a little more in some aspects

the scene with florence pugh grinding the guy while he read the bhagavad gita felt so unnecessary and cheap it was a huge netflix vibe 

her  him in front of like eight men was just dude 

movies like interstelar contact imitation game etc had this kind of focus

but its just personal opinion thats all",2023-08-10 00:30:39
im not the one who posted this comment but from context i would say he probably found it offensive that this movie which was marketed just as heavily as being about the creation of the atomic bomb as about oppenheimer himself chose to not explore its role in the wholesale killing of whole populations of people but instead focused on mccarthy era communist witch hunts implying that that is somehow more important than oppenheimers role in the death of innocents his comment also could be read to suggest that the oscar bait tactic of having so many big names to play such small roles could have cheapened the impact of the real story but again i didnt write the initial comment so these are just guesses,2023-08-27 15:09:20
watch the test footage it looks more powerful than what we saw in oppenheimer honestly a letdown,2023-07-22 06:13:12
well yes but i just feel that as a consumer of a product 20 seconds of a bomb is a little bit too little seeing as they basically marketed the whole movie as were working on a topsecret project of building a bomb and the bomb is shown for about 20 seconds i do understand that the movie was intended to be a biopic of oppenheimers life but going into the movie i was under the impression that it would just be about making the bomb,2023-07-22 15:31:20
it should if you want audiences to pay for imax tickets,2023-07-23 01:39:42
i agree and disagree every scene felt essential to the bigger picture but i did feel as though the pacing toward the last third of the film was too slow,2023-07-22 08:05:54
" i rolled my eyes when rdj turned out to have some vendetta against oppenheimer like why was this reveal needed

because thats how it actually happened in real life",2023-07-22 12:23:24
"100 

i can’t remember the last time i walked out of a movie if ever but when i look at my watch and there was almost 90mins left i couldn’t cope 

and i don’t know how to describe this but as a nonamerican i feel like it was a very american movie i get it was a world war but american stories of any war they’re involved in kind of make me roll my eyes slightly",2023-07-22 08:52:06
read the biography you nunce,2023-07-22 10:33:52
while i understand why not i think a parallel from the happy screams and reactions of the americans with the terrified death of the japanese youre kinda removed from the actual victims and while it is realistic it undermines the damage actually done,2023-07-22 12:42:16
"and how quickly they took it 

the test worked boom they’re gone loaded up on trucks",2023-07-24 06:46:12
"oh no 

is it like eardrum shattering loud especially for very harsh sounds like explosives is it also unexpected at any instance like an out and out horror film

i know all this sounds so ridiculous to ask but im as excited and yet scared to watch it",2023-07-21 07:27:13
solid point,2023-07-22 16:54:46
"yeah the sound is fine and i can see fine its just blurry and i cant really read text far well and things on the side is much harder for me to see clearly

i know an imax screen is huge so i am just afraid things on the edges may be tough to see without me turning my head and that sound like a nightmare if i have to look around to see stuff",2023-07-23 03:42:48
thank you,2023-07-23 17:25:30
yeah read this one they were many speculations about the discussions they had inside that room one was like truman said to his secretary that i dont wanna see that son of a  again,2023-07-26 05:16:07
so i thought the color vs black and white depicted timeframe at first too but theres a couple scenes of strauss in color i was confused by this so i looked it up and its supposed to differentiate objective reality black and white vs oppenheimers perspective in color,2023-07-31 15:49:36
the  scene in the hearing made perfect sense to me he was facing consequences for going to meet his communist mistress both personal in regards to his relationship with his wife and for his career in the hearing showing how even a man with all this knowledge who built this insane bomb still has flaws and weaknesses which points to the whole thing about giving a weapon with this much power to these flawed human beings,2023-07-30 15:46:34
florence pugh was seemingly just in the movie to be topless,2023-07-23 23:05:19
"oppenheimer is a story based around real life

just putting that out there to get you out of the confusion

character development ",2023-08-03 02:09:40
didnt you felt that trinity scene was underwhelming the sound of feets tapping was louder than that pissfart of a gasoline bomb nolan made it was like a car blowing off,2023-07-23 05:00:28
"you focus on the most important parts of the person’s life though

they could’ve spent a lot less time on the communism stuff pre los alamos or made it better he’s a communist but it felt like it was never really explained why and was just the actor saying “i am a communist” into the camera

could’ve spent more time on los alamos and upped the tension it felt very languid and low stakes somehow most of the famous physicists felt underutilized einstein looked like a homeless person like some kind of caricature i didn’t even realize that quaid played feynman until after the movie  what an astronomical waste feynman plays the bongos

bomb’s explosion could’ve been the climax with the resolution being mostly the same without the trial having another act with lower stakes felt really weird keep the sad falling action a la the irishman and save a ton of runtime this also allows you to cut out a lot of the communism content

idk exactly what it needed but it had too much squandered potential",2023-07-22 15:51:12
i didn’t understand why they filled up the glorified extra roles with legit working actors who have a decadeplus in the industry peck quaid thirlby etc all had roles that either should’ve been at least somewhat larger or simply been some noname’s first “real” part,2023-07-23 06:10:27
i personally am not a big fan of nolans work so that might play into my perception here,2023-07-21 14:38:07
i think how hard ledger nailed the joker is biasing you to tdk a bit,2023-07-21 15:09:03
i agree it was good but not that good,2023-07-21 15:12:54
japan bad america good,2023-07-26 22:09:51
bit of a poor example as 12 angry men intends itself to feel long at a certain point  that film is half the run time of oppenheimer,2023-11-17 13:41:47
personally thought the los alamos line and the i am become death line were heavy handed corny imo,2023-07-31 21:58:29
but was the science really there  it felt like a side car  there were no challenges to overcome no discoveries no drama around the science except maybe seeing bomb go boom,2023-07-31 15:51:06
"im not trying to tear it down its a movie made by one of our contemporary masters and certainly a sincere film just not worth the massive praise its getting imo if this wasnt a nolan film as heavily marketed as it was it wouldnt be the phenomenon it is today

its great that nolan can on his name only trick general audiences into seeing a dry and demanding drama like this but i cant help but smile while browsing yt and seeing all these critics who mainly review  suddenly entranced by oppenheimer its like hey where are your pta reviews your almodovar reviews terrence malick haneke reviews or does a director need to make a superhero movie to get your attention 

oppenheimer is a proper introduction to cinema for many younger movie bros who never ventured this far before into movies where the only effects are lighting framing editing and acting nolan took them by the hand and told them look  theres an ocean of movies for you to fall in love with sadly i think many of them wont explore further and think this is it

its very reminiscent of the joker movie phenomenon when people called it a masterpiece when it was just a good drama with an insanely popular character and people went on to wait for the next superhero film instead of watching the classics its inspired from like network or taxi driver",2023-08-23 10:35:26
it was completely unnecessary as you can already see it in her face and even if that wasnt enough she explicitly tells him how she feels in the very next scene,2023-09-25 22:42:26
or maybe even how oppenheimer imagined it just have been for kitty to hear all that being spoken into public record,2023-08-31 13:56:48
" mostly political discussions

in a biopic about a man involved in political discussions shocking",2023-09-06 01:35:14
look at us cleverest boys in the room,2023-07-21 11:41:48
does he wave his arms in oppenheimers face as hes trying to watch his work,2023-07-21 12:53:19
 it was really that simple ,2023-07-21 18:23:41
"nolan said it wasnt due to timelines but that color scenes were meant to be subjective first person experiences while the black and white scenes were objective

afair there are no hallucination scenes in the black and white sections",2023-07-25 11:48:03
"you will hate this movie if youre a blithering idiot

i for one thought it was perfect 1010",2023-07-21 20:56:11
definitely as the only party with good intentions throughout the war,2023-08-28 19:06:05
even japan themselves recognized the necessity in what happened,2023-09-13 19:50:20
"you are accepting american propaganda if you believe the nuke was the only way to end the war the soviets declaring war on japan and invading manchuria would have been more than enough on its own as the deaths of civilians meant basically nothing to the japanese government at the time japanese leadership had also been discussing surrender for months prior to the bombings

instead the us committed a war crime then lied about its necessity to convince people they were justified in doing it",2023-10-16 16:07:13
what i didnt like was the fact that he seemed like an interesting antagonist and is built up as such only to be discarded as quickly as hes introduced,2023-07-24 01:57:08
seriously what were his last words,2023-07-21 20:07:59
"well yeah obviously i know what a biopic is but you still have so much creative control over what you focus on and how you depict it and i was really surprised how much the voice of the movie condemned him for it

also it was based on a biography not an autobiography which i feel like is a pretty important distinction",2023-07-23 17:23:50
thank you,2023-07-23 06:33:34
"i have the right to view things the way i view them however i didn’t say they were monsters but they knew what they were doing i’d rather the film show them owning up the that fact and not have them play both sides  

plus even though i think the scene tried to humanize the abomb building scientist more the woman leading the discussion made a good point  was dead there was no need by the military’s standards for the bombs urgency or to drop it they mainly did it to show russia what they could do",2023-07-21 13:44:34
i can respect that take but i’m no more interested then i was before in the man the movie was titled after having now seen the movie,2023-07-21 20:19:43
"maybe but the character was too underdeveloped for me to care to need to know the answer 

i am not spending all day today having seen the movie last night on a quest to learn about robert oppenheimer so i can answer that question for myself 

i am sifting through comments to find the realists who aren’t caught up in the hype",2023-07-21 16:30:54
there was a time when i was a lot more into the dark knight and inception but i think my preference in movies has kinda gotten away from his style a bit dont get me wrong i dont really think any of his movies are bad at all i can still watch memento and the prestige on repeat without any complaints though not the case for the rest,2023-07-21 20:30:37
the detonation felt like a wet  they couldve shown the tower being vaporised the sand turning into glass but noits a fire all and you dont even get the scale of it cause its dark and once the fire is out you dont see the mushroom cloud anymore which may be realistic but he couldve taken some liberty with the lighting or shown a shot of the mushroom cloud at dawn with someone picking up a trinitite,2023-07-22 15:42:27
"anne hathaway and jessica chastain were great in interstellar

he does have this problem in his recent movies though",2023-07-23 07:54:10
"no need to be passiveaggressive here i didnt have a good grasp of the content due to how fastpaced it was but i question why he would include that conflict within the movie unless its a crucial part of the story

there are plenty of movies without  scenes depicting  i dont see why there should be a shot where oppenheimer read that famous line while the opposing actress is ",2023-07-23 23:51:05
"you shouldnt sit there for three hours just to watch one firework

"yeah the polarized opinions are interesting on this one i havent seen tenet because i read so many negatives about it plus the premise didnt seem that interesting but i definitely think its my least favorite of his films

i didnt even mind the dialogue heavy scenes but as usual there are parts where its hard to grasp what is being saidplus the first hour of the film is just too frenetic jumping from one scene to another felt like a bunch of trailers about his early life instead of a movie 

didnt find the nonlinear storytelling a positive with this one either i think if they had a less talented actor than cillian murphy as the lead this would be so uninteresting he was really really good and kept me engagedbut otherwise it felt like a disjointed oddly put together movie

the fact he says the i am become destroyer of worlds line while having  just automatically disqualifies this as being talked about as the best of anything the score was also unbearable at timessomeone should tell nolan we dont need music blaring to realize this is a heavyconsequential scene you can build up that tension more organically

edit oh and the jfk line just made me laugh so muchthe fact it was rdj involved in the scene  the way its said reminded me too much of marvels character introductions are we getting a cold war cinematic universe",2023-08-04 15:11:30
"its easily one of his best along with tenet

x200b

to me his top three are inception tenet oppenheimer the batman movies are fine but a little overrated",2023-08-04 16:41:10
that’s fine but i’m just warning you 95 of the general public seeing this movie only cares about the bomb and it’s creation objectively the strauss relationship was not well explained and my girlfriend and i who both hold multiple college degrees and paid close attention we couldn’t really tell what the conflict was the last hour of the movie like who cares oppenheimer had his security clearance revoked he already made the bomb and why is strauss so mad egos hbomb development,2023-07-21 20:32:47
yes i completely agree with you you explained it much better than i could ,2023-07-24 12:22:02
i wanted literally any of this,2023-07-25 07:47:30
yet they tried to portray it they just did it wrong very wrong that explosion was complete joke,2023-07-25 07:48:11
"the build up to the detonation was fantastic but my only grief with the film was the actual bomb detonation 

the bomb should engulf you its 20000 tonnes of tnt exploding with a mushroom cloud with an height of 10000 metres 

an atom bomb is about scale the sheer size of the detonation except nolan showed everything in closeups 

it felt like a decent size bomb going off not an atom bomb",2023-07-25 12:19:47
they specifically said you learned to speak it well enough to give a lecture in it like that requires at least passable pronunciation but the problem wasnt even the pronunciation the problem was that none of it was recognizable as dutch in any capacity,2023-07-25 16:19:03
"its not as much about whether the scene works well with it but its more about whether having the nudity in the scene adds anything both of the real life pugh scenes basically accomplish nothing by having explicit nudity and could easily have been shot without it and accomplished the same thing narratively

the scene that did need to be shot the way it was but ironically without explicit nudity was the vision scene in the hearing where while oppenheimers affair is being discussed kitty sees pugh and robert  in the chair you would definitely lose something in the portrayal of the movie if you change or make that scene less explicit",2023-07-25 19:21:04
appreciate the different perspective it still didnt work for me but i think i get what nolan was going for now,2023-07-25 16:39:07
im sure you both know already but the apple poisoning was something oppenheimer confirmed happening so id think this was nolans best guess as to why he did it i took his emotions as angst about not being as successful as everybody else in the class especially with how much he prided himself on being an intelligent scientist,2023-07-25 18:06:27
yup and yet unions and unionizing is communism and they love their unions but also don’’s so dumb and also the red scare is such a joke to me i’m 30,2023-07-25 20:47:11
"you see that beautiful sun at 030 seconds thats what i wanted to see first the first milliseconds of a nuke that ball of might

 on another note i think we should ask ourselves why we want to go see a film thats about the danger of nuclear weapons while wanting to be entertained by a nuclear explosion

i wanted to be in awe horrified in a good way you know like the feeling of going this is the power of the sun in the hands of mere mortals",2023-07-28 01:30:35
chernobyl did it great seeing the burning reactor was beautiful in a horrifying way,2023-07-28 02:13:50
"i like the phrase dont make it realistic make it believable

nolan instead chose an uncanny valley of neither i just dont buy his explosion its a bunch of tnt detonated in the middle of the desert and it painfully looks as such theres just so much wrong in this

a nuclear explosion that close to the first bunker oppie only had a view of the tower of debri not the mushroom cloud thats one of the key aspects of a nuke being so overwhelming in its show of force the mushroom cloud would have been like a sun standing over oppenheimers bunker if youve ever seen that test footage of the nuke tested close to soldiers in trenches you would get an idea of the sheer might and scale of this horror

instead this feels like somebody trying to explain to me the power of an artillery shell with a firecracker

you make a good point that nobody yet has really nailed it well of all people i think nolan and his budged had that chance",2023-07-27 23:46:42
yeah i don’t get that take at all this film was so nolan to the point he chopped up the timeline of a biopic,2023-07-23 02:19:16
thank you,2023-07-28 22:04:37
lol no you can’t tell the story of oppenheimer’s life without jean tatlock,2023-08-01 03:07:57
"great points agree completely that in karma not a victory

i was thinking mainly that the policy of the usa followed what strauss teller lawrence groves etc wanted not what oppenheimer and most of the rest of the usa academic community wanted",2023-07-21 21:26:48
" thats the real issue the world is transformed there are enough atomic bombs to wipe out the entire world in less than 24 hours

and if theyre never used they will save the lives of millions of potential victims of war  the specifics of this film aside you gotta say that is an interesting thought exercise when weighing up their existence

more interesting than wouldnt the guy who invented them feel conflicted like yeah ofcourse he would",2023-07-22 14:46:15
i dont know if it was more objective i think black and white represented stauss perspective where the world is very black and white,2023-07-24 03:05:38
"i meant why did nolan choose spend time telling a political story when he could have explored topics that are more importantinteresting 

was humanitys use of an atomic bomb inevitable
 does any one person bear unique responsibility on a project of that size",2023-07-31 11:46:43
not necessarily true anymore,2023-11-28 05:21:40
your way too obssessed about race,2023-07-23 22:00:24
oppenheimers circles in los alamos his university days and washington almost entirely consisted of white people so im not sure why this is an issue its a bit like complaining that a churchill biopic does not feature any black actors personally id like a lot more films in hollywood featuring black american actors telling the stories of black america both fictional and historical itd be a disservice to black actors to shoehorn them in to small speaking parts in biopics to pretend some sort of diversity when they along with black writers and directors should be given the opportunity and scope to tell the stories they want to tell,2023-07-23 22:35:53
i do think the marketing is abit cheeky lol it really does become a legal drama for much if the final act,2023-07-21 18:52:46
yeah i was having an argument with someone about this when i told them i would have been more interested in a movie about the bombs its literally called oppenheimerlike yeah but the trailers i saw dealt exclusively with the manhattan project,2023-08-07 21:27:39
yes those are both true hes lucky he was just asked to leave school not arrested the privilege of a great mind i suppose,2023-08-06 01:48:55
oh i do understand why nolan chose to do it this way i just wouldve prefered it to be a bit different,2023-07-22 10:58:43
definitely they were great,2023-07-22 09:21:03
i know but i still think it wouldve benefited the film because it visualizes his phrase i have become death destroyer of worlds creating an even stronger emotional connection with it,2023-07-22 09:11:39
thats why it wasnt a great movie,2023-07-22 10:27:39
then it misses the mark,2023-07-22 10:49:46
drakewheres the bomb,2023-07-23 17:24:13
when they first showed his face in the sequence of oppenheimer recruiting scientists i immediately whipped my head to my friend and we both started laughing i also was trying not to laugh whenever it cut to him during the trinity test,2023-07-23 19:26:08
"to each their own but i liked the idea of processing everything after the film rather than during 

also what made the explosion great to me was the timing of the “i am become death” quote",2023-07-24 02:43:04
wow thats insightful never thought of it that way,2023-07-24 14:01:29
"ahhh this is true

which also brings up how many people were calling him a hypocrite for only caring about disarmament after his bombs droppedyea no kidding before then we were doing science and after then 200k people were dead from something i built lol",2023-07-24 14:21:59
she was in my opinion the film didnt do her actual person justice,2023-07-24 13:40:57
thats very clear thank you,2023-08-06 16:08:22
"ah so it was a continued part of his “vision” of the world ending

it’s weird because when they first referenced the v2 and briefly showed the first part of that scene oppy in the plane seeing the white glow of the v2 jet it didn’t seem like a vision there but him actually witnessing it from a plane and why would they launch off v2 rockets with a plane directly above

something still makes me feel like those white lights were a subtle uap reference ",2023-08-06 15:36:02
i thought it was more nolan than dunkirk which i did not like,2023-07-23 23:50:42
thats a lot of hostility for a totally reasonable question i absolutely came away thinking that was the implication,2023-07-22 04:23:28
"shortly before strauss finds out about jfk blocking him we get an entire scene of dr hill talking about how vindictive and petty strauss is

strauss specifically asks who the young senator is that blocked him and its revealed to be jfk",2023-07-22 04:15:20
agree i think most nolans characters are only carried by the actors that played them but arent really well written or compelling bar joker and few others,2023-07-22 19:47:08
there is a massive amount of marketing around this film the youtube trailers hyping it up with tense music and proclaiming it needs to be seen in the imax it doesnt and i wouldnt be surprised if many youtube and reddit comments are the result of the massive marketing machine,2023-07-22 19:43:14
for a film called oppenheimer we have learned very little about the guy from the movie,2023-07-30 17:30:30
third season of twin peaks theres an episode that features the trinity test,2023-07-21 21:35:07
" its more distracting when they find ways to cover up or keep a bra on

i dont know if its more distracting but i think both are distracting a topless florence pugh is distracting i am but a man",2023-07-24 20:48:59
the  at the end i get especially kitty visualizing jean and oppie having ,2023-07-24 20:42:34
nah i’ve had to read vishnu quotes to all my lovers,2023-08-15 07:25:22
doh,2023-07-21 16:01:58
yeah that’s probably what i’m going to see in imax based on the comments i’m not even sure i’m going to see oppenheimer in theaters based on how it’s described in this thread,2023-07-21 20:41:58
well there are zero scenes in mission that use the full imax ratio so by that logic oppenheimer is the clear choice,2023-07-21 20:14:39
why would i want to see a drama with lots of dialogue on imax,2023-07-21 21:56:03
what if i like both i’m seeing both in theaters most likely but only one of them in imax,2023-07-21 21:33:17
i also thought it might be a reference to radiation in the air,2023-07-25 01:10:15
why was him retaining his security clearance such a big deal the last half of the movie made it out to be so important like it was the second coming of christ,2023-07-24 22:27:51
it was first brought up fairly early on in conversation and the way they talked about it seemed to imply that having an opinion on it one way or another suggested communist sympathies def would have been before the bomb part of the timeline i think it might have been brought up at the secret party but it was definitely referenced like 3 times ugh i’ll probably just have to duck out and google it next time,2023-07-30 01:23:46
super excited thank you is it necessary to know the world politics from back then well enough or is it mostly just his story,2023-07-21 14:39:53
until that last 30 minutes i was like they really got oscar winning rami malek to stand there and hold a clipboard for 5 minutes,2023-07-21 19:00:40
i wasnt sure if it was just my theater that was too loud im bringing ear plugs next time i could barely understand the dialogue,2023-07-23 18:48:24
the part where the bomb jumps out and scares the audience,2023-07-24 21:41:45
a head pop’s out from a boat at the height of the bomb blast,2023-07-24 21:55:50
"i mean it is glossed over saying the number and focusing on the trauma of the white aggressors is pretty glossy the movie goes through pains to defend it as necessary and never makes the point that maybe it was good that the russians entered the arms race otherwise the americans wouldve been unchecked 

its like making a slavery movie and focusing only on the trauma of the white men who built the system 

i will say there is a way to do this concept well  theres a movie coming out this year that does it  oppenheimer just comes off as muddled and shallow",2023-08-05 22:01:15
"ok great thats good to hear thank you

again without spoiling if possible is oppy seen as a  the movie or is the endingmovie more nuanced than that because i certainly dont seem him as a hero whatsoever for creating such a killing machine",2023-07-21 10:22:30
why are you downvoted,2023-07-21 19:59:11
bleh,2023-07-21 10:34:46
why would i want to fight you,2023-07-21 09:48:57
"yup im still a bit confused because that means nolan used to metaphor of the raindrops in the puddle for two different things 
or maybe nolan is just a genius and managed to connect alle three raindrops in the puddle  bombings spreading across the land  atoms interacting  interference pattern

so first oppenheimer saw the beauty in the atom and later could only see the destruction it  he caused how  beautiful is that",2023-07-29 16:30:31
tons of people here saying the opposite no need to act aggressive,2023-07-21 14:09:07
yeah the third act was easily the best part,2023-07-21 13:43:13
"i have to agree with them the last third’s pacing is very different from the first third and it feels too drawn out for not enough narrative payoff it just sort of fizzles out with everyone testifying and his clearance being denied but we knew that was coming early on so the drama doesn’t feel effective to me 

i liked it i just have to imagine the last third could have been down more cleanly or with less obtuse editing",2023-07-21 13:31:54
a biopic about teddy roosevelt wouldve been more gripping,2023-07-21 21:50:57
yep if anything strauss shouldve let oppie know that it wasnt appreciated or professional to act in that manner but instead strauss said let me burn this mand to the ground also oppie was fighting for good preventing a nuclear arms race and trying to create peace treaties and strauss was preventing that by attacking his character,2023-07-23 06:45:01
"it became very clear to me immediately that it wasnt about the bomb it was about the american industrial military complex and one of the men who contributed to it 

i thought the way the bomb test was presented was incredible the sound direction beforehand and then when it detonates and you can feel the tension in the cinema everybody onscreen starts celebrating really interesting fourth wall emotional disconnect 

i definitely agree that there were some slow parts especially with the strauss scenes",2023-07-27 00:26:58
i thought i was at fault for not being very impressed by the explosion i always have a weak reaction to spectacles,2023-07-26 22:58:25
"biopics filled with robotic characters the audience is left to feel apathetic toward because the writers are only mentally capable of robotic plotservicing dialogue outside of 1 character should be straighttotv

you could call everyone but emily blunts character person a through z and it wouldnt matter because none of these characters evoked anything",2023-07-27 03:31:32
also the cause of his death,2023-07-31 07:49:45
as a smoker myself i have no idea how the  he smoked so much that often dude had the pipe and the darts going for the whole runtime,2023-07-31 19:36:07
have to say i watched it at a very small independent cinema and the sound was incredible the music gave me goosebumps throughout however i haven’t seen it at a chain cinema so i may be biased,2023-07-31 22:56:07
"i walked out of oppenheimer feeling quite shaken

i did as well  im generally an optimist and as someone who grew up when things were really tense i generally do not fear nuclear war quite as much as perhaps young people who are being introduced to the real possibility for the first time in thirty years

and still the end rattled me badly  i doubt i could have enjoyed a light film after that",2023-08-05 16:53:19
it insists upon itself,2023-07-25 20:04:40
he came to the the conclusion that it was pretentious because he had trouble following the storylines that’s ok,2023-07-25 20:24:24

maybe it was the shrooms and the  man idk,2023-07-21 18:06:59
"maybe it was the comment about  shrooms i guess to me they aren’t really a big deal i thought they are basically legal in most places and both given medicinally 

either way can’t wait to see it again",2023-07-26 12:43:56
not to mention the runtime difference although oppenheimer gets a bump with imax screenings,2023-08-17 02:01:12
his will stand the test of time,2023-08-18 00:31:41
the extra 300m is all from barbie fans going full meme,2023-08-17 20:58:40
i am genuinely shocked that so many people in this sub are ranking oppenheimer over interstellar,2023-07-21 14:00:54
tenet is the worst lets be honest,2023-07-22 02:26:56
dark knight  inception  interstellar  tenet  oppi,2023-07-22 08:03:06
lol im getting down voted for having an opinion i love this subreddit oppenheimer is not even close to being his worst film,2023-07-21 12:42:38
"maybe because every trailer basically showed all the scenes the movie had to do with the bomb and so people go in expecting the film to mostly be about the bomb and these people role in it not oppenheimer having  in the middle of a security hearing

honestly compare this film to the imitation game a film about enigma being cracked by alan turing manages to tell his story and be dramatic while still focusing on the enigma machine 

certainly didn’t need some self circle  scene where he reads the famous quote out of a random book while a  woman rides him",2023-07-30 02:38:06
"i think i phrased my original comment wrong on its own the soundtrack is good but when compared to the scores of nolan’s previous several movies even including tenet it doesnt sound as powerful in my opinion 

goransson’s work in oppenheimer isn’t bad by any stretch",2023-07-26 05:00:13
still it was a confusing mess,2023-07-21 11:47:01
lets see  a movie about a bomb  the bomb  loud noises  somehow seems appropriate,2023-07-21 15:37:22
i was thinking of bringing foam ear buds to the theater i can get noise sensitive sometimes plus i have a raging headache today do you think those would be effective for cancelling out louder noises while still being able to hear dialogue,2023-07-21 15:36:39
thats not it the color scenes were from oppenheimers perspective the blackandwhite scenes were from strausss perspective,2023-07-22 01:08:39
actually the black and white is supposed to be objective third party truth while the color is supposed to be oppenheimers subjective receptioninterpretation of what he is experiencing,2023-07-22 01:22:17
yes the trinity was a let down it was not a focal point,2023-07-22 15:25:40
" the trinity  also kind of a let down

im actually curious about this how was it a letdown for you maybe its because of the fillintheblankswithbackgroundknowledge thing but to me it was practically perfect i was losing my mind all the way from the initial flash to the characters going nuts at the end of the scene",2023-07-22 15:49:00
as someone who didnt know the story of oppenheiner everyone here complaining about the fast pace and being confusing are wrong  movie was fine to follow even if youre a little confused at some parts  just have to pay attention,2023-07-22 17:50:48
did you know that a title doesnt literally dictate that what appears on screen must only be 100 related to it,2023-07-22 22:54:45
true true im just thinking of those stomping shoes beating in your chest ,2023-07-23 09:00:42
watched it the other night again definitely enjoy this movie beautifully shot with a james bond espionage sheen all throughout the movie washington and pattinson are very likeable and the turnstile version 1 encounter while great really comes together on version 2 encounter i did have to have my tv use a clear voice ai output though as i dont have the room set up for the audio mix i doubt many do for this particular movied,2023-07-24 19:08:34
honestly oppenheimers script was dealing a lot more than jfk i kind of wish it didnt,2023-07-21 11:54:32
yes its his least crowd pleasing heavy on drama and less on spectacle film cinematography is still great though,2023-07-21 11:53:03
"the film wouldve really benefitted from being called trinity rather than oppenheimer at least personally i wouldve loved for there to be a deep dive into the physics and complications of the actual manhattan project rather than just a biopic of oppenheimers life i really couldve done without the last third of the movie turning into a political courtroom drama call me lame but it turned a story that involved tens of thousands of people billions of dollars and some of the coolest most innovative science this world has ever seen into a coldwar hitpiece courtroom drama 

as far as telling oppenheimers story it did a great job because you really cant separate what happened to him after the war from his story before the war it was interesting but fell flat in terms of what i was really hoping to get out of this movie 

also that trinity bomb was not a good representation i admire how nolan would rather not use cgi for such an important part of the movie but you cannot replicate the magnitude and aesthetic of a nuclear bomb with conventional explosives it really didnt look realistic and was a bit of a letdown imo 

overall id give it a 35 it was definitely interesting but not something id go back to watch for at least a few years as far as nolan movies go it was pretty average imo",2023-09-25 14:27:57
haha ,2023-07-22 05:45:49
personally i think the last section was fantastic it was very interesting seeing how the politics of everything played out but i do see how people would find it boring at the end of the day it is a biopic,2023-07-22 19:42:57
well duh it is obvious that atom bombs are dangerous but the glorification of nukes in media has downplayed what these divine weapons truly are but showing the real side of how the bombs very own creator felt is way heavier and more impactful than just simply showing a explosion scene in a movie it requires critical thinking and despite the few who were bored the vast majority enjoyed the movie,2023-07-22 21:06:29
honestly the movie fails at even making the a bomb scary the explosion was underwhelming while realistic for the trinity test a little artistic licensing might have helped or even showing some of the photos from the meeting about the after affects of hiroshima,2023-08-11 03:41:13
they didn’t need to show off the affects of the bomb all the meetings and interrogation do a much better job of depicting the weight of reality,2023-07-22 19:21:49
dude it happend its not a  plot twist,2023-07-23 17:01:30
"he created the unexpcted plot twist with rdjs character 

it wasnt unexpected i pretty  versed on oppenheim and the state of the super 

strauss to set out to destroy oppenheimer and shift blame onto others saying the same things i dont remember seeing the homicidal maniac curtis lemay in this film many people had personal and professional beef that oppenhimer was nervous about building a truly horrific weapon 

i dont think many people realize the difference in size of the bombs built in las alamos and the fusion devices that teller later built its the whole message of the third act 

einstein knows that strauss led the effort to develop the hydrogen bomb and he was vehemently opposed to it 

they are in fact talking about something more important and strauss the anger was real",2023-07-23 12:33:31
"the line from truman about removing kyoto from the target list as its his vacation destination made me really upset and harrowed me most people around me audibly laughed i dont think it was supposed to be comedic relief

it definitely was meant to be funny from the filmmaker not from the character the character was being very serious but what hes saying presents cognitive dissonance its humorous

he takes kyōto off the list for a personal reason because the city holds sentimental value to him of course this completely ignores the fact that many many people have sentiments towards hiroshima and nagasaki

its a brief moment of dark humour that i think nolan absolutely intended youre laughing at him not with him for presenting such a ridiculous and obviously biased reason to take kyōto off the list",2023-07-23 07:24:57
it’s called gallows humour it was terrifying how they decided to keep kyoto off the list,2023-07-23 07:28:04
our theater scoffed and laughed at this scence but not because it was funny more like disbelief disbelief and disgust that the only reason kyoto was spared because of the cultural signficance to japan  that it was where truman  had his honey moon kind of like really dude  these are peoples lives,2023-07-23 07:14:58
" truman about removing kyoto from the target list as its his vacation destination made me really upset and harrowed me

this is 100 how it went down the movie was incredibly accurate from historical perspective",2023-07-23 12:39:42
i know exactly what you mean i understand why people laughed but  something just didnt sit right with me laughing at that linescene,2023-07-23 08:03:14
i think that is more valid about nolan fans who will just mindlessly call the movie a masterpiece without accepting any critique of it,2023-07-23 09:01:05
"in my personal opinion the part thats meant to shake you is when oppenhiemer gives his speech when the war was announced over and the people were cheering but he also sees the destruction the bomb causes a crazy juxtaposition of the crowd not understanding the reality of the use of the bomb the movie was really trying to show that oppenhiemer truly believed that once the bomb was dropped once the whole world would be horrified and he hoped would be the end of the destruction so when he sees people  on patriotism he realized the chain reaction that would destroy the world was not a chemical reaction that he introduced but the chain reaction of  on power oppenhiemers ego made him feel godlike that he was all knowing and that he could create a peacetime but when truman blew him off and basically said im  oppenhiemer thought the politics and power hungry forces of the world would bring it to its end probably why he seemed relieved that the soviets got the tech so that power in the world would be dichotomas 

why the ending scene with einstein should haunt you is not any moral question of what was already done at that point but the understanding of the inevitably of science progressing and that each one of us has a responsibility of it after its here we are the chain reaction thats when einstein understood that his legacy would be tainted with  the bomb because he started the chain reaction of understanding quantum mechanics so the moral question leaving the theatre should be we need to take this big leaps in science discovery with the care it needs before it runs away makes you think about who you are voting for how much tech you use and how we use ai

the movie was a 1010 but as an engineer that studied nuclear energy i am bit of a fanboy of the scientists involved it was like the art rennisance but for science the implications of discovery are still unraveling today ex quantum computing in the age of ai  i already understood the science and what was happening and it was rewarding to get into the head of oppenhiemer and the politics and moral questions he had as a man maybe the movie rewards you more if you know more heading into the film due to the pace brilliant character study of one of the worlds most interesting people he felt the music he truly felt like a vessel of science and had higher devine purpose",2023-07-22 15:34:23
same here lots of people saying they were shaken to their core by something that i thought was understood by everyone aware of the power of the weapon from the start makes me wonder what im missing,2023-07-22 14:50:00
the film goes to great lengths to convey the whirlwind nature of the project with everyone feeling the pressure of an existential crisis due to the nazis the thrill of discovery and overcoming scientific obstacles its easy to deceive oneself in that environment to mentally put off the inevitable which comes crashing down on oppenheimer as soon as the bomb is dropped with no more project theres no more distraction he has to face reality,2023-07-22 14:47:00
for me it was when he said it the reveal of what he said to einstein was just what he was saying the entire time oppenheimer set out to stop the nazis what he and his colleagues accomplished was giving nuclear weapons to the nation that would eventually destroy his life he didn’t stop the nazis he didn’t see hiroshima and nagasaki as completely justified if justified at all and he didn’t succeed in tempering the development of nuclear weapons going into the future what really got me though was strauss’ meltdown at the end juxtaposed with oppenheimer’s calm dark quip one had his world taken away the other may have destroyed everyone else’s and the way they reacted was completely different,2023-07-22 14:52:10
exactly what i felt not able to understand people who say the ending shook them to their core,2023-07-22 14:47:45
"so i get the argument that it’s just regurgitating the same point

but for me it comes down to the way it’s shot edited then cillian murphy selling it with that haunting look

to directly follow the scene where strauss is convinced that oppenheimer was conspiring against him from the beginning to even turning einstein against him to being told “maybe they were talking about something more important” having us hang from the conversation earlier in the movie to finally finding out what they were really talking about and the weight of it shows the importance of it and how it reflects on modern society and is as relevant as ever

then the music building getting louder tenser while it zooms in on the haunting look oppenheimers face to just then cut to black it just lingered long enough to give me a sense of dread about modern society and how we are never truly going to be safe from nuclear threat",2023-07-22 20:07:06
"reddit has the most negative reviews of this movie i’ve seen anywhere 

this movie was one of the best i’ve ever seen i can’t stop thinking about it 

and nobody apart from a select group of weirdos cares about upvotes",2023-07-24 02:32:19
correct boring as ,2023-07-24 02:49:14
your opinion definitely agreeable  but mine is its not as bad as other made it out to be i love it but i do not dare say that it was the best there is interstellar after all,2023-07-24 20:34:49
what in particular did you expect from a biopic on oppenheimer,2023-07-24 20:57:39
the imitation game comes to mind as well,2023-07-24 20:07:16
just a few more days and watch the bombman’s ratings drop this is just an over hyped 3 hour orchestra jump cut box,2023-07-21 15:38:34
hilarious how you guys act like this isnt a big budget hollywood blockbuster,2023-07-22 20:17:41
the poster shows the explosion the trailers all make it out to be about the bomb itself not the man not to mention there was no music how could this film be an 8 or 910 when theres essentially a nonexistant score the visual effects looked terrible too that scene where oppy sees the crowd disintegrate looked more lowbudget than terminator 2 a film from over 30 years ago,2023-07-22 20:33:20
but as we just saw oppenheimer’s life story is not interesting or important the bombs are much bigger than him,2023-07-22 20:50:46
information glut i also didnt find it very informative not because the information wasnt there but because it was delivered in a narrative structure that wasnt intuitive to me and there was just so much information without meaningful connections to the characters and plot,2023-07-25 18:19:03
i appreciate this comment and it does seem like that’s what the purpose of the film was but i don’t think nolan did a good job of executing it i don’t know if it was the pacing of the movie or the development of the characters but i just did not feel these stakes while watching the 3rd act i don’t know if enough groundwork was laid for me to actually feel compelled towards the end and so more than anything else it felt like a huge drag,2023-07-29 13:50:38
"your comment makes sense but im just keeping it real

i guess where you lose me is that iron man wasnt an escalation of oppenheimers own internal conflict he was already debasing himself amongst the military war hawks when hes giving speeches and theyre shaking their heads and whispering to each other so when rdj turned out to be a bad guy it didnt really do much for me",2023-07-29 20:28:21
"i get what nolans going for tho  the best of our people can get submarined by egotistical businessman who isnt a scientist nor a soldier  hes just powerhungry and wants to exact his revenge for the pettiest of grievances not even profitmotivated in this case

its david zaslav vs christopher nolan",2023-07-29 15:50:10
"i mean presumably his security clearance gives him a direct line to the people who make decisions so instead of being an activist hes an advisor and that makes a difference

but yeahother than that i basically see it the way you do its not like he goes to prison or is smeared publically even",2023-07-29 20:20:38

if youre like me and dislike all of his films since the prestige you will hate this its more of the same of nolan proving time and time again that he sucks  as a filmmaker,2023-07-21 23:11:57
i was expecting a movie like the trailer showed we would get a thriller about oppenheimer making the atom bomb not half a movie of dialogue in rooms they dont show a second of dialogue in a room in the trailer why is that,2023-07-23 07:30:52
i was expecting an entertaining movie i dont care if its action or not this was far from it it was like watching a ai generated video of an history audiobook,2023-07-23 07:02:41
the first half was both too fast paced and too slow haha it was far too much dialogue too much quick cuts and also not enough interesting and engaging things were happening,2023-07-27 03:43:44
i dont care if that person didnt like it i havent even seen it yet but starting a critical post with  what a disaster should be downvoted,2023-07-21 20:16:32
i wasnt outraged either and i think my point is being misunderstood for some reason i dont have a problem with it being depicted or even that oppenheimer read it as that is based on truth but to have them read it while having  like its some  foreplay is disrespectful,2023-07-22 15:55:32
you arent wrong but thats not what i meant to say i have an issue with a religious text being shown as some sort of foreplay,2023-07-22 15:58:56
" ive see way too many people flat out stating this film is bad

what would be the appropriate amount of people flat out stating this film is bad",2023-07-23 02:45:58
it didnt get kicked out oppenheimer had the screens first then mi changed release dates and couldnt get them tom cruise then tried to push oppenheimer out to make more room for mi,2023-07-23 18:55:55
probably cause they didn’t want to show the same movie on imax that’s been shown 100263 times,2023-07-23 20:50:42
technically oppenheimer is a very good movie but do i feel the need to ever watch it again  not really meanwhile i am going to see dead reckoning a second time in theaters with another group,2023-07-23 19:02:54
constantly changing the timeline with little to no context most of the time if someone were to watch oppenheimer and didn’t know much about the nuclear arms race with russia they wouldn’t have a clue until the the end of the movie it looked great and sounded great it had an amazing cast but just didn’t tell a story very well to me i was getting annoyed by virtually the same music every scene too i’m a massive nolan fan i’m a bit disappointed,2023-08-21 23:20:28
they very briefly explained the concept of a gun type bomb and they pretty clearly described the bomb they made as a nuclear fission using the implosion type bomb,2023-07-22 02:37:07
they made two types both discussed nagasakifat man and trinity both used the implosion style device whereas hiroshima little boy used the gun style device,2023-07-22 03:10:32

the third act was sort of critical to his story,2023-07-28 18:37:38
that doesn’t work for me movies have dealt with atrocities before whether it be the holocaust or slavery so for me not showing the nuclear disaster or the silhouettes of the japanese burnt into buildings doesn’t make the audience or oppenheimer confront that dark reality in american history,2023-08-08 22:28:21
youve been commenting althroughout this thread loser i get it you didnt like it move on lol,2023-07-21 13:29:13
i thought bethe was supposed to be von neumann until they named him real disappointment guess they didnt need 2 tellerlike characters,2023-07-22 01:00:37
i didnt hate it but i found the first hour really hard to follow lots of names lots of very fast conversations lots of history lots of lectures and speeches and negotiationsits a lot,2023-07-22 23:05:14
bro for me the first hour was boring cause i couldn’t even understand what they were saying it was way to dialogue heavy,2023-07-22 22:50:41
you know the negotiation scene in bohemian rhapsody that has so many jump cuts it actually becomes jarring the first hour felt like an extended version of that the editing made what shouldve been a slow burn character study feel like a blockbuster action movie it felt like i was watching a recap of an oppenheimer tv show instead of a movie,2023-07-22 22:53:08
biopics still have to be written as do the characters in them,2023-07-23 02:04:15
i liked it too just not as much as i thought i would and yeah the constant scene switching was exhausting even though it was well done lol just because its like 3 hours of it,2023-07-23 00:05:58
i usually hate the quick cuts in films and it’s my biggest negative with nolan films but here i think it actually works as a way to create this feeling of constant ascension and anxiety the whole film feels like a three hour long panic attack even more so then beau is afraid reminds me of uncut gems and requiem for a dream and how quick the cuts in those films are,2023-07-23 01:51:22
same im within 40 minutes of 3 of those theaters and now am thankful they were all basically sold out,2023-07-22 23:39:10
same very glad i didnt drive all the way to the imax for that lol definitely not interstellartier effectsvisuals to warrant that,2023-07-22 23:23:12
i recall several definitely more than 10 nolan fanboys calling it a masterpiece when it was in theatres both on reddit and in real life,2023-07-24 16:44:27

"wrong the ending was depicting what fermi had predicted roberts last words to einstien in relation to the atmosphere igniting was i believed it

it was a commentary on how oppenheimer despite his moral stance after the launch of the atomic bomb believed fermis calculations and despite the possibilitybeleif of the atmosphere igniting still launched it",2023-07-26 19:48:48
i love how nolan’s finales always leave us with a thousand possible meanings like the end of inception every single one of us interprets it differently and that’s beautiful it also reminds me of the “haunting of hill house and bly manor” by flanagan i live for this type of cinema,2023-07-26 20:33:53
actually main problem is they never gave sufficient time for viewers to digest the information and characters even after having a runtime of 310,2023-07-21 15:47:16
i think it was tbh,2023-07-22 22:58:50
it would been better as a six hour miniseries,2023-07-23 08:04:52
wow what a reasonable and not insulting response i will certainly be sure to take your opinion seriously in the future i followed the film just fine but i can see that the pacing was very strange and could have easily lost people especially those who dont bring as much context in with them as others i dont fault the audience for this honestly it would have been nice if some if not all of the scenes could have had time to breathe to make sure everyone can follow it this is supposed to be a summer blockbuster for a wide audience it would have been nice to see the director some respect for those who are new to the story,2023-07-23 23:28:16
it’s honestly fast af i had to  missed a couple mins and was lost for 10 minutes lol,2023-07-23 23:11:10

"general groves said he wouldn’t have granted him clearance if the rules that were made were in place at the time of oppenheimer’s hire

the authors of american prometheus said he was never red but firmly placed him in the “pink” category

which is understandable considering the great depression led many to believe capatlism was failing and the political climate

he remained a patriot and it’s disgraceful how he was treated your last sentence is spot on 

it is a slippery  but i can understand a nation’s commitment to ensuring parties involved with its most sensitive national security secrets are the staunchly patriotic 

it obviously got out of hand with mccarthyism but spies were a thing and it was a constant battle",2023-07-24 01:22:18
not worn enough for me,2023-07-21 21:21:59
genuinely i felt so bad seeing the recrestion of the effect the bomb had on people through roberts eyes if they had recreated and showcased what those people went through i wouldve probably  shed some tears,2023-07-21 21:24:27
thanks for your input you dont think that would have been amazing to see in imax,2023-07-21 21:23:46

well that footage wasn’t of the trinity test but yeah his explosion is still under rebelling compared to actual footage of the trinity test,2023-08-11 17:59:52
oppenheimer wasn’t there for his exlovers death either but they stilled showed that,2023-07-21 23:23:22
my point remains what draws nolan specifically to these subjects is that what lit the fire in him to want to do this project at this point its clearly a choice and cannot be ignored simply because its history same way spielberg chooses similar themes when it comes to family and an absentee father  hes specifically seeking out those projects or makes a point to highlight those aspects because of his personal history to those subjects,2023-07-22 10:39:12
terrible review of a review literally state i already watched barbie and even threw criticism on that film,2023-07-22 10:41:05
the pacing was so jarring up until matt damon appears it’s not a nolan film if everything is told in order but boy was i confused,2023-07-23 23:49:10
 neither barbie or oppenheimer are good enough for that besides its only 2023 arent you getting ahead of yourself,2023-07-21 11:59:26

japan repeatedly signaled that they wished to surrender but under the condition that the emperor be allowed to remain in office the us insisted that they surrender unconditionally wiped out two entire cities full of civilians to get that unconditional surrender and then decided to let the emperor remain in office,2023-07-21 13:13:30
"my man you need a history lesson the japanese were actively discussing and pursuing peace talks but truman didn’t want to hear it and wanted to use the bomb to intimidate the russians that’s literally all in the movie as well 

racing the enemy by tsuyoshi hasegawa is a definitive text that examines primary sources from the japanese and russian governments that proves this 

the decision to use the atomic bomb by gar alperovitz looks at truman and his cabinet and shows that they considered other options but ultimately decided that an actual quick peace was not as important as a  contest with the ussr 

i studied this at the graduate level i’ve been to the hypocenters of hiroshima and nagasaki i’ve spoken with the survivors you do not know what you are talking about",2023-07-21 13:47:09
guess i understood i just didnt care that some random person wanted to become atomic energy commissioner and oppenheimer would loose hissecurity clearance i mean you have the most interesting thing in the world nuclear bombs and you spend the entire third hour in courtrooms with insignificant drama playing out like oh no worst case scenario oppenheimer is still a multi millionaire hired by a private company or a tenured professor with unlimited retirement benefits i cant actually believe someone thought that was a good idea,2023-07-25 00:09:28

"they did talk about the firebombings the scene where they discuss the targets opens with it its 2 sentences blinkandyoullmissit but ot is discussed

i think the not showing of the bombings mostly has to do with the movie being about oppenheimers journey ultimately not atomic bombs 

the movie starts as conversations between scientists in small indoor spaces with some outdoor scenes that prime oppenheimer and the audience with themes of an existential nature and the relation between the intimate and the cosmic then this escalates into wide open spaces in the desert  visually communicating the grandeur of this part of oppenheimers life hes huge bigger than life at this point then this reaches its obvious climax and the existential cosmic and intimate themes all erupt into a fiery chaos in the dreamlike darkness of the night almost all the rest of the movie is during the day outside the intimate scenes this fantastical fever dream bleeds into his nightmarish speech scene

and then during the subsequent days the shots are very brightly lit initially the cosmic dreamnightmare is over the daylight is harsh almost like when one has a hangover or wakes up after a ons and then the movie quickly draws oppenheimer back into small rooms

thats oppenheimers life an academic a  an outcast small rooms wide open spaces small rooms

showing scenes of the bomb dropping from airplanes or whatever would completely ruin the flow of these themesoppenheimers life because this movie is not about the horror of what we did with atomic bombs it is about exploribg oppenheimers relation to his decision to create them  the buildup the succes and the impact it had on his life",2023-07-26 00:06:12

it really wasnt confusing per se even if i havent read the book we are told whats happening like all nolans movies told what peopless motivations are etc but good filmmaking is about showing these things otherwise why is it on film he definitely is at a point where no one anywhere is giving him advice saying no helping him shape a story hes too big for all that now,2023-07-24 03:30:21
"first off i want to say i fully respect your oppinion and that i didnt mean to belittle anyones intelligence with my opening statement
what i meant was that if you go into this movie expecting an epic story about the atomic bomb you will be left dissapointed 
if you went into it with wanting to get to know oppenheimer better and the way things worked regarding the project from his pov i think it definitely served that part very well
but i could be wrong im going for a rewatch soon maybe ill come back and change my mind

cheers ",2023-07-22 13:14:42
they werent housing just scientists guards and military personnel were also there,2023-07-29 03:22:19
oi bro barbie has deeper themes than oppie,2023-08-06 01:01:42
in some scenes inside the white house a globe is shown and during the final scene lots of atomic detonations are seen on a large scale on the globe,2023-07-21 20:36:18
well evidently there is no hope for you in life as you pointed out first of all there was no such thing as “russia” during ww2,2023-07-24 04:50:08
they were using the term “russia” throughout the movie never used the term soviet union which was the name of the country at the time and yes they were fighting on our side the issueproblem  at the time for world war 2 was the 6 million jewish people  slaughtered however nolan made his focus on the war “commies” he’s either antisemitic or a very bad wannabe historian who has no business writing screenplays stick with directing,2023-07-24 04:45:15
he wasnt openly communist he never joined the communist party and the only thing they had on him was that he supported the antifascist rebels in spain as did ernest hemingway and many other intellectuals,2023-07-24 07:28:18
just so happens his bomb ended ww2 the whole purpose of oppenheimer creating that town in new mexico under damon’s orders was to create a bomb to use in fighting ww2 that was the entire reason for the commission of it no oppenheimer wasn’t communist,2023-07-24 05:14:34
apparently christopher nolan didn’t  he presents the entire 3hour movie as the usoppenheimer vs “russia” germany is the enemy which was hardly even brought up,2023-07-24 04:48:51
"when did i say i showed up late i was 30 min early 

people showed up late shuffling to their seats that caused me to missed parts of the beginning",2023-07-22 02:18:04
when did i say i was late,2023-07-22 02:22:51
to be 100 honest i pretty much only saw the movie because i have the regal unlimited pass and it was my day off so it was a free waste of time and for the memes,2023-07-25 23:09:21
maybe don’t be rude i tried paying attention and i didn’t get it i didn’t understand what was going on with robert downey jrs character and it just kept getting more confusing as time went on i understood the fission making the bomb  oppenheimer feeling like he has blood on his hands whatever but the stuff with robert downey jrs character was extremely confusing,2023-07-25 22:48:57
i understand the movie was supposed to be about oppenheimer and not a antiwar political thing but i was very underwhelmed with how the movie tackled the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki they mentioned it some and mentioned oppenheimer’s guilt but i really wish they would have gone into further details about the horror of the bombings and the impact it had on japan,2023-07-25 23:06:15
"oppenheimer was a chain smoker

yeah that was made clear by the 30 minute mark  

maybe it just stood out because smoking is basically nonexistent in tv and movies these days",2023-08-05 01:25:38
he could have cast oppenheimer as a minority was chris pratt italian not available scarlett johansson woman would have been a great choice too,2023-07-24 20:09:01
well everyone is saying that openheimer is a horror movie for some reason,2023-07-22 20:36:13
thanks,2023-07-25 17:34:26
"

this post has had some conflicting reports and makes it sound like itll depend on the theater",2023-07-25 16:01:14
"its pretty loud the bomb is practically nothing compared to the rest of the movie lots of musical swells and stuff i would look to see if your local theatre has a showing with closed captions or something for hearing sensitive people my local theatre does on occasion

the movie uses sound phenomenally to intentionally invoke the feeling of a panic attack multiple times and id say i found those moments far far far louder and more impactful than the actual detonation of the bomb",2023-07-25 17:48:32
"thats a good idea ill have to look into that thanks

reddit doesnt do free awards anymore so have my poor womens gold ",2023-07-25 15:10:19
"watching this at home feels so odd to me i liked what i got with my imax experience but id be pretty hardpressed to think id give this anything above an 8 if i were to watch it on a tv suppose if you were into series like chernobyl you might still likelove this but a lot of the sound design can get really dampened off on something like tv speakers  


  
but yea the movie has a lot of loud thuds bangs every id say 2030 minutes which were cool in my experience but ik would really annoy others depending on how well that theater turned messed with the volume",2023-07-25 15:42:08
yikes sounds like we should probably wait until its available at home then thats a shame,2023-07-25 17:17:22
ah right he hired him after thanks,2023-07-27 14:31:54
and in the a bomb it’s a “standard bomb” that sets off the fission,2023-07-24 23:08:24
when i meant same time i meant it looked as though one occurred right after the other of course i knew strauss was referring to oppies inquiry in the past tense,2023-07-28 06:01:47
i think nolan gets off on that kinda confusion tbh,2023-08-08 03:09:28
i dont know how someone could even think its happening at the same time were they not paying attention,2024-01-07 07:58:00
"wow thanks for the snarky enlightenment

no one but you deemed to respond unprovoked to my harmless comment like a  so please kindly  blocked",2023-07-30 08:31:22
you could argue he did and that was his reason for going through that farce of a security hearing it brought the scientists in for questioning so they could see he was being drug through the mud knowing it was strauss pulling the strings,2023-08-23 07:33:36
half the theatre burst out laughing such was the intensity of the movie,2023-07-24 10:19:52
i think thats juxtaposed later by him telling the story of what casey affleck had intended to do to one of the scientists,2023-07-30 19:30:46
it was when oppie said he was a “new deal democrat” matt damon performed those lines beautifully haha,2023-07-26 00:00:23
what he really did was channel groves he was snarky and had little time for  which is what made him so great at his job,2023-07-24 13:21:04
yes it was especially that last “” at the end,2023-07-24 01:20:11
apparently they may have had an affair but it may have not been  so i guess thats why it wasnt shown because we dont know exactly what their relationship was ,2023-07-22 15:23:39
it wasnt my theater i saw it multiple times at different theaters in different countries and it was terrible its a nolan problem and it doesnt get me to focus all it does is make me annoyed,2023-07-31 04:52:49
ohhhhhh interesting,2023-07-26 01:53:25
 its like they made something wild in a city sim,2023-11-16 23:26:55
the government did still need oppenheimer that’s the whole point of the 2nd half of the movie they needed oppenheimer to continue to build from the atom bomb they wanted him to build the hbomb etc but he refused over moral grounds,2023-07-24 04:58:12
“you aren’t just selfimportant you are important” is such a good line,2023-07-23 03:56:23
that scene was based on and to my knowledge almost exactly like the real oppenheimer and truman meeting,2023-07-23 20:00:52
i couldn’t believe he was gloating about dropping the bomb,2023-07-24 22:40:59
definitely more of a “stay in your lane ill take responsibility for those deaths” statement,2023-08-06 07:41:38
just missing an r,2023-07-22 06:33:00
loops back it happened as einstein was talking about it,2023-07-23 20:29:21
explain what loop,2023-07-22 09:54:23
this is called a setup and a payoff its a hallmark of good screenwriting,2023-07-23 09:29:45
you aren’t allowed to critique nolan on reddit ,2023-07-23 23:31:24
yeah this movie was  all they did was  talk,2023-07-24 04:01:45
thats just how people work but especially people with a chip on their shoulder they have something to prove constantly and its not enough to know theyre good they have to let others know theyre good,2023-07-23 00:38:57
speak for yourself some of us give people benefit of doubt or we forget if it’s not a big deal if you think it’s good stuff then you’re like strauss you give people reasons to hate you then wonder why they do,2023-08-02 06:08:47
glad he got a meaty role in a big project after that han solo flop,2023-07-23 12:13:32
"i have this thing my husband calls imdb brain where a name pops unbidden into my head when im just trying to watch a movie i dont know how i knew the name i dont think ive seen any of his previous work but alden ehrenreich just popped into my head 

it happens a lot with actors ive never heard of or perhaps forgot id heard of",2023-07-23 01:15:39
but it was a heel turn it just started earlier that was the conclusion of the heel turn,2023-07-25 17:50:05
theres always that one obvious audience surrogate character that feels like a corny plot device but given the density of the narrative it felt purposeful here,2023-07-23 12:14:23
thank you for clearing that up for me,2023-07-24 00:37:50
"i was surprised to see josh hartnett having a pretty big role in the movie i was wondering why and how just because he hasnt been around much i guess he was one of the candidates for the dark knight but declined nolan definitely saw something in him then and put him to good use now 

also read somewhere that matt damon was supposed to take a break from acting for a while as a promise to his wife the only thing that would bring him out of the break would be a christopher nolan movie guess he never took that break",2023-07-22 15:23:22
cillian murphy being a prime example all those side roles led to him getting the best role of his career the dude killed it,2023-07-24 04:44:31
i don’t remember about rami malek but the two others have already been in nolan movies you’re saying it’s either bucket list or tactical but it may also just be they have a good relationship and like working with him enough to do these small appearances knowing they will be meaningful and not just a cameo,2023-07-21 22:45:42
those are my thoughts legit excited to see how he works with florence pugh rami malek and jack quiad in the future,2023-07-23 14:44:04
commenting late but that is what happened to murphy nolan saw him kinda fell in love had him read for batman and cast him in small roles consistently and then bam,2023-08-17 02:02:27
2 hour sean avery role when,2023-07-30 17:26:58
movie was a couple actors away from being batman 4,2023-08-04 18:32:07
i find this highly annoying it’s smacks of laziness and they nearly always stick out cillian murphy the exception but he’s the main character florence pugh josh hartnett safdie were all great i much preferred them over the 810 twominute “cameos” by batmanalumni actors,2023-08-18 21:07:48
yep in batman begins murphy doesnt necessarily have an insane amount of screentime but lo and behold hes here as the lead,2023-09-10 04:10:12
just been in a scorsese film for 5 minutes would be seen as a honour for some acting talent you can say you were in a scorsese film same with nolan you dont get these top actors doing 10 minute roles if that just out of the goodness of their hearts nolan has that pull and they know a lot of his films will live  on for generations to come,2023-07-23 16:57:59
those are just rdj mannerisms though he’s always been like that,2023-07-23 22:07:24
had the exact same reaction to rdjs mannerisms took me right out of the movie,2023-07-23 02:37:00
i’m so embarrassed i was like wow they called in some rando to play truman but he’s doing a good job ,2023-08-16 05:48:43
i felt the same way about rdj there were one or two momentsmannerismsvocal ticks that snapped me out of the moment  his acting repertoire is a bit too familiar,2023-09-08 16:30:45
thats quite funny maybe your subconscious picked up on it being him,2023-07-23 06:55:57
 disrespecting my boy fdr,2023-07-29 16:15:42
funnily enough leo was also played by gary oldman this whole time,2023-07-24 20:00:35
the scene itself was stirring but it felt a bit weird that he of all people was the one giving it he appeared in two scenes prior without any dialogue and both times he was just told off by oppenheimer we didnt get to see him witness any of the rivalry between strauss and oppenheimer  that was all young han solo,2023-07-23 11:46:46
respectfully how did you not see that coming,2023-07-24 14:02:10
me neither,2023-07-26 04:57:48
literally,2023-07-23 11:47:41
thats sort of part of being a character actor i mean not exactly you can still have range but you do get type casted into certain parts,2023-07-23 02:12:05
i agree it all feels like elliot imitating someone else i cant shake how performative and strained all his dialogue delivery sounds,2023-07-23 11:47:30
not being sarcastic i think hes great in small but pivotal roles like this and in the master and they are wildly different characters,2023-07-28 01:54:43
ahhh ok,2023-07-24 17:31:48
"in a movie full of people being naive about the bomb trumans line about the soviets never getting it which he actually said was the most naive statement of the film

the moment they dropped it on japan the soviets were certain to develop one they would have done it without fuchs or any other spy knowing that the bomb could work beyond theory was enough to make the pursuit worth it",2023-07-24 05:20:18
president hadnt seen the bomb go out live hes aware of its scale only in the papers oppenheimer and the other scientists know the sheer scale of destruction caused by the bomb there was at least one other scientist who was puking after the speech,2023-07-23 23:08:32
that’s not what he was even sorry about how do people miss this the “blood on his hands” wasn’t referring to the japanese people but the human race  the movie ends on that exact scenario oppenheimer knew what truman didn’t that these bombs could inevitably lead to the extinction of humans and that building a bigger bomb in order to “deys ex machina” our problems away was never gone work,2023-07-26 11:32:04
a quick google suggests that scene is actually very close to how it actually played out,2023-07-24 06:35:49
iirc the line in the movie is close to what he actually said in real life too,2023-07-24 07:22:11
oppenheimer still has to live with it but this scene is important in showing the consequences he created for himself he created something incredibly destructive and now the patrons he built it for are telling him to take his opinions and ,2023-07-28 08:05:54
"  the president is the one who actually had to make the call to drop the bomb and live with the decision 

the extent to which it bothers you to have to live with the decision depends on how much you open yourself up to the guilt and the enormity of it if you dismiss it or easily rationalise it then its not much truman might have been more directly responsible than oppenheimer but im sure he felt less guilty about it",2023-07-29 14:12:04
" i know the movie was trying to portray truman as a  in this scene but i was on his side

one thing i loved about this movie is that it is kind of like a fusionfission bomb with layers that set it off to make it be both very watchableentertaining and complex it’s structurally quite complicated nonlinear multiple perspectives multiple narrative arcs on a scenebyscene basis it’s pretty straightforward with fairly easytoparse character motivations and story goals “truman is a ” “oppie and jean have a messed up relationship” but the actors are able to bring complexity to this simplicity as are the beautiful visuals

so for this scene we’ve got it fitting nicely with the themes of people who wield power being inherently undeserving of it but we also see in oldman’s performance the extent to which this decision does weigh on truman and he is largely correct that this blood was not on oppenheimer’s hands he says some very foolish and thoughtless things that reflect his character but it’s also clear that his character goes far beyond those foolish thoughtless things",2023-08-17 20:03:06
well except for the nagasaki bomb truman was never told the military was gonna drop it because they treated it like any other weapon in the arsenal and you don’t inform the president every time you launch an artillery strike truman didn’t find out about nagasaki until well after it was dropped hence why now today the use of any nuclear weapon requires the president’s approval,2023-07-30 07:47:23
no there was no hanging of  just florence pugh being topless a few times,2023-07-23 00:02:52
what does it do tell you the most boring part of the movie,2023-07-24 22:35:30
runpee was one of those things i used only for particularly long or anticipated movies like oppenheimer but couldn’t justify it once they started with a payment model not that they don’t deserve a little cash,2023-07-27 15:10:18
"i used my last ‘peecoin’ to use this app… here’s what the little blurb at the start says “it was a real chore to find good peetimes most of the movie is a sequence of short scenes few of which last more than a minute”

i considered using my brothers phone to facetime myself so i could watch while peeing  i ended up holding it the whole time though asking people to hold their legs in so i could squeeze by pains me too much,2023-07-30 03:36:19

yep and also addams family values but this was the most recent role i watched of him he lost weight for s2  3 on purpose seeing him with a bit of weight again knocked me out but apparently he has been known for physical transformations for roles so good for him,2023-07-23 01:12:14
nah he is barry schweiber from freaks and geeks older brother of neal and slayer of lindsays ,2023-07-29 08:54:31
yes i almost didnt recognize him at first it was great seeing him in another scientific role like he had on numb3rs,2023-08-27 08:07:18
josh zuckerman,2023-07-29 04:44:19

"i wouldn’t say truman’s hand was forced truman just saw what was around him and the decision was clear how many millions died in europe how many millions died in russia how many millions died in asia 

so you’re gonna cry in front of this guy for a few hundred thousand of course he’s going to hand you a handkerchief",2023-07-25 13:32:14
this is pretty much how i saw it truman basically just said “this  is way bigger than you fam”,2023-08-20 21:03:19
we didn’t need to drop the bomb saving american lives was just propaganda japan was going to surrender but truman wanted unconditional and for japan to get rid of their emperor and adopt a democracy he knew japan wouldn’t go for that so he basically forced japan to force him to drop the bomb,2023-07-24 16:03:22
"think about it from trumans perspective a little more instead of stopping at the most hagiographic and favourable interpretation possible 

at the point at which the bombs were used japan was already communicating a willingness to surrender and conventional weapons firebombing raids in tokyo had already wrought immense destruction there the bombs were more about intimidating the ussr than anything else",2023-07-29 14:15:42
he was also a hack brought into replace henry a wallace fdrs previous vp who was way more progressive,2023-07-31 07:49:11
i mean you’re absolutely right but i’m talking about the depiction of them in the movie not irl,2023-07-25 00:18:49
yep one of the best quotes in the entire film do you think the people of hiroshima care who built the bomb they care who dropped it on them paraphrased,2023-08-07 14:45:59
to truman no oppenheimer can’t feel guilty that’s the cross that truman bears alone it’s a   decision to have to make and truman was well aware of the human cost he was the president his decision to drop the bomb absolved oppenheimer and everyone else who worked on the project of having any blood on their hands,2023-07-23 20:27:23
he was right… oppenheimer knew from the very beginning what was being created by him and only started to cry after the inevitable happened,2023-08-06 10:19:49
"the nuanced option was of course dropping the bomb 

the childish one is to doom a million american gis and japanese civilians to slaughter in operation downfall",2023-07-23 00:14:15

i thought the sound wave was going to shatter the windshield i didn’t know the factual bit about him doing it,2023-07-29 04:40:58

"the water ripples effect was mimic on the map when they were deciding which city should they bomb 

i took it that the government was talking about this so casually this dropping of bombs on populated cities that it was like they talking about raindrops hitting the water no big deal and that horrified oppenheimer",2023-07-24 23:53:54
the opening shot of the film,2023-07-23 23:11:50
it’s that but it’s also conveying the ripple effect the bomb will have on our history and how he believes it will ultimately lead to our destruction,2023-07-21 16:13:42
while also serving as an imagery of the chain reaction of elements when the bomb goes off,2023-07-23 11:40:50
youre both right it was after round 1 and during round 2,2023-07-23 17:15:40
"i agree coz the real video of oppenheimer quoting that line was probably the worlds first apology video caught on tape

you can really see it in his eyes just how much his work is weighing on him and he is saying i am become death with such immense regret

cillian murphys piercing eyes truly caught all of this in the movie",2023-07-25 00:44:05
very ridiculous i almost audibly groaned such a weird and poor way to integrate it,2023-07-22 07:51:04

i can’t help but think nolan should have listened that was the dumbest scene",2023-07-26 18:48:25
an entire book with 700 pages and nolan couldnt grab one other line it doesnt even make sense as someone who would be interested in the philosophy like oppenheimer was,2023-07-31 02:25:17
its crazy seeing how many famous people were in this i was like these guys look familiar for the interrogation scenes and then it turns out that one of them was a main role on scandal and the other was the lead role in dawn of the planet of the apes plus alden ehenrich too i havent seen him since solo but he delivered a great performance crazy seeing how nolan was such a big draw for these actors and some of them took insane pay cuts just to work with him plus his name is also getting butts in seats for a 3hour long rrated biopic,2023-07-24 20:05:54

you are correct i was in the front center section due to lack of good seats definitely not the imax™ experience i was expecting,2023-07-24 07:04:46

they did,2023-07-22 10:29:39
it was a very toxic relationship,2023-07-23 23:23:01
the movie made a hard swing from 210 to 910 the second matt damon came on screen  not solely because hes a great actor but also because the whole momentum of the plot immediately changed,2023-09-24 18:52:34
what was wrong with how women were portrayed,2023-07-25 02:08:49
i see it as a parallel to his remorse over the use of atomic weapons though hes torn up about it but ultimately he bears a significant portion of the responsibility he committed one of the greatest sins mankind could ever know and we shouldnt feel sorry for him,2023-07-31 05:49:59
stringing jean along the cheating maybe getting her killed im pretty sure they leave it vague whether it actually was suicide or a government arranged assasination and in the greater scheme of the film is representative of oppenheimers selfmartyrdom debate for building the bomb,2023-07-22 14:59:03
for beaching off with the other kens,2023-07-22 15:39:28
clearly,2023-07-22 09:53:57
it was tax evasion i think,2023-07-22 13:32:33
the cheating of course but it’s also about the bomb,2023-07-23 01:06:39
its pretty pathetic you got downvoted for asking a question lol reddit will never change,2023-07-25 02:43:06
uh yeah pretty obvious,2023-07-29 03:34:33
oppenheimer and kittys relationship started with both of them cheating on their spouses shes at least a little aware that hes not above infidelity,2023-07-23 18:10:03
incel alert,2023-07-26 01:15:54
thats kinda funny hope the movie doesnt whitewash kitty because she cheated on her previous husband with oppenheimer  she didnt get divorced from richard harrison until after she became pregnant with oppenheimer,2023-07-21 22:45:38
least sexist rmovies user,2023-07-22 23:54:32
um kittys testimony to the kangaroo court,2023-07-23 02:11:13
kitty oppenheimer‘s quote perfectly encapsulates robert’s outer and inner turmoil she greatly humanizes and contextualizes robert oppenheimer’s person how in the world you think the movie would better without the female characters is beyond me,2023-07-23 00:30:39
just tell us you dont get laid dude,2023-07-23 18:34:55
"that scene alone is scarier than most horror films imo like i never get scared with horror films never i think there are some interesting movies bur nothing that haunts me or prevents me from sleeping

that oppenheimer scene was scary as ",2023-07-30 08:22:27
i think the sobbing woman was in his mind  she represented a loved one of someone who died in hiroshimanagasaki as did the couple sobbing on the ground the man throwing up outside represented the effects of nuclear fallout,2023-08-28 22:02:30
wowza that sure is a thing to say in response to someone experiencing emotion in response to media designed to elicit emotion you remember feelings right,2023-07-31 01:18:09
ok but that scene you know the scene we’re talking about it isn’t about other countries it’s about america,2023-08-21 22:43:51
"this is really the culmination of everything i like about his movies i think 

it marries the spectacle and scale of his blockbusters with the more complex personal emotions of his early movies and successfully avoids his infamous bad habits like inaudible dialogue and excessive shaky cam 

it’s like you plucked him right out of his memento days but gave him a massive budget and an unrivaled cast to play with",2023-07-25 06:46:02
there is a behind the back shot of oppy standing before the bomb tower that was reminiscent of the joker bank heist opening shot,2023-07-24 06:37:51
pugh is the star of midsommar and was freaky in that one too,2023-08-28 09:22:24
i think it’s intended as kitty’s 1st person pov and hallucination,2023-07-26 19:47:13
but at the same time they do make it sexy its not perfect  because they cant just make it  they have to keep some semblance of artistic credibility so it has to be disturbing in some way but compare it to male nudity in movies its a completely different vibe when we get a full frontal or a butt of a man its usually just a man standing there grotesque and  they dont show you the  butt of a man slowly thrusting into a woman with his butt cheeks clenching and him sensually making love unless that movie is fifty shades of grey maybe which is a  movie but every time you see florence pughs  in this movie she is sensually in the act of sitting on top of the guy and  him its clearly just there for the men,2023-08-07 15:39:35
wish there was more of thirby too,2023-07-30 06:57:20
the shot of her in the hearing room was bizarre and out of place,2023-08-09 20:07:00
it was overly explicit for sure,2023-07-25 07:41:59
they also used it in the trinity test which was also really effective at least for me,2023-07-24 11:51:30
"ehhh that was the dumbest scene to me 

they could have just incorporated it during the trinity test scene where it belonged",2023-07-26 19:04:33
"honestly my only complaint about the film and its the most minor thing ever is that they didnt use the full quote 

vishnu is trying to persuade the prince that he should do his duty and to impress him takes on his multiarmed form and says",2023-07-23 01:53:43
“mein fuhrer i can walk”,2023-07-27 02:58:18
thats still the most powerful movie ending ive ever seen,2023-07-30 21:03:53
the senate hearing is part of the main plot without the senate hearing you don’t have a bad guy or an ending you just have big explosion,2023-07-24 22:47:31
all that political  that happened to oppenheimer after wwii is still a major part of his life and legacy though a biopic on him can’t ignore the way he was treated after the manhattan project,2023-07-25 01:38:29
go watch barbie,2023-07-24 17:26:09
dont worry the daily wire version will end with the detonations above hiroshima and nagasaki images of 1000s of japanese being incinerated and oppenheimer being carried around on peoples shoulders as queens we are the champions plays over the credits,2023-07-31 03:05:09
there are some controls in the us for instance an order to launch has to go through the chairman of the joint chiefs and the secretary of defense nixon is supposed to have drunkenly ordered strikes that obviously were not carried out,2023-07-22 07:11:59
i like how the film portrayed politicians and leaders those who are entrusted to drop or not drop the bomb to be inept and morally bankrupt a la strauss stimson and truman,2023-07-23 02:13:22
pretty much the only prevention system we have is literally and figuratively mad,2023-07-22 19:57:46
there are lots of controls and ultimately they’ve been tested in brinksmanship situations before the reality is no rational human will undertake an action that will result in their annihilation but accidents could happen…,2023-07-22 23:46:13
it was strongly hinted by the joint chiefs that they would have stopped trump though,2023-07-25 22:23:17
then again you can argue that nukes were what prevented a bloody wwiii from breaking out,2023-07-22 18:10:30
the scene where he can’t look at the photos and turns his head was enough for me intense,2023-07-29 04:59:33
most people would just die from exposure,2023-08-21 02:55:56
on the other hand we would never have tried to slowly push ukraine into nato if people take that still possible eventuality at face value we are the closest we have ever been to nuclear annihilation,2023-07-26 03:35:33
do i feel more intelligent than other people because i stated a fact about nuclear warheads no because it’s basic logic,2023-08-02 15:54:39
something we need to be careful about as a society is the idea that we’re doomed we’re not we still have ample opportunity to save ourselves and have made great progress even in the past decade to avert climate disaster and further nuclear disarmament,2023-07-21 23:10:14
"the atmosphere on  that was the most chilling and visually stunning scene in the film like burning the edge of a piece of paper the glow slowly gnawing away

literal chills you guys",2023-07-21 23:40:08
maybe im on a post cinema buzz but that was one of the memorable scenes ive ever seen the single scream from that girl in the crowd the sound mixing the lack of sound incredible,2023-07-22 22:35:04
gotta be one of the most bone chilling endings i’ve ever experienced absolutely brutal,2023-07-22 02:21:12
filming for oppenheimer began just as russia launched its invasion of ukraine so that would have weighed heavily on nolan as he made the movie,2023-07-22 02:28:51
i was shook stayed through the credits and hadn’t even realized i was completely frozen in my seat,2023-07-22 03:28:17
holy  i just realized those were probably practical effects too how did they do that,2023-07-22 00:05:02
i thought i knew the story but never knew about the risk of the explosion potentially detonating the atmosphere globally holy  ,2023-07-22 10:08:37
"the scene that followed after with explosions devouring our planet shell shocked me

same it was such an affecting scene i had no words",2023-08-07 13:17:43
i’m glad it had such an impact on you as well it’s definitely a movie that will make fantastic discussion material no easy answers for any of the questions it evokes,2023-07-22 19:42:35
whatre the downsides of solar geoengineering genuinely curious,2023-08-04 04:54:17
i teared up and if i weren’t in public i probably would have let myself break down lol,2023-07-22 03:36:08
with the war in ukraine and the threats from russia along with the doomsday clock closer to midnight than ever i don’t really see how people weren’t absolutely shook after watching that ending if it came out 10 years ago it wouldn’t have had nearly even close to the impact it has right now,2023-07-25 06:42:55
eh i think the current world could have been reached without nukes there would likely have been a second war in europe with the ussr but i do think thats better than the chance of mass annihilation although it probably would have been developed eventually either way,2023-07-27 03:56:34
oh that’s right thanks for reminding me what was said right before he said “i think we did”,2023-07-24 01:05:31

its too intuitive not to mean exactly that right they wouldnt just put the ripples in the watter just for fun right,2023-10-24 01:11:24
for a lot of the movie i was wondering why nolan cast emily blunt as kitty when she seemed to barely be in the movie and then i saw that scene and i understood,2023-07-22 01:23:32
that is the scene that gets her nominated rdj is going to win for his reveal scene about the same time,2023-07-22 23:31:56
"exactly and in light of that  why didn’t he stick up for himself more it was a breath of relief to see kitty being strong for him and it made me wonder why oppenheimer took all of their false attacks

that’s one thing i can’t figure out",2023-07-22 19:50:58
wasn’t the point that robb orchestrated his own demise as penance for his creation and become the martyr rather than father of the atomic bomb or death,2023-07-22 10:01:38
in saying that sorry late to the show only saw it like 3 hours ago the actor playing robb did an absolutely magnificent job i was expecting spittle to come flying out of his mouth i dont know whether robb was actually a true mccarthy acolyte or just out to win but the sneers the aggression the attitude the complete disregard for anything but pounding the person in front of him into the ground by whatever means necessary  jason clarke was unreal,2023-08-04 17:34:51
her accent was awful though,2023-07-23 08:03:52
" kitty embodies bad  to a t and it shows

bad  ",2023-07-22 01:46:52
she was wasted alright,2023-07-23 07:32:18
honestly that does make sense maybe he felt “being tarred and feathered” was a small punishment to pay for his “crimes” and his way of coping with the guilt,2023-07-22 23:54:43
robert knows the scientific community strauss thinks hes so much better and smarter than the nerds because hes a selfmade man and not some science nerd even telling robert that he had been invited to learn physics on several occasions and declined he has never understood the scientific community and clearly hes never really wanted to because he thinks he does i dont remember who said to robert that he isnt like so many others thinking hes self important hes actually important strauss is one whos only self important and i think robert knows that given enough time its going to come back around what the movie shows is that hes right what it doesnt show is that he goes on to still have major roles as a speaker and scientist but its kind of implied that his life was pretty great afterwards anyway as you see him being given his medal and accolades,2023-07-23 17:09:07
i believe he was thinking about his conversation with einstein einstein told him he’d have to go through this type of thing but eventually he’d get his accolades and dinner at the white house,2023-07-24 01:26:52
"emily blunt’s performance as kitty reminded me so much of bloberta puppington from moral orel strained relationship with husbands and abhorred their children yet find solace in alcohol

kitty and bloberta would absolutely get along well",2023-07-21 13:17:36
its definitely hyperbolic but i did think the two female characters were poorly written clichés  housewife and tragic yet beautiful  object,2023-07-21 17:31:49
what was his personal gain,2023-07-22 20:04:12
that is the thing that really had me glued they felt like real people because they were nolan  co really made every character feel alive in a way that films rarely do nothing felt dumbed down for the sake of the audience it respected that the audience would recognize the complexity of who these people really were,2023-07-22 07:08:13
roger robb and lewis strauss definitely came off villainy,2023-07-22 17:10:53
i noticed it a few other times you’d see the explosion and the sound would follow noticeably later,2023-07-24 04:13:23
i smiled clever christopher,2023-07-24 11:32:35
"i felt the visceral urge to cry during that scene the casualness with which they discussed such unimaginable death and destruction and kyoto being scratched off the list because the one guy honeymooned there and loved the city

nolan did an incredible job of making you feel the impact of all these choices without showing a single scene of the bombing itself",2023-07-31 03:29:03
i know months have passed since you posted your comment but if youre curious it was complete silence in my cinema in tokyo we are overall super quiet in cinema but 99 of this movie was dead silence,2024-04-09 10:29:37
yeah we got some great scenes with emily blunt and rdj but i feel it could’ve been cut down quite a bit once the bomb went off and we were dealing with the aftermath and the start of the arms race,2023-07-22 14:28:59
actions have consequences this is why it’s very important to mind who we place in the seats of power in our governments,2023-10-16 03:39:59

biopics and historical movies about major events but in the 3rd or 4th movie you name drop a fictional characterbadass to reveal this isn’t historical it’s a “what if” franchise and you explore how the world would be different with a super spy",2023-07-21 14:30:50

if were talking about familiar voice casey affleck for me they did a long sequence of not showing his face to give a tense reveal of who this mystery guy was but all i was thinking about was thats definitely casey affleck,2023-07-21 14:24:05
yes gary old man was in this movie,2023-07-21 13:14:53
i felt the same way about rami malek in this movie during his only lines i thought that is rami malek,2023-07-23 23:24:32
yeah i dont think hes a bad actor but he suffers from the ryan reynolds syndrome i could feel exactly what youve described in oppenheimer but i thought he did a good job inspite of it,2023-07-22 15:02:29
" damon is the kind of actor who just doesnt disappear into his role

sure but not everybody is harry tru… i mean not everyone is gary oldman",2023-07-23 03:06:50
i recommend the talented mr ripley matt damon is fantastic in it,2023-07-23 08:36:44
" damon is the kind of actor who just doesnt disappear into his role 

i see you havent checked out the talented mr ripley 1999",2023-08-21 23:04:12
agreed though i enjoyed it here his friendship with oppenheimer brought some nice levity to the film,2023-08-05 08:33:14
his acting got worse and lazy i remember watching courage under fire from the 90s and he disappeared into that role and now he just plays different iterations of matt “bourne” damon,2023-07-22 07:03:25
holy  i totally forgot he was in interstellar i was thinking that this is his first nolan movie,2023-07-23 12:01:39
same here they were good in those small roles but i think it would have worked better with unknown actors it was hard not to see them as actors themselves,2023-09-01 06:30:52
exactly this if you listen closely at the end when oppenheimer says i believe we did you can barely make out robin williams saying  he stole my line right after,2023-07-25 23:20:08
how about dem cyanidelaced apples,2023-07-24 02:58:54
he was playing a real person though they didn’t just throw that in to make matt damon’s character seem smarter than he was,2023-07-23 14:46:25
he really was he oversaw the construction of the pentagon,2023-07-24 02:59:39
hes nowhere near a  hes just a very direct military man compared to the sophisticated scientists who dealt with theory groves was the logistical workhorse behind the manhattan project and probably had a greater impact on the success than anyone else,2023-07-25 01:51:38

"aldens performance is going to be overshadowed by a cast full of amazing performances but he was such an excellent audience surrogate for the strauss side of the story most of his arc is conveyed through his  reactions and it just perfectly captures the evolving perception the audience has of strauss really great character

edit upon reflection i see a lot of similarities between aldens character and the character of rev hale from the crucible both are introduced as bythenumbers pencil pushers who are on the antagonistic side more out of circumstance than anything else but theyre gradually disillusioned by the system over the course of the story and land as one of the few morally agreeable characters it may just be the strong presence of mccarthyism in both stories but i see a lot of similarities between the two works",2023-07-22 19:51:35
for sure the scene about strategically choosing 11 cities striking out kyoto was a gesture i’m sure our adversaries at the time would not have extended to us imagine if it was dropped on nyc or london,2023-07-22 12:02:11
thats a possibility but were now judging them based on information they couldnt have known about information we cant know and ignoring the future which we have yet to see the stakes are the destruction of the world anyone who claims to know it was the right choice is a fool,2023-07-22 11:54:12
may be or it could have just as easily terrified people into launching them as soon as they were available or the fact that they were used then prevented them from being used anywhere else which leads to people forgetting the impact too soon and nuclear war starting in our future we cant know,2023-07-23 11:07:05
okay will there be enough for every person in the entire world otherwise your comment means nothing,2023-07-22 20:55:10
"which of course was a guess what they did was set a precedent to use nuclear weapons on civillian targets we have no idea what the long term ramifications will be it can just as easily turn out that because the horro of nuclear weapons were immediately unleashed the trauma will fade just in time for them to destroy the world 

again its the same problem where we say maybe they prevented nukes to be used before now when we still dont know what the long term cost could be maybe they wont be used because they were used then maybe they would have been used on a more horrific scale and that would have been the only effect

the truth is the us had poured too much money into the project not to use it and they made up whatever excuse they needed in order to justify it",2023-07-27 15:26:23
this isn’t entirely accurate there was an attempted coup against the govt faction who wanted to surrender by the japanese who wanted to keep fighting  even after being bombed twice without the bombs the position of the pro war faction would be much stronger,2023-07-25 14:50:38
there was a like about that in the movie i can’t remember it verbatim but it was effectively “should we be bombing a country that’s effectively surrendering” or something similar it was a bit of a throwaway line i think the narrative set out by the film was that the us wanted to make an example of their new capabilities,2023-07-22 16:47:01
" one thing the movie didnt get into is that japan was going to surrender soon anyway they even offered to but the us didnt like the terms

why should japan have been allowed to hold onto their conquered lands and not had to completely dismantle their whole country 

should we have let the nazis surrender and continue to be nazis and keep eastern europe

japan surrendered but knew we would never accept such terms",2023-07-30 06:39:52
but didnt japan not even surrender after the first bomb then finally did after the second,2023-07-23 02:39:54
what about japans occupation and colonization of korea china philippines indonesia malaysia singapore and etc once japan surrendered completely all those countries were finally free japan was trying to erase korean culture  kidnapping teen girls for comfort women using koreans for as slaves mass murdering chinese babies for target practice human experimentation torture etc theres a reason why many countries still hate japan but i think the west doesnt care because japan is the darling of the east for them or just ignorant on the suffering under colonization,2023-08-15 12:01:59
we had a draft during wwii,2023-07-25 03:30:15
"this high school level take keeps showing up  they had plenty of opportunity to surrender prior or after hiroshima and opted not to do so  there were factions considering it but even those weren’t going as far as the american terms

what would have happened had we held the bomb back is far more complicated than “japan would have just surrendered still”  and the japanese government had a part to play in that the same the germans did when  refused to surrender until they had fully bombed berlin into the ground and got within a mile of him  if either of those countries gave a  about their own people they would have both surrendered in the fall of 1944",2023-07-30 05:19:26

you could also link it to the growth in ai in how the invention of the a bomb opened the door for man to recklessly create tech that could wipe out humanity,2023-07-27 03:06:45

i kept wondering to myself “did they really cast rami malek to be in two scenes with no dialogue and just drop a clipboard in a hotel lobby”,2023-07-23 03:15:14
why oppenheimer never wears black gloves iirc and jean was a communist and he took off in the middle of the project to meet her in chicago the cia has done worse,2023-07-25 02:50:54
yeah i had that take too originally i was like  black glove the cia killed her but in the montage of the scene it felt like it was oppys hand pushing her down maybe its both the reality doesnt matter opp still felt complicit,2023-07-22 12:07:11
didnt he say something about an unexpected substance being found in her blood as if shed been purposely drugged and then drowned by someone else i havent had a chance to rewatch and confirm but id swear he did drowning yourself in the tub is an abnormal suicide method usually youd slit your wrists and arms and let yourself bleed out,2023-07-23 00:35:45
people were killed during the red scare that’s for certain when people are willing to ruin powerful innocent people’s lives they are generally also willing to  poor people,2023-07-26 14:22:09
this is the right take,2023-07-28 03:56:55
its a conspiracy theory that she was murdered but its not widely accepted or anything reality is only ambiguous in the sense that a lot of conspiracy theories make reality ambiguous which is to say not much,2023-07-21 20:54:00
yes but he does mention that it was unsigned though,2023-07-29 02:09:46
that guy gave me the fkin creeps and yes that cut with the hands was definitely alluding to the earlier conversation between matt damons character and oppenheimer where he mentions casey is unhinged and tying no loose ends,2023-07-21 23:35:56

me too that dude deserves more of a career i was really sad to see that jack quaid as richard feynman didnt even get a line,2023-07-21 08:29:08
he was one of the scientists along with josh peck and jack quaid he only had like 2 speaking scenes though,2023-07-21 17:55:37
he was the one who threw up,2023-07-23 23:13:12
he also played a scientist in black mirror and was really good i’ll be honest if you had told me five years ago that josh hartnett would be playing two different scientists within a span of months i would have been… very confused,2023-07-24 11:53:01
"he just gets hotter honestly 

he also had a great line that wasn’t so important to the film but very insightful about the type of person his character was and people who still exist today 

oppenheimer asks if he doesn’t care about integration 

he says he wants to vote for it not talk about it 

incredible interaction that sums up so much about american politics in two short lines",2023-07-26 19:54:12
i actually smiled at him showing up i remember watching that movie when it came out and liking him but never saw him again seeing him pop up years later in a nolan movie made me kind of think like “hey good for you man”,2023-07-23 12:40:37
i mainly knew him the disney tv movie “‘twas the night” good to see him still getting roles in big films like this,2023-07-24 17:01:52

ohhhh  yeah its a microcosm of nuclearconflict escalation,2023-07-23 02:14:46
oppenheimer didnt actively get strauss denied the movie shows his colleagues speaking up against what they saw as unjust treatment of him but he didnt tell them to do that also strausss denial was only partly for oppenheimerrelated reasons but they didnt bother showing the rest,2023-07-24 04:31:35

ill admit i gave a slight chuckle when truman said dont let that crybaby back in here but i think it was more from the emotions of the scenes leading up to it  any time theres a bit of brevity in that situation it helps to laugh,2023-07-28 19:28:35

ooh yeah that totally reads also in the way that shcherbina and groves are well versed in the ebbs and flows of the political world whereas legasov and oppenheimer are much more idealistic and stubbornly working from an assumption that things are going to shake out rationally,2023-07-24 14:11:43
but if you used the hoop wouldn’t the ball just bounce off the mantle,2023-07-24 13:08:23
yeah i could not have cared less about that arc,2023-07-23 05:19:25
completely agree it was really unclear what was at stake with him losing his military clearance and why that was the whole focal point of the movie,2023-07-24 21:35:38
thats exactly what i keep thinking after the main event of the trinity test its another entire hour of courtroom drama rdj becomes this twist villian and the stakes are him trying to remove oppenheimers secret clearance generally ruin his reputation and put him as a communist sympathiser but for what because of an imagined slight ten years before i didnt catch many reasons to care about any of that stuff,2023-07-23 18:02:55
"it wasn’t subtlety it was cowardice 

subtlety would have been burned and tattered kimonos or hints of destruction of japanese architecture instead they had a blonde lady laughing and then in the next scene she’s screaming

the tenet score didn’t have memorable motifs but it had a lot of character,2023-07-24 12:24:02
hard disagree in my opinion the soundtrack should feel like another character in the movie it also really helps that the trinity  entirely muted as well as the gym scene but music is subjective in the end,2023-07-26 08:41:27
people have drank the kool aid you put it perfectly silence wouldve actually had a much more powerful impact than the music which felt unnecessarily instructive existential dread music every 5 seconds ruined the movie for me,2023-08-03 15:11:00

maybe another director wouldve portrayed the trinity test scene with an immense feeling of scale like denius villeneuve comes to mind as someone whos super talented at that and maybe that would also have worked or even been better idk but what nolan did here accomplished what he intended i feel imo",2023-07-24 19:47:40
it wasn’t effective for me,2023-07-23 22:03:05

for people who are perhaps interested in los alamos and further perspectives of the scientists working on the manhattan project beyond the movie richard feynman would go on to deliver an hour long lecture entitled “los alamos from below later on in his career he tells his experience of the manhattan project as a much more junior researcher it’s incredibly insightful and absolutely crazy to think of these mid 20 year olds who have just finished their phds involved in all this also he’s a fantastic speaker,2023-07-23 11:39:57
i thought it was ambiguous,2023-07-22 02:44:55
people have already addressed the ambiguity but i want to add on that what you saw was right,2023-07-22 23:58:52

they were actually reading the kama sutra but that would be too much for the censors,2023-07-23 20:49:30
what do you mean by it,2023-08-05 05:12:57
honestly i was surprised to see how popular a movie it is here my showing and the next two showings after mine were sold out as i was heading in a group of teenage girls were by in their tickets for the last showing of the night,2023-07-21 20:38:12
they put cgi dress here in india too i think they did it for every country with strict censor guideliness regarding public movies,2023-07-22 05:10:19

not really gotta assume the locals are used to it,2023-07-21 20:41:20
i watched it without censorship and i kind of hope she had a dress on instead she was  for the majority of her scenes and i don’t see how that’s necessary we can understand they had a relationship without it,2023-08-17 22:06:33
yep  felt like nolan hired a middle schooler to write the  scenes then did everything else himself,2023-08-02 11:12:14

almost kittys entire dialogue in the trial scene was as it happened,2023-07-27 23:36:34
"agreed but his female characters almost have no character development outside of their relationship to the male lead we’ve seen this type of nolan wife before emily blunt just took the material and elevated it above and beyond

for kitty’s major scene nolan benefitted from lifting a lot of her lines directly from the historical transcript",2023-07-24 11:25:16
"i thought that was the most cynical single moment of the film people in my theater laughed at the line and that seems a lesson in itself 

were that resigned to the amorality and corruption in our leadership that americas sweetheart™ matt damon can cheekily deliver that line and we register it as a joke",2023-07-23 02:04:51
honestly coming from nolan whos come across as neoliberal in the past this film was fascinating in how it showed a very honest rendition of our government from the rabid anticommunism in the face of the  nazis to its cultivation of near rabid dogs to the fact a single government official ruined opps life because he was slighted once is brutally honest about our history,2023-07-23 03:18:52
this line got the biggest laugh of the night a mix of uncomfortable laughs surprised laughs and laughs at the deadpan delivery,2023-07-23 06:17:53
thank you,2023-07-22 03:06:19
yeh i like this take also will have to wait and see what nolan says about it i suppose,2023-07-22 03:04:49
why did she refuse to shake tellers hand at the end,2023-07-22 05:46:15
now i need to go rewatch it and see exactly how many seconds elapse between the silence and shockwave hitting them,2023-07-21 13:17:30
not only that the movie has a loud non stop score throughout yet nothing during the explosion until the shockwave is felt,2023-07-21 15:44:17
i thought they were 20 miles away which would take the sound a good 1m40s to reach them,2023-07-22 06:52:55
i knew that fact and was dreading the sound wave and explosion as everything was washed in atomic light such a great scene,2023-07-21 19:04:19
"that was not 25 seconds

x200b

that was at least a minute",2023-07-21 18:28:09
yeah i went to some space shuttle launches and they have the same effect  you see the launch then sometime later the sound hits you,2023-07-22 20:50:33
fun fact a quick wikipedia search says it took 40 seconds for the sound to reach the observers further web sleuthing shows general groves’ report also gives the same time delay ie 40 seconds ,2023-08-07 13:47:55
it sort of shows that in the movie but not that long,2023-07-22 23:13:11
do you know how they were able to look at the bright light emitting from it not long after it went off i figured that would be dangerous,2023-07-23 14:03:17
glad someone else caught this,2023-07-23 08:12:36
they already introduced that in some of the explosive lenses test scenes thankfully an elegant way to remind people,2023-07-22 18:45:54
at one point i threw my hands up in despair lolll no chance i was gonna hear what they were saying i already have a hard time processing speech during high ambient noise,2023-07-24 12:11:24
"the whole movie is an artistic decision we don’t have a soundtrack playing in real life with oppenheimer voicing over either 

the sound cutting off and only hearing oppenheimer breathe throughout that sequence was an artistic choice",2023-08-03 02:42:08
"you werent wrong but you didnt have to be super abrasive at the end 

i was going to point out that with big explosions like that sound comes much later which is scary as ",2023-07-21 06:42:11
you sound like a dork ,2023-07-21 09:43:10
 is wrong with you ,2023-07-21 14:09:21
this it’s a movie theater moment i’ll never forget,2023-08-05 03:40:55
did your 70mm screening have flickering in the bright areas of the frame,2023-07-24 00:35:19
he does i’m amazed how cillian looks almost like oppenheimer to a striking degree he captured the solemn and stoic demeanor of him nicely,2023-07-22 14:14:48
"its insane how the man who literally worked on the most secretive us project and literally helped won the war gor clearance revoked

i know several of my buddies have clearance ans they aint no oppenheimer",2023-07-25 11:39:24

you are yeah,2023-07-29 12:49:39
maybe 2 hours in after the bomb blew up and everything settled down at least 3 people in my theater got up to go to the bathroom lol,2023-07-21 04:55:50
you’ll know it’s coming,2023-07-21 06:15:18
same right as the bomb goes off this chick was just casually climbing up the stairs and leaving i had to clench my teeth from cussing,2023-08-01 07:30:59
i went during the day today to avoid this and ended up in an empty theater except me and a high school couple who talked through the whole thing including this scene lol i’m gonna have to try again,2023-08-10 23:31:54
if you are accompanied by a parent  i also dont think they knew what they were getting into,2023-08-01 11:04:06
it’s just the fact that it was an amazing scene in a memorable way which is why people are commenting how great it was i’m sure most people who watch the film know that it takes time for the sound of the explosion to reach the ears of the people that were watching miles and miles away it was just a beautifully shot scene and worth mentioning how wonderful of a job nolan did with it,2023-07-21 07:37:11
why are you all over the comments saying this most people know that besides if it wasnt scientifically accurate would itve made it less impressive ,2023-07-21 16:06:30
isnt it pretty common to show trailers for rated r movies at movies that are rated r i cant remember the last time i saw a rated r movie in theaters where there wasnt a horror movie trailer as those are often rated r,2023-07-21 20:42:24
my theater dimmed the lights immediately after that trailer ended it was so creepy,2023-07-26 12:34:17
oppenheimer had several jump scares ,2023-07-22 01:02:56
yeah jump scares in horror movies really just  me off and i involuntarily jumped like three times during that trailer and the volume in my theater was loud,2023-07-21 16:35:46
i literally closed my eyes during that trailer not because its scary it just felt like being assaulted,2023-07-22 08:13:25
same i cannot do horror and i hate scary things especially with such loud volume i was genuinely feeling panicky during it i didn’t watch but the audio of the sounds creepy voices and screaming was really difficult for me to hear  can they keep horror trailers out of non horror movies,2023-07-24 07:44:01
the scene of his speech right after the trinity test was definitely horrorlevel unsettling,2023-08-07 04:06:08
apparently a biographical movie about the creation of weapons of mass destruction which have already been used to  over 200k people and could eventually destroy all human life on earth is far less scary than the latest blumhouse ghost story,2023-08-07 07:44:35

ooof oppenheimer wasnt half as anxietyinducing as beau,2023-07-21 13:40:00
rdj was fantastic but if they removed his entire subplot throughout the movie and restructured the exposition you could have the climax with opps traumatic hallucinatory speech with the film ending around his attempts to dissuade gary oldman from nuclear development rdj played the role fantastically but it was such an underwhelming and petty way to end the film and the second use of the intense dialoguebomb flash gimmick in the interrogation room was also an anticlimax,2023-07-21 23:56:02

especially because people are being more selective with their movies choices in theaters postpandemic if a movie looks safe and the reviews were meh then people are likely to stay home people want to see directors taking risks like in oppenheimer,2023-07-22 00:45:30
i went to a lot of screenings at the seattle international film festival back in may and the number of super amazing intelligent thoughtful poignant films i saw was staggering and its really disappointing to think that most of them wont ever get the attention they deserve,2023-07-23 02:31:18
it’s been proven time and time again this isn’t true though nolan and tarantino are the only director names left that really pull a large audience with non ip scripts others have tried and bombed,2023-07-24 05:20:25

"i disagree compared to other works of science fiction nolan does not really allow his audiences to think for themselves

i think you secretly agree because you say the audience is craving something  that isnt telling you how to feel but then you say it simply gives you no other option but to feel what the character feels

perfectly put you described my exact feelings 100 i liked the film quite a lot actually but this was probably my main complaint with it that and some of the clunky very expositionheavy dialogue scenes with rdj towards the end where he’s explaining the situation to his assistant,2023-07-21 23:55:26
100 agree i know i shouldnt go into movies with a predisposition about what it should be but the whole plot about the race against the nazis was forgotten about instantly i wanted to see what heisenberg was doing and why they didnt get theirs done,2023-07-23 21:10:58
" we never really are shown much about the actual discoveries at los alamos that got it there

i think oppenheimer himself maybe not in the movie said that no actual new discoveries were needed to build the bomb but i get what you’re saying i thought there would be more exposition scenes about the building of the bomb—which is really a surprising thing to say for a nolan film

for example i don’t think they talked that much in detail about u238 and u235 critical mass etc this film is not what i expected which is saying something because i’ve been a nolan fan for more than a decade",2023-07-22 05:11:20
there is an older movie about the manhattan project called  man and little boy that may be worth watching i havent seen it in forever though john cusack is in it i think,2023-07-22 05:50:08
veritasium released a 30 min video a few days ago it was super educational to watch before watching the movie ,2023-07-22 06:08:52
completely agree don’t get me wrong i enjoyed the movie but i went in expecting it to be more focused on the science and less on his political issues when he first started talking about how light behaves like particles and waves i was like “alright here we go” then it just quickly cut from scene to scene and glossed over everything,2023-07-27 04:11:04
i was shocked there was no mention of john von neumann,2023-07-30 01:19:02
yeah thats my one minor gripe i just got out of seeing it and me and my buddy grabbed a burger and some beers after and we both looked up how the bomb actually worked was curious as to what the main core and the one pice they added to the bomb was,2023-07-25 01:43:57

this aspect is fascinating you dislike strauss cause hes a conniving politician hellbent on petty vengeance but hes not entirely wrong about oppenheimer ,2023-07-22 07:57:15
i’ll just say this about the movie since i haven’t seen it commented and i know this is unpopular but everything in the last act draaaaggged for me i understand it’s important to his story but sheesh it was just reiterating a lot of what we already saw earlier in the movie i feel as if they could have still had a really nice movie even if they trimmed it down a bit still enjoyed it tho,2023-07-24 06:31:00

same here they could have been more subtle about it felt like an early marvel movie making a reference to thanos or something lol,2023-07-24 03:40:07
i might be wrong but my understanding ia that until john herseys book was published everyone outside of japan was out of the loop no one really had any concrete idea of what the immediate bodily impact and long term devastation would be,2023-07-21 05:31:18
"the choice to never show the victims of the bombs during the slideshow scene was also sublime rather than showing them for manipulation 

oppenheimer overall is a movie that’s unabashedly unsentimental",2023-07-22 01:18:54
"to only hear about it on the radio to feel cut out of the loop like oppenheimer was

i thought that was a great decision by nolan  also with the scene a little after when oppenheimer attended the seminar about the immediate effects of the bombs  they dont show us the slide show being shown to the audience he was in but he saw the first slide then looked away for the rest while the audience gasped at the photos",2023-07-23 14:50:32
tbh i always thought it was nagasaki that really disturbed him especially how quick it was bombed after hiroshima,2023-07-22 10:36:35
really i feel it was a major cop out to not show the carnage of the bomb it diminished the impact,2023-07-21 08:52:03
the  scene in the hearing room felt like a horror movie,2023-07-21 14:49:08
but how much of that feeling was him or kitty oppenheimer doesn’t react to anything kitty sees everything,2023-07-21 15:47:10
i realized on my second viewing the scene where it goes white while he’s being interrogated is actually the trinity test or any atomic bomb through the window it blew my mind when it clicked,2023-08-06 19:12:44
i havent stopped thinking about that final scene monumental is absolutely the word for it theres something about those final moments that feel even bigger than the rest of the film,2023-07-22 17:06:29
i know exactly what you mean because my eyes started welling up as well and for me it was out of staggering dread and terror and being put in his headspace while he was feeling the tremendous weight of what he unleashed,2023-07-22 02:53:30
i felt sick to the stomach when everyone was cheering,2023-07-23 10:13:26

"if it’s anything like fight club you shake the camera and then stabilize to the persons face after that doesnt seem to be the case here because his entire face is clear the whole time but if you have the camera back quite a bit and zoomed in i could still see the effect working 

that does require digital processing of the captured film though if he didn’t do that then he just straight up shook the background with machinery or man power",2023-07-21 22:13:43

the empty man by david prior felt very much like a horror movie done by nolan after he read some laird barron short stories,2023-07-21 04:36:46
the boat being torpedoed and the oil spill are horrifying for sure,2023-07-21 07:58:59
the subtle screaming was  me up,2023-07-21 13:46:02
"it was great but… i wanted more 

i wanted to see that imagined destruction taken all the way depicted as only nolan could that conversation between them at the end felt like a classic nolan twist in that the terror of what they were discussing of complete nuclear  annihilation had been not explicitly addressed beforehand i felt it shock me into feeling something that perhaps lurks somewhere deep inside everyone",2023-07-21 07:30:55

" i can’t even imagine a bigger bomb

the underwater hardtack was 8 kilotons  as in equivalent to 8000 tonnes of tnt  

russias latest icbm that only came into service last year can carry warheads that are estimated to be between 1825 megatons per warhead  a megaton is a thousand times larger than a kiloton so using the lower end estimate of 18 megatons one warhead is two thousand two hundred fifty times the size of hardtack  and that single icbm can carry 10 warheads that can each bomb a different target over a 150200 miles range

while i somewhat agree the bomb in the trinity test was much smaller than most of the bombs in those clips the bomb that morning outputted around 25 kilotons the bombs in these clips are magnitudes larger at megatons,2023-07-21 08:14:19

no truman was not “the trump of his time” but the haberdasher from missouri did have an earthy plainspoken ordinariness about him he was probably only of average intelligence and was supposed to have broken down in tears upon learning that roosevelt had died as he felt utterly unqualified for the office of president however i think he did his best to make up for this by surrounding himself with experts of different kinds and weighing their opinions on matters his “regularguyness” also allowed him to cut through the washington bs at times,2023-07-23 16:33:08

well real truman did want to take the guilt he did say to other people involved too but he also insulted oppenheimer but not to his face,2023-07-25 19:21:11

i loved that and josh peck is in like 4 scenes and says 2 words the cast is stacked,2023-07-21 17:15:23
i was sitting there bewildered that they had cast him in the movie as an extra without any lines  but then of course he finally got some spotlight,2023-07-21 21:11:21
so im less familiar with rami malek as an actor was he putting on a character with his weird vibes or is that just his vibe,2023-07-22 19:15:57
did jack quaid have a single line not like he really needed one but he might as well have been replaced by an extra to be less distracting,2023-07-23 04:02:39
its was long by my bladder standards but over all it was amazingly paced,2023-07-21 06:46:31
yea i didnt feel the 3 hour runtime at all in a way it makes you feel how much pressure oppenheimer was under and how relentless it was,2023-07-21 05:01:59
it also depicts the most important event in mankind’s history so i hope they can sit through 3 hours of great story telling to know maybe a little bit more of the world they live in,2023-07-21 10:44:10
tbh it didnt feel that long to me feel it went at a good pace,2023-07-21 23:29:38
i didn’t think it felt three hours long until the hearing scene which sorta dragged a little bit not enough to detract from my overall enjoyment though especially with how it pays off,2023-07-22 17:19:39
i had a different reaction to the beginning it takes off so quickly and the dialogue is or at least in my theater  not super clear and it took a little bit to get into the flow it definitely felt intentional but the first 20 minutes was a lot very quickly but it all worked and everything i thought i might be missing was cleared up as it continued,2023-07-21 06:18:26
it was fast paced and the switching of timelines helped it to not feel slow,2023-07-21 19:37:16
there’s this thing especially among men where they’re afraid to just sit silently and experience the emotional impact of the film they can’t be scared so during a horror movie they have to talk to break the tension etc,2023-07-21 13:50:09
that sucks i saw this in a mostly full theater and there was not a peep it was an experience it was an 11am showing so it might have been partly that i was in an older crowd,2023-07-27 01:19:02
"i just saw it and while i wasnt bored i was longing for some scenes to breath a little longer

the constant jumping around definitely holds ones attention but i found myself wanting to stick around certain moments a little longer

reviews were calling this a 9 or 10 film and while id agree its a 10 on a technical standpoint it felt like a 7 or 8 for me from a narrative standpoint

maybe i just need to let the film soak in before i see it again maybe im just dead inside

edit oh and thats just my personal take i still think people should see it because its definitely a high caliber movie",2023-07-21 03:54:10

eli5 why einstein was sort of a pariah  criticized at that time  my education taught me that einstein pioneered the theory of relativity and is the greatest scientist along with isaac newton,2023-07-24 00:04:41

you should read jonathan hickman’s manhattan projects comic book series it’s precisely that with oppenheimer fermi einstein general groves it’s pretty much like that but super weird and fun,2023-08-19 06:38:47
we are also all very familiar with heisenberg,2023-07-21 08:05:20
the movie also props him up as a massive figure the first time we see him oppenheimer immediately mentions their known disagreements but also acknowledges his stature and strauss fawns over him like a fanboy that scene alone which sets up so many events in the film could convince an unaware viewer of the mans importance,2023-07-21 12:55:46
its weird seeing einstein depicted in anything that you think he lived hundreds of years ago,2023-07-21 08:11:01
i met edward teller in 1980 talked to him for just a minute and got his autograph after he had given a talk,2023-07-21 23:42:13
i feel like the name drops were so frequent though for armchair science fan like myself you get bohr heisenberg fermi and even moreso because i love history so there’s a lot of nice political name drops in there too,2023-07-22 02:53:46
"i think you’re definitely right i’m an organic chemist but in undergrad i was a chemistryphysics doublemajor i geeked out whenever they brought in a new famous scientist

one thing that i think would have been pretty cool is during that last scene with einstein while they were flashing forward to oppenheimer fermi and others getting awards it would have been cool to show the next generation of famous scientists there through the whole movie there was a bit of a changing of the guard feeling when talking about the first generation of quantum physicists bohreinstein and the new ones oppenheimer fermi could have been cool to give a shoutout to higgs or someone else coming up in late 20th century",2023-07-21 21:08:53
i thought einstein was meg ryans eccentric uncle,2023-07-21 09:09:08
fermi is incredibly famous probably more so than oppenheimer,2023-07-24 02:44:48
totally agree i knew bohr and heisenberg from school but i couldn’t put a face to them,2023-07-22 06:14:54
"oh man im a huge fan of the history of particle physics and the name drops made me feel like i was watching the nerd avengers

so many of those  deserve to be more widely known",2023-08-09 02:41:52
i knew neils borh heisenberg and if i am correct richard feynmann,2023-07-28 14:28:27
good points i also hope this helps change this the world would be a better place if more kids had niels bohr posters on their wall,2023-07-24 04:02:10
my theatre actually had their aha moment when bohr was shown it was nice to see i was watching movie with people who had atleast some knowledge of the stuff going on,2023-07-23 17:11:04

jfks existence has been introduced and im excited to see nolans origin story flick establishing this character and possible setup of a new cinematic universe,2023-07-24 02:47:46
right and remembering that and knowing that they shot on bw and color film i knew there had to be color footage somewhere later or at least figured,2023-07-21 13:48:53
and it kind of solidified the decision to go with bw vs color for the different points of view i was wondering if there would be one of nolan’s signature  around with different points in time and editing and it really came together in that last scene,2023-07-22 02:57:01
same with the flowers being moved at that table scene those kind of moments help make the scene memorable for when you come back to it,2023-07-30 20:59:02
"scenes in black and white were from—or framed by—other character’s perspectives strauss was the original one to recount the einstein pond scene only strauss saw einstein leave the pond looking bleaksour revisiting a scene in color the h bomb reception table einstein at the pond meant that scene was being framed by oppenheimer’s perspective 

all of the senate confirmation scenes were in black and white essentially because oppenheimer was never there to have a perspective on it",2023-07-21 08:54:48
"their awards weren’t for einstein or oppy 

it was for the persons present  awarding them to essentially make amends and forgive themselves for that they’ve done or said about them in the past it’s not then saying sorry it’s for them to make themselves feel better",2023-07-23 03:35:22
same i took it to be about how the next generation of scientists patronizes the greats who “haven’t done anything lately” and the politicians pin medals on them to get them to shut up and go away,2023-07-22 03:58:45
for how good a movie it was interstellar also fumbled with it a bit but thats only when compared to most other nolan films that usually end in grand ways,2023-08-29 10:04:29
they didnt do the scene for you they did it for them,2023-07-21 20:04:19
just because its more impactful he asked einstein if he remembered the conversation where he thought if they used the bomb they would set off an unstoppable chain reaction i took that to mean the nuclear arms race,2023-07-21 02:49:55
oh i thought he said ‘i prayed it did’,2023-07-21 09:22:51
"my gut reaction was it was a dead cat from the spreading wave of what is clearly ignition but the man was famously anti theories that suggest quantum immortality so i dont think that is what it means but its my best guess  

i dont think its saying a h bomb could destroy the world but every time any nuke is used all possible outcomes happen and it some the world ends hence the past tense 

but hey quantum immortality has always saved us so it must also save us going forwards right",2023-07-21 14:57:37
"i think the point is about split world hypothesis as it show what i believe is ignition after a lots of nukes are tested but only one does it 

hence the past tense of i think we did but famously the man was anti theses sorts of theories but that could also be suggesting admitting they where wrong which also works 

pretty nasty dead cat to throw out at the end",2023-07-21 15:02:25
"quite the opposite oppenheimer gave me so much to chew on

i won’t be thinking about the scene when i’m 95 though… 90 of the people here will forget about the last scene in 6 months",2023-07-27 13:07:56
"also perfectly portrays how ego miscommunication and petty disagreements can set the stage for a conflict that destroys both people in the process

essentially the inherent flaw of human nature that cold war is built upon and brings us close to exchanging nuclear weapons even today

the chain reaction was never in the atmosphere it was within the paranoid human psyche",2023-07-21 06:24:24
a lot of discoveries and breakthroughs were more basic so to say because quantum mechanics as a field was so young that any progress seemed huge for example diracs phd thesis concerns things taught at an undergraduate level today so everyone who discovered something had their work built upon by exponentially more people and thus got more famous than scientists of today until we experience some sort of new field where individuals contribute not teams,2023-07-21 13:21:04
something people cant really fathom is just how much everything changed in the first half of the 20th century all the theoretical physics that they showallude toreference in this film was a shift in science that never happened before and probably wont ever happen again  all the technology we have today works because they did solve so much of the puzzle they figured out what the rules and math behind physical reality are,2023-07-22 23:54:57
my understanding is that we do have quantum computers they just fail to do anything better than traditional computers and are actually far far worse at the most elementary things right now,2023-07-24 05:52:42
"einstein was hugely popular and recognized after special relativity  but at the time there wasnt any socially relevant use for it  it was amazing that someone could disprove newtonian mechanics but it was also puzzling and hard to understand there was a lot more interest in the publicmedia sphere about science after the industrial revolution huge progress and optimism about humanity collective ability to do amazing things was a common belief 

we still have that but it is drowned out by everything needing to be some kind of gadget or tech that is marketable people know brands but not the people that work for them overtime there was also a lot of skepticism as a backlash against the many downsides that came with scientific discovery unethical medical experiments eugenics and the toxic pollution that poisoned workers and the environment",2023-08-11 06:19:08
"i can understand about entertainers they are lauded far too much for normal things

but a good chunk of those ceos or cofounders are inventors sure they went an entrepreneurial way but that doesnt make them anything less same with athletes being at peak human health and representing and winning for your country should be lauded",2023-07-23 17:18:34
well i mean sam altman and musk are “project managers” over huge advances in applied science similar to oppenheimer it’s just corporations are where this work and research gets done now not government projects,2023-07-24 05:56:45
i mean in 30s molecular physics was wordy as well now all science undergrads have a really good understanding of it,2023-07-24 22:54:39
they should have sent a poet,2023-07-23 08:49:36
dont feel bad some people are brilliant but  teachers or had at explaining things ive attended conferences with my partner whos a scientist and some people some people can just simply things and some can just see it as is,2023-07-27 04:51:24
dont over half of the superheroes out there canonically have a stem background,2023-07-23 21:51:08

"seeing truman wave the white handkerchief in his jacket to oppenheimer after opp said he has blood on his hands with the bomb screams  behavior

i can imagine oppenheimer being absolutely furious to see the president treat him like he did must’ve brought back horrible memories of being bullied as a kid",2023-07-21 13:41:04
truman or oppenheimer was bullied,2023-07-30 08:03:18
yes i was dying with anticipation hoping they included that line but they didnt i wonder if it just didnt fit right with the tone of the movie,2023-07-21 04:06:37
never let that  cretin in here again,2023-07-22 20:19:20
i think the thing that really  truman in that scene was oppenheimer thinking he solely bears the responsibility when the movie up to that point tells us it was a collaboration  it does come off as dickish but the audience at least understands that what oppenheimer feels isnt his to bear alone,2023-07-21 06:16:24
"what i find particularly great is the part mentioning about how the soviets dont have a bomb trumans hubris was a weaklink and not taking oppenheimer seriously over negotiations came back to haunt everyone which was surprisingly pointed out earlier in the film but it still came away with so much weight because of how brazen the assumption was 

powerful stuff by gary legitimately would want to consider him for an outside oscar if he can somehow qualify for supporting",2023-07-21 17:25:40
"did truman truly feel guilt did oppenheimer

considering that oppenheimer told truman directly that he felt he had blood on his hands prompting truman to cut their meeting short and tell his aides never to allow that son of a  the white house againi think that answers the question",2023-07-21 17:49:44
"a lot of historians would say that truman never made a decision to drop the bomb no one did its use was assumed through the entirety of its development and the actual decisionmaking with respect to its targeting deployment etc did not involve truman whose only contribution was to tell stimson to make sure the targets were military in nature stimson then removed kyoto from the target list

however after nagasaki truman decided to take unilateral control of the final decision making for any future bombs he never recorded any of his personal feelings at the time but henry wallace secretary of commerce wrote in his diary on august 10th

truman said he had given orders to stop atomic bombing he said the thought of wiping out another 100000 people was too horrible he didnt like the idea of killing as he said all those kids",2023-07-21 13:50:26
i remember hearing a recording from the 60s or so where truman was interviewed he said well it was a weapon they said would result in victory i approved its use no regrets didnt seem to bother him too much although i think he was worried about the current 1960s arms race,2023-07-21 06:52:35
i mean its easy to say dropping the bombs was the best option when only looking at the past since we dont know if it will eventually lead to civilisation ending,2023-07-22 09:57:21
"  as a historian 

as a historian you shouldnt be making best option decisions compared to a timeline that didnt occur

bs alarm",2023-07-22 12:27:53
"but even in the movie they drop hints that japan was about to give in

everything was all about nazis how they surrender and they seem keen on not trying to continue it but leslie groves stop that conversation so they can continue building it

even then in true history japan was about to surrender they just wanted to negotiate with soviets but the us didnt want to because they wanted the soviets to witness what they build since they were also racing soviets to build one because they were desperate in being the innovators but werent thinking how it would change the world",2023-07-21 20:25:12
it’s ego all the way down if memento was nolan’s examination of memory and inception was his examination of dreams oppenheimer is a deep dive in the power destructive or not of ego,2023-07-23 00:10:46
"i’m interested that so many people’s takeaway from that scene is ego 

oppenheimer was a theoretical physicist which is said explicitly several times throughout the movie he worked in theories his life’s work to this point was theoretical calculations on the deaths of stars when he didn’t even know whether or not stars died 

he throws himself into the work of making a bomb nobody realised was possible it escalates he achieves this giant goal after years of work  and suddenly it hits him that his work is not theoretical any more his work had consequences and that consequence was the death of 200000 people   a fact that seems to hit him at the gymnasium where everyone is celebrating his wonderful achievement 

he then spends the rest of his life knowing the genie cannot be put back into the bottle so fighting for the next best thing  sharing intelligence so the result is mad not one country developing the biggest possible bomb that they will end up using if there isn’t a big enough deterrent and his final act of genius is fighting a losing battle to get his clearance back in order to get all of this on official record 

i really didn’t see it as ego at all but almost the opposite  that he finally snapped out of the ‘work towards this big goal and you’ll be a hero’ and understood what consequences his actions really had 

and remember the full quote

 a few people laughed a few people cried most people were silent i remembered the line from the hindu scripture the bhagavad gita vishnu is trying to persuade the prince that he should do his duty and to impress him takes on his multiarmed form and says ‘now i am become death the destroyer of worlds’ i suppose we all thought that one way or another”

it was his ego that caused him to build the bomb not to regret it",2024-02-15 15:46:16

i thought that was a pretty brave choice to have him be so cowardly to turn away at the first slide and never turn back to look,2023-07-26 05:13:17
im leaning to this side too i know its about oppenheimer but you cant appreciate his story without appreciating the horrific cost of all his work,2023-07-23 21:37:31
there is a film called “waltz with bashir” that has the absolute most gut wrenching and effective “see the real cost” ending and something like that i think could have worked here after cillian’s last line,2023-07-24 06:19:57

thats just not the line,2023-07-21 11:53:50
a little detail i like with richard feynman quaid’s character is him playing bongo drums at the christmas party since the real life feynman was an amateur player of bongo and conga drums,2023-07-22 22:39:26

hes lost a lot of weight good for him,2023-07-21 19:04:57
"it seemed like it was supposed to be ambiguous to me

the scene before showed a big celebration with people kissing and drinking it also showed the one woman celebrating and a second later crying in horror i think it was supposed to show his anxiety and inability to properly process the world around him

i enjoyed interstellar for a lot of entertainment purposes dunkirk missed the mark but i didn’t see it in theaters either,2023-07-21 03:53:08
i honestly think that’s a fair opinion and i  love nolan’s work,2023-07-21 06:23:58
i feel like i have to be the one to go too far and start getting downvoted im going beyond best nolan film and straight to best biopic ever made,2023-07-27 01:28:28
havent seen tenet talked about much and havent sought out opinions on it after i saw it in theaters but i agree that movie was a mess even if it did have some really cool scenes visually,2023-07-24 23:52:21
as in pointing at the calculations as proof something  doesn’t work when in the next room they just did it is that something that is almost like a physics inside joke,2023-07-24 06:13:50
isnt the electromagnetic force more responsible for us not phasing through each other our electrons push against other electrons which creates friction the strong nuclear force is more responsible for holding atomic nuclei together,2023-07-22 17:14:33

as a european i’ll never be able to grasp the concept that in the us humans having  is a bigger reason for an r rating than humans getting eviscerated by a nuclear explosion which is more than just alluded to in oppenheimers dream state when he’s giving the speech after the explosion you don’t even see full on  just her  around here in germany there’s day time commercials featuring topless women there sure as  aren’t any day time commercials showing people getting their skin torn off by a nuclear blast,2023-07-24 22:12:39

where he perfected the accent hed later use in tropic thunder great role,2023-07-21 12:36:01
the timeline stuff is very well done and not confusing at all nolan has perfected nonlinear editing but the movie has a massive list of name drops and supporting characters with very few lines i think it is confusing on this level where it’s difficult to know who is who until pretty far in on a first watch unless you’re already familiar with the history and every physicist mentioned for example what is rami malek’s character named couldnt tell you,2023-07-24 06:39:39
cmon its pretty easy to get confused the audio mixing was not great so i couldnt pick out what they were saying sometimes in such a dialogue heavy movie you can see why that would cause confusion,2023-07-23 10:57:10

admittedly mass bombing was commonplace at the end of the war more japanese people died from conventional bombing of tokyo than the atomic bombings of nagasaki  hiroshima,2023-07-23 00:06:47
by that point in wwii they had already seen tens of thousands of people dying in under a month repeatedly some of the pacific island fighting was incredibly brutal and this doesnt even begin to cover the carnage that the eastern european front,2023-07-29 03:37:21
ah i watched that a long time ago but i remember it being good,2023-08-01 19:33:36
rami malek and that other guys petition was for that a demonstration it wasnt done because they doubted that it would have the desired effect plus they didnt care that much for japanese civilians anyway,2023-07-27 07:23:25
1 for the making of the atomic bomb and then american prometheus though fair warning that tmotab takes a while to get started it spends a good chunk just introducing scientists and science to lay the foundation for when things get going basically once the nazis get going,2023-07-21 10:45:06
the follow up to the making of the atomic bomb dark sun is also a great read gets into the new world of thermonuclear weapons that oppenheimer was so afraid of as well as the espionage and teller’s breaking from the rest of los alamos in pursuit of the super,2023-07-22 14:45:59
no need to apologies you are right about everything i just added a few and your point about that oppenheimer trying to tell jean about arjunas moral dilemma and jean and the military corelation about the line about destroyer of the world was very insightful,2023-08-01 17:22:20
"yeah i understand your point but if everything else in the film is so purposeful and thematic and cinematic how can we excuse this scene as she just grabbed a book it was done with a purpose and for a purpose and i think the way they did it was bad judgement 

i also see that reading a religious text during a scene like this ups the eroticism factor but that seems like a cheap move on nolans part and i dont know why he is relying on these  tropes at this stage of his career",2023-08-01 23:09:04
the trick is to dehydrate yourself all day before going to the movie,2023-07-31 03:53:12

you dont need a directors cut when the theatres show the cut the director wants",2023-07-30 22:15:14
i thought the actual bomb was a huge letdown it was a closeup of flames that didn’t look epic as it should of been i think nolan use of strictly practical hurt that scene for all the talk leading up to that it was a major let down,2023-07-23 21:26:27
true with historical context the moment is extremely important powerful and even terrifying but the movie did not convey that in a lot of viewers opinions i think a lot of people are carrying their knowledge in with them and letting them fill in the blanks rather than looking at what the movie is actually offering,2023-07-23 22:16:04
everything except for the actual bomb going off was 1010 the bomb didnt seem as big as the actual trinity test footage you can watch on youtube i feel like they could have added a bit of cgi to match the build up they had for the scne,2023-07-24 21:07:52
"my takeaway from the stuff with rdj is how petty people can be even when they have the power of the atom and the future of humanity in their hands oppenheimer is worried about the fate of humanity while rdjs character is stressing over slights from years ago and angling to climb another rung up the political ladder  


really hammers it with the conversation with einstein being revealed at the end strauss thinks oppenheimer said something to turn einstein against him but it turns out they were discussing the end of the world  


less about good vs evil right vs wrong but more about the way most people go through life fixated on the short term while others see the big picture which is only ever appreciated when its useful in the short term",2023-07-21 05:40:10
i mean i think “mccarthyism is bad” is kind of in full display here but i agree with you on the rest,2023-07-21 04:42:09
i really liked the back and forth the movie does between them while strauss is  oppenheimer out of absurd pettiness his points about oppenheimer’s martyrdom are true the movie indicts oppenheimer just as much as it celebrates him,2023-07-21 07:01:18
"right the thing about strauss was that he wasnt evil or anything he genuinely believed he was doing the right thing the whole way through he was just kind of a complete  to oppenheimer to an absurd extent

it didnt occur to me until the very end too the parallels between oppenheimers security hearings and strauss confirmation",2023-07-21 05:52:03
i was incredibly impressed by how well they dealt with the nuance and conflicting feelings in the us about use of the bomb from jingoistic blase over their effects to pragmatic concerns about national security to the reality of human suffering caused by them and their existential borror,2023-07-22 07:25:01
honestly strauss was making a little sense nobody associates oppenheimer with hiroshima and nagasaki he was one of the guys who created it but nobody blames him for the suffering and how he changed the world,2023-07-21 19:58:10
or read american prometheus the book the movie is based on it helped me immensely in following all the different characters and personalities,2023-07-24 04:42:31

i mean doesn’t the film explicitly deal with this  the removal of his clearance and the tarnishing of his name is a significant part of the third act,2023-07-22 02:58:47

im so glad i at least listened to the first 4 episodes of that series before watching the movie gave me a little bit more of a way to keep in my mind who was who throughout the movie,2023-07-26 06:20:04

"even when it isn’t done very well apparently

i just love how people are pretending this movie is sooo deep like there was audible confusion in my theater when strauss was revealed as the “big bad” because nolan did almost nothing to introduce us to him as a person or set up his original motivations 

i watched this movie and saw what nolan was trying to do but he just can’t quite get there as a director 

if you had fun that’s great but i will never not laugh at the pretentiousness of nolan fans who refuse to show any critical thought for his works and try to paint people who do as unitillectual",2023-07-22 15:12:00
heres someone saying it nearly 2 years ago,2023-07-26 04:17:26
but objectively kyoto is the most culturally important city in japan its a logical decision when i first read about how the us made the decision to take kyoto off the list in history it was noble i dont know why they played it as a joke in the movie,2023-07-24 12:28:16
true,2023-07-23 21:45:37
it wasnt a joke it was his firsthand knowledge that a specific city contained the largest concentration of an entire nations cultural history pretty sure that was a very good reason to spare kyoto,2023-07-25 18:26:41
im sure they would have considered it if they hadnt surrendered after nagasaki,2023-07-22 00:48:11
i enjoyed the joke about humble physicists,2023-07-21 14:22:05
this is why strauss introduction threw me off he corrects oppenheimer to use an americanised or at least altered pronunciation of strauss and oppenheimer remarks either way everyone knows youre jewish which suggests strauss is downplaying his jewishness and perhaps resenting oppenheimer for being so loud about it but that doesnt track historically,2023-07-23 21:29:45
i couldn’t tell if opp’s fame was understated or overstated for this point of the plot,2023-07-21 04:21:24
"einsteins family was jewish but einstein himself was not a part of a religious community he described himself as agnostic and deeply religious nonbeliever

fermi was baptized roman catholic but he and his family was not particularly religious his wife however was jewish which is why they left italy behind together due to mussolinis racial laws",2023-07-21 09:13:00

"strauss wanted to stop isotopes from being sent to other countries oppenheimer kinda humiliated him by showing how meaningless the isotopes really were

more clear explanation from another comment

from what ive gathered strauss wanted to stop export of isotopes but didnt truly understand what he was asking for and got very publicly humiliated with oppenheimer treating it as a complete joke and you would have to be  to support the idea because the isotopes have no use for nuclear weapons even though they are radioactive pointing out that strauss has no idea whats going on and making mocking him very publicly

as the man is a political operator he expects this would only happen between bitter rival however i believe the movie tries to point out that oppenheimer didnt care one bit about strausss games and would have done the same thing to anyone focusing on only 2 things trying to stop nuclear holocaust and trying to get everyone else involved to project their guilt onto him so only he has to suffer",2023-07-27 07:11:49
agreed i know rdj turned in a good performance and it was satisfying in a petty way to see him humiliated but in the grand scope of the film i didnt care about him at all felt like the big bad should have been higherups in the govt the hearing truman groves turning distant or the moral fallout the clapping scene how he knew the victim numbers trying to stave off the hbomb,2023-07-23 21:33:56
him defending oppie was a cover for him being the orchestrator of the smear campaign happening,2023-07-22 20:30:49
at many points during this film i thought to myself how real life context provides the essential motivations for characters’ actions and statements since this is more of a biopic this is definitely a movie i’d recommend reading up on before hand not much to spoil anyways,2023-07-21 04:43:37
i did the same for dunkirk and learnt my lesson to not do that that being said i had no idea who or what strass was doing till the 3rd act but i really enjoyed it when it all came together,2023-07-21 05:16:32
nah the dialogue was actually good,2023-07-22 19:28:11
there would have been tension if oppenheimer wasn’t already a pretty famous person but knowing already what would happen wasn’t really entertaining for me,2023-07-21 08:39:16
it’s also not even a remotely absurd comparison to make either as social media has been one of the most destructive inventions of the modern era,2023-07-21 07:58:22

"another way i could interpret it is that it felt like a bad dream where it replays all the traumatic events hes been through retracing his steps on how he got to where he is

i’m very familiar with the history of the manhattan project and even i was lost they didn’t do a great job of explaining who all the different characters being introduced were and when various scenes were happening really not easy to keep up with,2023-07-23 05:10:44
i certainly did so many moments that were meant to be really dramatic that i just didnt grasp because i had no idea what was going on a lot of the time i either couldnt hear what was being said or i couldnt process it thats why i love subtitles enjoyed it nonetheless but definitely need to give it a rewatch,2023-07-21 19:12:46
tbh i had to read the wiki afterwards lol,2023-07-21 19:09:07
yes the movie was focusing on too many things when it needed to cut stuff out an be more focused also the detention was a let down,2023-07-21 19:04:57
for real that was not a tense scene whole movie was a boring slog,2023-07-28 04:52:50
who pays fifteen bucks or so for a seat maybe food and gas as well only to decide yeah this is boring im going to play solitaire just leave the  theatre,2023-07-22 23:20:43
you know animal farm wasnt really about pigs horses and donkeys right,2023-07-22 11:04:52
it may have prevented any direct conflict between any superpowers so far however it didnt prevent any proxy wars fought on behalf of those parties nuclear arms have only merely shifted the human burden of wars on to countries that can be exploited by those with nuclear weapons plus its not like the world never came close to ending in nuclear armageddon theres been numerous instance of close calls  wars will keep happening that much is evident today the invention of nuclear weapons has just made it so that the casualties are relegated to other parts of the world and in return we contend with a possibility of a global extinction event,2023-07-22 14:35:29
this is negates the value of the lives lost in nagasaki and hiroshima it’s ignorant to think “wars have been halted” wars may be fought differently but globally there remains a massive loss of life due to military violence and civil unrest,2023-07-22 13:29:31
also that lol,2023-08-31 02:49:10
"from all the outside expectation setting i was prepared for a long talk heavy movie that would bore me and while it was long i had to  30 min in and decided to wait it out i was pleasantly surprised by what it stirred in me in reflection on existence and consequence of choices and the additional conceptual sensory moments especially when he address all the white peoplein the bleachers right after the trinity test really blew me away also i made sure to see it in 70mm imax ceiling to floor and the picture was spectacular

ps  mark ruffalo should get best supporting actor over rdjr",2024-02-01 19:05:47
nah the people who disliked it just thought it was bad because they were told they should think it was bad but they actually enjoyed it,2024-01-30 22:45:48
i just kept thinking excuse the cliche the balls to shoot it this way and in that moment it took courage for pugh and murphy too florence seems like she really sees acting as art and i know she must want to be taken seriously and sometimes scenes like that can degrade an actoractress as a serious person but she really did a phenomenal job i was just blown away by how serious everyone took their part a monumental achievement by nolan and this is the guy who made inception the dark knight and interstellar among other amazing films,2023-07-21 02:35:32
oh  i’m going with my dad to see it on sunday how awkward will it be,2023-07-21 05:54:44
since its nolan i think he would do as much in camera as possible as hes not a fan of digitally altering scenes if he can avoid it and i dont see either of the actors being afraid of it with how bold they were in this film,2023-07-21 03:54:06
yea im not sure but even so i thought it was brave either way,2023-07-21 02:42:59
absolutely she did she seems pretty fearless as an actor from what i’ve seen of her previous work she made don’t worry darling pretty entertaining even when it got intolerable near the end,2023-07-23 12:48:14
lol but seriously her acting is amazing when she makes eye contact with blunt it felt like its own nuclear bomb it was just really bold,2023-07-21 02:27:48
i read that her contract emphasized the  scenes and her being  but this 100 could’ve been a joke that flew over my head,2023-07-22 20:03:05
flo,2023-07-21 02:31:49
right right but do you happen to know if that was at a particular conference hearing like what was the occasion for oppenheimer to have been giving that talk,2023-07-22 23:43:57
wasn’t perfect the guy that turned down the welder glasses before the trinity test and said “don’t worry i have a windshield” should have gone blind or have something happen to him,2023-07-23 04:34:59
i remember it being 20 miles away when the detonated it i imagine the sound would take quite a bit of time actually reaching you so a nice realistic detail not just dramatic,2023-07-23 04:29:36
love the casual mention of dissociation here especially because it’s weirdly accurate to what it’s like,2023-07-21 07:30:58
"completely understand what youre saying it could easily be a justification on my end

the only reason why i get to where im at with the interpretation is that i just dont have the same emotional drainage after watching other movies with odd sound mixing 

oppenheimer seemed to be edited in a strange way 12 minute scenes particularly in the first 30 minutes that feel like theyre trying to invoke an emotional response not convey important information for later on in the film

walked out of the theater 2 hours ago still thinking about it",2023-07-21 04:07:25
i get it but his dialogue is usually unremarkable as it is anyway and i feel like no one is actually missing out it’s not substandard it’s just pretty unimportant this isn’t tarantino level dialogue it’s a lot of exposition some sensical some not and a lot that pales in comparison to the visual storytelling i’m not a nolan fanatic i love his films but none of them are perfect but he’s not necessarily a dialogue person that said i felt that he did well with it here and where it was actually good it was also audible mainly in the third act,2023-07-21 07:34:02
weve never been more back like i think nolan could make whatever he wants with a 300 million dollar budget for his next film,2023-07-21 03:44:48
after adjusting nolans stats removing outliers to project the future he heavily regresses to around the level of peter jackson,2023-07-21 03:11:14

you dont thats the point the guy above me and most people in here are complaining at the lack of scientific explanation meaning it wasnt a confusing explanation they just kept it too simple,2024-02-04 03:19:47
does it matter though they also pretty explicitly explain the difference in the scene where teller pitches,2023-12-21 06:14:32
"yeah i hate to say it but i believe if nolan had to cut the movies run time to 2 hours it wouldve been a better movie overall watching experience and presentation of the story
yes a lot interesting material would need to be left out but as a final product itd be better
for me personally all the pieces in the movie are amazing its just too much of it

also 2 hour movie runtime would not require an intermission which just feels like such a self indulgent artiste nonsense",2023-08-04 12:08:05
i figured since he was gonna use a practical explosion instead of cgi they would use some sort of forced perspective felt way too close and way too small,2023-07-29 06:30:06
oh im sure it will be a good experience on a standard theatre but i really wanted to see it at the biggest screen i could find,2023-07-21 05:17:54
just watched it after driving a few hours for imax i dont regret it but also dont think its remotely necessary,2023-07-23 23:53:03
i saw it in 35mm and sunday in imax,2023-07-21 02:48:24
30 worldwide 19 in the us,2023-07-21 08:06:32
regal city north on western only imax in chicago and it’s not 70mm new massive screen just opened in batavia though and might be showing it in 70mm but not sure if they do i’ll head out there in a weekend or two,2023-07-21 12:38:13
"there used to be one in navy pier it shut down over covid so your best choices are indianapolis or grand rapids 

i saw it in 70mm and i felt like it was still amazing",2023-07-23 00:52:22
yep,2023-07-25 13:42:23
probably means his first time seeing a 70mm screening in an imax theater doesnt take a genius to extrapolate,2023-08-03 17:24:27
"i thought it was must have conflated it with dune 2 which is 
i try to only see certain films in imax and recently the only two on my radar were oppenheimer and dune 2

cant seem to find how much it has though usually there were lots of ads or articles in the past saying like most imax footage in a film at 35 minutes or whatever",2023-08-03 17:39:39
might have to pick up a pair,2023-08-28 13:02:52
yeah it did get easier for me too after 1015 min because id realized they were just jumping around time  a quick 1947 caption would have been helpful to me  a scene in 1946 or 1947 were basically indistinguishable to me as far as timeline order since they never let you know,2023-08-29 02:37:08
"i haven’t seen tenet so i can’t comment on that but for oppenheimer we’re immediately thrown into the middle of the story and the dialogue is unintelligible so it’s difficult to grasp what exactly is happening for me

i also went into this with 0 knowledge of oppenheimer’s life beyond the obvious so i had no frame of reference",2023-08-28 04:55:51
but no nolans too modern for these old methods,2023-08-29 06:17:28
"the way the movie starts feels like youre just kind of dropped into the middle of a movie  it bounces around different years without really making that clear  it was difficult to start forming a timeline of when each events take place  after the project began they stopped doing that and the movie was much easier to follow from then on

i didnt really see the point of having any of the interrogation scenes in the beginning i dont recall them giving any information in those scenes that the viewer needed to see at that time

at the final scene where we find out what oppenheimer said to einstein at the pond i was confused because i thought the earlier pond scene was when oppenheimer met strauss and what he told einstein was obviously after the bomb i guess the original pond scene was a fast forward in time  they just didnt make those jumps very clear in my opinion

im pretty sure when i rewatch it later it will all make sense to me but a well constructed movie should make sense on the first watch",2023-08-29 02:32:57
understood i share your surprise because it lept right out at me maybe because i just finished watching slow horses,2023-08-31 13:00:09
i went to a regular theater intentionally avoiding imax so i don’t hurt my earring turns out they still crank it to 11 have ringing in my ears ,2023-07-21 05:50:32
well just in my personal experience all the dialogue was clear only one scene that i would say i couldnt fully understand what was being said but it seemed like it was done on purpose,2023-07-21 14:34:31
youll know the difference when you see the big  sandworm played by gary oldman appear on an imax screen,2023-07-21 05:49:06
you actually gain a lot in terms of immersion and spectacle  they obviously arent going to crop important info out of the 2201 frame  but imax frames def improve the experience overall,2023-07-21 05:07:25
sure but you can just watch it on tv then you lose nothing,2023-07-21 20:01:27
so not worth the 20 price,2023-07-21 15:19:49
most of the movie is shot with imax cameras,2023-07-21 15:08:18
its not about loudness its about range quality and sense of space,2023-07-26 08:54:33

that’s weird considering marx wasn’t even born when the us was founded,2023-08-02 11:22:08

why do you care so much lol,2023-11-10 22:43:15
that’s cool this movie definitely made me more interested in the manhattan project i’m probably gonna read the book the movie was based on,2023-08-01 03:36:21
you can see from the comments here it is a pretty divisive movie  for a movie with so much hype and investing into a 3 hr run time i can see ppl being offput by the experience  why go thru that in a packed theater when you can just watch it at home cheaper and turn it off if aren’t into it,2023-07-28 01:28:44
it’s making money cuz of marketing hype and nolan  the heat will die down once word gets out it isn’t a crowd pleasing movie like interstellar or the dark knight  not even just that but just a long chore of a movie to get through,2023-07-28 01:31:02
can’t wait to watch dune 2 pretty much the only movie i’m excited about for the rest of the year,2023-08-04 11:10:46
i am happy that i only spent 12 on the imax tickets almost all of the movie is just men talking and hardly needed to be seen on such a big screen,2023-08-04 15:35:25
dune in imax was incredible the sound felt like it literally rattled my bones,2023-08-04 23:59:35

oscar bait is why moonlight beat lalaland,2023-07-21 12:42:33
i think that the gloved hands were oppenheimer’s he felt like her suicide was his fault so he couldn’t help but picture himself physically murdering her,2023-07-21 04:04:27
i know crazy right what a plot twist,2023-07-21 14:18:01
objectively one of americas finest moments,2023-07-23 00:14:25
literally every trailer made it seem like it was about building the bomb not about oppenheimers life,2023-07-24 03:51:09
but they lay it out for you in the movie oppenheimer was no longer a scientist he was a politician literally the exact words,2023-07-24 02:19:59
"

the film is entirely about oppenheimer

half the  movie is entirely about his shifting thoughts on the arms race how his beliefs set him in conflict with those who disagreed with him and investigations directly questioning his beliefs when they changed and accusing him of sabotage",2023-07-24 01:57:01
that and the “my wife and i honeymooned in kyoto” were two scenes that got a kind of laugh from people that i wasn’t sure they realized were based on facts i’m happy they get to find out how life is stranger than fiction,2023-07-21 02:55:51
"yeah that is a fair point but i do think again that the issue with it is that its a one note character in a single scene who was the man who dropped the bomb   


that is all we got of him once scene of him being a  to oppie",2023-08-10 09:03:09
i didn’t realize how accurate it was but truman still had a lot on his plate at that time he wasn’t a simple minded ,2023-08-11 14:50:35
the wobblywobbly background in the gymnasium scene you could do that practically very easily if you wanted to it’s the nuke itself i doubt could ever be convincing without computer assistance,2023-07-29 00:54:45
i think the subtext of oppenheimer having an affair with jean while married to kitty coming to light during the hearing was enough we didn’t need jean riding oppy right there in front of everyone to drive the point home,2023-07-21 19:31:09
my grandfather has weird vibes depends on the grandfather,2023-07-21 17:23:13

thats good insight personally havent noticed the drowning out the dialogue until this movie,2023-08-17 07:02:59
you’ve never seen titanic avatar or any of the christian bale batman’s yet you saw oppenheimer that’s wild,2023-08-22 01:34:28
yeah thats not what im saying im asking in the average case and in practice do people criticize nolan,2023-08-16 21:59:07
i will this thread isnt about those better films its about this awful one what didnt i understand is oppenheimer a communist or not who cares the atom bomb meant thousands of people being vaporized and thousands dying horrible deaths because they didnt have the good fortune to be vaporized if the film is about judging oppenheimers character isnt that a bigger deal than communism,2023-08-20 23:34:10

i think the point they really tried to hit home with on oppenheimer is what all he did only for politics to turn on him at the end because of his reservations he expressed having not known the whole backstory i did wonder what was going to take place when i realized that the climatic event took place 23 of the way into the movie,2023-07-21 12:08:38
not sure if that’s a joke but i don’t think cheering for the near instantaneous death of 110000 double that civilians and the complete decimation of 2 cities is something anyone should ever cheer about in any context,2023-07-22 04:12:23
agreed i felt everyone reached the pinnacle of the character they were playing it was magnificent,2023-07-23 03:33:48

seriously and it’s a historical drama so i’m sorry but you’re going to see and hear a lot of unidentifiable greyhaired men sounds like the above posters would have been much happier going to mi7 which i’ve heard has plenty of mindless action,2023-07-27 04:09:03
a movie about the making of the most dangerous weapon the world has ever seen and yet the scene where that weapon is displayed is anticlimactic,2023-07-27 04:50:12
fun may not be the right word per se  shawshank redemption isn’t “fun” but it is so good and i can always rewatch it so that is “fun” in a way  i can’t imagine oppenheimer being a similar type of rewatch,2023-07-27 04:07:41
serious nd deadly topics can still be fun if done well like dark comedy,2023-07-27 06:48:27

" with the revocation of his clearance he was abruptly expelled from of the conversations he had led for 30 years

thats overstating it a lot especially when considering that a big reason why he lost the clearance was because he was opposed to the hbomb even if he was a part of the conversations the same ideology that vilified him would have driven people to ignore him he was a scientist but the decision to pursue the hbomb and how to plan defense strategy more broadly is geopolitics and even from the outside he could still attempt to influence that sort of discussion",2023-07-28 16:41:31
i missed that line,2023-07-28 02:50:19
i saw it on opening night so specific spots i dont remember the only nitpick that immediately comes to mind was at the end when einstein tells oppenheimer to some extent you know they will never forgive you then it cuts to black despite the fact that he was formally cleared in december of last year there was no cue card showing that they may have finished filming in may but a black cue card is barely a few minutes of work and it completely changes the ending there wasnt even an actual picture of oppenheimer at the end before the credits like most documentaries do,2023-08-20 17:24:53
well for one thing the apple scene didnt happen no one in oppenheimers life even those who hated him believed that story in the slightest the first instance that rumour popped up was in a book called american prometheus which itself also calls it an unfounded rumour makes one wonder why they put it in print if they couldnt source it as reliable so nolan did in fact twist history at least once,2023-08-20 15:18:16
im just saying nolan may have had very little to work with sciencewise i think what we saw is what we get,2023-07-24 19:54:15
and everything you mentioned is shown in the movie so im not sure why people are complaining,2023-07-24 21:15:30
one thing i would like to have seen is maybe 1 or 2 scenes about the people in the midwest working to actually produce the uranium and plutonium and maybe a little insight into why its so hard or slow to make they seem to be the only part of the team not shown in the film,2023-07-24 21:17:11

"it was essential to the plot of the story the plot being his life sure the atomic bomb was a big part of it but what happened after was also just as important 

the strauss storyline was basically showing that oppie felt guilty about inventing such a horrible weapon prometheus giving fire to humans he opposed the h bomb because of its massive destructive power and strauss made him pay for his opposition and also because hes a narcissist who thinks oppie humiliated him

the point was that oppenheimer regretted inventing the atom bomb and the government  also showed little appreciation to him for doing that",2023-07-24 22:06:51
"that’s a valid point but does einstein not serve a similar function in far less screentime particularly at the very end instead of an hour with rdj that’s largely disconnected from the “main” storycharacters

after all it isn’t oppenheimer who destroys strauss he does it to himself and our prometheus like the mythological one isn’t in the end “destroyed”…he’s tormented oppenheimer’s image largely recovers he spends his last decades as a speaker activist and american icon…but he’s tormented to the end of his days because just as he flippantly says of einstein earlier in the film and is repeated back to him by the very same legendary predecessor the knowledge he’s unleashed on the world has simply passed him by and is being built upon by those who’ll come after him oppenheimer like einstein does not get to play gatekeeper to “his” findings he doesn’t get to ensure that only the righteous wield the fire he’s given mankind like prometheus he’s propelled man forward…and given us the means to our own destruction in the same moment his greatest achievement the act that secures his place in history is also his great sin and the cause of him having to endure the everlasting torture of knowing what he’s unleashed oppenheimer ends the film exactly where einstein began it being paraded around and given awards by the people who’ll use his gifts for their own ends good or ill 

it’s einstein or rather what he represents who plays the role of the nowchained denied clearance relegated to a cultural figure without true power or influence prometheus’ eagle not strauss",2023-07-23 06:46:46
"the book also starts on the day strauss and nichols showed him the aec letter its bookended by the aec hearing

as oppenheimer wrote in his defence and murphy read in the movie the only way to understand his actions is to understand his life

for me the only surprise in the structure of the movie is how heavily it leant into the strauss cabinet confirmation hearing but that made the two stories rhyme and i thought it worked",2023-07-23 16:04:56
i haven’t read american prometheus so i’ll concede to your knowledge here that strauss plays an important role in the book but from a film standpoint those parts just seem disjointed and i think the film would be better paced with a more narrow focus,2023-07-23 06:23:56
it’s a tradeoff but there’s a few shots in there that were fully soft throughout  personally i’d have taken the take with a less compelling performance over one where the actor is oof for fully 100 of the shot,2023-07-26 11:09:45
i dont recall exactly and it could have been but we killed a lot of japanese civilians bombed a lot of their cities they were not doing well i think it was from the documentary fog of war if you want to find it and check it out,2023-07-29 15:37:06
here is an excerpt of part of the doc where he asks why was it necessary to drop the atomic bomb,2023-07-29 16:02:53
" the japanese were not going to surrender it was atomic bombs a genocidal starvation or an invasion with tens of millions dead

this

im not saying the bombs are good war is  people also like to point to the atomic bombs yet dont know anythingdont care about the fire bombings that took place

you know how many americans died taking the japanese mainland 0 it could have thousands upon thousands upon thousands 

hindsight is 2020  we have context and can look back and all angels at the time truman was  more or less  presented with a choice the end the war with 0 american casualties why would he not make the choice he did",2023-07-30 03:53:13
" you do realize the diehards launched an actual coup attempt to stop the surrender 

yes but nobody outside the coupactors was buying the depose hirohito concept the coup failed under its own design 

for that reason the emperor as person and as symbol was the thing around which the end coalesced 

hed made the recording already so the bombs perhaps figured into the impulse to make the recording 

 there were soldiers running around the japanese imperial palace trying to find the surrender recording so they could destroy it

indeed 

 the japanese were not going to surrender it was atomic bombs a genocidal starvation or an invasion with tens of millions dead

its complicated bit of a rabbit hole  people note a lack of evidence of a reaction to the bombs that leaves a degree of freedom in any explanations its an onlypartially decidable proposition 

 and the russians declaring war was more the japanese loosing the last chance of a mediator than an actual military threat

very much so big part of the lack of communications too",2023-07-30 14:58:33
"i don’t really think so frankly i think it’s great that people have different interests because it inspires filmmakers to make different films and we end up with diversity movies are subjective at the end of the day

i loved the movie and i wish some of my friends loved it too but alas",2023-07-21 20:32:47
hmm didnt notice any drowning out  was in an imax theatre though,2023-07-22 14:24:59
what format did you watch it in i didnt have this issue,2023-07-22 15:21:40
i didn’t think the mixing in this was anywhere near as bad as dunkirk’s was,2023-07-22 20:48:49

"mike myers while it was less comedic casey affleck had the exact same vibes

seemed like people were fighting over each other to be in this film thankfully none were sideshows to take away i thought they really all brought their a game i enjoyed it more formal actor spotting than i did for the odd inclusions of humour

having slept on it i did enjoy watching it but i wouldnt watch it again",2023-07-23 09:39:52
im embarrassed to admit that i enjoyed barbie more than oppenheimer and thats saying a lot as interstellar is my favorite movie of all time and i am extremely invested in oppenheimers history,2023-07-23 23:31:10
the trailer was meant to not give away the central themes and points of the movie if you didnt already realise that im sorry,2023-07-23 23:00:58
please tell me you’re not like those ones who didn’t like it because it was “woke”,2023-07-23 22:48:01
"i guess so but i didnt have any reason to think oppenheimer didnt have integrity obviously he was extremely instrumental in creating the atomic bomb but it wasnt his choice to bomb major japanese cities as oldmanastruman very rudely points out lol and it was pretty clear that he was only for creating the bomb to beatdefeat the nazis in pursuing the same goal i suppose its noble to put yourself through a very difficult hearing where your name is kind of dragged through the mud just to lose a clearance level it didnt seem like he was incredibly interested in keeping but i was kind of with kitty when she said something like im going off memoryparaphrasing so hopefully this is right haha why do this who cares if you lose that clearance level

and just to be clear i would estimate that it was 15 hours for 1954 private hearing and the 1959 senate confirmation hearing while i felt like there were too many 1954 private hearing scenes that went on for a long time at least they were directly pertinent to the character of oppenheimer so i take less issue with them its more all of the scenes involving strauss senate confirmation hearing that i struggled to care about at all why do i care if he gets a cabinet seat or not hes nobody in the story of oppenheimer and the atomic bomb

but i definitely respect your thoughts and the political world vs the academic world dichotomy definitely has some merit i guess im glad strauss lost but besides that i struggle to care about his plotline the framing devices were differentiated by blackandwhite vs color and oppenheimers appearance changed in early days vs los alamos vs his 1954 private hearing but i also was confused in my first watch on the exact time periods and what was going on it took a 2nd watch with subtitles 1st one was in theaters for me to piece together the entire story well i honestly kind of tuned out slightly my first watch and struggled to pay attention to some of the more minor scenes my 2nd watch made me appreciate the film much more

the last thing that occurs to me just now is that i dont have any inherent issues with intercutting between different scenes in different time periodsfrom different plotlines but there should be a reason to intercut between them that adds extra meaning to the film or lets us see deeper insights into it i dont feel that going from early oppenheimer traveling the world to 1954 to 1959 to los alamos and then back to the other 2 1950s scenes added anything did we glean anything we wouldnt have gotten from telling the film in a completely linear fashion

always feel free to ask for more feedback i welcome respectful dissenting opinions always ",2023-11-28 18:36:23
the titanic was a catastrophe trinity was a success,2023-07-25 09:26:58
100 this i wanted more we started to gets bit more during the clearance hearing when the nuclear light starts bleeding into the room that one time but then we dont get that surrealism ever again literally just two scenes where we feel the weight of the guilt oppenheimer carries we certainly see him feel sad but we only have those two scenes where we feel what he feels,2023-07-25 01:52:34
i loved the scene felt so amazing dont care that it’s not a real atomic bomb it felt great to watch,2023-12-25 17:27:47
idk why they’re booing you you’re right,2023-07-21 20:32:39
yeah i get that it’s focused on oppenheimer what i’m trying to say is that oppenheimer isn’t that interesting of a figure apart from his role in developing the atomic bomb yes he was a womanizer who dated communists but many other academics at the time did worse,2023-07-29 04:46:30
"i asked a different commenter but i am actually really curious what you think it looked like in real life

bear in mind that looking at a still photo or even timelapse whose timing you have no clue of does not give you an informed opinion",2023-07-22 16:06:04
is it pretty sure the human reactions to it are the point of the movie,2023-07-22 14:56:51
what do you think an actual mushroom cloud in the immediate wake of a nuclear explosion looks like,2023-07-22 16:04:01
" his guilt over building the most lethal weapon in all of mankind was the point

ill look out for it more closely in my next screening of it i thought the interleaving of timelines made things confusing strausss perspective being in black and white also made me think that it happened before the manhattan project lol i know nolan enjoys playing with time but i didnt see how it was thematically relevant to do so here unlike in tenet,2023-07-23 23:08:28
it admittedly comes in act 3 but there is literally a scene where kitty says this will cost him his job reputation and even house,2023-07-23 23:58:37
lol,2023-07-24 03:11:35
"fair point

i personally felt a scientist who oversaw the most important science project in human history losing their security clearance heavily implies it’s implications by the nature of losing it

also kitty flat out says we will lose the house he will lose his job his livelihood 

but i better understand how people were not making the connection

this movie really plays better to those who are familiar with his story as things make much more sense",2023-07-24 19:09:53
yes i get that however it strains the narrative which is why you see audience members who were unable to follow what is happening also it leaves no room to make character motivations clear requiring either multiple viewings or outside research to make sense of what is happening onscreen both options i feel are major flaws of the overall product,2023-07-24 01:46:05
yes it bothers me that in a heavy dialogue movie the filmmaker chooses not to mix his movie properly it’s a frustrating experience because i love dialogue,2023-07-25 11:05:29
i saw it in imax and it was just teetering on the verge of too  loud honestly im glad i saw it in imax but im more glad it was taco tuesday night at my theater and the ticket was only 9 dollars,2023-07-26 16:30:57

" if such a utopia can exist i

agreed the film even makes mention that it was originally the domestic ideas of communism that were intriguing however the idea was much more dark than that and it was spreading everywhere,2023-07-30 13:14:55
that sounds like dictatorships rather than actual communism sure they have a history of being linked thanks cia but one is by no means inherent to the other,2023-07-30 12:51:22
"sure let me fix problems of oppressed women across the world before i comment on anything on reddit next time

now coming back to the actual topic which is the age restriction in this movie  i did not think  would be so scary for some teenagers to justify the age restriction it was not personal unless you’re working with the movie raitings of course so not sure what got you worked up there i removed “america” from my  comment if that helps with national continental should have specified pride issues",2023-08-11 16:36:40

imax sound is my favorite sound,2023-08-17 02:04:32
then it did as it was designed to this day outside of science nobody cares about j robert oppenheimer all they care is the atomic bomb and its following technology the whole film while about oppenheimer isn’t about who he is it’s about his being treated and slandered by a man who felt he was humiliated and so in turn used what was already known information to destroy his reputation using the red scare this movie isn’t a cut and clip biography from a wiki page and i think that’s what everyone misunderstood,2023-11-27 05:53:32
i agree im from a sea country that was  and pillaged by the japanese during ww2 but i still dont think it was necessary to drop two atom bombs on civilian cities at that point it was a  swinging contest for usa to show the world they meant business germany surrendered japan was arguably already going to surrender after the first atomic bomb the second one was just got  and giggles at that point,2023-07-24 22:12:36
"you posted wiki as well as you tube for the majority of your sources dear  help us all

"was extremely disappointed in the explosion if they spent a tiny tiny fraction of the money they spent on marketing the explosion on the actual explosion it would be way more impressive

nolans explosion seems like he just bought a few gallons of gas and set it aflame",2023-07-23 23:24:58
thats a great point using remastered stock footage would have met both nolans desire for authenticity not cgi and the audiences desire for a bigger spectacle,2023-07-31 20:22:08
"  i read that the american government expected japan to surrender right after the first bomb but when they didnt they decided to deploy the second and threatened the japanese with more bombs to come

nah dropping 2 bombs was always the plan they explain it in the movie as well drop the first one to show the japanese the power of the weapon drop the second one to show them it can be repeated at a short notice",2023-08-08 02:14:00
tbh japanese were considering surrender even before the bomb in terms of when and on what conditions not if we should,2023-08-08 11:44:18
"why wouldnt japan assume thats the case anyway

because the weapon was so unusual theyd wonder how many can be produced in fact the japanese actually did wonder their postwar records showed that top war leaders discussed this very issue they interrogated a us pow who eventually claimed the us had the capability to make hundreds  he actually had no clue but just said that under torture that with the nagasaki bombing helped convince them to surrender",2023-08-08 20:53:06
"tokyo was already in ruins with all the firebombing so it wasnt picked they had to pick a untouched city so its destruction is a direct result of the bomb

hiroshima is where their military factories are at and theres no allies pows so its not just a random city so no its not obvious in fact they decided not to surrender believing such weapons cannot be produced quick enough but the second bomb proved them wrong",2023-08-08 06:40:45
well i think thats becsuse they needed to show they could continue to produce these bombs it wasnt just years if work tonproduce a one off event,2023-08-08 12:24:00
because germans were winning before us decided to help they were on the verge of taking over moscow soviet despite the many differences were not seen as the immediate threat that  germany posed to the western nations,2023-08-09 03:43:44
it’s not my belief i just found it funny plus the movie barely mentions it and makes it seem like the real motive to drop the bombs was to just end the war,2023-07-24 18:29:03
"well the thing about the bomb test footage is that it was just fire

which can be beautiful and it was an aspect i enjoyed on the big screen but the fire was a different energy than an atomic bomb produced and it was disappointing that a movie that had a lot of visions of energy in the beginning got that part wrong

but it was still enjoyable to take in",2023-07-25 03:09:46
i think it was just the particular theater we were in more than the movie,2023-07-25 02:49:38
i agree i mean the movie was marketed as flames and being in ultimate imax i think its only fair for one to assume some spectacular visuals and existential suspense  i went in knowing it was a more dialogue heavy movie but was still surprised how much it was a literal wikipage like bio have the people who think the movie is a 1010 never pondered nuclear war its not that novel of a threatidea so i dont understand how the message is that deep,2023-08-09 02:24:18
"agree and disagree wasn’t entirely needed but the “we are terrible people” built the guilt of his character before he started working on the bomb

and ya you could have cut him courting her but then there only would have been him getting introduced to her and then them getting married with basically none of her backstory",2023-07-24 03:37:31
or you could do a social network i dont know that movie had just about as much dialog and even more complexity because there wasnt a clear villain so to speak but it still managed to keep people a lot more engaged simply from filmmaking techniques  better timing of cuts better points where new characters were introduced better jumping back and forth between timelines  id go so far as to say even mank was more engaging than oppenheimer here but it probably had less to deal with so social network remains the better comparison,2023-07-24 04:44:30
"dont get me wrong i really enjoyed the show and watched it 3 times and while the majority of the inaccuracies were clearly made for understandable reasons to make the show more functional there were a fair few that were really bad and easily avoidable and really annoyed me for some reason

a very poor explanation of the difference between radiation exposure and radiation contamination the show seems to give the notion that standing near a source of radiation for too long turns you into an emitter of it when in fact its the ingesting of radioactive materials that does this and part of why the disaster was so uniquely dangerous

the womans baby absorbing the radiation to save her life this was so  i couldnt believe it made it into the show absolutely nothing about it makes sense at any level it was simply added to add drama and so that woman could say the line we live in a world where sons must die to save their mothers or whatever absolutely 

the cherenkov effect does not cause a blue lightsaber to shoot up into the sky its a mild blue glow that didnt extend beyond the reactor hall

rbmk reactors specifically arent the problem and i dont know why they were constantly mentioned the problem is the parent category boiling water reactors

rbmk control rods are not tipped in graphite this might be nitpicky but the entire bottom half of the rods is graphite tips to me implies just the very end like an eraser on a pencil

the control room scene while exciting was loaded with bs i understand they need to make things dramatic for the finale but theres absolutely no evidence that arguing about raising the power took place az5 was not pressed in response to a power surge but simply as a routine planned shutdown its very unlikely xenon poisoning played any role whatsoever in the stall and all the plant operators were well aware of the test all nonsense to add drama

i can’t recall the exact order of events in the way it was cut but the flower table scenes are after the war all of the discussions are about hydrogen bombs not atomic bombs it’s likely a flashforward that’s been cut before certain events strauss and oppo didn’t meet until after the war remember and they say they have x number of atomic bombs and x number of super hydrogen bombs,2023-07-25 00:04:07
"i dont recall that line but i can say the us didnt expect the soviets to have an atomic bomb until 1953 so them detonating one in 1949 was a shock to the americans to say the least

my wife is very detail orientated so exposition kinda works for her she loved the story sound design and the fact it was a biopic for a change  i liked the movie but didnt love it  i felt like the scenes were cut like a movie trailer and the dialogue was like non stop which started to distract me  i loved the los alamos scenes especially in imax but thought the film was structurally a mess and overly convoluted,2023-07-22 10:59:13

that’s interesting and i think it’s also partially bc as a society we’re used to the culmination type movies with a clear goal being the driving force behind the plot and in the us we’re used to epic war hero movies that make ww2 into a simple good vs evil where “our boys” end up on top one of the things i liked about the trinity lead up only being half of the movie was how it turned this expectation on its head,2023-07-22 16:11:52
dude this was a real story christopher nolan didn’t go make up oppenheimer and make up reasons for his security clearance  that stuff all actually happened,2023-11-27 06:03:21
yes that alden ehrenrich who was really good in this had a mic drop of a final line maybe they were talking about more important things than you,2023-07-22 21:56:37
"totally get that i think i got frustrated trying to figure out lewis’ motivation and ended up laserfocusing on that during the end

i even suspected the aide of somehow working with or at least supporting oppenheimer which i don’t think there is any proof of whatsoever in the movie lol 
at beast his slightly critical or ambivalent towards lewis at the end",2023-07-22 22:14:14
oppenheimer is an excellent movie but it doesnt have the bite of a nolan movie imo i think it would have been better as a david fincher movie,2023-07-23 23:34:01
this sub is so miserable lol,2023-07-22 21:55:10
because most people did like it between every its the most brilliant piece of work and its too boring and too long nobody is calling it a bad movie and ive been reading reviews since the very beginning the first day was overwhelming positive second day was still positive with some exceptions third day is a mix,2023-07-22 22:18:36

"sure he had nothing to do with it personally but his life story pretty much revolved around those events so there must have been a change in tactics or planning based on these very important events

it just seems weird to ignore major events and solely focusing on oppenheimer when he was only tasked with creating the bomb because of such global events 

we dont need to watch another 3ish hour movie for each of these events when we could get 15ish minutes worth of scenes revolving around these that help paint the complete picture

whenever a movie is made around real life people and real life events the directorwriter is always tasked with the toughest job of deciding what to keep and what not to and while nolan did a good job mostly he missed out on certain key parts

showing a random professor for 5ish minutes isnt going to make me feel their importance without the movie telling me about why they are so important most of the characters arent fleshed out enough and just act like background characters to maintain a complete focus on oppenheimer but this leads to most of the movie feeling like oppie doing random talks with random people",2023-12-28 11:43:33
i read about david hill after but hes barely featured in the movie yet hes a key character at the end its never explained how he learned what he testified and up to that point hes shown to be just another scientist,2023-11-25 02:55:16
"im not a nolan fan at allbut this bs as a nolan fan  i like what others in popculture like so im a fan key and peele literally wrote a skit about people who pretend to like everything others like without no explanation of why do they actually like it

nolan has specific way of filming that stands out like scorsese and this film is literally on point with what he did in movies before only its longer since its biography and dialog focused",2023-11-28 12:13:22
i know but it breaks immersion when a nuclear explosion that has been built for nearly two hours looks like the average movie fireball it literally would have been more impressive with stock footage of a nuke test,2023-07-21 21:05:34
i assume that they unconsciously subscribe to aestheticism  and hope to see it in films period  not only this specific film,2023-07-26 12:54:31

i do not believe strauss and oppie met until after the war,2023-07-22 18:59:53
i don’t think strauss had interactions with oppie throughout the manhattan project all of their interactions came after,2023-07-22 19:02:40
"the film is a bit all over the place in this regard showing flash forwards countless times but the timeline is

oppie before the manhattan project hasn’t met strauss studying in europe visiting germany returning to usa to teach physics

oppie teaching still not met strauss attempting to organise a union

oppie being asked to direct the manhattan project still no strauss talking to einstein who he already knew about igniting the atmosphere 

oppie finishing the manhattan project almost at strauss meeting the president etc

strauss meeting oppie offering him a faculty position seeing him talk to einstein

oppie embarrassing strauss

oppie and strauss getting their security clearance rescinded",2023-07-22 18:50:11
it wasnt for the calculations he visited einstein when he was walking with a colleague who said something about patterns in tress there he discussed the possibility of fusion reaction in the atmosphere the other time he saw einstein was post war when strauss wanted him to take the role and einstein was with him on the lake at the startingwe see the scene from perspective of rdj and at the last in the first person of oppenheimer strauss was aware of the work oppie did and his reputation as was mentioned before he greets him from the car but they meet for the first time when he wants to give him a position at princeton,2023-07-22 19:02:13
"yes it is a war crime to  millions of civilians and radiate survivors so generations are born with defects for decades afterwards 

obviously you are completely ignorant and oblivious to the magnitude of the effect dropping abomb had on japanese

i know usa gets a free pass to  civilians of other nations but thats not an excuse to keep your individual head so deep up your individual ",2023-07-22 00:02:20
"for expecting spectacle from a scene ilustrating a real history event in which an army of one nation killed millions of civilians of another by dropping a bomb so powerful it turned them into ashes instantly

fixed it for you my unpretentious chill with genocide guy",2023-07-22 00:07:01
the soviet’s had some of world’s smartest people they just received almost no financial incentive for being as smart and distinguished that’s why i thought truman’s comments were arrogant at worst naive at best,2023-07-24 02:22:38
"thing is we people did have some idea stalins brutality was well known even to the soviets themselves who tried to distance themselves after his death  but the damage to their reputation had already crossed the point of no return

edit and you can add mao to that as well the leaders of the large communist nations were as close to evil as any human has ever been  shady western leaders dont even compare to these guys",2023-07-24 02:38:21
didn’t just miss it literally got up in the middle of the countdown like come on…,2023-07-22 04:26:40
yeah its not a great comparison hateful eight is an example of a  movie focused on a very narrow space and entirely carried by dialogue and tension  much like 12 angry men or carnage this one was overall a pretty standard biopic good interesting topic not overly flattering to its main character looking at you darkest hour but a much more conventional sort of movie and with much less unique dialogue i liked it but it didnt blow my mind  it had only a handful of truly standout scenes like oppenheimer talking in the gym,2023-07-22 06:24:27
fair enough  i guess i find historical events equally as captivating even given artistic license  appreciate the opinion either way  i can see the distinction,2023-07-22 05:59:30
i think the trinity test was wonderfully done in the sense that it was building anxiety and creating fear but the promo for this film shouldve never happened because its really misleading,2023-07-22 08:53:51
"yeah wow fair enough you felt that but man i totally disagree trinity explosion was absolutely nuts and had me on the edge of my seat

  
everything up until that moment worked i thought it was after the test that the film fumbled a bit and took a second to regroove i could buy back into it but i can see how some would cash out from there",2023-07-22 10:14:32
very specific and meaningful,2023-07-22 13:47:17
let me see it first pal i have no intention of seeing it,2023-07-22 10:49:11
those scenes gave us the testimony of all the people that worked with him where they got to speak their mind about exactly what kind of man they believed he was we saw who turned on him and who stayed true which was incredibly relevant to the movie overall,2023-07-23 05:09:12
i guess the implication is here is the one guy saying don’t make the h bomb and speaking out about preventing an arms race and he’s being shut out of the political limelight,2023-07-24 06:53:34
like a quick tiny peak of little boy before sealing the crate  but yep no mention i recall either,2023-07-23 02:58:22
i felt similarly out of the theater i haven’t been this mixed on liking and disliking a movie in a really long time part of me is more disappointed that i don’t love it then being disappointed with the movie itself especially seeing so many people enjoy it even if i wasn’t huge on it i’m glad it’s a movie still being released today and people are seeing,2023-07-25 05:50:55
ah didnt know what the exact time was i just remember that they said they were 9000 metres way maybe i heard wrong,2023-07-27 00:40:56
i thought it looked close to identical,2023-07-26 20:14:21
well he minimises the use of it at least,2023-07-21 22:53:28
land wellfor you you obviously never got laid for explaining quantum mechanics to a pretty girl,2023-07-22 10:32:36
i tought that was clear strauss had ambitions and he held a grudge against oppy,2023-07-27 13:23:46
and i’d be fine with that it’s not a bad screenplay  it how it’s edited gives it an unnatural and jarring pace it’s like the whole movie was at 125x speed on a podcast you’re trying to get through fast,2023-07-27 14:45:59
see i think he has too much warmth to approach oppenheimer as a character sorkins writing is too cozy and saccharine at times i think nolan works bc oppenheimer was also famously quite cold lol,2023-07-27 15:59:08
"i disagree here

i admire nolans commitment to practical effects over cgi however in the case of the trinity test i was disappointed that nolan went completely practical instead of working in some cgi you say that people wanting a big explosion are missing the thesis of the movie but i think the big explosion is the thesis

the entire movie and the book its based on compares oppenheimer to prometheus the man who stole fire from the gods and gave it to humans oppenheimer gave the us government the power of the greatest weapon built at the time 

i wanted a massive explosion to put it into context and show what oppenheimer built i wanted to see him dwarfed and overcome by the very thing he created i wanted to see a man standing in front of the two mile high mushroom cloud",2023-07-23 01:54:23
i mean we could have at least got something memorable from the movie,2023-07-22 22:33:08
it does in today scenes i dont think there was a single scene without him in the entire movie except for rdj scenes we saw only what he saw or at least the events he was an earshot within,2023-08-08 12:22:47
"this wasnt a story about the changes the world was going through at the time or feynman or the war this was a movie about oppenheimer and the security clearance hearings were a major part of his story that altered his entire life and the hearings were used as a story telling mechanism to talk about and tie together the different parts of his life as well as to show the political hit job that it was to redeem him in modern eyes

and what jump scares are you talking about",2023-08-20 18:22:28
in chronological order memento becomes a comedy i think with this movie it just makes it more obviously boring so yeah i guess easier to make cuts but the parts you leave in would still feel too abrupt and somehow rushed,2023-08-20 23:20:16
"i mean you just labeled the political dismantling and character assassination of a very complex person as boring

its a movie about oppenheimer and the security hearings are a major part of his life and identity what did you expect then",2023-08-25 12:19:00
i think people’s attention spans may be irrevocably damaged by the modern way of life,2023-07-21 15:50:16
"yeah i got the summary scene in the security clearance hearing but it was like the 3rd version of the same story opp had given and again the initial scene in the office with affleck was just completely lost on me  

dont  shame me",2023-07-21 16:10:17
some demon kid horror film,2023-07-23 02:06:55
it was for the upcoming the exorcist sequel—the exorcist believer,2023-07-23 05:05:10
my interpretation is that those are manifestations of oppenheimers inner doubts and fears about what he has unleashed less about what the reality iswas and what oppenheimer perceived reality to be,2023-07-23 13:13:29
"tbf i read a post on a website about things to know before watching oppenheimer because there were many characters and im quite slow at grasping things and i can lose focus  easily when im watching movies so this post contained information about the roles and about certain elementseventswithout spoliers in the movie including the two tones this post actually was very helpful for me as it didnt have many spoilers but valuable information without which i wouldnt have understood the final 30 mins of the movie i would even say that post made my experience watching the movie so much better

but to answer your question the black and white for strauss seemed quite clear to me from the start",2023-07-23 12:42:08
that makes a lot of sense,2023-07-23 12:23:35
"i was looking for a towering mushroom cloud i think an impressive explosion in this context would have amplified the idea of a horrific force thats been unleashed dovetailing with the quote of being a destroyer of worlds and of oppenheimer being this modern prometheus

there was also a big missed opportunity to remake this shot in cgi itd have been regarded as a natural extension of those abstract slowmo sparks and flashes we see earlier on in the film",2023-07-23 05:40:47
" im not sure the purpose was to make it look amazing 

the purpose was it to make it practically nolans selfimposed limitation hurt him this time",2023-07-23 04:11:43
i would think the idea would not be to make it impressive but to make it massive and scary the way that the actual footage looks,2023-07-23 07:09:12
" im not sure the purpose was to make it look amazing rather instead terrifying

instead it looked like a typical 90smovie gasoline explosion",2023-07-23 04:14:15
yep,2023-07-23 03:18:28
the initial red and the blinding white was definitely depicted then also there were hints of a few other colours seen  however at those times camera would also cut to the depiction of the actors and their reactions,2023-07-23 03:39:25
they used practical effects here and whole fire might have been hauntingly beautiful they definitely missed out on some potential visuals,2023-07-23 05:14:54
lol i mean if you don’t understand what i’m saying you’re just not that bright and that’s not what i was saying sooooo…sorry you’re just not that bright,2023-07-23 11:03:49
the director should have done that before he made the movie so he could see what a nuclear bomb explosion actually looks like,2023-07-23 04:13:26
and would also make it look more realistic  theres no reason not to have done so  at least no good reason,2023-07-22 13:58:41
no it’s not take titanic you know you’ll see the ship sink but you aren’t prepared for how it’s presented and the emotion behind it it wasn’t cool it was terrifying and sad,2023-07-22 14:06:28
it doesnt matter how you twist it it looks like that cause nolan didnt want cgi thats all,2023-07-22 13:57:10
"it did feel fast but kind of artificially so the whole first hour felt like a literal montage with no time to breathe and for me it dulled the emotional impact of the deep moral and philosophical topics presented it was just so rushed

the music added to that rushed feeling for me and while it did add suspense ultimately it was so pervasive that it eventually had kind of the opposite effect it was like bucket of popcorn that just got drenched in so much butter that it starts to ruin the snack i like butter but theres a limit and oppenheimer blasted right past that limit

that said im glad you enjoyed it its just a case of different strokes for different folks",2023-08-17 22:50:30
"film is as much about the road towards building the bomb as much as his guilt over it having said that heres the things i like and dont like

like nolan didnt show a pornographic overexaggerated sequence of death and mayhem in fact the few subtle scenes he shows of charred bodies hysterical crying  radiation poisoning etc are very effective at getting the message across

dont like the film is about oppenheimer sure but his name is forever married to the invention of the nuclear bomb and his guilt over that invention is a big theme of the film its only natural that if you want the audience to understand the gravitas of such an invention you show the actual devastation it causes

the scene couldve been carefully and respectfully crafted without being pornographic a good example is the hbo series chernobyl they showed the terrible effects of the plant meltdown without exaggerating its already terrible effects i feel oppenheimer wouldve a stronger film had nolan shown that",2023-07-22 12:50:40
i argue that by not showing them american audiences are taken off the hook as they always are by facing the true consequences of our actions this is just more of the same,2023-07-22 12:05:17
" but the the nuke in this movie looked better needed some cg to beef it up comments are strange to me  


hmm i dont personally think it needed cg in particular it just needed something to elevate it the the abstract shots in the opening felt really cool the parts where nolan tries to visualize opps imagination felt 1010 the effectsshots for the bomb itself felt like 7810 i was sitting smack dab in the middle of an imax screen too but i just really didnt feel like i was seeing an explosion of an atom bomb in particular   


i think it suffers the same issue that even dead reckoning did this time around they advertised the  out of the bike jump off a cliff which is cool in theory but it ultimately just felt lackluster overall for the big stunt of the film especially compared to its predecessors granted i think mi has much more of a safety net compared to oppenheimer cause it had 23 other action sequences to make up for it  


i liked what nolan was trying to do in theory for the bomb scene trying to give the more human approach to it but id be lying if i said i would have wanted a bit more given how well executed everything before it was the tension building was great but i feel like the aftershock was just there i just dont think nolan successfully conveyed the scale of a nuclear bomb i think he could have tried to physically show how far everyone actually was from the test site physically instead of just on the map for instance that wouldve helped people like me actually go oh  yall are really far away for this",2023-07-25 10:33:43
feels good we’re not alone at least,2023-08-03 17:00:42
its almost like  gasp  its okay for people to have different opinions,2023-08-03 17:14:26
the story was literally all reallife events  what do you mean it wasnt that good,2023-10-17 18:21:58
don’t listen to them i completely agree with you this film was a sleep fest my friend literally laid down across three movie seats and took a nap we were the only ones in the theater except for like two or three other people,2023-10-17 16:54:33
im glad im not the only one who feels that way i was like  is this looks like he threw some gas into a bonfire and filmed it close up i thought he was going to create the inside of the bomb during the chain reaction using some crazy film technique but we got nothing,2023-07-21 12:36:36
"that is true nolan is too proud to use cgi even when it would have improved that scene manifold

another problem i have with the bomb  that the mathematics doesnt work out the sound travels at 343 ms and assuming they were sitting some 9 miles away the sound should have been heard in 2025 seconds and not more than a minute later it was very gimmicky",2023-07-21 11:49:15
"completely disagree they do not give a good indication of how much time is passing they dont really explain who everybody is and what they do 30 of the dialogue is hard to hear because of the score that gets absurdly loud compared to the vocal levels and its moving so  fast that its hard to digest not to mention the absolutely needless non linear story telling that adds nothing to movie except another way to push the pace forward and add confusion

like yeah broadly speaking its never hard to understand what is going on but on a scene by scene basis nolan doesnt seem to give a single  about conveying what its supposed to mean the movie is the epitome of thing happens thing happens thing happens jean dies heres one scene of grief thats 10 seconds long thing happens end

the movie is extremely boring due to the singular pace the trinity  pretty much the only point in the movie that doesnt move at a 100 miles an hour and it looks really lame im anti cgi but when its the centerpiece of the movie he can probably stretch that a tadbit fast pace doesnt mean the movie is good and somehow nolan has convinced himself otherwise in these last two movie

this movie is only above tenet its nowhere near anything else much less the best hes done maybe if the movie cut out the student section at the beginning and used that time to slow the movie down it might be alongside tdkr comparing this to prestigeinceptioninterstellar is quite frankly insulting to good movie making

im also really sick of nolan having a puzzle piece in every movie to end it on hes been doing it since what the prestige",2023-07-22 21:41:45
how so specifically,2023-07-22 22:56:21
still no explanation,2023-07-22 23:01:50
it doesnt mean it cant be done again and told a different way,2023-07-25 07:15:27
thanks for giving the first part i was not disinterested in the biopic part i just think that the security aspects should be absolutele first maybe nolan thought that the subject is overtalked by other previous media,2023-07-25 22:36:19
social network was not a character study movie which showed mark zuckerberg’s personal issues or his conflicts it just told how facebook was born with some elements of fiction incorporated in it comparison would’ve been fair if that movie was called “zuckerberg” and explored further on to what happened with mark’s life afterwards oppenheimer had it’s own set of problems with off pacing for 2040 minutes at start of film and at times with sound mixing and scenes after scenes of what happened told through characters relentlessly talking but whatever happened to him really can’t be dumbed down it would’ve worked better  as a tv series to give the story some breathing room in between for audiences to not run around in their minds in between the scenes to get a grasp on everything that’s being said but still it was a good film,2023-07-25 18:17:12
"you need to judge the movie you saw not the movie you wanted tothought you would see

exactly what is this  of reviewing a movie harshly for not being the movie the critic thought it would be and instead being a different movie about different things thats like reviewing dunkirk negatively because you thought the movie should have been about dday instead",2023-07-25 18:12:24
"totally  i loved the immediate silence and the gym scene which really delved into the human horror of a nuclear attack but the actual explosion itself it seemed compressed and minuscule while all other aspects of the film felt so large the performances the sets the frame even the quanta felt massive

i think the practical explosion to mimic the nuke was either a misstep or not performed to the best it could have been nothing about it felt more powerful than the ship full of explosives briefly shown exploding much earlier in the film

 shame but it’s my only real nit to pick with this one and i could easily reedit it myself with some other nuclear bomb footage  so no sweat",2023-07-21 20:44:10
the point wasn’t really to show the explosion it was meant to show that it worked and that it represented the culmination of everyone’s work the focus is on the “quiet” moment of triumph followed by the exultation and emotional release of the characters involved it’s really about how the creators experienced it not to make a broader point about nukes,2023-07-21 21:28:57
 it really wasn’t i’m not sure what you were expecting,2023-07-22 16:29:23
you might be right for me it seemed to add something to the acting i think i might watch again in nonimax,2023-07-22 20:11:11
got it yeah i didn’t have a problem following the timeline likely because of the color vs black and white for some reason i was thinking there may be a deeper reasoning,2023-07-22 20:47:41
"well yeah 

sorry i didn’t get your point i don’t mean that in a snarky way",2023-07-23 09:43:25
"two of the best documentaries in recent times were for starters moonage daydream  all the beauty and the bloodshed

nolan himself said he instantly appreciated the parralels in narrative and editing style when he watched moonage daydream near the end of his work on oppenheimer",2023-07-23 11:42:48
ya it did,2023-07-23 19:06:06
totally it added an extra layer of dimension to the film,2023-07-23 19:07:33
"i think it is important but not the main point it was digestible to some extent but definitely need to watch it a second time the thing is i normally tend to over analyse everything during a movie but i said to myself before watching this movie that i’m going to try to feel it instead of trying to understand it and i’m glad i did i felt so much during the movie by just looking at body language and  expressions

the scene where they were planning the attacks on japan had a lot of impact for example just as the speech from oppie after the bombings it made me have chills all over my body and made me have a very unsettling feeling",2023-07-24 10:50:28
agreed its a complementary work with the book but not great as a standalone one,2023-07-24 21:10:25
"still not sure what the point is you’re trying to make — did the plot not follow that same structure

 studies all over becomes a leading mind in science
 leads the mproject builds and tests the bomb
 deals with the notoriety and guilt in the aftermath

what am i missing",2023-07-26 00:33:31
yes thats the point,2023-07-26 04:55:35
thats an extremely reductive way of looking at it both visuals and score had a huge role to play in this movie the first act when hes in europe the trinity test when the bomb explodes i never felt like its just people talking,2023-07-25 15:24:49
absolutely this very much reflects my feelings about the movie,2023-08-09 02:16:56
"and all 3 parts were important

first part showcased that a person is not useless just because they have some trouble

second part showcased how he was conned and motivated to build the bomb

third part showcases how he was being lied to and being manipulated as the nazis were never close to building a bomb and wanted to focus on fission energy reactors and the japanese were super close to surrendering but they nuked them anyways

 he just decided to take an hour detour frantically jumping around timelines before abruptly tying things back together

and that detour is where you currently live and the people in the detours dictate your life the portrayal of the government officials was perfect lies blackmail  corruption the whole lot

unfortunately im getting the sense that people in this thread just dont care what their future looks like and are more than happy to let bloodthirsty hooligans run rampant in any government",2023-08-07 17:18:43
yeah this is my feeling too,2023-08-07 14:14:35
no we didnt,2023-08-14 04:28:14
theres plenty of action films emulating nuclear explosings this one was about the perspective of those who made it seeing the bombs leave the terrain as if its some standard shipping and then hearing it from the radio was the right choice i think,2023-08-13 19:55:29
"i thought it was handled about as well as i can imagine without amping it up like that we wouldve had just very wooden speeches or parts of the hearings that level of drama balanced it out with how messed up he likely was over the whole thing giving us a glimpse into his mind rather than just the words we know he said

for example it wouldve just come across as inappropriate to show his speech without amping the living f out of the drama of it all",2023-08-24 07:49:22
the bomb could have been used in the bay of tokyo a huge mushroom would have frightened much more people without killing,2023-08-26 12:24:43
very few people on planet earth with an appreciation for those aspects of filmmaking  all done perfectly in this movie  and an interest in oppenheimer the mannuclear philosophy would be bored by this movie i think the general audience reaction will reflect that,2023-07-22 01:47:02
"i mean if youre going to spend most of your marketing on ads that specifically bring into question how the bomb scene was made then people are going to notice

also the movie itself  i thought i was going to learn what made him the first person to develop this weapon or why the bomb worked instead you just see the bomb being assembled   explosion  a boring storyline about his trial probably meant to convey the corruption in government which is something a lot of people have already figured out",2023-11-25 08:10:56
"i actually did it the other way and barbie helped alleviate whatever sense of doom oppenheimer made me feel not entirely but it helps when you have the entire theatre filled with women howling in laughter

the latter sounds like a std  i guess its upto preferences how long you want the oppenheimer angst to stay with you,2023-07-21 22:21:21

i watched the movie yesterday thats how i know in the first scene with nudity with bhagavad gita they zoomed into her face and in the second one where she is sitting they edited a black cloak on her body  it looked whack not gonna lie if you knew a  scene was there you would have figured it out,2023-07-22 03:26:54
yeah lol i am 23 but there were a lot of teens in the movie in the first scene with nudity they zoomed into her face and in the second one they edited a black cloak on her body,2023-07-22 03:13:36
i dont recall hearing one  where were they,2023-07-22 04:42:00

"the film was shot using some film in that aspect ratio and before the movie released people were complaining that they didnt want it cropped to preserve the original images as shot only imax screenings with the appropriate sized screen displayed the film in its 100 accurate aspect ratio with no loss or tiny box of footage with black all around

see croppenheimer

i was lucky enough to see oppenheimer in 70mm imax today and it was awesome when the footage went through the different aspect ratios",2023-07-26 03:42:34
yep thats what makes certain people special,2023-08-06 16:22:35
made it seem trivial the humiliation should have been the final straw that pushed strauss over the edge instead its basically his entire motivation,2023-07-21 16:51:02
if u liked the movie ur bar is very low,2023-08-03 21:44:18
my criticisms are obvious and you know theyre obvious because youve been giving one sentence replies to criticisms of oppenheimer nonstop for the last week youve heard these arguments before one hundred times we can all see your post history,2023-08-07 19:10:50
"nope anyone can see any movie and have any opinion they want about it

i can also complain that i find the discourse of people who arent media literate tiring its okay to say men arent necessarily supposed to get barbie because its a film for women which is true and as a man i enjoyed it too but i cant say that some people may not necessarily get oppenheimer i guess",2023-08-03 20:21:11

i mean he was a notorious womanizer to render him sexless does far more injustice to the character it’s not like we were subjected to protracted  scenes i too hate the reliance on empty  to sell but i don’t think this is a fair critique oppenheimer did  and got in serious trouble for it,2023-07-24 12:28:08

"it couldve been done without any full several intimate scenes on it i think its worth it for the 13pg rating i suppose nolan knew from the beginning that its not like any of his other movies so he decided to go full mature and non family friendly with it 

i was just expecting it to be based more on the historical scenario and humanity as a whole like most of his other movies not to go that far deep into oppenheimer and make it feel like a biography so its a bit unexpected based on christopher nolans other works",2023-07-21 16:46:50
theres 10 minutes of the film that are gorgeous in 70mm and 2 hours and 50 minutes that i could have watched on a  game boy advance and missed nothing,2023-07-21 23:19:30

also any movie that includes  scenes just because they can… it’s makes the movie cheap",2023-07-21 16:29:04
not really oppenheimer was wellknown before this movie was announced for having qualms about the bomb and being accused of communist ties i didn’t hear of any rightwingers being excited for this movie,2023-07-25 02:17:11
in my experience right wing people dont respect science or intellectuals i have no idea why they would have any interest in this movie,2023-07-25 01:44:15
yea i guess its about what you expect vs what you get and how ok you are with it i have a habit of forgetting to enjoy a movie despite its flaws when the expectations are sky high that will be my motivation for a second watch later on thanks for the talk,2023-07-24 08:43:52
im just saying with jean it went from their first encounter to her throwing his flowers away and apparently hating him of course her mental health issues became clear by the end of the movie but at that moment it felt like they skipped a step,2023-07-22 12:06:44

tenet in home theater is barely watchable the sound is all over the place and the mixing downright awful it destroyed a really intriguing story i wanted to like it as i love these uselessly overcomplicated stories but this one not really for me but oppenheimer worked for me the sound shouldnt be pleasent in that one and it wasnt,2023-07-28 15:02:27

to be fair i thought the movie was downright amazing and i’m not really a nolan fan like only 3 of his movies really and most of the criticism i’m reading on this thread makes my eyes roll pretty hard but can 100 get behind more feynman,2023-07-23 01:24:39

i have been hyping up this movie a lot to her for a while and shes not necessarily a big movie person to begin with let alone a big 3 hour dialogue heavy biopic so just a quick brush up on the history of the security clearance issue  important people involved i think would allow her to enjoy the second half of the film a lot more wasn’t trying to say she is dumb she is smarter than me in many ways lol,2023-07-24 19:21:23

anything other insightful questions you’d like to add",2023-07-24 18:40:38
i do brother i do but at least i dont think i need to bring some paper and crayons so my girlfriend can follow one of the biggest movies of the year,2023-07-24 20:46:40
"correct

that kind of plays into the fission vs fusion titles at the beginning fission is splitting of a heavier atom to produce a smaller bomb so effectively the development and immediate results of having developed the bombs dropped on japan

fusion was black and white and fusion is combining lighter atoms to create a larger one producing drastically greater energy so its no longer about just the bomb to drop on japan but instead what to do in the new age where all countries will have capabilities to drop multiple atom bombs",2023-08-06 21:48:10
what did you expect to learn how to make an atomic bomb the movie showed disagreements between the scientists differences in morals and ambitions as well as the consequences oppenheimer’s downfall is an integral part to understanding him as a person which you claim the film didn’t accomplish frankly i have no clue how you didn’t learn anything about him hard to overstate how much i disagree with you i guess that’s cinema,2023-07-22 04:43:18
"we learned nothing new about the development of the bomb

the movie was called “oppenheimer” not “the bomb” for a reason it’s about the man",2023-07-22 05:37:24
if you walked up to random people in your theatre after the movie was done and you asked them what the movie was about i can almost guarantee you 99 will say something along the lines of the atom bomb the manhattan project the guy who made the atomic bomb yeah the political drama was a major plot point but it certainly wasnt 50 of the movie also were you expecting this to be a groundbreaking documentary about the manhattan project why did you expect to learn something new about an already heavily documented period in human history while watching a historical drama,2023-07-22 05:00:37

interstellar wants a word in the parking lot on millers planet,2023-07-24 05:10:48
the movie wasnt about the manhattan project it was about oppenheimer it was his life and how the us government uses scientists and spits them out after they give them what they want and how powerful people in the middle of the 20th century used the red scare to their advantage,2023-07-25 13:16:17
last i checked they actively were supporting russia while calling domestic protesters communists,2023-07-23 03:53:24
"theres also a large portion of the world that actively shutout idiotic politicallyfueled drama past and present  i had surface level knowledge of the red scare before and dont give a rats  about how obsessed this movie was about communism  its like margarine  dont want it in me

the fact that i had to stomach watching my embarrassing country be imbeciles over this thing for 2 hours just to get to the fun 1 hour of science in this movie was infuriating",2023-07-23 06:11:11

 too many people in this thread wanted this to be ‘atomic bomb’ the movie not oppenheimer",2023-07-23 15:41:29
"the last 3rd of the book the film is being adapted from focuses on the communiststrauss angle that hounded oppenheimer in his later years and does a great job connecting certain events in his early life that led to the troubles later same with the scientists they are periphery characters as it focused on oppenheimer’s experience 

considering this has been widely promoted as an adapted screenplay of a wellknown book it very much does the job it set out to do",2023-07-23 17:19:37
"justification typically taught for the dropping of the bomb is the potential for massive casualties in the vent of an invasion of the japanese home islands not that germany was still in the picture

the us turning its attention to the pacific theater after the war in europe was finished is a pretty significant part of the overall narrative of wwii from an american perspective mixing up the order seems like either you had a very poor teacher or personally glossed overforgot the information more so than anything to do with propaganda",2023-07-23 20:29:22
arguably it would be more painting the us in a bad light if the us had dropped bombs on japan only while germany was still at war with us  what would have been the motive for bombing japan alone in that context other than pure antijapanese racism  if germany had still been in the war the bomb would have been dropped on them,2023-07-23 20:31:45

"i think the editing was bad like for a half hour before the bomb it got its groove with the score but besides that it just felt off and bombarding
the score was amazing though
listened to it today while  whacking
i just wish it was set to a more concise version of oppenheimer
i liked the ending alot how it tied up neatly
that first hr is very unforgettable",2023-07-22 06:14:02
maybe its a frantic panic induced nightmare because… oppenheimer lived it that way remember the script was written in first person subjective focus on what oppie felt saw thought etc,2023-07-24 18:24:22

ps i  hate tenet with a passion lol

every few months i think back on the concepts and wonder if i might actually love it but it fails in execution

i love the action scenes i love the vibe i adore the soundtrack but it’s too cheesy and i hate that they solved the greatest and ultimate threat to all energy in our universe entropy and use it to prank each other on earth and play hot potato with physical blocks of metal that are apparently “the algorithm”",2023-07-21 20:59:16
"i totally agree that he’s not at the spielberg or cameron level yet and certainly not kubrick but not that he is the best modern director

i actually think denis could be that guy he’s older than nolan and took longer to reach his filmmaking potential but every single film has been a thoughtprovoking wonder that somehow avoids the pitfalls of pretension it’s all left to us to compliment it because his films never once seem to call attention to how brilliant what he’s doing is they just are",2023-07-22 00:23:33
it was heavy handed imo kitty already knew the details what she took issue with is that it was now on record she was more bothered by his lack of a fight when being “tarred and feathered”,2023-08-28 04:29:18

its also the most literal interpretation an artist can think of,2023-08-28 18:43:39
i mean yeah but it is also the most kindergarten level of symbolism you can think of,2023-08-31 18:45:47
excellent but how long did it take for the movie to communicate these stakes,2023-07-28 16:25:49
stakes means contingency what you describe are the implications of two different ideologies not how they relate to one mans security clearance and its completely unrealistic to think that one mans security clearance had any implications at all on the game theoretics of nuclear strategy between the us and ussr especially considering that one of the reasons strauss sought to undermine oppenheimer was because of oppenheimers opposition to the hbomb meaning that even if he kept his clearance there were forces seeking to dismiss his arguments,2023-07-28 16:48:38
the movie was inspired by a biographical book called american prometheus  if you havent heard  that is why the film is shaped this way and accounts for some more important moments in his life that may not necessarily mean much in the grand scheme of geopolitics he is just a man after all,2023-07-28 16:14:56
because he recruits many of his students and colleagues from before the manhattan project because his travels and studies and relationships with competing countries helps us understand why he was chosen as director of the program because it’s a film about oppenheimer the man not specifically the bomb itself why even go see a historical biopic if you have no interest in learning about the titular historical figure,2023-07-28 17:17:30
"literally lol i think a lot of people know the movie  but they twist that into “the sucky bits were deliberate it’s a sign of how masterful and clever nolan is”  and any genuine critique is shouted down as “you’re just too  to understand the film” 

i honestly think this is the reason it has such a high rating nolan and his fanboys have built this mythology that questioning the movie equates to being  or lacking in some kind of advanced literary analysis skills i genuinely think people don’t understand movies like tenet because they are nonsensical and rather than say i didn’t get it or i couldn’t follow it they use that as some weird evidence of nolan’s superior genius it makes ppl feel smart to like his films",2023-07-29 03:37:53
because if a movie doesnt follow the guidance of matt parker it cannot be considered good,2023-07-28 21:08:03
its time to grow up from thinking that all movies should follow the 3act structure look up 5act movie structure,2023-07-29 02:16:52
theres a difference between an antagonist and a villain strauss wasnt inherently evil,2023-07-29 09:02:17
this aint endgame,2023-07-29 13:56:51
"thank you again for sharing the link i did see the video its just i want to get more from their writing advice but ill read the article later

i agree with you about nolans writing i read long ago that someone describes his writing as checklist writing they said that his writings leave no room for breathing and that everything the characters do and say contributes to the plot they dont do anything else besides moving the plot forward in the end you have very onedimensional characters because the plot is more important

edit

found it",2023-09-22 10:37:13
"i do or more accurately i disagree with how you’re applying it

it’s a useful guideline for writing a story just like the three act structure save the cat or the hero’s journey are but if you use that guideline  or any guideline  as an inflexible lens for critically evaluating a story then you might miss the “point” of why and how the story is being told

it’s a bit like hearing george orwell’s writing rules where he strongly advocates for terse disciplined language and then using that to dismiss j r r tolkien as a bad writer

take each story on its own terms this will provide a better means of analysis because you can properly engage with what the creator is trying to do plus it’s more entertaining",2023-08-01 23:57:22
i was super disappointed by the test beautiful build up but really didnt capture the magnitude of what a nuclear explosion would be imo honestly left a bad taste in my mouth for the rest of the movie definatly agree they shouldve spiced it up with cgi,2023-07-21 06:21:33
thanks for that very interesting i really should have read up on it before going in  i must have been blind because it was only after that i realised strauss was rdj,2023-07-22 06:50:06

"watching critical thinking skills go out the window is annoying  

youre underwhelmed by a miniature practical effect mockup of a nuclear explosion literally a scaleddown minature so they could control how the explosion evolved and get it to look right as faithful a recreation as an artistic interpretation of a blackwhite recording series can be of a nuclear explosion i dont know how to better articulate how idiotic and vapid your statements sound 

esploshun coulda been bigger my pappy made bigger bootleg fireworks in his garagegubment shoulda let that nolan feller crack off a moab or sumthin give it a bit more kick

look at this real life explosion that caused billions in damage killed hundreds of people and basically crippled a major port city its way more impressive than that piddly  they did in that oppenheimer movie  

youre actually thick in the head",2023-07-23 21:09:53
i am us born and raised also at this very moment i am less than a mile away from the world trade center i actually didn’t feel that this movie directly countered what you were saying but i do think it speaks to that point to a degree it seemed to me it was more about how oppenheimer ushered in the nuclear age and the realizations about what comes with that which is why he kept speaking on creating regulations after to me the biggest take away was the personal grief oppy felt but it didnt scream “nukes are bad” imo i can definitely see how you or anyone else could take it another way though i may have some biases blinding me i need a rewatch too,2023-07-22 14:29:39
“so the movie can happen”,2023-07-24 01:44:37
well that’s nolan “oh this is so cool” but tenet was so bad we watched at home and legit turned it off and had to finish the next day,2023-07-24 03:09:21
sorry yes perspectives not timelines because it was all happening at the same time,2023-07-24 01:31:09
yeah especially when hes whiningshouting about oppy to the political aide towards the end when its clear things arent going his way anymorehe acted exactly like tony stark arguing with steve rogers lol thought he was good before that scene though,2023-08-03 00:12:31

i will never understand the hype that movie was so incredibly dumb and the acting was terrible,2023-07-23 18:01:26
well no this is the controversial section means your comment isnt a popular one reviews say otherwise sorry kid,2023-07-26 21:59:02
that line is actually said during  i assumed that was a funny joke wow,2023-07-21 13:56:25
"it’s insensitive to have that document in a  scene to begin with but from a movie perspective i just don’t think it’s really true to the character who had alot of respect for hinduism

i think it was very intentional on nolans part because hes using the scene to establish a key part of oppenheimers character in it a lot of the early film is dedicated to oppenheimer wanting to put everything into context like his initial statement to the oversight board or the way his understanding of communism was shaped by reading das kapital in german rather than english but at the same time he shows no comprehension of things like history and politics and thats really what gets him into trouble it never occurs to him that strauss might hold a grudge because of the way oppenheimer undermined him or how kittys association with the communist party could come back to haunt him two decades later to him strauss is a natural ally because they work for the same organisation and their disagreement is purely intellectual while kittys communist leanings do not matter because they happened so far back in the past

the  scene is important because oppenheimer  who is still quite young here  is looking at the text as an object of intellectual curiosity he sees reading something in sanskrit as a challenge to be mastered first and foremost and doesnt see the religious undertones if anything he probably views it as poetry  the baghavad gita is part of the mahabharata an epic poem not unlike the iliad or odyssey  considering that he is briefly seen with a copy of the hollow men early in the film the point is that the scene is foreshadowing oppenheimers biggest flaw he assumes everyone shares his ideals and so underestimates how their personal context influences their behaviour he doesnt understand the more esoteric aspects of humanity that put that person into context",2023-07-21 14:16:41
yes exactly that  when time is of the essence he does this trope a lot  happens in the batman films too,2023-07-23 04:47:48
i didn’t call the critics uneducated teenagers i said that i wouldn’t expect an uneducated teenager to be very impacted the actual test didn’t look like what many would think an atomic explosion looks like i’m not trying to condescend and i’m not angry at people who don’t like this movie lol i’m just explaining some of the dissent for anybody who may be put off by the “it’s just three hours of men in suits being mad at eachother and then a  explosion” ,2023-07-26 19:27:02
to add to this we are also introduced to the idea oppenheimer is incredibly smart  he learns dutch and gives a talk in the language in 6 weeks  he is later shown as fluent in several other languages,2023-07-27 02:05:17
that meeting was the aec one of strausss arguments for pursuing the hydrogen bomb was that russia had all our intel anyway because there was a spy at los alamos oppenheimer clings to the notion there was no spy because hes consumed with so much guilt he doesnt want nuclear warfare to advance any further every scene with strauss is after the manhattan project,2023-08-20 07:10:46
"oh yea i feel like oppenheimers sound design was really the only thing that felt remotely imax or da worthy dune just like bladerunner has so many screenshotworthy frames with a scale thatd be very hard to feel on a tv much less so on a tablet or a phone   


but i can see why some people may like oppenheimer over dune dunes presentation is much less energetic than a movie like oppenheimer where theres music playing constantly in pretty much every scene theres the puzzle piece aspect of it the sound design and editing feels much more kinetic compared to dune where it feels like youre following pauls slow journey into arrakis",2023-08-30 07:26:32
"my interpretation of the movie is that during the whole film you feel like a bomb is going to explode you just dont know when and youre scared because you know its going to be loud  


now imagine what people lived through during the cold war knowing that it was just a matter of time a bomb would drop and cause a chain reaction of bigger bombs knowing it could end life as we know it  


so taking his security clearance away i think its the point of it its important that the h bomb doesnt see light because it can cause more destruction we dont need it war is over then why are we arguing about making bigger bombs  
the point of the movie is phlosophical  


i am sorry for my english im not a native speaker",2023-07-28 14:25:15
it sounds like you just don’t care about history in general why on earth you went to see a 3 hour historical drama is beyond me lol what were you even expecting oppenheimer in rambo gear shooting atom bombs from the hip at nazis for three hours,2023-07-28 14:28:49

"atomic spy is such a cool name  

btw was just saying that the suspicion and the race situation was not just due to red scare  i mean it is but it is not that unreasonable imo  its like the prisoners dillema",2023-07-22 14:53:45
there was no real secret though once you knew it could be done it was only a matter of time money and technology,2023-07-22 15:35:33

"as a casual film and history enjoyer and someone who found oppenheimer to be extremely emotionally affective and awe inspiring i found your review to be the first criticism i’ve read that doesn’t feel like nolan hate it felt like history love 

i wonder if the portrayal you’re looking for would be better served as an hbo docuseries akin to chernobyl give the horror some time to marinate 

history is an endless series of rabbit holes and rarely do some of its most important events get representation even half as faithful as oppenheimer",2023-07-22 19:04:47
"im just telling it like it is man for me it was utterly overstimulating
edit oh  im logged in on a different account on my phone horrifying",2023-07-22 19:16:10
i saw it at an imax there were some scenes that were good but the majority of the film absolutely didnt need to be seen on an imax and that was false advertising imo they were banking on nolans reputation,2023-07-22 20:10:18
"i stand corrected this is an actual source which i didnt have for the time when the berkeley scientists got the news

i had read so much about the rapid dissemination by word of mouth—along the eastern seaboard—that i assumed it spread across the country the same way i guess i overestimated the social connectivity across the continent at that time werent there longdistance phone calls this is after telephone repeaters were common though they were based on vacuum tubes

meitner and frishs conversation was on christmas 1938 i also overestimated the time bohr spent crossing the atlantic in that time it would have taken about 4 days not a month it makes sense that it would be in a newspaper by jan 29

im still surprised they didnt get a phone call from a colleague earlier but maybe the west coast scientists were more socially isolated by their geographic distance",2023-07-25 02:00:02
dunkirk had far more variation in pace which made the action bits more exciting,2023-07-22 23:18:52
"this is the most pretentious answer i can imagine holy   


the movie should be easy to follow whether you have a political science degree or not it fails to be so and not because people turned off their brains or expected something with action the movie does not put in the leg work to make any of the other scientist characters actual characters besides tellerstrauss 

and when i say easy to follow i dont mean i need simple english at all times and a pen through a folded piece of paper i mean i want to know who these people are and what they contributed and how much time is passing instead of just flying through literally every scene of the movie with reckless abandon giving the least amount of information as possible

im not talking about the different periods in oppenheimers life im saying that the first two acts did not properly show the passage of time during the manhattan project there is no care and no sense of urgency given by the story because until matt damon says its been 4 years they dont actually give you a frame of reference the bowl with the marbles means nothing because we have no sense of time when it comes to the intervals between them

this movie requiring multiple viewings is more of a flaw its based on the movies complete disinterest in informing the viewer on what is happening while having the fastest pace i have ever seen it makes pure action movies like the raid 2 blush what makes repeat viewings great is seeing new layers based on revelations made near the end of the movie not the movie failing to care to tell the audience even the bare minimum",2023-07-22 23:06:47
youre right next time around i hope nolan sends out a public service message before his movie releases this movie is only to be viewed by people who can appreciate the art of history and cinema the rest of mortals who are just ignorant  who dont know anything shouldnt be allowed also political science degree is mandatory this is the way,2023-07-22 23:17:51
no it’s not implicitly understood because you literally said the exact opposite,2023-07-22 22:46:59
" if youre looking for an action movie then yeah of course youre going to view it as boring

you are still relying on this strawman and not understanding what he said saying that a historical movie is boring does not mean that he would have prefered an action movie it means that the historical movie was boring stop presenting a false dichotomy

however i would argue that it is in fact an action movie its one of the most fast paced movies ive ever seen and the soundtrack does not ever stop from being very loud and very intense 

nothing about the cinematography of this movie indicates historical biopic john wick 4 was slower paced and had more breathing room for its dialogues",2023-07-22 22:48:43
people keep arguing that when someone calls it boring there are plenty of boring action movies,2023-07-22 23:51:57
"thats a good point and its certainly true in the real world 

for the movie though the big decisions are renewing oppenheimers q clearance and the senate voting on strauss for commerce secretary the ramifications of those decisions isnt clear at all 

they both matter for the men personally but trinity is complete the ivy mike shot has already been done",2023-07-24 15:37:28
"it probably depends greatly on where you see it sadly it’s impossible to see it in 70mm in washington state but the seattle pacific science center imax showed it in its original aspect ratio on its massive true imax screen between the audio literally rumbling the seats and the massive screen that suffocated you with every atomic blast i felt it brought a level of immersion worthy of seeing it in the theater certainly one that elevated it beyond the standard biopic and lended gravitas to the horrors resulting from his work 

but in terms of screenplay i could definitely see that they covered many decades of his life in three hours using the overlapping timelines to juggle it all but it would probably be pretty effective conveyed more traditionally in a well produced show",2023-07-30 09:17:17
i think imax being so immersive and  loud really aids to shock the world into remembering the horrific implications of nuclear weapons and the immense suffering their creator endured to prevent their use,2023-07-30 06:43:11

no i only mentioned tenet,2023-07-21 14:05:03
"the film is very much about his personal experiences did he personally experience the bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki no and he only heard about it on the radio and thats exactly what we saw in the movie no need for gratuitous scenes of destruction and the emotional hit plays perfectly

 everyone’s heard of it so an explanation of what it really means would’ve been cool

einstein was indicating that similar to his own life they will celebrate you until your use diminishes then vilify you then finally give you an award near the end of your life  but that award is not for you rather for the other people to pat each other on their backs",2023-07-23 03:28:35

"i was expecting more focus on the bomb and the actual science i have no idea what happened at los alamos and the movie didn’t explain it i’m led to believe they sat around for 3 years playing with ignition devices and just waiting for enough plutonium 

another commenter put it best i think when they were all celebrating after trinity it fell a little flat for me because i have no idea how hard they actually worked to make it happen",2023-07-24 14:54:20
yes every second of the trailer led me to believe that a total mismatch in expectation kudos to the acting nonetheless,2023-07-24 15:34:03

those 3 movies are widly considered among the best of the last decade,2023-07-22 01:48:57
in reality it was probably just him being  but that entire scene is a direct way of oppenheimer thinking he himself is death the bomb those very close to him are burned to char he steps on it those slightly further away have their faces peeling off those in the back of the room are really fatally sick and crying while those outside the room or blast radius perhaps have radiation sickness,2023-07-22 00:59:16
" if they were trying to convey radiation sickness imagery

you were not paying attention at all if you didnt realise it was portraying radiation sickness youre acting like the scene had one charred corpse one guy being sick and then ends when in reality there was 10x more to it

seems you went in wanted to dislike it",2023-07-22 01:44:27
i think youre proving his point lol,2023-07-22 02:26:53
you realize a napoleon movie is coming out already ceaser and malcom x have both been done nolan wanted to tell a movie about oppenheimer maybe thats what he wanted why does it have to be what everyone else wants,2023-07-22 22:10:15

first time seeing a biopic,2023-07-22 16:37:37
"no im mostly just surprised that you thought it wouldshould only focus on that

that would be a terrible biopic tell us only what we already know",2023-07-24 19:20:35
yall need to go into movies especially a nolan film with less concrete expectations apparently we should all know by now promotional materials are meant to promote the movie the bomb is great promotion for an oppenheimer biopic its really not hard to see that lol,2023-07-25 15:33:23
exactly that,2023-07-24 13:01:50
apparently that happened in real life when they met,2023-07-27 14:56:42
the others were portraying things that actually happened theyre relevant context kitty could have just recoiled for the same effect in a more tasteful fashion also the movie was full of surrealism and abstract takes so i dont think this added anything in that aspect,2023-07-22 04:17:00
how often do we see things from anyones perspective except oppie any other movie would have just shown kitty recoiling in some way the idea of him being laid bare makes sense so i agree there i just think it lingered too long and the way the actress performed just felt weird and disrespectful,2023-07-22 03:41:10
nudity doesnt really bother me in movies its how long they are that bother me 30 seconds to a minute of  isnt that bad but 15 minutes would be atrocious,2023-07-22 03:16:12
it’s 2023 maybe ,2023-07-22 03:51:44
the movie initially shows us oppenheimer was cynical and suspicious of communism at the beginning of the film and then somehow he just suddenly turned into a communist sympathizer with zero reasons and explanation given midway through the movie,2023-07-24 08:53:36
he was open to all kinds of ideas not just communism but communism was so derisive during that time period everyone focused on that part of him id say a lot of the movie showcased that,2023-07-24 13:18:46
"theres the scene where niels bohr implores him to hear the music rather than just read the sheet as a metaphor for his approach to physics its after this that he becomes interested in modernist literature and art eliot and picasso the cause of the spanish civil war etc i think he needed to understand the revolutions happening in the worlds of art and politics in order to revolutionise physics in the same way

his flirtations with the communist party before the war mainly came out of his sympathy for the spanish republic and its not hard to understand his aversion to fascism as a jew who studied in germany in the 1920s",2023-07-24 14:53:18
he only slept with 2 women in the movie is that enough to call someone a womanizer ,2023-07-24 12:05:32
"agreed we still have no idea what his motivations and drives were we also didnt see the true emotional impact of the nukes on japan that it has on oppenheimer were just supposed to accept that he feels bad about his involvement which changed his mind about developing the h bomb

the movie says and shows so much but at the end only about 510 of the scenes stay with you",2023-07-24 08:44:13
yea i think people would possibly enjoy this film more if they knew more about it if i didn’t watch a documentary a week before i would have been lost haha the book is on my to read list now,2023-07-24 20:13:40
his dialogue is also one of the biggest problems ive been having with nolan films not every line from a characters mouth needs to be some kind of a profound proverb words of wisdom or thinly veiled foreshadowing often characters in his films just dont feel real or personally relatable,2023-07-24 22:04:42
"the movie already is way too much talking constant talking of expositions of information upon information often with no context given

what the movie needs is more showing show me the actual result of the nuclear bombs dropped in japan show me how this directly affected oppenheimer show me why oppenheimer is so driven show me why the loss of his security clearance was such a blow to him etc 90 of the movie is literally the audience being told through conversations what went on and whats going on

nolan seems to have forgotten the fundamental rule of show dont tell of filmmaking",2023-07-24 09:44:43
yeah that moment took me a second tellers subtle indication that he wasnt quitting then loudly asking to leave the conversation didnt immediately track with me,2023-08-14 16:06:32
i think that part is kind of lost by not ever stating what the atomic energy commission was and how it influenced policy i agree that the significance of the third act is about the country turning on a patriot because of communist ideals but i dont think it was properly executed and the tension was broken because of the editing between the strauss scenes and the oppenheimer trial i kind of found the whole film a bit confused in its pacing and i think it undercuts the theme of the film honestly hard to articulate on a first viewing but i just left feeling a bit meh to the whole thing,2023-07-21 04:52:08
totally agree,2023-07-21 06:26:58
you never sat there and realized that a room full of suits or in the case of truman one suit we’re in charge of dropping two cataclysmic man made bombs and killing thousands of people half a world away only for them to look at the guy in charge of creating said weapon and think “yea let’s blackball him because we don’t need him anymore” wasn’t a little  up,2023-07-24 06:45:13
the fact that u think the movie was abt making the atom bomb is the issue the movie is abt oppenheimer making the bomb is his defining moment but thats not the focal point of the movie he us,2023-07-24 14:30:17
"i hear you i really wanted to see both a visual and audio culmination of that scene to capture the magnitude of the nature of the bomb though got a hint of that in the trailer and i think it built that expectation with me    


the sound was incredible  almost lost my hearing in the imax one lol but really wanted to contextualize the upclose look an atom bomb",2023-07-24 06:41:31
never argue with hardcore nolan guys its pointless,2023-07-22 08:55:38
"thats why i said his storyboarding he doesnt have a formal or traditional list but he still visualizes and has a plan in his mind for the final cut resulting in his storyboarding  


wanting to see more nuclear action is fair ig but i dont think that detracts from the experience the differing perspectives and timelines result in the overall film to be more psychological imo",2023-07-22 11:26:21
that’s wild to me,2023-07-23 16:17:59
you are right i misinterpreted the motif ,2023-08-16 19:49:20

it’s called “oppenheimer” not “trinity” and the trailers clearly show rdj saying “truman wants to know what’s next” the last trailer opened with them meeting about the soviets nuclear test and also branagh chastising oppenheimer saying “you gave the world the power to destroy itself”,2023-07-22 07:30:55

on top of the problems simply watching the movie it also makes me wonder how much money was wasted getting these shots only to last like 2 or 3 seconds lol like the costuming set design lighting animal handling all that stuff which costs money and time just for a shot that ends up feeling completely disconnected from anything else anyway,2023-07-21 19:18:14

yeah but what i’m saying is that i went into the film eager to dive into the psychology behind oppenheimer’s conflicting choices throughout his life instead we just got a bunch of aha moments that pieced together the strauss plan all along idk didn’t really feel like i cared for strauss,2023-07-28 06:39:24
strauss didn’t know oppenheimer at the time of the interrogation with the “military guy” how do you figure he was behind it,2023-07-28 03:06:37
"correct

thats why one of the last few shots are oppenheimer in a cockpit seeing a rocket fly overhead and a line of icbms",2023-07-31 13:37:01

"it was very clear they were seeing each other consistently she kept booty calling him and despite not wanting to make it happen her kept turning up ill also reply

then he knocked up kitty accidentally so had to get married with her thus the heart to heart sat at the bed doors openingclosing he shows his philosophical outlook and within that is an attitude of wanting his cake and eating it the selfishness

she calls him again in an hour of need he goes to her gets in trouble

he ignores her she kills herself hes distraught because he didnt help he is accused of acting like a martyr by kitty because he left that door open he brought it upon himself

theres a tidy parallel there with the a  h bomb story

her story was complete we didnt need anymore that we got out of their relationship",2023-07-26 23:27:48

"the problem i had with this movie was that nolan would introduce creative ideas and then wouldn’t follow through with them 

the scene with him and his communist mistress on the chair at the inquiry brilliant he should have done more of that “did you have communist contacts” that would have been the ideal time to have the images of all the communist friends he turned from in his past in the room behind him 

but no instead we get blurred shaky cam and a close up of oppenheimer’s face

and this lack of consistency is all over this film it was a decent enough biopic i just wish people would think about it a little more critically before pulling this “ give nolan the oscar now” talk",2023-07-22 01:29:35
the movie was very fast paced switching perspectives rapidly and building suspense it was about an event that we have now agreed defined a new moment in the earths history in a relatable way about the human impacts of that moment personal preferences based on personal lack of interest is one thing but this film is far from boring in any objective sense,2023-07-22 14:50:56
their intention was to use the affair to make oppenheimer’s dilemma dealing with the consequences of his actions more accessible… it wasn’t well done but that’s how it was repeatedly presented,2023-07-23 01:02:19
if i want to see nudity i’ll watch   i came for a story the scene didn’t make any sense grow up,2023-07-23 18:35:11

i full agree with you they couldve cut every single black and white scene and it wouldve taken nothing away for the movie,2023-07-25 03:49:20
ur opinion about the jumps it created tension and suspense and was one of if not the best part of the entire movie,2023-07-25 18:00:45
"not every scene in the movie is what oppenheimer saw or experienced 

also it could be a deliberate choice to show it even though oppenheimer did not witness it that wouldve had carried so much weight and be very meaningful",2023-07-30 06:52:14
"who gives a  about oppenheimer we all assumed this would be a movie about the development of the bomb at los alimos and oak ridge and the bombing in japan  oppenheimer and  biopics 

the history channel had a 1 hour documentary they made in the 90s about this that has so much more content this this  

they could have included more about the development of the physics the letter to fdr oak ridge the fact that we used 10 of the power in america at oak ridge to make the material the technical issues of making the fuel the scientists that died in accidents the enola  pilots and their prep the bombs being transported on the indianapolis the actual bombings and the surrender of the japanese truman being briefed on the project post fdr death i could go on an on this movie should have written itself instead we got some film about a whiney  and some bad  scenes and a bunch of boring meetings about communists like who gives a  movie was about as exciting as my monday morning meetings",2023-07-30 09:20:30
i don’t think you could capture the nuances of all the decisions and emotions of the people in oppenheimer’s life after the bombing in 10 minutes those instances shown where the most importantconsequential people in oppenheimer’s life had to decide or had already decided whether to defend or attack his character were enthralling,2023-07-22 02:31:17
strauss is literally the reason for oppenheimer’s downfall in the film…and we see strauss’ downfall played out very well,2023-07-22 02:41:23
i thought it was a great commentary on the evils of the mccarthy era in american politics also this is a biopic of oppenheimer and the removal of his security clearance was a pivotal moment in his life  we were also able to see his change of views on nuclear weaponry and their use against people in conflicts the whole third act is oppenheimer dealing with the consequences of his creation,2023-07-22 02:15:02
the political stuff at the end is kind of the entire point of the movie though,2023-07-22 02:54:53
honestly it’s dumb you don’t care like it’s actually real history with real politics that might have determined whether or not you are even alive today because of nuclear deterrence,2023-07-22 02:45:58
yeah while i kind of wanted to see the bombing it kind of put you into oppenheimers perspective as a viewer to feel like you have lost control completely of where and how this power will be used,2023-07-23 13:21:56
thats literally how it happened in real life the timing and success of the bombing were treated as classified info so groves who was in washington refused to inform oppenheimer about the attack oppenheimer learned via the radio,2023-07-23 15:54:19
well said the movie felt so overwhelming after the bomb sequence too many dialogues and a trial that didn’t create any interest in me,2023-07-23 08:12:25
"nolan’s timelines are often not linear it’s not for everyone as some people can have trouble following it but it’s not entirely unexpected from him

how thrilling do you think building the atomic bomb can be the trinity test scene as the climax of all the theory now i thought that was thrilling other than the test scene it’s all physics math science theory what more can they add to make it “thrilling” things that didn’t happen again i think people were expecting the avengers because they heard a bomb might be involved when it was a period piece biopic about a politically divisive scientist no less i don’t blame the movie or the trailers agree to disagree",2023-07-23 08:21:50
since you asked before your edit i honestly have no idea where the movie began it was so disjointed my guess is it began with a black and white scene of rdj in a courtroom after the windows 95 screensaver graphics of stars and atoms why did they start with what appeared to be a bunch of men in their 30s in college who were into science no idea bad directing maybe,2023-07-23 16:55:33
there are certainly valid criticisms to be made but i dont think not enough explosions is one of them its trying to tell the real life story of a historical figure not be transformers 15 cybernetic space wars,2023-07-23 17:26:42
"my post was making fun of the 1010 reviews hence the italics  

my fave nolan movie is the prestige but yeah hes as subtle as a brick and has still to put out a movie that i consider to be masterpiece  too clunky a filmmaker",2023-07-25 09:56:17

"i will have zero tgm slander in this house smh  


personally loved tgm over eeaao because of how good the action was sure the storys faaaar more simpler than eeaao and oppenheimer but i feel like the jet fights delivered far more than the abomb drop marketing was drumming up hype for months now",2023-07-25 08:58:43
"pulls away quickly

dont touch me swine",2023-07-25 03:29:03
yeah but this movie doesnt really have that problem across the board tenet was a nightmare true but i saw this and legit didnt feel any audio issues whatsoever so it may just have been your theater i will say music underscored a lot of the movie so maybe the mixing made it even more prominent,2023-07-27 15:42:09
yes it is but its like in writing theres a reason behind it hes not ,2023-07-27 14:51:02
"then its not for you hes described movies as an experience and sometimes its uncomfortable i get it he wants to throw you in there and feel it

 about it isnt going to change a  thing he does",2023-07-28 07:29:37
for me the nudity is what helps establish their characters and their relationship their attraction is passionate and sensual and i think you would lose that had the characters been clothed,2023-07-31 22:11:34
"she picks up the book because she is fascinated by the idea that oppenheimer can read sanskrit and idolizes him  she does open it to a random page but the movie takes convenient artistic license in having it be the very page with the famous quote it’s an important scene that shapes oppenheimer’s view of himself through the perceived influence he felt he had on those around him oppenheimer secretly desires to be viewed as a great historic martyr the man who can destroy the world but is sad about the weight placed on him and he relishes the notion of pugh’s character perceiving him in this grand and tragic light

and of course the scene has some on the nose foreshadowing of oppenheimer eventually destroying pugh’s character’s world",2023-08-03 12:30:31
"the movie speaks on him being a womanizer arrogant among his many other flaws i don’t know how you got the idea that this only portrays him in a positive light 

also the movie wasn’t about the atomic bomb it was about “the father of the atomic bomb” oppenheimer who wasn’t in hiroshima or nagasaki when the bomb dropped",2023-07-24 01:23:42
"spot on it didnt sit well with me at all as an american that christopher nolan barely attempted to depict the catastrophe we brought on 250k japanese civilians

i stress the word civilians because those were innocent people through and through do i think its american propaganda well i havent read the book its based off so i cant say for certain but not including the horrors of who the atomic bomb actually affected regardless of the source material is not only dishonest but also disingenuous

we always criticize other countries when they dont own up to their horrors like china with the tiananmen square incident and germany with the holocaust yet here we are letting our directors save face with the bombs we dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki by barely acknowledging the incident in a film thats going to be seen by hundreds of millions of people how are we any different in that regard

and dont give me that it was an artistic choice or its not nolans job to lecture us ",2023-07-24 01:17:07
"  

busting out the i am become death line in the  scene is goofy but the rest of the movie is solid and the adaptation and depth of information is artfully done

"superficial political stunt is from straussrdjs perspective  ability to affect policy is from oppenheimers perspective    


as a society we absolutely need to be thinking about how politics affect science  the opioid crisis hurt all states but it severely impacted red states  why  and how did that cause red states to lose trust in doctors and science leading up to the covid response  im a democrat but its wrong to stereotype republicans as ignorant and backwards after the predatory actions of bigpharma",2023-08-03 11:19:50
i never felt poor oppenheimer thing even i was questioning his stand on morale  he was okay with abomb but then opposed hbomb,2023-08-03 13:51:11
"the movie doesn’t celebrate what oppenheimer or his scientists achieved though nor does it attempt to paint them in a sympathetic light it shows oppenheimer as a conflicted confused contradictory shiftless person who isn’t able to keep his moral compass aligned with his desire to have a place in history but neither does it downplay the magnitude or importance of what he and his team achieved if you came away thinking the film wants us to think “poor oppenheimer” then i think you deeply misunderstand the film

i think the third act was the movie’s most important it shows how complex an individual oppenheimer was through the eyes of those who knew him best whether friend or adversary and it shows that oppenheimer himself struggled to define and defend his own worldviews",2023-08-03 12:23:13
i think what you wanted was a movie about the history of the bomb ie ending at the bombings in japan and what you got was a nuanced character study about a complex and contradictory and political man all of the plot’s various thematic elements are resolved in the third act it’s vital to the movie’s themes and message you can argue that it could have been edited down to be shorter but it’s really the meat of the whole movie you need all of it to complete the movie’s portrait of oppenheimer,2023-08-03 12:43:41
i compared it to endgame instead being a threehour thanos trial,2023-08-04 12:38:25
its fine to have those long conversations over whether he was connected to communism but perhaps they could have been a half hour as opposed to 2 hours because it was mindnumbingly boring after a while quite frankly,2023-07-22 20:39:32
of course that doesnt mean you need to stretch that part of his life to a 2 hour slog,2023-07-22 21:47:28
gotcha makes sense,2023-07-22 16:52:31
i disagree its a story told from different view points over a number of years i thought it worked very well and was clear from the start that its what they were doing i dont understand why people cant follow the dialogue,2023-07-22 18:50:00
i certainly felt deceived trailer wasnt accurate to what the film was and the claim about it needing to be watching in the imax absolutely wasnt true,2023-07-22 20:37:45
my man is making it his personal mission to defend this movie at every turn ,2023-07-22 20:39:02
and i mean im all for having that in there as this is about oppenheimers life butnot for that long it could have been edited for 10 minutes then it wouldnt fall so flat when all that tense build up ended up in his security clearance being taken away,2023-07-22 19:32:19
people nolan fanatics are arguing its about him the movie is called oppenheimer after all it should be about his character okay well stick to one plot and make it interesting at least i go to the cinema to be entertained not to fall asleep,2023-07-22 19:33:05
"  imitation game 

the intrigue of the mcarthy era politics anticommunism is already interesting however strausss attempt to take down oppenhiermer and his legacy is important to the story",2023-07-22 20:18:47
good criticism is fine this…doesn’t fall into that category especially when people can’t comprehend the title of the movie so triggering,2023-07-22 21:55:06
nope glad i saw in regular theatre most people left early too long get a good editor nolan oppenheimer was better than tenet but not his best film barbie wins,2023-07-23 06:54:20
did you think any of the parts of the film were worth the imax,2023-07-23 06:55:20
nah just pointing out that the recency bias and the amount of people who ran to the theater opening week read fans and people easily influenced by ads without thinking critically about their choice and end up blaming the movie for a personal problem,2023-07-23 21:24:44
so for a imax experience to be great it needed nukes going off every thirty minutes not everything has to be marvel dude the multiple explosions and panic attack scenes were actually incredible on the big screen its wild to downplay how amazing they looked just because it didnt going 100 mph all the time,2023-07-23 06:51:40
i mean…would people talking outside have been better whether or not you actually mean for it to come off this way or not it comes off as “too much talking i need an hour of straight explosions”,2023-07-23 13:53:03
that’s a great point and one that i hadn’t thought of,2023-07-21 05:14:47
exactly nolan could have easily gotten a pg13 rating for this film its like he said just throw in extra fbombs and make sure her  are onscreen and in focus multiple times in my super serious adult biopic no i wont get rid of the scenes shes riding him and having him say his famous quote while getting hard its super needed for me to get best picture what a creepy hack,2023-07-22 10:14:30
"no there are not 2 different timelines but i 100 knew nolan was going to do some time jumping bc he always does the book is chronological but almost identical truly one of the most direct book movie adaptions i’ve ever seen

i highly recommend it the “chevalier affair” and the after effects are extremely interesting",2023-07-23 02:49:32
the government blacklisted oppenheimers brother and he spent years not being able to find work in physics  if the government had wanted to blacklist oppenheimer he wouldnt have been able to find out either unless maybe he defected to the soviet union,2023-07-21 16:54:56
i get that it discredits him in the eyes of certain people but he is the father of the atomic bomb that’s what they will remember not his security clearance imo as a movie it would have been more interesting to see more scenes about his struggles with what he did rather than 40 minutes of a court case at the end of movie the story arc just didn’t hit for me,2023-07-21 15:54:09
well nolan tried something very different this time so yeah it was kinda obvious that it might not turn out to be very good,2023-07-22 11:22:35
chernobyl is still the gold standard at showing the horrors of radiation and nuclear power,2023-07-23 03:20:11
the fact is that is the selling point of the whole movie the trinity blast it was underwhelming as you said i totally agree,2023-07-22 09:47:19
well we still got something similar to the trinity test in the opening of the moviei mean why would they show something at the beginning which was indirectly and literally the selling point of the entire movie,2023-07-22 11:26:38
the whole point of the movie is that he wanted to feel important but was stymied by his impetuous poor decisions and the security clearance plot line is critical to show that,2023-07-28 00:13:22
ok youre dumb,2023-07-28 20:53:21
thats dumb,2023-07-27 23:39:50
"compare this video to the explosion from the movie scenes are repeated here almost frame by frame and there is a mushroom in the film but when it gets dark as in the video  
",2023-07-26 04:02:06
i think it is a cliche to you only i felt that including that line after the explosion was near perfect it brought in a sense of dread and horror that now the world has changed forever,2023-07-21 20:57:07
"isnt it a bit vain to think that people who disagree with you only do it out of a desperate need for attention from you 

i wasnt even talking to you and you and thats how you started our conversation lol",2023-07-23 19:59:19
oh is that what that is im not a contrarian for everything lol i love pop music for one i just dont think nolan has the sauce anymore ,2023-07-23 19:56:03

i completely understand it is failure on nolans part that he could neither completely delve into the intricacies of oppenheimers psyche nor completely get into the manhattan project even with 3 hours its like he did half of this and half of that the end product is incomplete and leaving you wanting more,2023-07-22 00:11:31
"i have a  degree in electrical engineering had chapters on chernobyl power plant as well as a short intro into nuclear physics  albeit in context of power generation  went through the los alamos primer atleast tried  and as i said to each their own 

your expectations were different mine were different i got what i want out of it  atleast for me  it captured what was required from the film 

i also thought that it was bloated slow and was not at all the movie that was advertised half of it took place in the 50s and was centered around a security clearance meeting that i just couldn’t care about

yes a security clearance meeting that changed the very track of humanity

i dont care what anyone says  what i find good i find good  deal with it if you think i am pretentious i am happy that you atleast said it to my face",2023-07-25 12:16:25
"i also thought that it was bloated slow and was not at all the movie that was advertised half of it took place in the 50s and was centered around a security clearance meeting that i just couldn’t care about

"he never saw that directly in the film except through the images he avoided looking at this showed his perspective which was removed from the reality of the damage

i think the movie was about retelling his story to a new generation so they can decide for themselves whether his actions and reasons were justified or not without the cloud of mccarthyism obscuring things",2023-08-22 00:50:41
a scene like that of oppy stepping into the charred remains of someones ribcage x1000 would actually make you feel something about him or the american govmilitary instead we got other people reactions to it,2023-08-21 08:45:19
"if you dont know about the victims of the atomic bombs then thats on you this isnt a movie about them this also isnt a comic book movie there doesnt have to be heroes and villains and the fact you think there does says quite a bit about your maturity

in my experience obnoxious people just exist and you deal with them in general and sometimes it’s busy so a lot come at once",2023-07-21 10:58:33

well you shouldnt make a multimillion dollar blockbuster for average moviegoers if you expect them to read a 700 page political drama biography before,2023-07-21 11:44:20
you dont even need to read the book as someone who didnt and also isnt an american nor knew much about the title character and details about all the politics and the project that was going on it was quite understandable to me i will definitely watch it again maybe a few details escaped me but i have no confusion about the whole story,2023-07-21 11:50:31
strauss wanted to destroy oppenheimer because he humiliated him in that hearing which is a total non story and nothing that serious and because he opposed the development of hbomb he used oppenheimers left leaning or communist associations and history to sow doubt into his allegiance to the country  him of his clearance and destroy his credibility and reputation its all about the ego thats what that closed hearing was all about it was setup specifically to do what strauss wanted a farce its really not that complicated i didnt know much about anything except how nuclear weapons worked and i understood the bulk of the story without problems maybe a few details here and there i would like to catch when i watch it again,2023-07-21 11:56:49

what does this even mean lol

sen john f kennedy did vote to oppose the nomination of strauss as us secretary of commerce in 1959 which was only the 18th time in the history of the us that a cabinet nominee failed it was an extraordinary defeat and was directly related to his treatment of oppenheimer i understood the mention of kennedys vote as way of anchoring the era a country on the cusp of dramatic change kennedy became president only 2 years later,2023-08-02 23:49:32

i mean it’s called “oppenheimer” not “the atomic bomb” of course it’s going to focus on the man as opposed to dissecting the act of dropping the bomb,2023-08-27 20:55:11
thanks for answering regardless,2023-08-27 15:44:53
"it still needs to work in a movie i got the feeling nolan was torn between creating a drama and a documentary the volume of content he was trying to capture college traveling manhattan project postwwii world trial political life love life etc was just too much for a drama but he also added too much to each scene for it to be a documentary similar to tenet it became a movie of pieces each piece was given a soaring orchestra moment or a quippy line of dialogue or a surprising reveal i acutally hated oppenheimer and when every moment is big in itself the whole thing becomes stale 

nolan did well during the bomb test the music swelled there was a big build up this moment was treated with respect everyone in the theater paid attention well done to that scene the rest of the movie especially the end not so much",2023-07-22 18:43:39
"  i feel like it was a very american movie

well no  you went to see a film about an american in america",2023-07-22 09:10:48
i thought the same the most interesting thing about this whole story is how oppenheimer is thinking and feeling in this situation and that fell too short in my opinion cillian murphy was great but the script didn’t do the story justice,2023-07-22 10:29:29
i think we can agree that a movie can be judged on its merits alone and doesnt require prerequisite knowledge,2023-07-22 18:44:38
the uss indianapolis left san francisco with the uranium and other parts for little boy the same day as the test there was 21 days 3 weeks between the trinity test and the hiroshima bombing,2023-07-24 08:42:28
yes there is a very loud jarring jump scare type noise,2023-07-21 07:32:03
don’t you know women are only characters when they’re  or drunkenly crying,2023-07-23 23:36:58
yeah the bomb scene doesn’t work we have actual footage of the trinity the test and even that low quality black and white footage is better than what’s done in this film,2023-08-11 03:21:12
 einstein historically generally just looked like a homeless person,2023-07-23 07:32:33
because its nolan and hes one of those directors that draws actors in so they all ask for a part stacked casts are going to be his thing for awhile,2023-07-23 06:57:05
lol i am not even american just go and ask a korean for example how they think about what japanese did during ww2,2023-07-26 22:11:31
while i do understand what you’re saying and agree with it largely i think you’re unfairly dismissing this movie there are definitely people who watch this movie who are caught up in the hype and don’t actually like it as much as they claim to but i think the movie is genuinely very well made and not comparable at all to joker,2023-08-25 15:29:12
fair enough i agree with you that i hope it leads to more serious movies getting made with blockbuster budgetsmarketing,2023-08-23 11:15:28
i didnt think it was unnecessary,2023-09-25 22:44:57
i think the first half was 1010 but the last part was maybe 810 the film reminded me of a beautiful mind in some ways,2023-07-21 21:21:38
i think he said  it blaze 420,2023-07-21 20:09:28
i dont know what you mean by the voice of the movie condemned him for it he was a reallife victim of mccarthyism and it effectively destroyed his career and reputation the movie was just trying to convey that historical reality and if anything highlight the absurdity of the witchhunt against him,2023-07-23 17:42:39
youre welcome,2023-07-23 06:39:35
they had lots of scenes addressing that they knew what they were doing maybe you should watch it again carefully,2023-07-21 14:14:00
sure you do i just dont know why youre faulting the movie for not portraying things as you see fit,2023-07-21 13:47:25
hey fair enough completely agree about oppenheimer too the structure of the movie just didn’t work for me but i appreciate a lot of things about it ultimately left feeling pretty bored overall though,2023-07-21 20:42:07
"that conflict was instrumental in oppenheimer’s downfall

strauss is a major character in the story of both oppenheimer and the atomic energy commission

i understand where you are coming from this movie makes a lot of assumptions about the audience’s knowledge of events if you aren’t very familiar with it the movie was fast paced and jumped around a lot",2023-07-24 01:24:30
"i wasnt trying to be passive aggressive ill add that i didnt downvote you but will upvote you the conflict did seem to be a crucial to the story

i dont think nudity was strictly necessary but theres nothing more silly to me than watching  scenes where women are wearing bras if the actress isnt willing to do a  scene then film it creatively so the passion is conveyed and no nudity is shown that would have been fine also i dont think the nudity was pointless in this film they both were topless",2023-07-24 00:01:29
actually sorting by new to me is where i am seeing all the comments that actually critique something of this movie instead of being literal perfection i wished it was 3months instead and with more random cuts also less cgi wait for actors to age 20 years to shoot it more accurately,2023-07-25 08:36:22
what part about it being a biography means it cant portray the appearance and scale of nuclear bombs accurately especially when the consequences of that power existing in human hands is the entire theme,2023-07-25 07:31:56
"people are allowed to have opinions you know you dont have to belittle them and other movies just because you disagree with them

and to be honest i feel like a lot of people felt decieved by the marketing that this would be a little different than what it actually ended up being",2023-07-25 07:13:06
"yes agree with a lot of what you’re saying 

what annoyed me most about the nonlinear story telling is they often didn’t reveal character motivations until the end so it hard to get invested when it’s not clear why things are happening yes that worked amazingly in memento but the whole movie is about memory loss so that was a fantastic device in that context when they’d repeat scenes like einstein at the lake or oppenheimer talking about isotopes at a hearing i think you’re supposed to have a big aha moment in a cool way like in the prestige when the entire movie changes once you know the twist but in oppenheimer it falls flat for me the prestige is already great even without that twist and then finding it out takes the movie to a whole other level in oppenheimer not knowing certain character motivations until the last 30 minutes or so makes it all very confusing

the  scene with the famous quote was so cringe worthy i couldn’t believe it was happening it’s one of my favourite quotes of all time in the context of oppenheimer saying it and there are so many cooler ways it could have been used 

tenet has got better with me on multiple viewings as once you understand what’s happening there is some great action it’s let down though by some weird lines for the main female character another nolan weakness and john david washingtons character is never that compelling robert pattinson is excellent it felt like there was a top tier 5 star movie there if it had been edited better with a tighter script 

what will be interesting for me with oppenheimer on rewatch is if i can watch the whole thing or if as i suspect i’ll skip some parts",2023-08-04 15:36:58
"interesting my top three are

inception
the prestige
memento",2023-08-04 16:57:52
i have one college degree and understood the strauss conflict perfectly  the movie was about his whole career not just the manhattan project,2023-07-21 21:23:06
you have multiple college degrees you should know better than to say your opinion is objective come on now,2023-07-21 20:41:53
"my girlfriend and i who both hold multiple college degrees and paid close attention we couldn’t really tell what the conflict was the last hour of the movie like who cares oppenheimer had his security clearance revoked he already made the bomb and why is strauss so mad egos hbomb development

proof that having a degree doesnt actually make you smart",2023-07-21 21:23:30
"sry ur 2 smooth brain to understand the sophistication that is nolan the most brilliant filmmaker of all time hnnnnggggg s

for real me too no cgi isnt as big of a flex as people think it is its a film making tool it can be used to great effect twin peaks the return blew me away with its nuke and i watched that on a  tv",2023-07-25 12:38:06
"yea i watched it in imax and the editing personally didnt work for me sure you can have people going oh well you know we didnt want the explosion to overshadow the man himself but like idk maybe you didnt need a loud bang but i would have loved something also creeping along like the sound of flames burning have a couple of seconds of silence before the shockwave because the sound design was master class up to that point the parts whenever something was being visualized the thuds of pieces of a machine shooting out all great the bomb itself while i can see working for many others felt kinda underwhelming even after the shockwave when the rest of the movies sound design and editing prior was already a 1010

edit typos",2023-07-25 08:14:10
"it was like pfiu breathe breath boom

x200b

i wanted kaboooom",2023-07-25 08:05:56
ah i see  that makes sense ,2023-07-25 16:20:05
"both of the real life pugh scenes basically accomplish nothing by having explicit nudity and could easily have been shot without it and accomplished the same thing narratively

disagree i liked that they sat there  and having a chat there was something normal about it they had a connection that was more than just physical like literally we see him more vulnerable and open in comparison to his friend telling him to quit wearing the ridiculous military uniform",2023-07-25 23:51:01
since when do conservatives love their unions,2023-07-26 02:56:36
chernobyl was 10 times better than oppenheimer waste of 3 hours,2023-07-28 04:18:45
"he still made the explotion feel like a real explotion i think the shockwave was real aswell but we will never know im not sayig youre wrong but i respect his choice

and the reason it probably happened this way is cos nolan is someone who wants controle over whats going on on the camera he probably didient want the pivot point of his film to be determined by cgi",2023-07-28 08:29:22
"i think david lynch pretty much nailed the trinity test in twin peaks the full clip with the right soundtrack gets wiped from the internet for some reason probably copyright issues here is the full clip with the wrong albeit interesting and fitting music 



mute it and put on threnody to the victims of hiroshima by krzysztof penderecki to get the experience as intended",2023-07-28 01:09:09
im still confused what crime was he responsible for,2023-08-02 15:27:33
it won a pulitzer and the movie maybe scratched 20 of oppenheimers story,2023-07-28 23:57:17
"nolan should never have tried to tell the entire story of oppie’s life in just one movie 
what they did leave in on jean tatlock does her a disservice",2023-08-01 03:24:51
yes and no there certainly was a massive build up of nuclear weapons but eventually over the public opposition of people like teller the us did ratify arms control and test ban treaties and also supported the establishment of the iaea to monitor nuclear proliferation,2023-07-21 21:31:31
the idea that setting off the bomb maybe saved lives is obviously explored in the film explicitly in the dialogue,2023-07-22 14:51:41
i highly doubt we never use another one,2023-07-22 14:46:58
i think nolan probably based the topics from the book american prometheus even the script is written in first person showing oppenheimers point of view,2023-07-31 13:38:13
apparently im only getting downvotes d my point is the white ones all look alike and the obligatory rare black ones are historically inaccurate this kept me out of the movieflow,2023-07-24 06:50:51
i dont take issue with the lack of black characters but with the ones that are there although its not historically accurate about the white ones there are too many of them i cant tell them apart but theyre all sort of famous and theyre recruited by nolan because he can that indicates a perverted hollywood mechanism and that bothers me,2023-07-24 06:58:14
kinda typical nolan really i remember thinking interstellar was all about space but the first hour was about farming,2023-07-21 18:54:44
did you not see his visions of people with skin being ripped off from their faces just like the citizens of hiroshima  nagasaki did he visualized it many times everyone knows the bombs exploded on those cities  why do we need to see it on film again,2023-07-22 11:25:09
very incorrect the film was called oppenheimer not the abomb the film was designed to be about oppenheimer the bomb was part of his life much like jean kitty etc there are plenty of films about the bombing itself if thats what your interest is this was never supposed to be one of those so instead of the film missing the mark imo you watched the wrong movie,2023-07-22 11:23:49
no it was about the man not the bombing,2023-07-22 10:51:23
this made me laugh out loud i hope your pillow is nice and cool tonight,2023-07-23 17:30:20
thats totally a fair approach to absorbing film but thats not the only way a filmmaker may prefer an audience take your approach but for a film being marketed as a summer blockbuster there should be a greater awareness of the sensibilities of a wider audience the buzzhype surrounding this movie assures it a strong opening weekend barbenheimer will definitely help lol but i dont see this film having the staying power of other nolan pictures because it will alienate many filmgoers,2023-07-24 02:50:33
nah the v1 was the first real cruise missile there were absolutely instances of pilots tipping them w their plane to knock them off course,2023-08-07 07:31:50
i would say that is a misreading of the scene i think that was just supposed to be another namedrop moment to contextualize the history of it all,2023-07-22 04:20:45
we’re you asleep the whole time,2023-07-30 21:51:19
what,2023-07-30 18:01:40
lol the person i responded to wanted less of oppenheimer and more of the japanese perspective and now youre complaining there wasnt enough about the guy what do you all want what would you have liked to have learned more about him,2023-07-30 17:44:38
i meant that it takes me out of the movie if i can tell theyre trying to avoid nudity in a situation where nudity is natural,2023-07-24 20:50:13
great enjoy,2023-07-21 21:56:54
my interpretation was that he wanted to be in a position to help guide and influence the future of bombs and its use in our society  losing his clearance kept him isolated from the scientific community which trickled into scientists in general being kept out of politics and key decisionmaking and more easily allowed for bigger and more destructive bombs to be created,2023-07-24 22:38:35
if you dont have a security clearance you cant work in the highest levels of government oppenheimer enjoyed that access and influence so much so that it was part of his postwar identity,2023-07-24 22:44:25
"my interpretation at least from the film is the hearing on his security clearance while seemingly fairly basic at first in effect becomes a criminal trial on oppenheimer and his links to communist associates stauss wants him labelled as a traitor in the press he was a celebrity figure after the war and the result of the hearing in effect completely tarnishes his reputation the hearing was national news after all and this is represented in the film by the second time magazine cover 

the film points out that links to communism results in you having difficulty gaining trust and finding work as displayed by his communist brother now labouring in railway construction

iirc there are actually very few scenes with oppenheimer after that timeline after the security clearance appeal is denied the timeline has a heavy focus on strauss at this point onwards with the exception of the final scene with oppo and einstein which is set some years earlier maybe that’s also representing a momentary fall from the limelight the next timeline we see from oppo he is in the far future accepting awards",2023-07-24 23:56:03
spanish civil war the communists were on the republican side so it makes some sense that being prorepublic might be seen as communist,2023-07-30 01:55:08
i had to do some reading on rdj’s character after the movie near the end i started to feel really lost with the cuts in the story but by the end it had all made sense there’s a lot of characters who all have significant roles in understanding how the end of the movie plays out but nolan did a good job of having it all make sense in the end,2023-07-21 14:45:43
its not an easy watch at all its hard to follow when it jumps around so much combined with the music being way louder than the dialogue at some points,2023-07-21 15:29:57
he was in i think 2 scenes prior to the senate hearing he was there to show how oppenheimer was rather dickish to him but still showed up and told the truth,2023-07-21 20:06:41
its very much about him being traumatized about what hes responsible for hes haunted by the deaths and even gets called a crybaby by the president,2023-07-21 10:38:23
i didnt think so the film lays out his story as more of a conflicted individual not a bona fide hero that said you are meant to empathize with him understand his reasons for doing what he did even if they were sometimes faulty  but i dont think youd leave the movie thinking hes the good guy,2023-07-21 10:30:44
ill be honest youre not gonna like it it is more nuanced than just a hero thing but it still has very obvious issues about how they depicted it,2023-07-21 10:32:11
"the movie tries to have its cake and eat it too 

it essentially portrays him as a great man whos conflicted but id say the nuance is pretty superficial and shallow it doesnt say anything new and the last hour focuses on oppenheimer as a victim which is just confusing",2023-08-05 22:04:41
"well lets see he was originally trying to stop the nazis from committing genocide on jews so right off the bat you can see why hed want to put a stop to that seeing as how oppenheimer was jewish


when that ended up being a moot point with hitlers suicide his efforts led to japans surrender and probably saved millions of lives not to mention that japan committed some of the worst atrocities in the war and killed far more innocent civilians than the atomic bombs oh plus they did  2400 americans without provocation to kick the whole thing off


all that being said i think they downplayed his heroism quite a bit",2023-07-22 22:45:47
they acknowledge the number of people killed but they dont show anything with respect to that other than seeing  man and little boy being carted away,2023-07-22 13:32:09
i love that idea,2023-07-29 18:57:23
i’m not here to sit in judgment but i honestly thought the pacing exceeded best in the last act pretty much every scene from the trinity test onwards had me on the edge of my seat everything leading there… not quite as much which isn’t to say it was bad just not as gripping,2023-07-21 13:36:51
feel free to sponsor nolan for that one then,2023-07-21 22:06:24
"totally justified imo 

i thought maybe they were building up to the
 massive destruction of japan but nope 

the speech after hiroshima shouldnt have been louder than the bomb",2023-07-26 23:02:20
no ive seen all nolan movies and understood it quiet well but maybe i was expecting too much with this maybe i wasnt prepared,2023-07-21 18:46:09
"people were gushing over the dark knight rises the day it came out too


give it some time and theyll calm down oppenheimer is not his best work its not even top 5 for me",2023-07-22 22:20:20
he was asking about sudden loud noises there was obviously the expected loud noise of a bomb going off but there was also a lot of sudden very loud noises even louder than the bomb,2023-07-21 15:41:01
i brought foam ear plugs which i tried to take in and out depending on the scene  honestly i still had trouble with the loud moments maybe because the sound design also vibrates intensely  i may be an extreme case though  the ear plugs definitely help and i would bring them if this is an issue for you,2023-07-21 15:39:57
"ah yes strauss the man who was barely set up in the first half of the film outside of his senate confirmation hearing which made it all the more hilarious when they had that scooby doo moment outing him as a villain 

this movie was such a mess

edited to add i didn’t catch that the black and white was from strauss’s point of view because his flashbacks were in color either way lazy film making",2023-07-22 01:11:13
yeah i don’t buy that at all,2023-07-22 01:23:18
"i know this is supposed to be more of a movie about oppenheimer and not just about an explosion as some people have said in this thread but the trinity  one of the biggest aspects of oppenheimers life  yet the movie made the actual bomb test sequence kind of feel like an after thought  

the movie was paced  edited in kind of a jumbled way so what could have been a better anxious  emotional build up was lost  by the time you get to the actual test you feel like youve just been spun around a couple times and are kind of disoriented because everything is moving at a breakneck pace  i genuinely feel like they tried to fit way too much into a 3 hour movie  they could have just focused on los alamos with some flashbacks prior to give a greater sense of build up to the trinity explosion  

also from a purely spectacle standpoint  you could tell practical effects were used to emulate the test bomb  it was underwhelming  i prefer practical effects for the most part but in this case it felt like i was watching some rednecks throw a flare onto a bonfire that was doused with gasoline as compared to the first test of the most destructive weapon man has ever created  it really took the wind out of the sails in terms of making it impactful  and i dont even care if that was a more realistic depiction  im at the movies to be  entertained  go nuts or at least more nuts than that  

that said i did like the delayed audio arrangement",2023-07-22 16:45:32
because unfortunately nolan used barrels of gasoline and some det cord filmed at clever angles to create a simulacrum of the trinity test its not the worst ive ever seen but it definitely would have been better served by blending cgi and practical effects,2023-07-22 16:51:39
everyones experience was different from mine so they their opinion is invalid,2023-07-22 20:55:12
you keep saying this and it doesn’t make you any smarter or make any more sense everytime you say it,2023-07-23 00:08:27
the movie is titled after what its about  oppenheimer  its literally a biopic why would they include irrelevant scenes,2023-07-22 22:57:45
glorification in what media lol  please cite examples,2023-07-23 23:33:28
if they want to show oppenheimer guilt and the magnitude of the weapons they created why not show the bombings themselves  destroyed buildings burning peoples this would of show the gravity of weapons of mass destruction and been impactful on the viewer  not seeing the bombings leaves you feeling abit underwhelmed,2023-07-22 19:24:26
"it was completely presented as a plot twist first hes this friendly figure no one is doubting him of anything and then hes big baddie from the shadows even his aide was surprised 

that was just some  convoluted stuff that isnt needed in a historical biopic especially when it makes the movie needlessly confusing",2023-07-23 17:53:19
" it wasnt unexpected i pretty  versed on oppenheim and the state of the super 

vast majority of viewers arent",2023-07-23 12:37:07
yeah no i get that but it was the same reaction as damons actual moments of brief comedic relief it felt off was all i didnt expect to hear so much giggling while being so upset myself it was like whiplash lol,2023-07-23 07:38:38
nah it was a niche movie that basically got memed into pulling in 20 to 30 million dollars over expectations theres going to be a lot of uncritical consumers out there that basically got led by the nose and reviews into seeing a movie they wont like no matter what changes were made,2023-07-23 13:42:48
maybe these people are our fine gen z and they were let down by our education system and dont know what nuclear weapons can do to our world and this is all a big surprise to them   im with everyone else here  shock ending  huh,2023-07-22 15:43:02
i can kind of understand that but with the threat of the nazis extinguished oppenheimer still supports the continuation of the bombs development so for him the development of the bomb wasnt entirely about the whirlwind of the  threat,2023-07-22 14:52:29
whats latest negative reviews mean the upvote comment was a joke since people are calling it both terrible and a masterpiece,2023-07-24 02:36:49
im beginning to wonder if hes using bots and hype to tout this as a masterpiece to make some sort of inception 2 documentary where he shows how he can plant seeds in peoples mind for such a terrible movie and make certain people love it at this point i almost want to set up an exit interview at my local theater to see what real people rate it just to be sure haha,2023-07-24 02:54:14
"we got only two quick scenes postbomb of oppenheimer experiencing this surreal guilt i sort ofwanted more than that for as tortured as he see him we only have those two moments during the address in los alamos where he envisions the face melting and the charred body and then once in the boardroom where the nuclear light begins to bleed into the room where we feel that guilt instead of just seeing him feeling guilty we also keep cutting to strauss and his attempting to gain a cabinet position as if hes a main character despite his arc not having much affect on the rest of the story sure he set the dominoes in motion for oppenheimer to be trialed for being a communist but i dont really care about howwhy he was investigated the mere fact that he was investigated and we see how he feels about that is plenty enough its one thing to see someone be sad in a room its another to be placed in his pov and see what hes envisioning and thats so much more impactful

im reminded of the barbie movie where they outright tell you dont think about it too hard when they talk about how to get to barbieland because in the end the how doesnt really matter its the effects and events afterwards that matter similarly i dont care that rdjs character had oppenheimer investigated so it just bugged me that we spent so much time on a plotline that ultimately went nowhere especially for someone we see interact with oppenheimer all of twice even if thats the point that some random moment sealed his fate its still not entertaining or interesting",2023-07-24 21:10:47
"i expect it will be a little polarising but still positive

you must hate the other biopics or avoid them altogether i assume i usually avoid biopics because i think theyre poor in general i was just pleasantly surprised by this one 

 like the elton john one the queen one theres a lot",2023-07-21 15:43:09
no music brother we did not watch the same movie haha,2023-07-22 20:48:41
you put it better than i did it was a drag i was there for oppenheimers own guilt and i liked when the petition scientist stood up for him but rdj being a bad guy and all the scenes where hes talking about how hes going to take oppenheimer down just felt out of place,2023-07-29 20:29:10
i defo got it but with the focus of the first 2 thirds of the movie being about building the bomb and his guilt for it to then zoom in the focus onto strauss felt unwarranted it made me not care about strauss story,2023-07-29 15:52:07
yep starting out with that line is plain bad faith and is begging for attention,2023-07-21 20:19:15
it’s perfectly fine if a movies doesn’t click with your tastes but saying it’s “a disaster” is some strong words for many,2023-07-21 19:49:29
i agree completely,2023-08-22 23:01:11
"whats the difference between a guntype bomb and an implosiontype bomb 

what version was dropped on japan

why

again using only the movie as a source",2023-07-22 02:48:25
chris nolan should just stick to batman movies and let a real director like michael bay handle the great stories of american history like oppenheimer or transformers,2023-07-24 19:58:29
"but the “personal statements” you see actually happened a lot of the dialogue is from transcripts or quotes 

the only fiction i can recall is oppenheimer imagining the audience as victims of the bombings everything else is spot on

the point of the movie isn’t for him to be redeemed it’s to show how strauss went after him due to a personal vendetta 

the only “redemption” i can think of is oppenheimer realizing the atomic bomb was a tragedy and not wanting the hbomb to be made both of which are historically accurate",2023-07-21 16:24:07
"i really don’t believe you’re correct here  a in the hearings they straight up call him out on the fact that his “morality” came into play only after he’d created the bomb  which he clearly realizes is correct after the scene b kitty tells him he will not be absolved just because of his guilt c strauss goes on a full monologue about how oppenheimer would’ve done it all again if he could  due to his egotism the last act of the movie presents a very clear case that despite oppenheimers crisis of conscience and there’s nuance here but despite it all  he did this and he can’t put the genie back in the bottle just because he feels bad about it in retrospect it shows a man reconciling with who he truly is and what he’s done due to his hubris which is a development that may doom the entirety of humanity

no one i was with walked away from the movie thinking highly of oppenheimer",2023-07-21 18:17:06
"ya plus bethe had a huge role in making of the bombhe was literally head of theoretical division there and von neumann role was important too but ya i think as teller is the more famous scientist and was chosen again this was a movie about oppenheimer and not every scientist could have been shown

i just hope one day we have a true limited series on just about making of the bomb based on richard rhodes book start from the beginning",2023-07-22 01:03:18
i thought the first hour was fantastic the way they focus on building up oppenheimer as not just a contributor to the war but as a true genius and top student in his field i love the moments where he would have visions of a hidden universe and they showed the visuals of particles and waves to convey his brilliance,2023-07-22 23:02:39
theyre called people in real life,2023-07-23 05:18:27
the problem lies more on the marketing of the film which hinted that this was the movie to experience in imax format when in fact it did not,2023-07-22 23:28:24
i thought his last words to einstein were something like “i believe we did” which i took as him acknowledging that the invention of nuclear weapons fundamentally changed the word not that he believed the test would destroy the earth by igniting the atmosphere but that he still proceeded,2023-07-26 20:00:13
no it was symbolic of how the advent of nuclear weapons changed everything,2023-07-27 03:35:04
of nolan’s movies this was by far the most boring inconsequential and weirdly probably the longest,2023-07-23 04:00:44
watch more movies,2023-07-21 21:26:11
showing emotion is ok you crying would have made for a more impactful experience you were denied that,2023-07-21 21:35:56
that’s not the point though you’re asking for a completely different film,2023-07-21 21:38:09
pew pew i like lasers green screen and jokes every 4 sentences,2023-08-02 20:40:17
"couldnt similar be said of your comment upset so many people liked the movie bro

it was never billed as an action packed movie and what you got should have been glaringly obvious from the trailers did you not watch them",2023-07-25 14:54:44
i agree with the point you are making it’s an interesting one people are only arguing with you because you forgot women are supposed to aggressively hide their gender on here bc you’re in a room full of uptight misogynist 22 year old dudes you suggested their  might have some human flaws and they can’t handle it,2023-07-22 11:21:56
i always knew scorsese used to work for the mob glad im not alone with these thoughts s,2023-07-22 11:15:25
youre why movies  now,2023-07-22 10:43:52
what a terminally online take you should take this drivel to twitter where it will probably get virtual head pats various male and female characters have and dont have the traits you described in his movies you just seeing through some weird  hipster jeezbel blog glasses,2023-07-22 10:46:52
terrible review of a review of a review go back to barbieland you lightweight,2023-07-22 10:47:30
yes i do especially when every single performance is amazing i can find movies entertaining without needing fast paced action and explosions to keep my attention,2023-07-22 22:10:35
and everyone in the audience assuming it was german because he was studying in germany and then being confused as all get out when suddenly there’s a reference to dutch,2023-07-21 22:06:53
no you’re not the only thing hysterical is your word ,2023-08-06 14:06:05
saying mid mid mid 5 is neither thoughtful nor detailed so get off your high horse you angry little man,2023-08-04 00:16:08
"yeah dude maybe it’s the fact that they claimed “just cause it’s nolan it ain’t deep” and just called it mid without adding anything of value to the conversation pretty judgmental and worthless comments here the fact that you feel the need to aggressively defend this comment and refer the film as a “dreck”  bet that makes you feel clever shows your bias against the film and your own perceived intellectual superiority over people that enjoyed it 

if you don’t like the film who cares don’t post weirdly dismissive comments with a snarky tone in a thread discussing it and expect not to get downvoted ",2023-08-02 17:58:07
no dude i think youre just mad you need to go take a chill pill,2023-08-02 15:39:49
nolan can’t show nudity during  but others can huh,2023-07-21 21:59:01
strauss rdj’s character wanted to end oppenheimer after his talk with einstein and when oppenheimer humiliated him after the hearing on isotopes also the movie was titled “oppenheimer” not nuclear bombs it was a biopic on his life and what happened strauss was instrumental in oppenheimers demise and it was said after he got his clearance removed that oppenheimer was never the same also strauss was never a random person bro he was a prominent politician who rose through the ranks in washington even during the times when the city was pretty anti semitic and was only the eight cabinet nominee to be rejected at that time,2023-07-25 00:15:44
" any book written about him would describe it in detail

american prometheus didnt",2023-07-25 17:27:26
"why would a book describe an event that he never personally witnessed in detail

there was no need to show the actual bombing as part of the film",2023-07-25 17:37:57
why the  should people respect your opinion if you didnt even stay for the whole thing to actually get a valid opinion,2023-07-23 03:40:51
it was the worst movie i have ever seen nolan should refund my euros that i spent on this  movie,2023-07-23 03:41:22
it was a massive billiondollar in the 40s government project to find the gold as absolutely fast as possible as a matter of survival  you make it sound like the government just threw darts at some pictures one of them landed on oppy and since then hes been unfairly credited with the success of the project  that couldnt be further from the truth,2023-07-24 17:37:26
" he did nothing special but find the gold first that’s all nothing special

you are out of your element donny",2023-07-24 18:49:45
"dont be mean to me

you are outdated out of touch old nerdy men",2023-08-07 14:27:53
which one can you point to whatever doctrine says its not ok to see  in a film,2023-07-25 22:54:56
w o w,2023-08-07 00:36:11
" what makes me so mad is that the movie doesnt  it just sucks to normal people i just knew that the movie nerds who sit around in cinemas all day  their own dicks are gonna love this its kind of like how  is disgusting to most women but a small percentage of total  love gurgling that stuff this movie was made for nerds not for normals and that makes sense because there was no advertising for this film only people who live in cinemas would see this movie on the wall and be like oh my  cilan murphy i gotta see this it was for a totally different audience not for me and thats okay not everything has to be tailored for me

yo  is wrong with you",2023-07-21 13:09:03
hahahahaha you nailed it,2023-07-21 16:56:58
"i guess thats fair but if you know the history then you would understand that it was political from the beginning to the end id suggest reading the  brigade by sam kean american prometheus by kai bird and martin sherwin and the making of the atomic bomb by richard rhodes to get historical context 

the science behind the bomb was quite secondary to the political machinations that led to its existence use and aftermath",2023-07-21 13:01:42
yes you could have just have oppenheimer stare at the screen and say “science” for 3 hours but change the background to different landscapes,2023-07-21 14:02:11
"you really couldn’t follow three stories because there was only what actually happened oppenheimer’s closed hearing and strauss’s hearing and it did all tie in together it did bounce between the three often but i found it was more difficult remembering every new “character” added there are a lot of people involved in the story but i loved it i’d go see it again saw it in imax it was amazing the way they used sound to portray oppenheimer’s emotions

anyway i don’t think it’s fair for you to say the movie is bad just because you’re bad at following a story lol",2023-08-03 02:40:31
my bad reading sarcasm on reddit is hard because there are people out there who genuinely mean things like that,2023-07-25 22:10:12
yes it’s supposed to be but was very muddled,2023-07-22 18:48:19
"what he did it because oppenheimers famous speech is from it its not like he just went oh ya  this religion in particular and how the  is this racist you can say its distasteful or rude but this is no way racist and he couldve done any other religion and 99 of people wouldnt give a  because your tantrum represents a very very small portion of people who watched this movie boohoo oppenheimer spit some gita bars while rawdogging someonewho cares

also gita is one of the most famous and popular hindu scriptures in existenceand to say its a small group is ridiculous and honestly kinda rude since hinduism is the third largest religion on earth with 15 or more practicing itand youre saying one of the most well known scriptures is apparently the small guy another random white knight trying to defend a group that majorly doesnt really care that much good job defending something you know little about ",2023-07-22 19:14:37
"sounds like something you heard offhand and took it as gospel lol

he most certainly wasnt he had an affair with his friends wife lol",2023-07-29 18:09:23
apparently not,2023-07-29 18:22:58
"it helped for now but in reality it only slowed down nuclear proliferationnow that we see countries like nk and iran pushing for nukes 

eventually a lot of americas enemies will have nukes i hope we will have colonized other planets by then",2023-07-22 17:17:51
also an objective fact is your inability to see the future,2023-07-22 19:25:44
cool lets check in again in 100 years a hydrogen bomb will be used again someday its inevitable when that happens the chain of retaliation will be endless,2023-07-22 20:19:46
"not the person who replied to you but while he was hardly a paragon of moral clarity he wasn’t spineless either first though you could argue this was partially ego driven he did take moral responsibility for the bomb arguably even too much moral responsibility given that he was ultimately a cog in the national security machine an important cog but a cog nonetheless this shows at least some willingness to own what he did whereas a thoroughgoing coward would have disclaimed responsibility “just following orders” etc second he did do a number of things in service of his beliefs despite the fact that it exposed him to a great deal of personal and professional risk associating with communists covering for friends advocating for nonproliferation again not really the behavior of a thoroughgoing coward

third him not standing up for himself is i think better interpreted as selfpunishment for his guilt over creating the bomb—in fact this is the interpretation explicitly stated by his wife it’s not so much cowardice as a misguided attempt at penitence",2023-08-06 05:27:59
ikwym the entire movie felt like it was a montage,2023-07-24 03:43:09
oh yes thats the point of the movie,2023-07-21 20:46:37
yeah there was,2023-07-24 05:11:23
the beginning of the film sees oppenheimer discussing camps  the european front etc the focus on communism was because oppenheimer got into trouble for his affiliations later when he was painted as a soviet asset your media literacy is very low,2023-07-24 05:13:09
i just came out of the theater from watching it and you are completely wrong about the germany aspect that was literally the catalyst for oppenheimer to get a head start on the manhattan project it was explicitly stated various times that germany had discovered nuclear fission before the americans did in the first act of the film,2023-07-24 04:59:02
"they talk about germany quite a bit in the film

please pay attention to movies when you watch them",2023-07-24 07:11:16
you kinda insinuated it by questioning nolan being an avid moviegoer but now it seems like your mad at nolan because other people were late lol,2023-07-22 02:31:45
"i wasnt being rude but the movie spells everything out quite clearly

lewis strauss was upset that oppenheimer was opposed to the hydrogen bombhad made a fool out of him in the earlier hearing so he and nichols conspired to damage oppenheimers credibility so that he wouldnt have any ability to influence policy they are quite clear about making this a closed door hearing so that oppenheimer doesnt have a platform they also mention that its basically a kangaroo court and the deck is stacked against him no matter what he does only kitty manages to effectively stand up to robb 

strausss actions in the film are brought to light by david hill in strausss confirmation hearing and in the end he is not confirmed to a cabinet position",2023-07-25 22:52:53
i think this movie defo needs a pre read upon all highlights surrounding the discovery of abomb and the politics around oppenheimer without this it is near impossible to understand it in your first go even with this you need to pay very close attention in the 1st 1 hour to enjoy the second half of the movie,2023-07-25 22:54:05
you literally fell asleep,2023-07-25 23:47:39
i think the view of the destruction is when oppenheimer is giving the speech and he hears screams sees the woman’s skin melting off and stepping in an incinerated corpse,2023-07-28 03:19:57
so his next movie should be about mlk with jackie chan in the lead role,2023-07-24 21:46:30
depends on the bomb little boy the bomb dropped on hiroshima was literally a gun that  uranium bullet at a block of uranium  man the bomb dropped on nagasaki was the implosion type bomb that we saw tested in the movie at the trinity test interestingly the gun bomb hadn’t been tested but was the first bomb dropped they just assumed it would work,2023-07-25 00:05:30

hmmmm im pretty sure oppie went through the security hearing because strauss encouraged him to oppie thought he and strauss were allies in that endeavour theres a whole scene towards the end where strauss breaks the news to him that his clearance wasnt renewed but theres an appeals process that he has a chance with,2023-08-23 21:46:02

what do y’all think is worse an emotional or physical affair,2023-07-23 03:26:44
it was just oppy being naiveprivileged he thinks he can relate to strauss by saying that but it’s obviously so ridiculous oppenheimer grew up privileged because his dad worked hard vs strauss who had to work himself up from being a “lowly” shoe salesman to achieve the wealth that he currently has,2023-07-27 11:42:25
had to have been  theaters plural then because there were no issues at the screening i was at,2023-08-01 22:13:58

are you certain im the one trying to find a sense of power here kiddo,2023-07-30 22:16:06
what even did the security clearance entail that seemed the biggest thing,2023-07-25 03:48:01
it echos back to when he is on the hillside with his future wife and she says that her husband pointlessly died in a war for communism oppi said it wasn’t pointless it was for moral reasons she said there were no results so it was pointless,2023-07-26 14:00:53
that is wild,2023-07-24 21:43:25
"i’ve read about their meeting before and this is the takeaway i got from historians  

he wasn’t gloating he felt tremendous guilt himself but still felt like it was the right thing to do unlike oppenheimer he wasn’t allowed to wear his feelings on his sleeve like that and he resented the “crybaby” for being selfindulgent",2023-07-25 17:50:07
"i read it more as him telling oppenheimer to get over himself dude comes into his office and starts crying to the very guy who played an even bigger part in causing all those deaths i’d be annoyed too 

it’s hard to have much sympathy for a guy getting sad that his  toy was used for ",2023-07-25 00:04:51
i think they mean the cycle of public defacing followed by medals and awards that einstein said he went through and oppenheimer should be ready for,2023-07-22 15:48:20

i was confused about hartnett as well when the cast was originally announced and he had a pretty significant role but my confusion went away a few weeks ago when i saw the new season of black mirror he killed it in his episode,2023-07-22 17:51:35
would be funny if it was because he starred in pearl harbor,2023-07-23 00:55:05
like spielberg bringing john williams out of effective retirement,2023-07-22 20:19:44

hartnett was up for superman spiderman and batman and he declined them all pretty wild,2023-07-22 20:30:51
"i saw him and asked ‘he is the guy from pearl harbour right i know it’s a really old movie but that’s the only thing i’ve ever seen him in’ 
and my friend immediately was like yes it’s him and same 

he looks the same and that was so random to me that we recognised him from that one film but still remember him
and when rob came on i was like ‘he looks like chandler bing’",2023-07-30 11:54:38

well if were talking about the potsdam trio then fdr is not there,2023-07-29 17:14:57
i think it makes sense the other scientists have to have talked amongst themselves and realized what strauss was doing to oppenheimer it’s also why lawrence doesn’t testify against him,2023-07-23 13:15:05
"david l hills testimony really did happen  the scene was from the senate hearing’s transcript he was testifying in his role as the chairman of the federation of american scientists

and though the film didnt flesh it out he was one of the scientists who built the chicago pile",2023-07-27 04:54:00
hill’s character was barely introduced or fleshed out tbh and after oppenheimer spurned him right before the bombs were dropped i fully would’ve expected him to testify to support strauss,2023-07-24 14:12:04
"i didnt really know who he was got the vibe that he was someone that oppenheimer seemed to be bullying in a small way

i didnt get the baseball stadium plotline  what they were doing there",2023-07-29 20:35:45
i never associated character actor with type casting but i also don’t 100 understand what that label is supposed to mean,2023-07-23 02:28:18
the reason you think that is because he was the star in a tv show instead of being a character actor which i said he was best at,2023-07-28 02:07:57
"agreed with no spies maybe it would have taken the soviets 10 years  
  
but they were always going to develop it",2023-07-24 06:40:37
i thought that was a trap  he baits oppenheimer into saying the soviets will inevitably develop the bomb and uses those words against him i think either truman or his aide says something along the lines of “well we have to keep researching larger bombs because of what you just said”,2023-07-24 16:29:50
i took the puking to be from drinking too much there were a series of shots of people celebrating that to oppenheimer evoked victims of a nuclear bomb and i took the puking to be him thinking about radiation poisoning,2023-07-24 12:03:29
"truman lead the us to its final victory in wwii by the time the dust cleared over 60 million people were dead and thats a low estimate he was well aware what carnage and suffering looked like   
      
i dont think oppenheimer had some special understanding of the sheer destruction that truman lacked simply because he had watched it go off you can watch nuclear bomb videos on youtube it wont give you that much extra perspective  
  
they were both on the same page fully aware that the use of the bomb would  tens if not hundreds of thousands of people  
  
truman might have been naive in some ways famously thinking the soviets would never get the bomb but to suggest he was naive about the suffering it would cause when used seems absurd",2023-07-24 06:39:36

it should of been the ender after they said it was based on the book,2023-07-25 22:09:26
this is the only part of the movie that i definitively disliked,2023-07-24 16:09:01
its frustrating how egregious that scene is and how its really the only thing i can complain about in the movie especially because everyone knew ahead of time about the  scene i even asked my girlfriend when i got home when do you think they debuted the bhagavad gita quote and she jokingly responded during the  florence pugh scene and she couldnt believe that was actually it its comical in such a detrimental way that it almost overshadows everything else about her characters role,2023-07-22 17:10:12
i laughed way to hard at that moment like what the  is that tonal contrast,2023-07-26 05:57:09
"this was the only detail that got spoiled for me and i refused to believe it was real but here we are

unbelievable it made the final cut i thought maybe maybe when she said no read the words oppy would read it in sanskrit with subtitles to soften the blow but no",2023-07-31 02:01:31
i hope it was actually from some biography that at least he red it first time whole dating her or it’s completely baffling,2023-07-25 17:51:35
thats actually why i didnt mind the quote being there it would have been corny to recreate that interview especially when the interview itself is creepy and powerful,2023-07-30 06:26:39
not india just radical hindus who get up in arms about most things while i also think the scene was weird and couldve been done differently its also not as bad as some people are making it to be,2023-08-02 07:25:09
they did cut the scene from the film in india i believe,2023-07-27 22:11:47
this is true according to american prometheus learning sanskrit wasnt just a side hobby for oppenheimer he wasnt duolingoing his way through an ancient language he was genuinely interested in the bagahvad gita the way the line was introduced fp banging him as she happened upon that particular line took weight from the line it cheapened it,2023-08-07 10:41:29
the actor who played einstein is the same guy who helps bruce in the prison in dark knight rises,2023-07-25 04:15:45
i didn’t even recognize rdj fully until they began doing more frequent cuts of court scene,2023-07-24 22:42:26
rami malek is an oscar winner and is kind of just there until that one scene but still,2023-08-01 23:15:43
fully agree i probably wouldnt have seen it or at least not in theatres if i didnt know it was by nolan,2023-07-24 20:11:11
its possible it was a quick shot and i missed it i avoided as much as i could about the movie before so i was very surprised at the amount of nudity there was  i was expecting none,2023-07-23 03:18:05
they were very onedimensional and mostly served plot purposes there were so many aspects that could have been explored but they were all omitted,2023-07-25 06:32:14
i have chosen to overwrite this comment see you all on lemmy,2023-09-18 13:12:26
absolutely spot on it’s a direct analogue that is reflected yet again in the questioning by roger robb who tries to frame that same cognitive dissonance as dishonesty,2023-07-31 19:31:06
that’s  lot of responsibility for one person to carry given nobody asked you whether you even want to be born into this world or not i bet he never asked for this life be remembered for producing weapon of mass destruction not beautiful scientific discovery just imagine weight on his shoulder as a human being you don’t have to feel sorry for him but you also can’t really blame him imho you don’t get to give someone life without asking their opinion and then put a bomb around their belly and blame them for it like they had a choice he had to do what needed to be done that was his life purpose to move us forward teach us more about who we are and who we aren’t as human beings he once again gave us a choice between good and bad and we picked both using such wonderful tool for mass destruction isn’t his fault but ours as humankind,2023-08-14 05:25:20
i dont know of it was just me but it almost looks like there was a blackgloved hand pushing her head into the tub,2023-07-24 02:56:04
jean strung him along though he proposed twice after years of dating she said no both times he eventually started dating and married kitty then later resumed an affair with jean when she wanted to see him again she was a tortured soul with clinical depression her whole life it’s  sad but not really on oppenheimer imo,2023-07-23 06:04:45
they dont even know how to beach off,2023-07-22 19:54:16
nah it was jaywalking,2023-07-23 00:00:27
their spouses oppenheimer wasnt married,2023-07-24 01:38:56
wow i critique a tv show character and you respond by calling me an incel nice,2023-08-16 11:34:01
have you seen the sopranos all of the mob wives accept that their husbands run around on them,2023-07-26 09:16:56
you mean sanitize lol,2023-07-21 23:03:50
literally don’t care what’s dangling between your legs the women were inarguably the weakest part not just of oppenheimer but of christopher nolan’s filmography as a whole,2023-07-23 02:38:10
and that changed what exactly,2023-07-23 02:37:21
totally agree i’m a big fan of horror and the gore genre specifically and never even wince but this was something else i guess largely because of the context of being something that actually happened and the notion that people could celebrate knowing that had happened it seems so incomprehensible but then at the same time i was thinking if my country was at war today and it was the same scenario would i act the exact same way it seems monstrous and i’m sure we’d all like to believe we were better people than that but how could you possibly know for sure without being in that situation it’s terrifying that’s a really powerful piece of film,2023-07-30 08:43:54
i thought the crying people were scientists on the team who were sad the bomb was used,2023-09-10 04:47:17
interesting i had a totally different vibe from that scene can’t wait for it to be released digitally so i can watch it again with that lens and see what i think,2023-08-28 23:21:26
yes and they are suggesting you contextualize the scene so as not to seem ignorant,2023-08-22 12:17:08
"right but the movie is supposedly about the different perspectives of two men — oppenheimer and strauss the color vs bw film indicate objective and subjective perspective 

why is there one scene with not only kitty’s perspective but her imagination there are no other scenes in the movie like that",2023-07-26 20:45:31
"that scene’s so  great the tension and build up as they count down makes you anxious as  then when it finally goes off silence you just have to sit there in awe and horror as you watch what these men and woman made and just as it’s sinking in you get the line

“now i am become death destroyer of worlds”

and by then when you’ve finally let your guard down that’s when the loud  explosion from the imax speakers knock you on your  even more

just an amazing scene",2023-07-31 05:43:54
in a way oppenheimer is wiping out a whole civilization with one nut so it fits,2023-07-27 02:53:53
it might be a nod to gravity’s rainbow how a climax is simultaneously the apex of life and death,2023-07-30 05:31:41
it was in the trinity test scene right before the shock wave hit them,2023-07-27 07:49:53
i actually appreciate how he doesnt just start quoting the multiarmed hindu  vishnu randomly during the trinity test the  scene gives some more context to the quote,2024-01-01 23:18:12
what do you think the full quote adds to the movie though,2023-07-23 02:32:00
i saw it at the alamo and their preroll stuff included a tv interview with oppenheimer where he has the full quote it was only after seeing your comment that i realized how well that worked so bravo to whoever put that in there,2023-07-23 04:32:28
anyone else have this memorized because of a daniel caesar song entropy for those wondering,2023-07-25 04:13:38
thats all he wanted,2023-07-24 22:49:36
the plot could have been about the science or the impact of the bomb but instead it was about a petty rivalry the topic is already so morally and emotionally complex you don’t have to focus on a “bad guy” who was quite boring and inconsequential at the end of the day,2023-07-24 23:18:00
"a small segment of mouth breathers only wanted nuke the movie

they didn’t want or expect a biopic about oppenheimer himself",2023-07-25 16:24:06
as someone who watched and enjoyed both movies your comment is cringe and condescending,2023-07-29 21:11:58
good advice it’s a much better movie all around,2023-08-02 04:40:26
i did it was great it knew when to end,2023-07-24 18:45:28
"wait  bless that and bless you you just eased the severity of my yearslong existential dread considerably

that’s wild abt nixon ",2023-07-22 14:01:17
"it’s not the us i’m concerned about using them first it’s the old russian warheads that went  in the 90s and maybe north korea getting something working well enough 

or putin deciding to take out everyone if he gets a hint he might be deposed",2023-07-27 05:35:12
" in the us for instance an order to launch has to go through the chairman of the joint chiefs and the secretary of defense

this isnt true the president could give the command to fire to a more junior officer who would have the means to deliver the order to the requisite commands who oversee the delivery of nuclear weapons

source ",2023-07-22 17:22:38
the world has almost 10x the amount of nukes just a few decades ago but we collectively decided to reduce that number no reason we couldnt go further if other countries felt safer and didnt feel like they were getting encroached on then theyd be a lot more willing to reduce nuke numbers,2023-07-23 21:44:51
"incorrect weve been working on missile defense for quite a while

its why youre seeing our adversaries pursuing more and more complex pathways of delivery russias nuclear poseidon chinas hypersonic glide vehicle

because if we have an effective shield all of the sudden mad isnt a burden for us",2023-07-23 03:47:04
yes… for now unless there’s no garantuee it wont in the future,2023-07-22 19:43:03
thats only half the story though since the thing that will make wwiii so unutterably bloody is the nukes,2023-07-23 21:03:45
no hundreds of thousands of americans dieing while causing the near genocide of the japanese people would have caused wounds that would have made vietnam look like the invasion of granada we just weren’t willing to bleed,2023-07-26 03:33:37
what a moving contribution to the discourse,2023-07-22 03:22:39
i think it might be the greatest final scene of all time honestly,2023-07-25 06:39:22
what was the context of that line in was it when  they showed the line of icbms ,2023-07-23 00:43:51
they built earth 2 and blew it up crazy stuff,2023-07-22 04:53:19
dneg did the visual effects for the film but theres bugger all people credited in the film so the only bits i imagined they worked on were those huge wide shots of the entire planet,2023-07-22 22:41:26
going for a second viewing soon maybe i can keep it together this time lol it’s that final reveal shot of the icbms lined up that got me from the 3 hour buildup and current events it’s horrifyingly real,2023-07-22 22:00:20
"eh russia always plays the nuke card but they don’t want to die anymore then anyone one else please calm down we’ve been through the cold war with those guys no one is going to nuke over ukraine 

at the end of the day you can’t go around wasting energy worrying about nukes unless you’re in the government they are here to stay all well",2023-07-25 14:55:25
"the doomsday clock is close due to climate change 

that clock has been used as a political football for the last 40 years",2023-07-31 02:39:09
and then next year we would feel the same sentiment about the next threat as we did with the previous thats the whole point  weve entered a new era of war where the ability to end the world is an option thats not new to the ukraine war i get what you mean but i just dont agree its like the concept of infinity the doomsday clock is only closer to midnight than it was the last time which was also as close as possible one of these days we will hit the limit,2023-07-25 22:40:22
were not closer to doomsday than ever closer would obviously be the cuban missile crisis but also vietnam,2023-07-27 03:53:15
"he asks einstein if he remembers their last conversation where einstein told him he hopes that they won’t destroy the world with their invention referencing the igniting atmosphere theory 

einstein says that he remembers that conversation and what he said to oppenheimer then oppenheimer says „i think we did“ meaning that the destruction of the world is inevitable now that nukes have been developed",2023-07-24 01:22:57
truly for some reason i couldn’t get behind her character until that scene and then everything made sense,2023-07-22 03:11:55
nah its the scene when she murders teller with one look ,2023-07-23 03:35:39
"kitty said something along the lines of 

do you think if you let them tar and feather you that theyll forgive you because they wont 

seems to be the movies answer for why he didnt fight back",2023-07-22 22:42:35
self flagellation i think he believed he deserved it,2023-07-23 23:09:47
"the book tries to spell out that oppenheimer would sometimes get flustered and say things he shouldnt under pressure they point to his conversations with pash and truman as examples

so he was just unprepared for the intense questioning he got they also note that towards the end of the hearing he was much better at pushing back it just wasnt something that came naturally to him",2023-07-23 22:09:14
i think op is referring to roger robb the special counsel to the atomic energy commission hearing that led to the revocation of oppenheimers security clearance,2023-07-23 00:52:50
yeah today people still remember oppenheimer for his scientific contributions and building the bomb but barely remember him losing a security clearance due to cold war paranoia,2023-07-24 01:45:26
dont forget the two seconds of bomb scientist telling the guys where they can stuff it with their fertility fears,2023-07-21 18:19:50
well unfortunately that’s what they were like in real life so nolan can’t do much about that,2023-07-21 21:37:08
well it’s called “oppenheimer” not “oppenheimer the wattpad story”,2023-07-27 15:10:09
it’s christopher nolan so i’m not surprised his movies are great but they’re all sausage fests and the few female characters he has just exist to be romantic interests andor people for the male lead to explain things to,2023-07-23 23:30:29
his priority was the h bomb oppenheimer was trying to end the project to avoid escalation undermining oppenheimer advanced his own career,2023-07-22 21:11:50
for sure strauss was not a good person but he wasn’t a villain either he was just a man who’s ego didn’t like being poked,2023-07-22 18:08:56
truman as well,2023-07-24 05:57:25
just realizing that ties well with the theme of the movie you make a decision in one moment then it takes time for the consequences to arrive,2023-07-24 13:58:12
the other delays during the smaller test detonations were because of the distance from the explosion thus the delay of the sound but the trinity test made it seem like it took forever before the blastwave and sound came,2023-07-24 09:11:19
sparing kyoto because he honeymooned there is actually historically accurate as well just shows how casual the decision to end 225000 lives ended up being,2023-08-02 13:59:06
the one guy was president truman no correct me if i’m wrong tho tbf he also saw kyoto as a culturally important location that he knew would make the bombing completely unforgivable but otherwise the way the conversation was carried makes my stomach churn and that’s coming from someone whose country was invaded  pillaged by the japanese during the war,2023-07-31 06:39:22
he isnt hes the opposite meaning something like sure you can be a man being a man doesnt mean you have to be a  give the video a try hes on of my favorite youtubers the japan video also is one of the best things but a heavy subject of course,2023-08-22 06:23:59
id love for him to take bond back to the 60s,2023-07-22 20:06:16
please yes,2023-07-22 07:57:09
i would also be down for him to do an ian fleming biopic,2023-07-22 21:46:43
i mean tenet was pretty much a scifi bond film,2023-08-31 01:35:39
close up of a computer screen the letters www show up screen cuts to black crowd goes wild,2023-07-26 13:57:15
a nolan mk ultra movie would be dope,2023-07-24 22:45:16
"its not a fantastic look though insofar as im concerned it was ok its basically poaching they wanted the knowhow they got great benefits from it and lets not forget that rocketry wasnt just about going to the moon it was about icbms which yeah better if they had not existed but also unavoidable once the russians were on the game too some guy who was working for the nazis i dont even know his real political views i mean everyone had to be a member of the party to work at that point  heisenberg is another obvious example didnt get punished for it like most of the other people who did outside of the big honchos because you couldnt really hang or jail a significant fraction of germany

i guess the most rational argument against it is that you may signal to future authoritarian regime scientist lackeys that theyll get an out and fall on their feet no matter how bad their side  up as long as theyre useful enough

anyway yeah it would be an uncomfortable movie i suppose only reference to von braun i can think of in a movie was in october sky and that whole  thing is completely ignored of course hes just this cool aspirational figure the rocket boys admire as a genius",2023-07-24 06:26:10
hunters on prime is sort of about operation paperclip,2023-07-24 10:44:11
indiana jones 5 is as close as it gets ,2023-07-30 20:47:37
"and he can play stalin as well

",2023-07-21 10:08:29
man i was waiting for the conversation between oppy and harry to be adapted and it didn’t disappoint i loved how harry was like “oh look at little  boy jr gonna cry” and how subtle the whole thing was i thought it was gonna go the melodramatic route,2023-07-22 01:13:55
also lee harvey oswald,2023-07-22 13:06:30
…wait… he was truman,2023-07-23 01:24:39
jordan would have won the award himself,2023-07-21 05:20:09
he would have taken it personally,2023-07-21 07:02:52
 dem scientists,2023-07-21 15:39:08
communists buy shoes too,2023-07-24 03:55:48
because he would have lost it gambling,2023-07-21 09:23:08
mickey mouse fermi award,2023-07-25 12:45:34
the fall of constantinople will leave a mark on lebron’s legacy,2023-07-21 22:09:24
he then said he wanted to add oppenheimer to the list of scientists he recruits to the lakers this summer,2023-07-21 19:46:41
he had the bongos and everything,2023-07-23 11:17:23
if the credits are to believed yes not sure if they ever said his name in the actual movie,2023-07-22 18:32:12
yes,2023-07-22 18:39:08
i literally stepped out of class to call my best friend when i saw the news,2023-11-30 07:32:18
that was the first imax movie i’ve seen in forever probably endgame that thunder clap single handedly convinced me to start seeing them more often,2023-08-07 01:52:33
i think we do know people just dont like the answer,2023-07-31 15:26:52
i didn’t know anyone could make casey affleck terrifying but  nolan did it,2023-07-22 06:43:29
casey affleck jump scare,2023-07-23 02:02:42
"same i think this is a case of too much gravitas for the role  iirc hes introduced in a scene with only a couple characters on the screen fairly centered on the shot and doesnt even speak

theres no ambiguity to how he looks its just rami malek

i think it would be like showing bryan cranston in that situation and not letting him talk  its too much presence  i thought the ensemble of talent was cool overall they just had to take that one down a notch",2023-07-26 17:46:23
probably one of the last times i can recall him really disappearing in a role not that its a bad thing hes like a tom hanks,2023-07-25 01:47:26
he almost killed himself for that movie  probably figured being alive and healthy  and merely good was better than being a great actor and miserable,2023-07-23 00:02:24
so were they trying to hint that aiden was the one who leaked the information against strauss he seemed real happy when rami maleks character revealed confidential information about strausss involvement but i wasnt sure if im misremembering it,2023-07-25 01:09:48
"the dude struck out kyoto because he went on honeymoon there

it was an extremely selfish act that was disconnected from humanity not supposed to be taken as a kind gesture",2023-07-25 03:22:56
the fact that a lot of americans will sit through this movie and still believe that the bombings were justified is very disturbing,2023-07-22 13:45:26
"but were now judging them based on information they couldnt have known

i used to think this until i saw the movie during the scene where theyre trying to decide where to drop the bomb my wife and i went on our honeymoon there lol they also talk about what will happen after the war

they knew that as soon as they dropped the bomb every other country in the world would be scrambling to build one themselves leading to a world full of nuclear weapons 

they knew what they were doing they just didnt want to think about it",2023-07-23 02:02:32
"but they’re here world ending devices exist

you’re harping on the worst possible events with no trust in humanity whatsoever

there are numerous checks and balances to use these sort of weapons and you’re counting on countless people saying “yeah we’re good with ending the world”",2023-07-23 19:36:43
lol you’re so dense,2023-07-22 21:48:19
what you say is true but the issue is that even if the us had been benevolent lol and stopped developing the bomb after germany surrendered  and never used it on japan the soviet union still would’ve developed nuclear weapons at some point so that would’ve forced the us to continue developing and would be a fine excuse to justify the project basically a world with nuclear powers was inevitable as soon as physicists discovered the possibility of a nuclear chain reaction whether showcasing their power on japan helped deterrence or not is mostly speculation but either way there would still be nuclear weapons today,2023-07-28 01:35:56
i actually went back and tried to find where i read what i said and couldnt find it i did find that there are some debates on this topic so an argument in either direction can be made but it might not be so black and white out of historical interest if you have a source on what you are talking about id be interested to read more,2023-07-25 22:28:45
they brought this up i think 3 times oppie even said something like “apparently the war was basically over anyways” and there was that meeting where they were like “ is dead and japan is def not gonna hold out long”,2023-07-22 20:26:54
in real life they were arguing amongst themselves about the terms of the surrender not whether they should,2023-07-23 03:20:44
were the hundreds of thousands of people indiscriminately massacred and poisoned in civilian targets all personally responsible for such atrocities,2023-08-15 12:17:58
true dr strangelove talked about the accidental first bombing that triggers a doomsday device that wipes out humanity,2023-07-27 03:01:28
that was what he was saying,2023-07-31 07:36:59
" the invention of the a bomb opened the door for man to recklessly create tech that could wipe out humanity

did it how so i reckon the computer age and the rise of ai would have happened with or without the atomic age",2023-07-27 07:16:47
yeah only nolan’s fans love this 90 plus rt rated movie that’s gonna make over 700 million dollars you are very smart,2023-08-16 22:00:32
if she never knew him she would have more than likely lived he knew and felt this this is true either way,2023-07-26 14:23:59
"the biography covers her death and mentions it could have been  although most likely suicide

a lot of what was in the book is also shown by nolan so i think it was a reference to the possibility she was murdered",2023-08-05 20:54:23
he was also mentioned the note was not signed,2023-07-27 20:29:47
they also bonded over the study of poison hence his confession about the apple in his bedroom after she looked at his books,2023-07-26 14:27:24
people commit suicide in a wide variety of ways and slitting your wrists isnt even in the top 3 firearms hangingsuffocation poisoning most people that cut themselves are not trying to  themselves source,2023-07-24 01:12:54
wouldn’t be the first person us intelligence had killed ,2023-07-22 06:29:46
its also a very easy to cover up  by planting the seeds of everything not stated by the state as fact as being a conspiracy,2023-07-22 19:25:39
“you lied to boris pash that man has killed communists with his bare hands”,2023-07-22 07:51:03
he did in the car during the test he was explaining the glass blocks uv it was a nice easter egg,2023-07-21 10:00:16
what do you mean he had plines there was an entire conversation with him during the recruitment he had lines in the car during the trinity test and he had a few others here and there at los alamos,2023-07-22 16:11:11
why was i so focused on the booger and not that it was rodrick,2023-07-24 05:07:29
he wasnt a scientist in that ep tho he was an astronaut isnt he,2023-07-24 15:39:22
saw some comments that identified him as feynman from the bongos alone ,2023-07-24 11:56:16

spot on,2023-07-22 15:23:52
"i’m going to be less cynical and hope nolan explains in the future exactly what he meant normally i’d agree with you when it’s general presented someone says they do something without the use of a specific tool they’re twisting the meaning but i’d like to believe he has more integrity than to put out a fluff popcorn factoid for people to talk about that could be fact checked later on 

not saying you’re wrong just hoping that you are lol",2023-07-21 22:01:58
it’s done on a computer also why we don’t use the term cgi in vfx cgi is an outdated term from the 90s,2023-07-27 08:16:28
they are kind of interchangeable terms generally but technically cgi computergenerated imagery is a subcategory of vfx a visual effects shot is one that just contains effects that are not practical gollum is a cg character so a shot with gollum and frodo is a vfx  fully cg shot of gollum falling into lava is also a vfx shot,2023-07-22 03:47:52
"see the timeline didn’t make it very clear but rdj’s “humiliation” happened in the late 40s five years after ww2 ended the trialcourtroomconfirmation drama was all in mid to late 50s

each to their own for me putting parts of post nuke japan in the room would have been about as on the nose as it gets the way it was depicted felt a lot more real and disturbing to me,2023-07-22 01:31:10
"i think part of the point was that these people were so wrapped up in their own drama that they viewed much of it through the lens of their own lives and what could happen to themthe things that matter to them while ignoring the actual victims like how kyoto gets saved purely because one powerful guy had a good vacation there that’s one of the chilling things about this part of history the hypocrisy of oppenheimer himself and his waffling about his “moral concerns” was at the heart of one of the most intense scenes in the film

tbh i don’t think having a bunch of japanese characters showing up for a single scene and essentially serving as a visual device would have necessarily been the most respectful thing either there can be and already are movies that actually show the real human effects of the war and the various bombings and what makes those like for example grave of the fireflies though it’s about the firebombings of tokyo and not hiroshimanagasaki so haunting is that the characters are actually deep and humanized not just glorified extras added into one sequence to heighten emotional impact and i think nolan probably realized that it would take a whole movie of its own to do the bombings themselves justice

i think the scene with oppenheimer and his wife after he found out that jean had killed herself was a perfect encapsulation of the whole thing something along the lines of “you don’t get to sin and expect everyone else to pity you when there are consequences”",2023-07-26 02:50:17
the thing is youre asking for more visualisation than there already was we saw the effect it had on them in a truly haunting scene but you want the audience to be desensitized with a whole scene of them suffering  not only that but it would also be out of oppie or strauss pov,2023-07-22 02:33:27
how would you describe the maga movement,2023-07-23 06:45:37

"zimmer infamously is a great collaborator who brings other people to the table to help generate new ideas pirates was klaus badelt with additional work by geoff zanelli i believe 

ludwig seems to be having a musical trajectory in terms of skill that’s definitely remarkable turning point for me was the stringsonly arrangement of his mando theme that closes season 2 if that was all him this score was wild and sometimes all over the place but it help keep a 3 hour run time from dragging for sure",2023-07-27 14:28:38
for me yeah i think that last bit of score is incredible but each to their own jonny greenwood would have been interesting too loved his power of the dog score,2023-07-23 06:23:36
"i assumed it was zimmer while watching the movie due to his history with nolan i try to go into movies completely blind after the teaser trailer if i can and not look at cast or credits until after

i loved ludwigs mando score and he definitely did oppenheimer justice and then some fantastic score knowing now that it wasnt zimmer composing i can already remember a few unique moments that stuck out to me as not as zimmeresque but the vibe was perfect i cant think of a single musical moment that didnt hit perfectly",2023-07-23 04:30:52

i hope people see this i couldn’t recommend the book more for anybody interested,2023-07-21 23:07:14
"that makes sense i read about the real jean tatlock on wikipedia

	there has been at times speculation by historians and her brother hugh as to whether her death was truly a suicide as there were some suspicious circumstances

so yeah it seems like nolan is addressing that",2023-07-22 02:50:18
thanks i appreciate the confirmation,2023-07-23 00:01:05
they did didnt they jean gave oppenheimer the book to read while sitting and riding on top,2023-07-21 09:14:19
kama sutra is not part of the hindu scripture what are you talking about,2023-07-27 23:34:14
"it’s definitely disrespectful and also totally contradicts the uproar of the bhagavad gita it also shows a lack of understanding of the text  the text is about rising above material and sensory pleasures and understanding the impermanence of the material world

i doubt oppenheimer read the text during   so it seems like a weird hipster artistic choice",2023-07-21 09:47:43
according the gita you do not have  for fun  is for the purpose of childbirth that scene was gross,2023-07-21 12:51:10

im honestly surprised they left the destroyer of worlds line they board censored the villain saying glory to hanuman in black panther,2023-07-23 19:02:52

makes me appreciate the first amendment in america that much more,2023-07-22 06:53:50
it was done well i think i was confused but wasnt sure if it was cgi seems like something that was already made,2023-07-22 17:18:45
it honestly convinced me nolan is asexual lol,2023-08-13 19:07:17
,2023-07-22 08:02:10
people in my theater laughed at the kyoto line… felt very disturbed by that,2023-07-24 02:22:35
you got a good point i think the movie also presents via the following and persecution of the lead character that that wouldnt be out of the question and again the gloved hand,2023-07-23 08:21:37
"plus truman making fun of oppy for feeling bad even him saying hey i was the one who did it felt like im the one who has to worry about how this action negatively effects my reputation whilst also taking a bit of pride in being the one who did it and ignoring the guy who actually spearheaded the building of the bomb

ive not been crazy about political readings of nolans work in the past more so because i think his films though they do present situations leave more up to the viewer so its hard to say oh this movie is saying this but for sure this films depiction of the usa was pretty cynical and i think it brought to light both the injustice of oppenheimers persecution and also the negative consequences of ww2 of which oppenheimers bomb was one of the biggest he was responsible obviously but so was the us military",2023-07-23 08:18:47
true for my showing too plus the line about the honeymoon spot which was both genuinely funny and also funny in a really thats a reason not to drop a bomb on an area full of innocent people,2023-07-23 08:09:47
teller had thrown oppenheimer under the bus during the interrogation,2023-07-22 06:07:10
teller had recommended oppenheimer gets his clearance revoked and then shook his hand kitty told her husband off for it thought he was being too passive and that he shouldnt have shaken his hand then she stuck to her guns,2023-07-22 06:41:04
teller had  on oppenheimers character during the clearance hearing but afterward oppenheimer shakes his hand and smiles anyway  she is infuriated that he shook tellers hand as she had been urging him to fight for himself instead of letting himself be made a martyr,2023-07-22 06:27:54
felt longer than 25 seconds but my anxiety was at the highest at that moment so it might actually be 25secs and my brain slow everything down,2023-07-21 14:27:46
i loved that in interstellar too loud ost but when the view is outside in space silence,2023-07-21 19:42:41
just checked on a camrip and it was exactly 1min40s,2023-07-23 19:37:07
shouldnt they have heard the ground rumble before the soundwave though the explosion scene seemed to have left that out more realistically it wouldnt have been completely silent before the soundwave,2023-07-23 16:58:05
i think that is obvious but delay between the explosion and the sound was not one of them the other things you describe are,2023-08-03 03:11:01
"all explosions in the movie had proper sound travel delay which im sure is done accurately

people will be analysing these to discern exactly how far away each explosion is from the viewer",2023-07-21 09:44:03
my 70mm imax did wasn’t an issue or anything,2023-07-24 09:56:13
yeah,2023-07-28 06:45:20
truman made the right call too it was the least horrible of the 3 available options he had,2023-07-21 05:26:08
when you do what oppenheimer and his team did its not called pretentious its called being self aware,2023-07-21 19:03:26
thanks,2023-07-21 05:04:08
as a frequent  you have plenty of oppentunity to  before the bomb and after too,2023-07-21 14:11:27
thanks,2023-07-21 06:31:18
didnt think of that i was just thinking about how weird age ratings are in the us,2023-08-01 11:10:04
it did have a few yes but nothing like the ones in the excorsist trailer,2023-07-22 01:17:15
they always spoil like the 3 best jump scares in these movies too for people that like them,2023-07-22 00:42:19
closed my eyes too but the creepy voice and the screaming still  me up i hate horror so much and i hated that they put that trailer on,2023-07-24 07:44:54
"well for one i wont ever watch the original excorsit ever again  i was absolutely terrified the first time i watched it and even now it just feels so evil  like i know a movie cant be evil and im not religious but i just remember it being so unapologetically brutal and terrifying  its such an assault i dont think id ever want to sit through it again  

this upcoming movie is absolutely not happening for me",2023-07-22 08:16:45
today i learned thanks for letting me know that kind of changes my mind about it then i just assumed like an  that it was a studio adding the beat to a traditional song im very happy to hear it was actually totally legit,2023-08-07 15:56:33
i had somehow completely missed the announcement they were making this movie but once i heard those two notes i realized exactly what it was,2023-07-22 00:47:50
i  loved it i thought they did the best they possibly could given the source materials length and the way its written love the book too even  emperor,2023-07-30 01:23:49
oofing your need to insert your comment in the first place definitely not getting into this weird competition between two movies that you decided to detour into ,2023-07-21 13:46:34
oh 100 agree his entire plot couldve been cut tbh i think the movie couldve been 2 hours,2023-07-22 00:05:10
oppenheimers not really and again this is a guy who will be solely remembered for creating the atomic bomb nothing else he did after that was ever going to be remotely important in comparison his political leanings are laughably unimportant especially 75 years later,2023-07-23 13:26:28
he wasnt going to stop the hydrogen bomb or anything it ultimately didnt even matter its a fine take,2023-07-23 23:26:35
no one cares about the 2nd most important thing to happen in your life when the most important thing is creating the first nuclear weapon,2023-07-26 15:05:30
"its not remotely true and isnt supported by any evidence other than people continually saying it the reasons for kyoto being removed from the list arent entirely clear but what is clear is that stimson didnt honeymoon in kyoto and didnt visit there until 30 years after he was married

see here here and here

dont believe everything you read on rtodayilearned",2023-08-07 09:04:14
which is frustrating because its incorrect and theres no evidence to support it,2023-08-07 09:04:36
yeah i get that but japan seems like a long journey on a boat plus the language barriers at the time were pretty intense seems like it would be a really long honeymoon,2023-08-14 16:50:45
hopefully well see more original content from hollywood over the next few years,2023-07-22 11:06:29
i think we all can easily point to movies in which directors took risks and they didnt pan out,2023-07-23 00:08:12
"the biggest movie of the year is super mario bros

it’s not like oppenheimer is the first risky movie to come out this year there are still tons of great movies coming out all the time and people don’t go see them christopher nolan has a big draw in the same way that other franchises do that doesn’t mean the general audience wants a lot of this",2023-07-25 15:54:27
any you want to recommend,2023-07-23 22:34:49
scorcese,2023-07-25 04:44:02
honestly theyre both among the best of their categories barbie might be the bestexecuted social commentary ive ever seen,2023-08-05 19:02:29
thats sad that people didnt give it a chance im a big fan of silent movies so i enjoyed it as a fun loveletter to that era if anything i feel that many movie nerds consider it a bit overrated due to its relatively slight classichollywood story and all of the awards it ended up with especially given its competition that year but it makes sense that outside of that bubble itd feel way more esoteric,2023-07-21 13:13:09
the edit wasn’t directed at anyone in particular sorry about that  didn’t know who did it but i didn’t tear up because the theater was nice it was because we were watching a unique film that was constructed in a nontraditional way in terms of the sort of blockbuster films that usually get this reception seeing people from all walks of life come together for an interesting cinematic endeavor for three hours is special,2023-07-23 02:26:39
"pig

haha holy ",2023-08-06 07:57:37
ah i really need to make the time to watch decision to leave i keep forgetting about it for some reason despite all the great things i’ve readwatched about it the others are great choices too big capital c cinema movies,2023-07-24 19:29:42
"and the science is honestly the fun part

i think thats exactly why we dont see any of the problemsolving that happened during manhattan project nolan doesnt want us to feel admiration his main goal in the movie is to explore oppenheimers guilt and the morality of his research so it serves him better to keep the process itself shrouded in mystery",2023-07-26 01:55:46
did you watch the tv show manhattan highly recommend,2023-07-22 05:15:30
but what they were doing at los alamos wasn’t enriching uranium right,2023-07-23 06:01:36
ah but it wouldnt feel like a real christopher nolan film without it,2023-08-05 19:09:12
there was a brief mention about the  team taking a wrong turn which put los alamos ahead but that’s all we got,2023-07-25 23:43:17
"discussions of the manhattan project tend to focus on a few scientists and theoretical work rather than the actual engineering either of the plants that were used to get the material that made the weapons possible or the weapons themselves explosive lens designs for implosion etc

this is arguably due in large part to intentional moves by the us government from the beginning of the project going public  the scientifictheoretical aspects were more available and they didnt want to discuss technical details of say uranium enrichment at all to avoid the soviets and later iran north korea etc learning lessons it took billions of dollars to learn  the smyth report which was the immediate postwar public account of the project had next to no technical detail other than a single reference to xenon poisoning in reactors which was edited out after the first few printings source   instead focusing entirely on general theories in physics which were already public knowledge

it isnt suprising that the movie goes the same route since thats now entrenched as the popular narrative though it is imo dissapointing",2023-07-22 18:27:53
i think the real raindrops were the friends we made along the way,2023-07-23 10:53:46
it makes sense just fine cooper was 1 just a pilot 2 joined the mission last minute whereas others were scientists who’d known and worked on the mission for some time,2023-08-12 11:56:37
lazy exposition is nolan’s main feature in his films,2023-08-07 07:53:57
"that’s what google says 

what i can’t find out is why they went through the stress of making the plutonium bomb given that the refining of plutonium was extremely time consuming and expensive and that they’d have to test the bomb to make sure it even worked at all 

i can’t find or understand why they didn’t just make two uranium bombs and be done with it maybe it was explained in the film and i missed it but i can’t find it on google either",2023-07-24 13:16:23
"big same my wife and i both checked our watches while rdj was giving his oscar nomination reel and were just like rolling our eyes lol   


like the focus on the terror of these bombs that we used them on people and what it means to the human race and our future is all like meaty substance then you just get this boring  drawn out legal scenes i think they could have still told that part of the story just cut down a bit more",2023-08-03 19:21:45
yeah but strauss had no power he lost it all,2023-07-22 04:34:15
"yes it was a contrived line  jfk had also almost been nominated for vice president in 1956  i wonder if kennedy really was a swing vote  it seems possible  two other liberal but strongly anticommunist catholic democrats from new england thomas dodd and john pastore did in fact vote for confirmation and maybe kennedy was expected to vote with them

",2023-07-22 23:48:18
it was literally one line out of this 3 hour movie  what the  are you talking about,2023-07-27 07:20:20
when the defining moment of kennedy’s presidency was the cuban missile crisis i think it works,2023-07-31 06:57:54
thats very true but  i like how the film also used it to demonstrate oppenheimers immediate loss of control over the situation as soon as the bomb was finished also with the army guy saying well take it from here when he tried to advise him on how high to drop the bomb from or his final conversation with grove saying he will keep him informed as best we can,2023-07-21 13:25:25
they did though the scene in the gym showed much of the most notorious effects of the bomb like the peeling of skin burnt bodies the white fallout etc,2023-07-21 08:59:13
i felt uncomfortable maybe for different reasons the scene is about how vulnerable and  oppenheimer is but i kept thinking of the reality of florence pugh shooting the scene  in front of literally a roomful of men sitting and watching with a male director dp etc and what a vulnerable position that is for the actress i’m glad emily blunt was there onscreen with her,2023-07-24 12:41:21
that  scene felt completely unnecessary all i could picture was nolan saying to lawrence pugh “yeah you look into her eyes as you f him”,2023-07-21 22:10:39
same  it was the exact set up as the others,2023-07-21 12:48:21
what if its oppenheimer imagining what kitty would think about as he is revealing it cuz the script for the film was written in first person,2023-07-22 02:25:01
hmm thats interesting i used to see that effect in older films mainly from the 80s and 90s it was an effect that could be done without cg so it was done to simulate thunder and stuff so i just thought chris was using that effect since it was a good practical effect thats also effective definitely could be interpreted as the representation of an atomic bomb going off,2023-08-19 06:15:00
me too and it really got me when the couple was making out under the bleachers and then the other couple crying hysterically right after,2023-07-23 15:41:31
yeah the whole auditorium scene was haunting with the fallout the nuclear flash the skin pealing off the woman and the burnt up body nolan really showed the horror of nuclear weapons,2023-07-21 08:56:56
im gonna guess oppenheimer,2023-07-21 13:03:25
oppenheimer but now you have me intrigued about the ending to barbie if thats the other one you were referring to,2023-07-21 13:21:07
tough to beat the sheet horror of the nuclear scenes in t2 or the day after,2023-07-22 05:11:30
how about habitable for apes,2023-07-22 21:06:05
good point,2023-07-21 13:26:12

yes those bombs are bigger but theres actual footage of the trinity test out there and it fails to live up to that as well",2023-08-11 04:29:12

films have def conditioned people to see big boom hear big boom when in reality theres a lag time same way space combat has sound in most film or tv when it would be silent in reality one of the reasons the expanse was such a breath of fresh air,2023-07-21 03:28:53
molecules are closer togethertighter bonded so it takes them less time to transmit sound to each other,2023-07-21 03:42:56
truman surrounded himself with experts yet excoriated the usa’s top nuclear scientist because the guy had extreme reservations about the use of nuclear weapons seems like a big character flaw of truman’s if that really was the case,2023-07-30 13:24:54

same the teeth gave it away for me lol,2023-07-22 06:36:18
i was wondering about the accuracy of the scene are there any sources,2023-07-23 20:18:49
it may have happened but the scene lacked execution and stuck out like a sore thumb from the rest of the movie,2023-07-22 17:53:15
three massive amounts of kenergy involved,2023-07-22 15:25:20
one is about existential dread and anxiety the other is oppenheimer,2023-07-22 04:44:02
thats life baby,2023-07-26 07:05:11
tbf he’s the vehicle for the reveal of the twist in the 3rd act a very memorable part of the movie,2023-07-21 09:26:48
this movie is for historical drama actors what the expendables was for action movie actors,2023-07-21 12:54:32
weirdly enough nolan cast three consecutive best actor winners 20162018 in bit parts casey affleck gary oldman and rami malek quite a flex haha,2023-07-21 20:49:07
main actor of what i personally consider the greatest tv show off the past 20 years,2023-07-22 04:14:33
devon bostick is in like 3 scenes and the most notable thing is him vomiting crazy hot huge the cast is,2023-07-21 23:34:23
i nearly came out of my seat when i saw josh peck was not expecting him,2023-07-23 00:47:57
haha pretty much his vibe he was excellent in the show mr robot where he plays a social anxiety filled depressed paranoid computer hacker theres more but that would go into spoilers he also won an oscar portraying some would say badly freddie mercury and his most recent biggest role of note was the villain in no time to die the last bond movie i dig him as an actor but its interesting he took a role with such limited screen time although he obviously gets a huge scene in the last 20 minutes,2023-07-22 23:20:04
he was there to play bongos,2023-07-23 10:46:19
once youve seen it and realize its more akin to something like spielbergs lincoln you really appreciate the relatively breakneck pacing,2023-07-21 15:29:18

the score playing throughout almost the entire movie helps push along the pacing,2023-07-24 02:41:04
i dont know if it was just memy theater but i couldnt hearunderstand a bunch of the dialogue throughout the movie,2023-07-21 08:56:58
same at the beginning i was caught off guard with all the time jumping but i think its supposed to be overwhelming,2023-07-21 09:01:01
"just came out of the cinema and im 100 with you 10 for its technical 7 from a narrative as the first hour was kinda hard to follow with so many characters appearing for the sake of the story and their role

the ending had me in tears it was worth the whole 3 hours and will be watching it again very soon",2023-07-21 04:50:27
i agree with you there should have been 1520 minutes more to let the information heavy dialogue and incessant character namedropping breathe one should read up some stuff before watching for better enjoyment 910,2023-07-21 09:06:26

"einstein was renowned for his development of special and general relativity as well as other developments in statistical mechanics and the photoelectric effect while his paper on the photoelectric effect was important to the development of quantum mechanics it took him awhile to accept the conclusions of later developments in qm as the theory became more developed thus for awhile in the 30s and 40s he was seen as being behind the times

its also perhaps worth mentioning that his political views and in particular his critique of capitalism did not endear him to the us government so some of his diminished reputation may have been retaliatory",2023-07-24 15:07:24
"look up the einsteinbohr debates 

basically einstein heavily criticized what has come to be known as the copenhagen interpretation of quantum physicists that neil bohr and most physicists took as the conclusive interpretation of reality this was taken by the younger scientists as a sign that einstein himself had become outdated and out of touch with their modern sensibilities and ci became the leading theory for the next sixty or so years 

in the last twenty or so years however there has been a lot more criticism of the ci now that the original young scientists of that era are now old men and dying off and a new appreciation for einsteins criticism it also helps that several additional theories of einstein which were nonprovable with the technology of the time have now proven correct especially regarding black holes and gravity waves",2023-07-24 18:52:26

also the german actor playing heisenberg is like known in germany but you wouldnt think he would star in such a movie seeing him in a nolan film with that cast around him felt like i seeing a guy i went to school with having  with margot robbie like „no way he pulled that off“,2023-07-21 13:51:06
america knows the other heisenberg,2023-07-21 08:05:57
and neils bohr there was whole highschool chemistry chapter’s about him,2023-07-22 22:38:26
heisenberg didnt have an iconic look like einstein did,2023-07-21 12:42:22
i cannot tell you how bad i was hoping for bryan cranston to appear but i realize nolan would likely never do something like that in a film like this just too distracting,2023-07-22 08:00:23
niels bohr and enrico fermi at every well known bohr is atleast a supporting character enrico fermi is just there lol,2023-07-23 05:50:17

probably not after this film people who know both from physics or history know them already and wider audiences learn from pop culture,2023-07-25 17:59:31
they mentioned jfk might’ve as well mentioned monroe too lol,2023-07-22 08:45:48
see even i’m a part of the problem i can’t imagine marie curie and einstein together without thinking of it as a crossover episode of sorts but i didn’t know that,2023-07-26 08:39:04
"j edgar hoover was also mentioned several times in passing 
he could be revealed as the big bad in a 3rd movie",2023-09-18 15:38:42
weirdly enough though the time skips worked a lot better in this than in dunkirk the last nolan movie i saw,2023-07-22 17:41:57
okay that makes sense after the trailer came out there were rumours that the black and white scenes would be the time after trinity test but as i saw the film it didn’t make any sense so i was confused,2023-07-21 09:01:32
i also think it has to do with 1fission and 2fushion color representing the atom bomb era and black and white the subsequenth bomb era,2023-07-24 22:40:38
i think black and white is all strauss he is on all those scenes and he is basically the lead of the black and white film,2023-07-25 18:05:17

they didnt put it in the movie but oppie went to a summer camp one year as a kid and a bunch of the other boys got together stripped him  painted his butt and genitals with green paint beat him up and left him in an outhouse over night,2023-07-21 15:00:17

they did though i heard it as they were shutting the door,2023-07-21 04:10:42
that’s the line i wanted to hear,2023-07-29 01:01:40
"when you contextualize this with the fact that truman only became president after fdr died it makes the scene even more interesting i think trumans reaction has more to do with free will and determinism as it does personal responsibility and duty

truman wasnt supposed to be president but when fdr died he was called up and ended up being the one to have to make the choice about dropping the atomic bomb i get the sense that he thought of this as him assuming his duty — even if it came with a tremendous amount of guilt

oppenheimer also assumed his duty and was initially passionate about serving his country and beating the nazis when the target changed oppenheimer began to change

truman and oppenheimer are kind of similar in this way only truman reacted as a man whilst oppenheimer reacted as a cry baby i think thats what annoyed truman so much about him and why he cut the meeting short

perhaps he was hoping to meet with someone who he could share his sense of masculinity and duty with but instead he got someone who was riddled with guilt and shame something with which truman could not relate to",2023-07-24 18:43:30
it’s borderline narcissistic for oppenheimer to have felt the responsibility fell solely on him,2023-07-21 13:49:39
does it it could be that truman wanted to bury his own guilt deep down and oppenheimer put a mirror up to trumans feelings in a public setting so truman reacted with anger and immediately ended the meeting so he didnt have to reveal his true emotions about it were talking about my grandpas generation here men back then did not often reveal their emotional vulnerability publicly scratch that they still dont,2023-07-22 04:31:58
thats one of the parts of the movie that sticks with you once the process is in motion it takes on the feel of a slowly moving freight train no one is really making decisions oppie says to ravi that they have no choice and its literally true you 100 have to stop the nazis from getting the bomb first there is no choice to be made,2023-07-21 14:59:04
i mean i think that makes a lot of sense we have decades of discussion about nuclear weapons their morality an entire arms race concerns about radiation poisoning etc but back then it was just a new type of weapon cities were already being leveled by air raids during the war  what difference did it make if it takes a thousand bombs or a single one,2023-07-21 20:57:56
as opposed to the alternative which was an invasion of japan i think he preferred the bomb,2023-07-21 09:09:48
"nobody in america knew what the japanese were thinking or what the soviets were thinking a lot of this is just benefit of hindsight all truman knew was that the japanese fought tooth and nail on every island in the pacific so far they didnt surrender after tens of thousands of civilians perished in tokyo so they likely wouldnt surrender if tens of thousands more died in a last ditch defense of the home islands and that if the invasion of japan was just as bloody as okinawa it would be a slaughter on both sides the atomic bomb was an attempt at shocking the japanese into surrender they didnt scrap the plans for a land invasion if it came to that and there was no guarantee that the japanese would surrender even after two atom bombs

even with modern social media twitter telegram and more we still struggle to understand what putin and the decision makers in russia are really thinking",2023-07-22 04:36:06
this simply isnt true historically the movie attempts to capture how people thought at that time japan was a blackbox we didnt know what they were thinking bc they didnt allow people to have access to that we assumed they wouldnt surrender and lets remember when the emperor tried to surrender there was an attempted coup against him the japanese even said a complete victory or they would die fighting its a common misunderstanding that japan was about to surrender,2023-07-22 02:14:47
the soviets didn’t get a bomb until 1949 and even that was mostly stolen from the us thanks to the communist spies in los alamos it was hardly a race,2023-08-05 16:29:26

bongos playing pranks on guards cracking safes for fun coulda done something with him he plays bongos but i never even thought oh thats feynman even though i know a ton about him including his bongos he was just a random extra basically so i didnt even think about it,2023-07-23 17:34:21
i may be wrong but gödel is a mathematician  logician not a physicist and there is no nobel price for mathematics,2023-07-25 11:53:10
yeah i’m still arguing with myself  it’s people who died horribly decades ago and we shouldn’t need to parade them to be like ‘look how terrible’ but is also is literally the point of what he’s consuming is how specifically awful the fallout was i would be curious to hear the thinking behind it,2023-07-23 21:40:54
the real cost we all feel every day the zeitgeist of nuclear anxiety the ever present sword of damocles hanging over us that deep down we all know will fall some day,2023-07-24 06:21:27
no he 100 called him a cry baby,2023-07-21 18:08:50
you didnt know it was rdj i didnt know he was in it before i saw it but as soon as he popped up i just thought iron man,2023-07-28 03:17:45
i see the problem,2023-07-21 20:43:59
just want to add to this that in american prometheus there was a man by the name of robert wilson who until the test was a believer in what they were doing he is one of the few that was very guiltridden after the successful test i believe the author went as far to state that he was physically ill over what had occurred,2023-07-21 17:19:53
i chalked it up to radiation poisoning of victims of the bombs hmmm,2023-07-22 03:07:50
"i think there’s a video of oppenheimer saying after the bomb was announced that “a few people laughed a few people cried most people were silent” 

i think that’s what nolan was referencing",2023-07-22 07:45:27
and the people making out under the stairs like oh excitement lets bang its like that video of a dog and his owner playing getting all excited dog proceeds to pretends to fall over only to steal a bite of a piece of cake,2023-07-22 00:01:31
"interstellarinception wins out for me and i agree with your opinion on dunkirk

still… oppenheimer might be nolan’s best film i  loved it and i’m a huge interstellar fanboy",2023-07-21 04:55:15
i’ve not rewatched dunkirk since i saw it in imax in 2017 but it was a magical experience i don’t know if it plays right at home,2023-07-21 06:49:46
i watched dunkirk in theaters and still feel like it was rather uninteresting,2023-07-21 09:18:09
no oppenheimer is kind of known for being pretty bad at doing math accurately and a bit of an overconfident  thats why he responded your math is better than mine when the student was confused why he told him to study his own theory rather than having opp do it,2023-07-24 17:30:40
"my apologies in my field the strong force is usually referred to as the color force i just meant strong as an adjective which i see now is really confusing so i edited my previous comment

yes you are right the fundamental force behind it is electromagnetism but it isn’t friction but rather the pauli exclusion principle that prevents the atoms from interacting since electrons form an electron cloud around their nucleus other atoms cannot occupy the same quantum state simultaneously because they share the same spin value this will create friction in the end but that is the effect not the cause

funnily enough the force that governs nuclear decay is actually the weak force the strong force binds quarks together and also creates new ones if there is sufficient energy",2023-07-22 19:59:46
"you need to take differential equations multivariable calculus and linear algebra to understand the “relatively simple” braket notation introduced by paul dirac 

if you want to understand the forefront of theoretical physics that oppenheimer was working on at the time you need a much more rigorous understanding of hilbert spaces which involves real and advanced analysis courses that are generally only for graduate students or mathematics majors",2023-07-25 01:50:55
agree with your comment but man kaku and green are hacks let’s not group these popsci losers in with the greats ,2023-07-23 12:18:11
"my favorite part is when he looked into the camera and said

“it’s oppin time”",2023-07-30 10:07:58
both sound jumpscares worked for me scared the  out of me both times,2023-07-22 16:41:27
i feel like that bypasses my point a bit i’m not saying the explosion needed to be the ending but i definitely felt more invested in the project and how oppenheimer dealt with it psychologically than the story about his reputation again i think every portion of the movie is well done and the themes on self importance were intriguing but it wasn’t a linear story structure and i feel like it may have been better served having the resolution after the bomb feel a bit tighter just how i felt watching it,2023-07-24 15:48:42
wipes uranium foam on passing piece of pie,2023-07-30 22:17:31
yeah i can not argue more with that statement you are very right a lot of the film is purposeful and yeah if nolan was trying to hint that it was jean who he felt a spark and she was the actual love of his life and wanted to share that moment with her instead of his wife it kinda makes sense but as a south asian person whose british i am not even that religious but it definitely was icky and could have been much better handled,2023-08-01 23:25:04
tbh i think it was nolan making trinity test a  thing by implication,2023-08-03 02:20:11
it was the silence then sudden audio that wowd me,2023-07-23 22:12:28
"just seen it and sadly i have to agree i had the exact same problem with dunkirk where his insistence on using practical effects only meant that the film looked absolutely nothing like how the battle of dunkirk looked where was the aa fire blackening the sky where were the armada of ships the hundreds of thousands of me the burning town and docks behind them

the trinity test worked a little better in oppenheimer but it still did not look much like the real trinity test however i did like his use of silence and the flash before the shockwave hit it did not have half the impact of the same event as shown in that astonishing episode of twin peaks the return",2023-07-23 22:19:33
i agree but i he achieved that early image of the blast going off in oppie’s mind and it was incredible i was hoping to see more of that footage but was very let down when it was only a small fire ball,2023-07-31 05:21:48
"are you talking about this scene



it just seems so comical to me with the immediate explosion and the lips moving around lol",2023-07-23 21:47:25
"yeah i think my ultimate takeaway wasn’t a particular political viewpoint although it is definitely nolan’s most political movie and was way more sympathetic to the left than i ever expected from him so much as it was “humanity is intrinsically flawed and should not have this power”

which is honestly pretty surprising from a guy that made a relatively uncriticaloftheconcept batman trilogy",2023-07-21 20:18:40
i think the movie pretty quickly took mccarthyism is bad as a given so that it could then play more shades of gray,2023-07-21 05:36:19
is there anyone even the most conservative republicans who defend mccarthyism to this day feels pretty unambiguously and universally disliked,2023-07-21 07:16:02
i took it as government bureaucracy is inherently  idiotic at best the us military is the most communist organization in existence and can only operate because of the massive budgetwaste that exists,2023-07-21 06:03:45
he was a complete  to oppenheimer on the false notion that oppenheimer was being a complete  to him which speaks to his character in a very different way,2023-07-21 07:17:48
they also kind of did a disservice to truman cuz truman was the one who ultimately pulled the trigger on the bomb and likely felt all the responsibility of their deaths and was right to call oppenheimer out on it the film just emotionally played it differently though making truman seem unsympathetic to what he had done,2023-07-22 07:10:25
that’s the funniest thing going by the making of the atomic bomb he barely noticed the occurrence of the depression it took the spanish civil war to make him aware of the existence of the external world,2023-07-23 01:00:19
"there’s this reddit trend where movie scenes are labeled “unnecessary” if they don’t directly move the plot forward it’s lame 

that scene is great emotionally evocative fleshes put a major character works to build this stylistic vision nolan’s working towards etc",2023-07-22 16:08:44
you could argue that about a lot of the dialogue though it shows a bit about his and her character and the nature of their relationship and how intense it is plus the scene with kitty specifically shows her spiralling,2023-07-22 14:16:24
release the ap history class cut,2023-07-23 15:40:44
i don’t think that it’s meant to be a deep movie i think that nolan is just trying to convey the many different threads of oppenheimer’s thinking as they occur to him in real time i agree that there’s no need to stan for nolan just off of his name alone but the rushed jerky nature of some of these elements to me were more about oppenheimer’s uneasy mental state than poor execution i will say that the shoehorning of the mysticism and more humanities driven elements were a lot clumsier,2023-07-22 15:16:36

"its the callous cruelty of it that makes it horrifying 

the idea that deciding not to blow up one of their more important cities as nice gesture for the japanese people while casually planning the  of hundreds of thousands of civilians is evil

its like deciding not to mess up your face while i plan to i break your kneecaps with the impersonal coldness of a ceo deciding that not enough people have died yet to make a product recall worth the cost

hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians have to die obviously but not these ones i went there once and it was nice is an evil thing",2023-07-24 23:51:05
i’m aware he was serious but he said it with a smile and a laugh in the film…,2023-07-25 19:37:34
apparently its factual that strauss went by the americanized pronunciation of his name and insisted on it supposedly because he was also proud of being a southern american and thats how people in virginia pronounced it this explanation seems to conflict less with how he was also very open about being jewish,2023-07-24 15:34:36
i’m not sure he was actually on time magazine tho so,2023-07-21 21:22:35
i think the fame was actually fairly accurate weirdly i don’t think the film even fully captured his intelligence there’s a handful of nobel prize winners that consider him the smartest man to have ever lived,2023-07-22 15:56:20
agnostic jews are like half of all jews,2023-07-25 07:49:39
judaism is an ethnicity and a culture more than a religion nowadays more than 50 of living jews are agnostic or atheist religiously but are still culturally and ethnically jews einstein was proud of his jewish heritage and culture by all accounts,2023-07-25 09:37:20
i feel like if oppenheimer actually didn’t care he wouldn’t have asked the dude next to him to secretly look and relay to him how strauss was reacting the movie definitely showed the humiliation to be at least partially purposeful,2023-08-03 17:24:50
"i think that strauss’s main motivation being a petty and selfish one makes it all the more telling that they are all grappling with something they don’t comprehend or appreciate these are the people that the scientists gave the bomb too people who sabotage and scheme because they were embarrassed people who decide that a city should be spared because it was a nice vacation spot

petty personal reasons and grievances",2023-07-25 15:40:53
yea by the end it all made the sense and the final scene was amazing i was just scratching my head about what was happening in the black n white scenes,2023-07-21 06:06:05
wow ain’t this some damning   i don’t think i’ve ever heard this take care to explain why you feel this way about his work i’m just curious and you may have a point idk  art is subjective,2023-08-02 02:50:29

i was really looking forward to this i made the decision that it was bad all on my own probably because i have eyes and ears and a brain,2024-01-30 23:24:21
 and nudity was handled amazingly in this movie really impressed by it one example is the scene with murphy and pugh  sitting opposite pugh is topless yet her toplessness has nothing to do with the framing of the shots it was framed exactly like it would be if she was not  same with murphy i dont really have the wordsknowledge to describe it but it was very desexualizing i can imagine that the actors felt pretty comfortable,2023-07-21 02:42:15
"she wants to be taken seriously shes been incredible from the jump and happens to have a well paying side gig in the mcu 

her scream in the beginning of midsommer will forever haunt me",2023-07-21 06:33:07
my initial instinct was that it was a composite shot but i could def be wrong i don’t really have an eye for that but i just assumed they didn’t ask pugh and murphy to be  simulating  in front of a room of their costars lol,2023-07-22 03:50:49
it’s fine there’s a  scene at the start that’s like maybe fifteen seconds and this scene is probably about the same as well and the latter is more uncomfortable in terms of the surrounding context rather than ,2023-07-22 14:12:03
nolan told her to just imagine emily blunt as olivia wilde,2023-07-21 03:49:59
florence pugh portrayed jean tatlock,2023-07-21 02:43:24
short for florence pugh i believe the nickname “flo” was infamously coined by olivia wilde in a released text video from shia lebeouf that painted olivia wilde in a pretty bad light,2023-07-23 12:46:24
oh i couldn’t tell you sorry,2023-07-23 02:30:46
well unfortunately for you richard feynman really did just sit behind a windscreen to watch the explosion and he didnt appear to suffer any permanent effects he also did spend all his free time playing the bongos its a biopic not the  avengers,2023-07-23 17:52:47
as an avid initial defender of tenet to my friends i had to explain this nolan does a meh job of saying dont try to understand it feel it he doesnt know how to describe it explicitly for people whove never done it thats how i realized that tenet was for me people who need to watch it with subtitles didnt get that the dialogue itself wasnt important the emotion displayed was,2023-07-21 12:17:40
yeah its tantalizing for me but ive been burned too many times lol,2023-07-21 04:09:14
"1 because i wanted to see what people had to say about the movie im still interested in his films mostly 

2 i wasnt aware i was not allowed to participate please let me know anywhere else im not allowed to express an opinion",2023-07-21 06:06:19
mahomes,2023-07-21 03:03:59
which is why like you said it doesn’t matter they did explain how things work but because most people have a hard time comprehending it they feel like it wasn’t there if they went into it anymore it would have been boring,2024-01-07 11:12:58
yes i feel the same there were so many great components but the end result is not as good as it could have been,2023-08-04 14:18:57
yes i feel the same there were so many great components but the end result is not as good as it could have been,2023-08-04 15:24:21
it’s not that’s where i just saw it and traveled quite a bit to get there,2023-07-21 13:16:06
"yeah we’ll see having read kotfm not sure i see enough in it for leo to win but obviously the movie role may be different 

this was 3 hrs of cillian just straight up killing it hope he wins",2023-07-25 13:44:14
"nah i thought it was mixed it up with dune 2 entirely filmed for imax 
the only two movies recently that i knew i had to see on the big big screen",2023-08-03 17:40:52
makes sense i thought you were confusing 65mm film and imax film from what i remember of the movie i’d say maybe 40 of the movie was shot with imax cameras the rest with 65mm film,2023-08-03 18:45:13
if you read american prometheus right before watching the movie all those sections are very easy to follow but i understand they might be pretty confusing otherwise,2023-10-03 02:18:56
maybe it was the theater i saw it in boeing imax but it was  fine for me the dialog never seemed to get drowned out unless it was the intention like when hes giving the speech after japan surrendered and all the feet are stomping,2023-08-28 07:00:08
yep my ears hurt and i feel i still have a bit of a headache from the imax will prob not do again lol,2023-08-06 23:34:41
haven’t seen the film yet but ugh that’s annoying hate how loud theaters can get i rmemebe blade runner 2049 was unnecessarily loud too,2023-07-21 15:19:32
honestly not sure if my theater was tuned better but this was first time i didnt feel the movie was loud there was a lot of places with rumbling bass but nothing super loud except for maybe few seconds,2023-07-21 20:03:34
no,2023-07-21 15:21:30
yes but unless its a 70mm imax youre still getting a cropped version thats why nolan recommends seeing it in 70mm imax  70mm nonimax  imax laser  imax regular,2023-07-21 20:50:58
"there’s literally a quote from his wife in the movie where she said “you don’t get to commit a sin and have us feel sorry for you”

if anything that’s an explicit condemnation of his actions plus the real oppenheimer became a firm advocate for nuclear disarmament so he clearly regretted his involvement in the manhattan project",2023-07-23 14:57:11
"eh personal pique seemed to be foremost in his mind up to the very end   
his very last lines are about oppenheimer as a person and in particular the einstein incident hence it segued into being the final scene of the film as a whole with anything about the hydrogen bomb a distant second at best",2023-07-23 20:27:19
to use your somewhat flawed analogy itd be more along the lines of complimenting a human for running a marathon when they couldve ridden a bike,2023-07-24 00:40:45
na i dont get pressed by clowns that are fans of dead soundcloud rappers lol ,2023-07-24 00:33:26
one thing for certain a home experience will never do this movie justice the dramatic score and sounds play a significant role  when that test bomb dropped i was totally ready to muffle my ears and they tricked me very well done,2023-07-24 23:44:37
its meaning communisms inception,2023-08-02 19:35:01
it’s not banned by japan it is the hollywood not releasing the film,2023-11-05 01:30:51
"it’s like a basic human right to know is deprived only from the japanese people it is a censorship of information like communism countries don’t let citizens know things that have been happening from the war era to still today in “democratic” countries also if it’s something they can’t show to the victims of the bomb or a whole country why they’re showing to the world they intentionally made the film to be not universally acceptable and very biased avoid any criticism but still present this as a 5 starred universally accepted film that illustrates a significant part of a human history and it is forever printed that way in a human history and no one ever question about it it is portrayed as heroic when there’s nothing peaceful about a war or weapons it is very immoral it is dangerously influential how the world might view such sensitive topics of a nuclear weapon and a war it is very easy to motivate or brainwash people to a war because they cherrypick only the part of a history as a propaganda dismissing the long whole history a hidden background or an equal human right

people who take this very lightly was never involved in such an event nor was a victim any human life shouldn’t be taken lightly or neglected the heavy weight of sadness and sufferings of victims from the nuclear weapons is nothing oppenheimer could ever imagine emotionally which is not about winninglosing in a war",2023-11-11 00:02:35
"my brother is a physicist i studied philosophy and eventually became a filmmaker so you can only imagine how much i love this film

i recall a conversation between my brother a physicist my dad a politician and myself a philosophy student at that time

my brother joked about philosophy being frivolous my dad responded dont forget how many wars have been started over philosophy my brother responded and dont forget how many wars have been ended by physicists

oppenheimer explores where physics politics and philosophy intersect i think it did a good job of it",2023-08-01 03:48:07
you could say that about almost any movie in existence lol but to say a movie like this is going to hurt cinema is crazy to me,2023-07-28 01:45:50
except that it made a  ton of money for a 3 hour rated r biopic,2023-07-28 03:47:15
ok well i respect your opinion,2023-07-28 01:55:17
yes me too i’m going to be booking tickets as soon as they’re released,2023-08-04 11:56:24
"i dont know if i am smarter than you but i was taking this conversation more seriously than you apparently are

good day and i hope you find the films best suited for your taste",2023-08-06 12:05:04
moonlight is genuinely good lala land legitimately would have been the bait choice because its about the  industry lol,2023-07-21 12:47:39
bro thinks he’s evil dead 2 ,2023-07-21 07:09:52
in my opinion the european theatre of ww2 is much more talked about in america than the pacific i think general knowledge of us nuking japan beyond “it made them surrender” is pretty surface level in air force basic training we were taught the reason we did it is because if we didn’t japan would literally never give up fighting i don’t totally disagree with that war is  loselose situation no matter what,2023-07-21 19:54:45
yes imperial japan started the war with the us and physicists many of whom were exiled by the fascists helped end it,2023-07-22 00:51:58
it should be about a documentary about the lead characters development of the most famous bomb in history not him  florence and worrying about security clearance snooze,2023-07-24 01:50:31
theres very little evidence the stimsons honeymooned in kyoto and no evidence to suggest thats why it was spared bombing its a pop history factoid that gets repeated so often most people just take it as fact,2023-07-21 18:26:29
i would argue that is the same reason the hiroshima and nagasaki bombings were never shown on screen oppenheimer wasnt there to see it its intentional meant to be isolating and unsatisfying how little time you get with truman and how far away the bombs dropped on japan felt oppy was also not there for any of trumans more redeeming moments theres no way to fit truman in except maybe in a seen involving straus,2023-08-15 23:41:26
the encounter happened very much as it was recorded in real life why should the movie make trumans dismissal of the crybaby scientist any more noble extraordinary or powerful when it wasnt any of these things,2023-08-11 15:34:38
"oh for sure i kinda wish we’d gotten a cg version of the nuke itself 

the wobbly stuff as you say are some of my favorite shots for what it’s worth i hope they are practical nolan has a couple interviews talking about getting close up shots for that stuff",2023-07-29 01:06:42
"im dutch and it absolutely did not sound dutch we were laughing in the cinema like was that supposed to be dutch

to me it sounded more german but if german people say it isnt german either its probably pseudodutchgerman or whatever you want to call it 

still they could have done a better job i think by learning an actual dutch sentence or two instead of this gibberish",2023-08-17 20:43:32
i think he thought screening was screaming,2023-07-25 01:42:14
definitely read screening was screaming,2023-07-25 14:11:03
"wait you just reminded me that nolan did batman my mind is blown lol i forgot about that

and yeap i havent bothered with titanic or avatar 1 or 2 as of yet just somehow skimmed by it yet got caught on oppenheimer hype",2023-08-22 01:50:36
i mean yeah there’s a reason people were joking that tenet seemed like self parody he has a style that doesn’t work for everyone,2023-08-16 22:00:51
blame the cinema for maybe having uncomfortable seats not how long the movie is,2023-07-23 10:38:57
that medal is what the modern equivalent of sloppy seconds would be in a way,2023-07-21 15:34:15
einstein literally says the point for giving the medals is not for oppenheimer himself but to make themselves the government feel better for how they treated him during the whole trial a whole sheepish and useless “yeah sorry about that here’s a cookie”,2023-07-22 00:33:24
people went to watch a movie about an atomic bomb and his inventor not about politics,2023-07-21 12:11:15
then you are not aware of how horrific the japanese were to the peoples of these countries during the war and how they have never really apologized for their crimes,2023-07-22 04:35:12
"the list can just go on

josh hartnett josh peck matthew modine tom goodwyn kenneth branagh tom conti dane dehaan david dastmalchian alden ehrenreich david krumholtz aka bernard from santa clause gary oldman etc 

and lastly casey affleck was absolutely terrifying in the short scenes he was in",2023-07-23 03:40:38
yeah i read that as “washed” i didn’t see that it said wasted oops,2023-07-23 04:03:48
it was about the man that made it not a 3 hour long sequence of the detonation,2023-07-27 10:25:14
it was about the life of a man who worked on the project and not ever meant to be an action movie but i’m sorry you didn’t get to see more people being vaporized by an atom bomb ,2023-07-27 09:29:47
"you don’t think it would be a little tasteless and grotesque to make an englishlanguage dark comedy about a bomb that killed 220000 japanese civilians given north america’s history with internment camps realistically how do you think that’s gonna go 


maybe certain things need to be treated with respect and not be turned out in service of  americans who want more ‘splosions",2023-07-27 07:21:02
"thats not how it ended 

einstein was talking about how they may eventually forgive him but it wouldnt be for him it would be for them it cuts to oppenheimer being old and receiving the enrico fermi award and showing people who spoke against him in the security hearings acting friendly towards him

but the movie ends with oppenheimer saying to einstein that their theory that the atomic bomb would engulf and inflame the entire world that he believes they actually succeeded meaning not that the bomb literally engulfed the world but that the power in the hands of humans would eventually lead to its destruction thats how it ended

and also this isnt a documentary its a biographical film and rarely do they show the actual person in at the end of those types of movies",2023-08-20 17:35:39
"the apple scene while perhaps exaggerated certainly occurred

",2023-08-20 16:12:53
i dont think you understand obviously showing math formulas and equations would not be good storytelling but showing them do experiments or show them argue over issues would have been very fitting filmmaking has many tools to show conflict without explicitly giving away the science,2023-07-24 20:19:08
"well oppenheimer didnt have anything to do with those parts of the manhattan project at all his sole domain was the scientists in charge of creating the bomb itself

ps  they werent in the midwest at all hanford was in washington and oak ridge in tn",2023-07-24 21:41:17
did i ask for action or explosions you seem to be projecting hard i specifically highlighted in my comment what i was interested in and none of it was asking for more action please read it again if you have trouble understanding it some random beef is not interesting its like making a movie about  but 80 of the movie of focused on him being a vegetarian surely there is something more important at play here,2023-07-24 21:00:27
really tired of this everybody who didnt rate this movie a 1010 is a marvel fan take,2023-07-25 15:09:32
"strauss made him pay for his opposition

i dont remember this part at all are you sure this was in the movie i think the movie made it very clearly strauss had a beef with him due to oppenheimer humiliating him in a hearing about exporting nuclear weapons or something its rather telling how meaningless the conflict was that i barely recall the details  


i think the atomic bomb should have been a much bigger plot point than some chairman quarrel that ultimately had little consequence",2023-07-24 22:18:26
i agree at the very least i wish someone else handled the screenplay to make the tones of thd movie match,2023-07-23 06:35:16

fire bombings are terrible but an atom bomb is on a whole other level of terror",2023-08-03 11:35:36

don’t be embarrassed at all barbie was excellent,2023-07-24 01:16:08
same,2023-07-24 01:50:27
the trailer was clever and funny most of the movie was not,2023-07-23 23:23:49
"just call it what it is it was a bait and switch

barbie wouldnt be doing nearly this well if people had known the true purpose of the film the entire theme of it being kept under wraps wasnt an artistic decision it was a marketing one",2023-07-24 02:34:04
i dont care about woke i just thought it was kinda boring whenever the kens were offscreen  i thought the realworld storyplot was  and the mattel executives were utterly pointless too much didnt make any sense  including how they ended up with things in barbieland dont want to say too much more for people who might not have seen it  i loved each millisecond ryan gosling was onscreen but i think its unfortunate barbie had every scene stolen from her in her own movie  his arc was a million times better than hers  i enjoyed the first 1015 minutes of the movie and all the ken stuff i did think it was way too heavyhanded with the literal preaching at some points but meh i didnt hate the movie and certainly wouldnt discourage anyone from seeing it  but i was really really excited for this movie and then left rather deflated,2023-07-23 23:39:11
fair enough i came looking for reviews within minutes of ending the film last night one thing i know and love about virtually all of nolans films is that they are almost always better on 2nd watch kind of get better with each rewatch,2023-11-28 21:25:03
isnt the whole point of the movie that trinity was a catastrophe and a much much bigger one than titanic where in comparison an almost insignificant amount of people died the titanic didnt even have any lasting consequences outside of it,2023-07-25 10:07:56
but oppenheimer didn’t lose his mind if you check interviews with him let’s say from the sixties where he tackles hard questions he always gives subtle answers just like teller for example these guys were scientist not politicians maybe if you’d delve into truman’s mind a more monstrous imagery would be needed what i’m saying that the subtle approach even it seems cheap fits well with the character’s enigmatic and complex personality it cannot be flat out devastating but an inner fight of troubled conscience,2023-07-25 09:38:58
absolutely it was a great scene the build up the reactions loved it just the explosion itself was a let down because i knew for a fact i wasnt looking at anything resembling a nuclear explosion so it was a bit of my nerd brain just being picky,2023-12-25 19:20:53
"id argue the opposite i think he’s immensely interesting

here is a man who on the forefront of quite a few areas in physics such as black hole theory pre ww2 then having his whole life consumed with the atomic bomb via manhattan project and beyond

a man who was able to assemble the better part of the most influential physicists and chemists and biologists to one site for the war effort whose decision to house trinity was bases on his own personal affiliation with the los alamos region

a man who had significant communist ties sure like others but was the figure head of the atomic project other scientists were involved but he was like the steve jobs of the manhattan project in a way the public face of it all after the fact 

a man who then had intense regret as to how the hiroshima and nagasaki bombings werent the end rather the beginning a man who tried to advocate against hydrogen bomb creation and testing but then was torn down by his own government for that  only to have some partial salvation near the end of his life 

at the end of the day he was the face of the atomic bombs for better or worse and someone who is both so multifaceted and yet by sources difficult to also read makes for a very interesting character that leads to many philosophical discussions",2023-07-29 04:52:58
"mate the only pseudointellectual here is you youre talking in vague platitudes about the bomb being masterful is there any word more up my own  than masterful people who didnt like it didnt like it because it was wrong and disappointing a pseudointellectual wannabe movie critic take is valuing a visual effect being practical over it being good or fitting for what the film promised

its hilarious that you think some close up shots of plumes of fire are just so masterful nolan really knows his audience i guess at least youre all on the same page about not having a basic understanding of women

group of people  that they didnt explain things well enough and another group saying there was too much handholding

its almost as if some parts can feel overly handholding and other parts can feel underexplained to some people and depending on the parts that can cause different reactions in people and different people can have different opinions about the same parts

most people here understand that but you seemingly dont you for some reason felt the need to turn someones plain old thoughts on the movie into something for you to ridicule and mock the takes you decided to attack were so boring and bog standard for a nolan film too you must truly be the utmost level of fanboy or just a generally sad person

edit to be clear its fine to have loved everything about the movie its also fine to have hated it its rarely fine to be a  about it",2023-07-22 04:01:00
no one has to imagine what it might look like theres actual footage of it,2023-07-22 16:40:08
i don’t know if showing a more accurate depiction of the actual bomb counts as “war ” but sure if that makes you feel better about my minor criticism of the film go for it,2023-07-22 18:27:07
i argued about this with someone for several comments last night and earlier today,2023-07-22 20:16:04
i guess i need to rewatch lol,2023-07-23 20:15:41
this scene happens fairly late in the movie the primary reason for the confusion of this film is the nonlinearity of the timeline,2023-07-23 22:57:53
"nothing was hard to follow in this movie tbh especially considerint some past nolan flicks 

think the pacing and structure was incredibly intentional to reflect the character too",2023-07-24 02:05:35
what narrative are you talking about the movie is about oppenheimer’s life,2023-07-24 01:57:23
the films not called oppenheimers bomb though,2023-07-27 18:43:02
"because of course seeing a picture of something is exactly the same as being there

also there was a scene in the film where oppenheimer sees images of the destruction and aftermath wreaked by his bombs the images themselves arent shown on screen but again i dont think they really needed to be  the focus is on how oppenheimer reacts to it and its assumed that the audience is familiar anyway

its a character study biopic about the man j robert oppenheimer not a project manhattan history lesson",2023-07-27 20:34:25
i thought the gym scene was way more impactful than seeing the bomb go off another time,2023-07-27 22:18:23
according to her wikipedia she believed she was a lesbian and people believe that because her struggles with sexuality her depression worsened and this was a cause for her suicide she just seemed to have an interesting life and its a shame she was reduced to just nudity in the film,2023-08-09 13:37:42
i think the point of two was to make it clear that the us has more than one of these insane weapons and was more than willing to keep dropping them until an unconditional surrender two showed they had developed multiples of the weapon — in hopes it would sway them to surrender,2023-07-25 02:25:48

if palestinian don’t deserve to live in israel because us says it was originally jewish people’s land why do you still deserve to live in america

you mean europeans colonized the world over 500 years and japan needed to be stopped after a few years where us directed and tricked everyone into doing so

many things mentioned are on the textbooks government records etc as well samurai period japan’s isolation western threats black boat and treaties militarization  and other wars wwii aid raid casualties etc and i added extra links japanese people knows the history in japan if you say the “national isolation of japan” didn’t happen it’s like you’re saying the sun doesn’t exist you just don’t know absolutely nothing simple stupidity and whatever is better than the “textbooks” “tv shows” “oppenheimer” or your  movies you watch  the source of information the gov owns or buys is reliable and i’m 10000 sure you didn’t read or understood nothing at all even this movie not even to mention you have zero knowledge about japan but all the brainwashed materials you gave up on researching anything regarding it on your own and deny everything just because you didn’t like the links posted here is hilarious

your  justifies unreasonable slaveries murders and all the illogical things he does so i hope he will help you

you needed to stop what you started  while japan was completely a closed country and you threatened japan force opened it tricked and have been stealing every indigenous people’s land around the world doing everything you can to create a reason to make everyone “evil” to justify colonization

you don’t even think anyone is a human being except your own people

"i’m seeing 2 types of criticisms

category 1 is related to plot related criticisms i don’t find these to be compelling criticisms since the movie stuck to the biography pretty closely so it’s pretty silly for example to complain about the inclusion of strauss’ story line when that was a substantial portion of the book and telling that aspect of oppie’s story is very important due to the historical and political ramifications that oppie not having a say in america’s nuclear weapons policy ie being opposed to the hydrogen bomb and an advocate of bohr’s vision of an “open world” to avert an arms race going forward had on geopolitics i think it is also an important point about how engulfing the “red scare” was and how many politicians mishandled that the fact that the man who led this enormous scientific project was completely ostracized from any decision making on his and all of the scientist’s creation is significant and has ramification to this day just look at how divorced dod decision making is from science along with many other aspects of our politics and regulations there exists to this day a level of mistrust between many scientists and governmentmilitary officials that partially stems from all of this 

category 2 related to criticisms of artistic and storytelling choices that nolan made i think many of these are valid and vary from person to person 

i’ve read 2 biographies on the guy a few other books on other physicists feynman fermi einstein and the manhattan project have a graduate stem degree am from nm etc so i found the storytelling to complement the biography well however in my opinion some of the loud music was unnecessary at times as was the first bhagavad gita quote during the  scene just my 2 cents",2023-07-21 18:36:03
well thats your problem,2023-07-21 20:37:04
because you cant make a movie that will please everyone,2023-07-22 08:54:59
gotta be taking the  at this point,2023-07-24 19:04:35
i think the bright white light was from them burning some magnesium as well,2023-07-23 23:58:29
thanks for the correction im looking forward to seeing the movie,2023-08-08 02:19:36
im not sure thats entirely right i think the general consensus is the japanese were likely to surrender after the first bomb but were grappling with their cultural issues around shame and the emporor which is whybit took a while,2023-08-08 12:25:24
it’s more the delivery of it through the story yes we all knew nuclear war is bad but it was seeing it through his view at that moment,2023-08-10 00:51:05
im not saying any scene served no purpose there are downsides to cutting anything but there are also downsides to not cutting anything and thats what i feel the movie suffers a bit from,2023-07-24 03:39:49
sounds rough i hope you can overcome that sorry man,2023-08-20 17:28:06

"idk it’s subjective 

if nolan wanted to use cgi he would have he clearly didn’t want to because it didn’t fit his vision for the film 

we can sit here and say “he shoulda done this or done that” but i don’t think nolan cares 

he’s probably not sitting around wondering “how do i please my audience the most”",2023-07-23 04:47:23
"the best argument i’ve heard is that the japanese have made plenty of art depicting what the bomb did

godzilla",2023-08-02 19:38:53
its not about what media should be its about this particular story there is a worthwhile story to tell about the impact of the bomb this movie isnt about the bomb its not called  man its about one man and the camera stays pretty focused on him throughout,2023-07-31 12:11:50
so it really wasn’t just me who didn’t really understand what oppenheimer and einstein were talking about clearly because to me it sounded kind of gibberish had to ask my mate about what they said,2023-07-22 11:27:20
yeah however the first hydrogen bomb was detonated by the usa not the ussr,2023-07-25 00:06:56
i may be mistaken maybe a rewatch will refresh my mind but it checks out the usa were worried about the ussr’s nuclear capabilities,2023-07-25 00:09:32
yeah my bad i understand this was after the trinity bomb but i swear i heard strauss say “they beat us to it” if i correctly heard him then it wouldn’t make sense since the usa beat the ussr to the atomic and hydrogen bomb but again like i mentioned i might’ve misheardmisremembered,2023-07-25 01:21:29
no i get that im saying that buying 5 million pounds of tnt and blowing it up just to get a cool movie shot seems excessive,2023-07-22 02:48:33
im not doubting that it did i just wished they could have done more to make me care about his security clearance oppenheimer is still a huge character in history even before the film trying to rush out this entire side plot where oppenheimers credibility is being ruined despite the fact its being presented in a movie sympathising with him made by christopher nolan in one of the biggest movies of the year is a little ironic,2023-11-27 14:52:53
i am not sure what did you expect to see in an explosion it is a big giant mushroom cloud to me the moments leading upto the explosion was just amazing knowing fully well what happens,2023-07-21 21:08:33
no,2023-07-26 19:41:04
that does not seem to be implied by their comment nor does that really make sense you could very easily argue that oppenheimer is an aesthetically beautiful movie  it’s essentially the single largest aspect of christopher nolan’s direction,2023-07-26 14:15:40
i 100 agree i went in knowing probably more of the story than the average viewer and it seems like the film just blew through all the history just to fit it in so many moments and people felt like mere cameos if you dont know the important figures and why they were important theyll just pass you byin a miniseries there would have been so much more room to explore the individuals around oppenheimer and why they were so essential to him orchestrating the development of the bomb,2023-08-11 23:24:20

the bombs should never have been dropped japan would have surrended due to the prolonged bombing and naval blockade but the japanese deserved everything they had coming

they committed so many atrocities throughout the war that they still refuse to atone for there is still a war memorial attended by the pm every year that venerates known war criminals

what the wehrmacht did to the russians was appalling what the japanese did to all of their prisoners of war goes beyond that

get to  with your japanese apologist attitude they were appalling and learnt pretty quickly why naval power is built power",2023-07-22 01:06:32
i mean couldnt you argue that if its the biggest war crime from wwii shouldnt the detonation scene drive fear into you and leave you  your pants and if it didnt do that then its kind of a letdown and didnt drive the point home,2023-07-22 01:02:12

yeah i guess my goal was to distinguish the type of person that would enjoy a movie like the hateful eight vs oppenheimer  not that the artistic visions were the same  got the answer i needed and moving on  seems like folks who enjoys exposition didnt necesarilly enjoy this type of exposition,2023-07-22 06:49:42
for sure and likewise the second the credits hit my friend said that was a masterpiece and i sure as  wasnt correcting him or ruining his experience i absolutely get why other people love this movie and its getting rave reviews despite not being my thing,2023-07-22 06:03:12
yea i read some of the biography and knew what i was getting into when watching the film think the trailer and experience some of my friends expected were more around the science and the bomb — less so on the scientist,2023-07-22 10:20:10
"i feel like the lead up to the trinity explosion was great the tension was built perfectly which is why the actual explosion itself was a let down there was a flash of light and then it sort of just zoomed in on sections of the explosion and then other people’s faces so it never felt like you got the full scale i honestly would have preferred they just used retouched footage of the actual explosion  still keep the silence because that’s how actual sound travels and then hit the theater with the sound from the blast the actual explosion itself felt almost quiet when compared to people stomping their feet later in the movie in fact with how loud they made other aspects like his anxiety i expected them to really go for the impact from the explosion

i did enjoy the movie a lot but couldn’t help but feel let down at that one integral moment because the film did such a good job of setting my expectations high",2023-07-22 11:21:08
i dont think it was the fact that matt damon endorsed his patriotism while recommending denying him a security clearance didnt end up being relevant to the fact that by building the abomb oppenheimer may have started a chain reaction that will destroy the world,2023-07-23 05:47:10
and the two different size crates carrying them i thought that was a really good shot,2023-07-23 03:14:26
i dont think they even needed to mention it its something most of us knew going in already,2023-07-23 05:10:13
i know right i had this weird guilt coming out of the theatre that why didnt i like it enough i have been ruminating on it since but i still remain disappointed with the movie,2023-07-25 18:59:21
"we see close up shots of the test in the movie for most of the scene there was one very short wide angle view if im remembering correctly this is to hide the fact that this is just a gasoline explosion which looks different from an atomic explosion take joan hintons account from viewing the test which describes seeing colors of blue and purple and we also dont see the stark contrast difference from bottom to top 

it was like being at the bottom of an ocean of light we were bathed in it from all directions the light withdrew into the bomb as if the bomb  it up then it turned purple and blue and went up and up and up we were still talking in whispers when the cloud reached the level where it was struck by the rising sunlight so it cleared out the natural clouds we saw a cloud that was dark and red at the bottom and daylight at the top",2023-07-26 21:47:07
and i dont  i agree with uondska,2023-07-26 20:48:28

"i feel strauss was just too 2d of a character for a film like this

if they wanted to dedicate that much screen time to him they cant just have his whole thing be oppenheimer embarrassed me so i plot against him

that doesnt work as the main villain to a plot about the possible death of millionsbillions due to physics and human ethics

it works as the plot to maybe a comedy childrens holiday movie but not this",2023-07-27 13:54:01
it was also obvious that they blew up gasoline and propane just a big fireball instead of the halfsphere followed by an earthspewing dirtcolored explosion like you see with a nuke nolans trinity test looked very hollywood stunt show to me,2023-07-23 02:11:24
florence pugh was at least semi memorable,2023-07-22 22:42:04
"except for rdj scenes

and there you have it the movie didnt treat it opps pov as an ironclad rule break it once break it twice

we saw only what he saw or at least the events he was an earshot within

if there insistence that it has to be within a certain proximity of opp you could just as easily portray hiroshimanagasaki through his minds eye just like we got to experience him in the seat of the bomber see the charred remains in the gymnaisum or the outer space perspective showing a global missile launch at the end",2023-08-08 12:34:08
"but the world only knows him as the man who made the bomb no one knew that this whole clearance thing even existed because its completely irrelevant its like making a movie about a drivers license i cant wrap my head around it

there were 3 or 4 jump scares ill let one go for the explosion the rest was cheap",2023-08-20 19:14:22

at the very least i would have expected the trailers to be honest about the movie because they show story 1 but not story 2,2023-08-25 15:16:39
"well much like oppenheimer sounds like you were frustrated by succession’s later seasons because you were once again watching the show through the incorrect lens again i challenge you to listen to any interview with the show creators it is and was never intended to be anything other than an exploration of its characters 

i absolutely counter your maverick example maverick is a narrative story with a well fleshed out main character the fact you can’t tell the difference speaks volumes about your feelings about this movie from the very beginning that film tells us it is about the mission first and foremost the opening scene catches the audience up on what kind of daring pilot maverick is for those unfamiliar then we are immediately introduced to the mission it’s objectives and why maverick is chosen for the mission from the very beginning the movie is about a linear goal to a specific military mission that maverick is the main player in the movie doesn’t care about his background beyond the emotional backstory to keep us invested it doesn’t care how mavericks ticks so to speak beyond how it serves the primary mission at the heart of the film from the very beginning oppenheimer makes it clear it is more concerned about the man than the mission places us inside his mind his visions his anxiety the movie makes it clear immediately that he is our focus not the historical events that follow 

it’s all about narrative structure there is another movie about oppenheimer that is like maverick where from the beginning the bomb is the primary focus and he just happens to be the perfect man for the job and everything else works to show us that and only cares about his psyche and background as far as it serves getting us to the abomb but that’s just simply not how this story is told again i posit to you that rather than assuming this film was supposed to be a narrative driven film that failed and not a successful character study that you misunderstood is solely because of your own expectations",2023-07-28 10:52:12
nah it is kinda confusing because there are 34 timelines happening at the same time one with the pov of oppenheimer another with strauss and sometimes both switching back and forth sometimes you will see a scene with strauss in black and white and then the same scene will happen in colour one hour later but this time it will be from pov of oppenheimer or viceversa sometimes both povs take a back seat and some other character leads the scene like matt damon or emily blunt honestly i dont think an average viewer will get the whole thing with nuances in a single watch because of the complicated narrative and dialogues which require a lot of attention and patience from the viewer,2023-07-21 16:00:50

nice id say i felt similarly especially with the whole postbombing speech i kinda wish theyd leant more heavily into that theme of surrealism as things progressed,2023-07-24 10:54:51
"the entirety of the first act is constant fast cuts and confusing time jumps showing oppenheimers earlier academic life but we are still never told asaudience what got him into physics what drove him what motivated him how he was raised we know almost nothing intimate about the guy besides his personal love affairs which had some really cringey seduction and flirting scenes

for the second act i felt like the movie also never showed all the technical and scientific challenges the team faced when making the bomb the movie simply showed how the team was hastily assembled then showed a couple scenes of them talking about the theories of the bomb piecing it together and it was just smooth sailing throughout with no hiccups and obstacles

historically the operation involved over 500000 people washington went into extraordinary lengths to keep the entire operation secret and it still took them 2 years to build the bomb but the movie only dedicates about 30 min of screen time to manhattan project out of 3 hours run time and nolan never  showed the true scale of the operation of having a city of 500000 people appeared into existence the logistics it required etc none of it the whole thing was just glossed over the prototype bomb was suddenly magically ready for trial detonation that that was it

the entirety of the third act is literally just rdj talking to his aids in a room because the film now needs to deliver expositions upon expositions about what went on and what is going on with oppenheimer and his questionable communist ties but fast cut into a incohesive montage of one minute scenes and more confusing time jumps so much so that the audience isnt even given time and room to process whats happening and feel the emotional impact

i dare you to tell me you fully understood and was at least 75 following what was actually going on and being said in the entire movie upon first viewing",2023-07-25 16:23:30

all the scenes with rdj in the hearings and in the room with those two other guys  the crux of the whole movie happened without oppenheimer present,2023-08-14 06:02:37
the way the handled it was as if it was this huge event in scientific history and that it really was this monumental moment for their lives i mean come on its just a security clearance and the other a hearing for strauss they can be dramatic but the direction nolan took with it was a bit much couldnt really take it too seriously because how self important that last act felt at times,2023-08-24 09:20:58

your explanation doesn’t make sense bc shouldn’t the image fill out the top and bottom of a regular screen and have letterboxing on the sides seems like the image is not zoomed in bc the theater decided to take the most simple approach which creates the most nonoptimal viewing experience this issue plagued some screenings of dunkirk where it was windowed all around while other dunkirk screenings had the correct projection which was the movie was filled the screen top to bottom and had letterboxing on the sides,2023-07-26 04:49:22

nah its nolans styleave you seen dunkirk and tennet he developed this super intense super quick super dramatic style since dunkirk i had constant panic attacks throughout the movie,2023-07-24 19:23:21
yet here we are,2023-07-22 21:37:45
well they should have put that stuff in the movie,2023-07-23 02:29:08
good for you,2023-07-21 11:29:14
the movie is about oppenheimer and both of the women in his life feature prominent roles in both history and the film both characters have some of the absolute worst dialogue i have personally ever heard in a movie and nolan directs and films both characters oddly to reduce them to being props when in actuality both were rather complex and well rounded individuals which is not conveyed whatsoever in the movie due to nolan   at anything involving women in his movies the guy is a  tier filmmaker,2023-07-21 23:10:21
nah maybe just the guy who spent 100 million making a movie that spends 13 of its time dealing with a cabinet appointment for secretary of commerce,2023-07-22 23:31:05
"oh in that case it will be a tough case mostly white males and only a few woman actors with lines it does not fulfill standard a2 or a3 i think not sure if there was a hispaniclatino in a major supporting role

it feels like the time period and story focus might justify the casting generally but rules are clear will be interesting to see if oppenheimer even gets nominated then",2023-07-21 21:33:39
"i think it was meant to show that they both oppenheimer and kitty were feeling intimately exposed she felt like the entire room was watching her husband with the other woman

"i thought it was clear when oppenheimer was told pretty early that he needed to go back to the states because of how far behind the americans were in their quantum mechanicstheoretical physics it quickly became apparent that the scientists were realizing that this was the first event in history where science would become a political weapon paraphrased there was a ton of anxiety explored on what that future would look like 

granted i had a decent understanding of the history before watching the movie and i could see how key points may not have seemed as important as they were",2023-07-28 16:39:05
"politics is almost literally ideologies vs stakes his ideologies vs others does a mans life work that had a hand in reshaping the world who is then essentially exiled from future involvement not create stakes it does for that man and that mans ideologies were pretty important

and to add although a biopic i think the stakes were more overall related to the future affairs of the world and his pov on it not whether or not he had a security clearance in the future although that painted the picture in his life of how he was essentially accused of being a commiefor a man who was essentially a national hero",2023-07-28 16:55:55

and it isnt like nolan is incapable of making good cgi in his movies interstellar is my favorite film of all time and the cgi is truly breathtaking",2023-07-23 22:59:31

j robert oppenheimer didn’t view the bhagwat geeta as just “poetry” the real man knew it was a sacred document the film had the opportunity to do something beautiful with that part of his legacy that quote but rather they chose to throw it in a  and frankly very boring way,2023-07-21 14:54:59

this is the trailer im talking about it makes it seem like everything that would happen in the movie would culminate in the explosion of the bomb no indication of things in the final third of the movie so i dont fault people for being disappointed the trailer made it seem like a different movie",2023-09-30 10:45:38

right because saying that “ truman saw right through stalin in the way a poor man understands the streets better than someone born with a silver spoon in their mouth” is suuuuper high effort and not reductionist at all huh 

 fdr was a great president he had flaws blindness to stalin was one of them

fdr’s death was a tragedy for third worlders like myself maybe if the us hadn’t strayed from his foreign policy  much saner and less beholden to the interests of a corporate oligarchy  millions of deaths could have been avoided in latin america asia and africa in the decades since",2023-07-22 14:56:07

i loved chernobyl i wouldve loved to see this story in that way though honestly i do think christopher nolan is starting to get in his own way he tackles these already complex concepts with increasingly non linear stories oppenheimer felt like him getting tangled in his own ideas,2023-07-22 19:12:41
what was the detonation like in imax if you dont mind me asking,2023-07-22 20:51:09
" im not saying you need to have a degree in political science to understand the film if thats what you got from that then youve definitely misunderstood 

the movie does not put in the leg work to make any of the other scientist characters actual characters besides tellerstrauss 

because the title of the film is oppenheimer not the manhattan project its focusing on oppenheimer its about his life and working on the bomb 

now you may feel that the movie should have focused on fleshing out the other scientists and there may be some truth to that with that being said these are literally some of the most famous names in their fields for example i wouldnt expect a movie about adolf  to flesh out or focus on mussolini and stalin as much i  would adolf or vice versa for because theyre not the focus of the film",2023-07-22 23:24:59
"again i  never said you have to have a political science degree to appreciate the movie that was literally me just talking about my background and why i appreciated the details in the film more because of my knowledge base 

youre acting like im saying you should be sterilized or something thats why i put in the very beginning that everyone is entitled to their opinions quit being  juvenile",2023-07-22 23:35:02
the themes  what does it mean to be the man that made it possible the biography the film is based on is called american prometheus for christ sake the prometheus stole fire from zeus and was tortured because of it its similar to verner vaughn brown and his creation of the v2 rockets,2023-07-22 23:14:07

well if you really want to get down to it at the end of the day its all a matter of perspective some people will find it boring others will enjoy it in this case i fall in the latter camp this isnt directed at you personally but ive never understood why people feel the need to argue with peoples opinions on art it rarely if ever changes their minds,2023-07-23 00:01:03
i wanted to see it in 70mm but it’s sold out here for another 2 weeks it’s insane just decided to see it in premium large format today at my local amc i want to see it again and want to try for imax just because but i do stand by what i said after seeing it i know it was filmed on imax camera and with 70mm but i just assumed there would be more shots that would make it worth seeing it in imax,2023-07-30 09:21:40
i was just reiterating im glad you liked the flick,2023-07-30 04:10:58

its less linear and more conflicted this film was mostly just step by step linearity and it bored me to tears",2023-07-23 05:15:38

oh my  youre right now that i think of it i was on my phone for 90 of this scene and i have a personal vendetta against christopher nolan it couldnt be that i just wasnt a fan of how they depicted the nuclear blastfallout hallucination,2023-07-22 02:06:35
that movie is packed with straight up iconic dialogue,2023-07-22 02:43:51
maybe that’s the disconnect i have noticed that bigger nolan fans are a little harsher on it but for someone that often finds his movies overhyped i thought this one impacted me the most,2023-07-22 21:36:52
i’m pretty sure the authenticity of his guilt was intentionally left ambiguous did his conscience really get to him or did he just want to be absolved by history was strauss right when he accused oppenheimer of just wanting to play the role of a martyr of a “great man” who unleashes terrible power and then flagellates himself for it i think it was presented as unclear i believe your criticism is actually part of the movie’s point,2023-07-22 22:43:44
not to mention he had a crisis of conscious after the fact which makes it completely inconsequential not that we didnt already know the ending anyways,2023-07-23 18:06:51
thats your claim you tell us why does it have to be what everyone else wants,2023-07-23 02:40:54

"again not to me the script for me and many others was fantastic and the development of the atom bomb is a important part of the movie but not the only one it is a movie about oppenheimer before making the bomb during and what happens next plus robert downey jr character lewis strauss also plays a vital role

for me i will totally recommend it esp if you have no problem with the subject matter just see it for yourself and decide or go watch some reviews of some of your favorite critics",2023-07-22 01:00:19
it definitely wasnt a 70mm screening,2023-07-22 19:18:28

i literally never said that",2023-07-24 20:06:16
"you call this movie a biopic but how much do you think you know about oppenheimer just from watching this film did you find out from the movie what got him into physics in the first place did you find out how he was raised what drove him his motivations and goals

no you dont after watching a 3 hour long biopic the film still barely tells you who oppenheimer is besides his involvement with the bomb his spicy personal affairs and his legal trouble with the aec   


this is why even if this movie is treated as a biopic it would be a failure",2023-07-25 16:08:32
he’s the father of the atomic bomb the only reason you know his name is because he built the atomic bomb expecting this movie to be more about the atomic bomb than his marriage isn’t  it’s  to make a movie that doesn’t feature the bomb more heavily,2023-07-25 22:37:54
"i was wondering if that was a real line

gary oldman is such a chameleon it was about halfway into scene before i realized it was him",2023-07-27 14:57:39

" then somehow he just suddenly turned into a communist sympathizer with zero reasons 

i can name 2 very good reasons for him if you know what i mean",2023-07-24 16:49:41
there was too much focus on communism and not enough on atomic bomb,2023-07-24 13:32:41
the film never actually showed this it was only ever implied and for audiences who arent familiar with the spanish civil war and political undertone of picassos works which i daresay is going to be vast majority of moviegoers these days would have absolutely no idea what was going on,2023-07-24 22:13:02
they specifically mention he had a long affair with ruth and you see the two of them interact like three specific times,2023-07-24 12:30:24
we also didnt really see the inner workings of the atomic bomb of the earliest prototypes and how the different layers inside the implosive design worked,2023-07-24 08:54:27
i was actually relieved they didn’t show the result of the bombs being dropped i don’t know why people would want to see that they showed how it affected oppenheimer in him having multiple panic attacks with the sound of the bombs etc in his speech for example i thought it was pretty obvious why he was upset about the loss of his security clearance it ruined his reputation and he could no longer speak up about his beliefs i feel like if you wanted more from it you shouldn’t have watched a nolan film haha,2023-07-24 09:53:38
tell that to the marketing department then whos been constantly hyping up the bomb explosion itself as the cinematic experience of the summer,2023-07-24 17:10:02
apparently he can do no wrong,2023-07-22 09:03:48
as someone who has struggled with varying degrees of anxiety i felt that the audiovisual effects used to convey the immense pressure oppenheimer faced at a few critical moments were executed masterfully,2023-08-17 16:09:24
well i mean if christopher nolan intended for it to be a biopic of oppenheimers life why wouldnt he put it in the trailer and ill tell you why the people making the trailer wanted to make the target audience as wide as possible they know that most teenagers arent going to want to sit through 3 hours of a biopic so they sprinkled in a few moments in the trailer that hint at it being about his whole life but excite the movie as the making of the atomic bomb i must have missed that line but i think that the general idea of the trailer and most definitely what they were trying to show in the trailer was the making of the bomb i was actually pleasantly surprised when it turned into his life story so i dont even care that much,2023-07-22 15:27:55
"“appreciate history…” they didn’t fully show history by neglecting to portray the devastation oppenheimer’s research had for the world 

i don’t get you mutual exclusive campers who are so hellbent on praising nolan cuz marketing has led you to believe this is a masterpiece—literally all of his actions  thoughts  political undertakings would be amplified significantly if the audience saw the footage in a nolan fashion—i mean wasn’t this the basis of all the marketing in the first place every trailer showing explosions every poster having a bomb in the background… and the culmination of all that is a test explosion and a phone call  be so fr w urself bro movie would’ve been 1000x better w the explosion shown",2023-07-22 04:17:11
"this is an excuse for the film history is insanely interesting…as long as you focus on the interesting parts nolan overall failed to do that here

if i’m telling a story about like the punic wars i don’t spend a third of my time describing how the roman generals kept avoiding hannibal at different battles because it’s not as interesting as the other parts it doesn’t mean i don’t appreciate history it means i know that history isn’t interesting just because it is history

the communist stuff was good the los alamos part somehow felt rushed and also too shallow they had the greatest scientific minds of the last century on the screen but it didn’t feel that way i feel there was way too much meat left on the bone

the choice to use the “trial” as a narrative tool didn’t work for me the trial overall seemed really…unimportant they talked about how important it was but then he lost and…everything still seemed fine

the last exchange with einstein was good

i just expected more i guess",2023-07-22 15:25:08
have you seen first man,2023-07-22 04:43:01
wouldnt it hang a bit too much then balls and two metal ones will always be going ting ting whenever you walk,2023-07-21 16:17:34
"exactly


i feel like nolan was too concerned with the bigger stuff and making it look good and it does so much so that in his eyes the lesser stuff like people talking scenes felt so boring to him compared to everything else that they barely got any attention to the point where it almost feels like they were done by a 2nd unit director or something


as you said at times there was a noticeable disconnect thats just incomprehensible",2023-07-22 04:34:32
yea i didnt remember that part correctly but regardless the entire smear campaign was strauss brain child,2023-07-28 03:47:35
"well you said it was too convoluted and non linear for you so i explained it 

can’t solve the other problem for ya xd",2023-07-28 16:01:27

up to you i saw it 70mm imax and did not feel like i needed to at all,2023-07-22 01:00:45
i regretfully saw it,2023-07-22 20:38:10
well if you are satisfied with that good for you personally i would have appreciated to see more so i can be invested more i agree with your analysis but the movie failed to make me care as this girl actually meant nothing other than a lazy way to tell us that oppenheimer has a victim complex,2023-07-26 23:36:25
"techniques like nonlinearity and the absurd  scenes are very arthouse so while a hundred million hollywood offering will not be an “arthouse movie” holistically the director can nevertheless integrate arthouse or avantgarde techniques typical of an arthouse film which is exactly what nolan did

and which is effective at times but not here here it was awkward pretentious clumsy and inarticulate",2023-07-27 17:45:56
i actually liked it it served a purpose  he was being exposed before the inquiry and his wife most movie  scenes  including earlier ones  feel gratuitous,2023-07-27 11:03:19
ofc it wasnt factual hahahahahahahaha who is getting it on in a government hearing,2023-07-27 15:47:42
this would be an incorrect read of everything i’ve written above,2023-07-22 09:21:26
" i feel like you just dont actually like nolan very much

since he just compared his leastfavorite nolan movie to the mona lisa your conclusion is absurd",2023-07-22 23:43:53
i hope you enjoyed the movie i certainly did i just didnt think it was one of his best and that is an entirely reasonable take to have,2023-07-22 12:28:46
" nolan would introduce creative ideas

i cant emphasize enough that for a biopic you really want to restrain the creative ideas  otherwise you run the risk of trashing the subject of the movie and etc

not sure how many biopics youve seenmost of them arent that interesting unless youre already interested in the subject matter  this one reminded me a lot of imitation game  dr strange was great in that but again that movie felt pretty restrained",2023-07-22 01:51:29
last i checked something being boring or not is a subjective matter some people can find a movie boring and others can find it entertaining which means that it being boring is an opinion they taught me the difference between facts and opinions in first grade there is no way to “objectively define” if a movie is boring or not because it all depends on the individual viewer’s personal preferences,2023-07-22 15:17:56
also to explain more of who he is as a guy right same with him trying to park his kid on someone else,2023-07-23 01:17:55
im sorry the rrated movie had  in it mohammed i hope youll be okay,2023-07-23 18:49:32
because you and the other guy wanted to see a movie about nukes this was a biopic about him,2023-07-25 13:22:40
well let me ask you this if you take away the black and white scenes what’s the point of the movie,2023-07-25 04:28:51
they just like stopped cutting from black and white like halfway through the movie from what i remember too,2023-07-25 22:32:51
if you remove the bw do you not remove strauss perspective entirely and only see one half the movie,2023-07-25 12:09:37
"i think it carries more weight that they did not show it

a big focus of the third act is the moral dilemma he struggled with he never saw firsthand all the death and destruction that it caused it was just left to torment his imagination for the rest of his life",2023-07-30 20:35:23
i think it would have been redundant with the test personally,2023-07-30 06:58:12
im literally cracking up  the move is called oppenheimer  hahahah,2023-07-30 15:49:14
the movie is literally called oppenheimer homie,2023-07-30 14:23:53
"who gives a  about oppenheimer

yeah who gives a  about oppenheimer in a biopic movie about oppenheimer titled oppenheimer  cry about it more you want explosions go watch mission impossible 25",2023-07-30 11:26:55
wow you are a special one,2023-07-30 23:31:08
i guess that’s where we disagree i don’t care about the nuisances of his life after i would have rather they visually portrayed his internal struggle,2023-07-22 02:38:50
yeah we can just agree to disagree,2023-07-22 02:26:04
"i guess that’s where the disconnect is everyone knows the atomic bomb is a divisive issue we don’t need to be explained this

i just wish they had shown more of the impact of the bomb in nolan’s signature style and let us decide for ourselves how we feel 

the political stuff added literally nothing except killing the momentum strauss was the definition of an unnecessary character",2023-07-22 02:59:59
"yeah except it took 40 minutes to tell you what could have been told in 10 minutes and actually made it more convoluted 

a real director shows us and appeals to our emotions not dumping 40 minutes of constant political dialogue",2023-07-22 02:53:00
yes im not disputing that it happened in real life im saying we could have gotten some scenes of the actual impact instead of just seeing oppie pacing around,2023-07-23 16:40:10
"honestly i thought building an atomic bomb would be pretty thrilling why would it not the trailer shows it as a race to build it with challenges along the way a tease of a love story in it etc i got very little of that

vice versa why would i think the story of oppenheimer would be fixated on a case trying to retract his security clearance did the trailer give me any indication of that i just read the entire wikipedia about his life and that was mentioned very little",2023-07-23 08:46:58
"yap i agree with you

i would also say that if inception is not 1010 then the prestige is

can you imagine memento also 1010 for me would be like if he release it today it would be impossible to follow

yet it has an arguably much harder timelinetechnique but it is kept in its reigns in a way that is logical pragmatic and as best as it can easy to follow",2023-07-25 10:12:14
your joke and opinion are at the same level congrats,2023-07-25 04:11:06
"you just said it wasnt and that the theater was mixed incorrectly

you gotta pick one bro",2023-07-27 15:17:37
if i missed the main points i probably couldnt hear it because nolans audio mixing department sucks at their  job,2023-07-24 01:31:52
"oskar schindler didnt directly affect or participate in the killings of millions of jews but spielberg had the  creative decency humility and responsibility to show us the audience what the nazis did when they occupied poland if i watched schindlers list and the whole movie was about schindler and him renewing his  party membership  id be  

but for whatever reason nolan gets a free pass because nolan and hes the darling of all the film nerds out there",2023-07-24 01:47:23
"the fact that we can put the father of the atomic bomb outside the bucket of what the atom bomb did is absurd to me theres a level of disconnect there i cant get

it doesnt only potray him in a positive light but it takes away a lot of the weight of so much  his affairs are just things that happened with very little insight  his entire coming to terms with what the bomb did is basically cut down to a 30 second sequence of him looking slightly troubled while someone shows a slideshow of things from the bomb drops that the audience never sees and a couple of fever dream sequences

 in a movie whos runtime licks three hours

the entire point of the movie is to handwave anything bad that happened because of his work and to focus on how he really tried to get that whole cold war situation under control without placing any personal responsibility on him or touch on any of the surrounding subjects",2023-07-24 01:32:41
i don’t think we needed a bomb dropping on japan montage to drive home the point that the bomb is an awesome power that wrecked absolute havoc,2023-07-24 01:28:37
" and dont give me that it was an artistic choice or its not nolans job to lecture us 

dont give me the argument that completely destroys my argument

oppenheimer didnt see the bomb drop either he wasnt there he only heard about what it had done it was painfully obvious that that was the artistic choice of the film and it worked perfectly",2023-07-24 01:49:54
if china made a movie about tiana men square that didn’t include tiananmen square i’d see the connection but the movie was about oppenheimer not nagasaki or hiroshima oppenheimer made the bomb he didn’t drop it which is why the movie mainly focused on making the bomb instead of dropping it,2023-07-24 01:25:17
"this is a terrible take

the film did include within its scope the effects of the bombings through the lens of oppenheimer when he was sitting in an auditorium watching the aftermath on a projector and we watched his reaction he couldnt look showing the viewers what he saw would have also taken away from the climax of the film which for me was the speech he gave with the crowd of people melting we saw the effects of the bombing through oppenheimers disassociative psychosis armchair diagnosis and how it affected him and caused his heel turn against nuclear proliferation it is absolutely a valid artistic and respectful way to show how the tragedy of nuclear weapons recreating those scenes with actors would have been insensitive and using real footagecgi would not have been consistent with the fabic of this film",2023-07-24 02:53:56
"honestly i think nolan thought it was his job to lecture us and he chose to glaze right by everything else to really make sure his bit about troubled genius got put on display

the fact that closest we see to him coming to terms about the bombs actually being dropped is a 30 second scene of him seeing footage and looking slightly disturbed in a three hour movie really says a lot",2023-07-24 01:29:03
"i dont understand how comparing works from the same director based on how well he adapted the source material to be so difficult to understand

with one he did really  well and wowed us

with the other he didnt do that well and polarized his viewers",2023-07-24 01:45:44
"“i am become death”  scenes and all of his initial conversations with kitty were so badly written they could have fooled me that they were lifetime scripts before not to mention the annoying cuts mid sentence to different locations unbelievably cheesy 

i think the rest of the movie especially the last ask does enough to save it to be a decent movie but it certainly doesn’t take off running from the startthat’s for sure",2023-07-24 16:37:03
"i said it was a way of making the audience think it not that i personally thought it the fact that its an absurd thing to think is precisely why that bit of storytelling didnt really work in my mind because by vilifying the people who were pushing the antioppenheimer view the strongest it just serves to cheapen the position

there was plenty of material for oppenheimer directly to appear to be a conflicted and morally nebulous type of person and that certainly achieved the effect that you mention here overall i consider this a 910 film but the fact that his only antagonists in the movie were such despicable people does kinda cheapen the overall quality of the storytelling in my eyes it was too simplistic",2023-08-03 22:44:57
"the concept is fine but personally i think it needed much better editing more showing less telling and not hiding key character motivations to reveal them later like some interesting plot twist i couldn’t really get invested in what was going on in the last hour because it felt a bit like a garbled mess until towards the very end i have no issue with dialogue heavy movies i love things like glengarry glen ross or twelve angry men which is the epitome of people talking in a room… but in both there was a clear plot without convoluted jump cuts the most boring part to me was rdj talking in a back room with alden ehrenreich it was so clunky alden asking all these pointed on the noise questions so rdj can spit out some exposition i actually loved rdjs performance but the whole segment dragged

how many more times to hear they suspect he’s a communist way too many people bought to that hearing adding very little with their testimony the whole chevalier thing i didn’t even know what that was by the end right now all i got was that oppenheimers security clearance was denied and that’s bad because he was opposed to building out nukes what he said to pash or not or who said what about this or that was not clear at all lots of talk and hearsay and none of it was clear to me at all",2023-08-04 11:27:14
 totally gonna use that one now,2023-08-04 12:40:48
"but those talks were the movie im not saying you should like the movie im saying you wouldnt have liked it with the changes either and neither would have anyone else

its not a flawed movie it is just a movie you didnt enjoy",2023-07-22 22:19:36
i enjoyed everyone testifying because it was interesting to see for example matt damon’s character admitting that he wouldn’t have cleared oppenheimer if he had to do it now i feel like all the details about his communist ties were needed just so the viewer can understand how it was easy for him to be vilified after being an american hero without all the context it seems like a really far jump to consider the person who created the atomic bomb for the us to be treasonous,2023-07-22 22:29:04
next time try using your brain a bit,2023-07-22 20:48:14

" well stick to one plot and make it interesting at least

my brother in christ its a biopic its historical events",2023-07-22 20:23:19
"its really not its a footnote in oppenheimers life


the most important and sole focus of this film shouldve been the bomb since thats what oppenheimer will be remembered for",2023-07-22 22:17:36
for me the bomb testing scene that lasted maybe 20 mins max was worth it in imax but i wasnt super impressed with it its the only part of the movie that made me feel something,2023-07-23 07:02:40
"to me its the equivalent of saying memento needs to be seen in imax it was mostly humans talking why the need for the biggest clearest picture the only part that felt worthy of imax was them testing the bomb for 15 mins and i thought that was just okay not incredible 

i have to drive an hour each way for the imax theater and it was very much not worth it when a normal theater is less than 5 mins from me i dont watch any marvel movies mission impossible on imax was 100 worth it and looked awesome almost the entire movie oppenheimer looked pretty good for maybe 20 minutes out of 180 

this is coming from a huge nolan fan  i saw tenet on imax twice and i didnt even like the movie much id rate it like a 610 but at least the movie was very much enhanced on imax and i wanted to experience it that way while i could all his movies since batman begins have been must see on imax but not oppenheimer

honestly the scores and comments feels like nolan fanboys who bought tickets a month ago to see it the first weekend coping hard claiming its so amazing i have a feeling the imdb score will start dropping by next weekend when other people start seeing it",2023-07-23 07:23:49
" it didnt going 100 mph

did you like close your  eyes while you typed that",2023-07-23 18:42:00
i’m saying what is the point of hyping up seeing it on imax for mostly dialogue in a room yes i want to see beautiful shots of scenery or action in imax not people talking in rooms would you prefer watching memento or tdk on imax,2023-07-23 16:14:15
the whole movie is really meant to be from his perspective sans the straussbw stuff of course,2023-07-21 06:44:33
"someone isnt creepy because they put nudity in a movie  

the reason why i said hollywood needs more nudity isnt masturbatoryi dont really like gratuituous nudity  its more like it makes a drama ring somewhat more true  in a lot of movies if two people just had  the next scene will often be the two characters in bed with the woman having the sheets pulled over her chest which seems a bit modest for two people who just had  and takes you out of a movie

real life involves  and nudity  it makes things seem more real and less coddled if you include the swears and nudity  if you see a couple of  its a little bit of a shock but really pulls you more into the movie  a good example is when oppenheimer is  during the hearing  it makes you the watcher really feel as vulnerable as he does in tha tmoment

florence has always been comfortable with nudity and they have procedures to make actresses in  scenes as comfortable as possible  it was only   you cant even see her   you seem fairly puritan if you think thats creepy  do you also think titanic was creepy relationships involve nudity

also hack  do you actually think nolan is a bad director",2023-07-22 13:55:53
"so it doesnt follow a similar sequence because the book is chronological and the movie is not also iirc there were more than 2 timelines all the events that led to the trinity test and its immediate consequences the discussion about the h bomb the closed trial and the strauss hearing

dont get me wrong i liked the movie in general i havent stopped thinking about it just think they dropped the bomb too soon",2023-07-23 06:38:16
sure but as oppenheimer the movie presents oppenheimer hes the most famous scientisttype person on the planet irl he would have had more issue probably depending on how much of an  the federal government wanted to be but i dont know that much about what actually happened in his life,2023-07-21 17:36:09
i can’t speak to the last 40 minutes yet i don’t see it until tonight not to include it would be folly but if nolan did a poor job with it that’s too bad lots of application to todays anti science climate especially given that oppy’s wringerrun was largely a personal mission of strauss’ sure people will remember him as the father of the bomb but reenforcing common knowledge shouldn’t be the point,2023-07-21 17:27:36
i love how your fan boy  response to everything is just hurdling insults lol this was not a well done movie narrativewise nolan cannot write for  people are mentioning legitimate reasons why this is not the masterpiece everyone is claiming it to be,2023-07-29 02:46:39
ill be honest recent comments by the ceo of imax feel more like rmovies comments than good business decisions they hyped this  explosion and its just really bad theres real footage of this test and it just fails to compare to it,2023-08-11 04:01:51
lol im not a nolan fanboy but i tend to like most of his movies and the real reason that guy is getting downvoted is because he wrote a very  comment about a very good movie,2023-07-28 07:27:19
chiming in that it felt like a cliche to me as well and im someone else entirely the movie is genuinely not good,2023-07-21 23:24:09
the scene where hes watching the slides of photos of the aftermath of hiroshima  i feel like the slides should have been put into the movie to reallyy drive that home,2023-07-21 20:12:56
and i think that’s fine for 99 of the movie but for the climax the rule should’ve been broken to show the devastation his work had,2023-07-21 20:08:37
i think showing the bomb in japan takes away from the story one of the themes in the film is how oppenheimer wants to feel like his hands are clean and all he did was build the bomb and imo showing the devastation counters that and also takes away from the story about him and his life,2023-07-21 20:09:13
it just didnt need strauss at all focus on los alamos and oppenheimer as a man you can do a little denouement about how he was treated for the rest of his life,2023-07-22 04:07:28
100 you’ve managed to articulate how i felt about it,2023-07-22 00:49:26
i havent watched the movie yet do you think it is worth the exttraa money for an imax screening or would a regular show be sufficient,2023-07-22 00:43:11
i know i should the movie made it too boring to hold my interest is my point,2023-07-25 13:01:27
its a movie about judging oppenheimers character leaving out the unfathomable human suffering and focusing on men in suits talking in rooms is a choice if nolan had made a different choice it would have been a better movie,2023-08-20 23:58:55
yeah it’s not the usual crowd so a lot of people being disrespectful i went to one of the theaters that had the film projectors break down but that’s no excuse to be rude to the workers the showing itself was mostly fine but i sat next to the one person who felt like they had to riff throughout the movie,2023-07-21 11:00:49
i probably happen to sit next to the worst person at the showing i have an impeccable ability to always have that experience at concerts,2023-07-21 17:07:42
it doesnt have to be the book you cant blame nolan for the lack of knowledge having an exposition for every character in the movie wouldve been incredibly boring,2023-07-21 11:46:46
ive no issue with people being uniformed but its when they go see such a movie without any knowledge and then dont understand anything and then go on to complain about it is what i take issue with peoples lack of knowledge shouldnt be part of their review as its not the movies fault,2023-07-21 11:54:16
"thanks although intentions were kinda clear they still werent clearly presented wasnt the humiliation part mentioned previously that he wanted that to happen or something

anyways the problem seems to be that i spent time learning about atoms and nuclei in order to enjoy this film because the trailers suggested what the film is going to be about",2023-07-21 12:18:28
i think jonathan glazer is the true kubrick copycat denis films have just gotten hollower and hollower upon rewatch for me and dune was a snoozefest at best yorgos is in his own world though the favourite and the lobster had some major stylistic references to clockwork and barry lyndon,2023-07-22 04:17:44
people that think nolan makes soso movies baffle me,2023-07-22 02:34:24
sorry didnt see the bottom part of your section and yes my observation still stands because the black and white scenes featuring oppenheimer are from strausss prospective why are strausss scenes black and white while the other scenes are not explain that theres an artistic choice being made here which is why certain scenes are black and white and some arent,2023-07-22 18:40:51
"bahahaha

mens rights dude

fml",2023-07-26 21:01:00
"im not going down nolans entire filmography with you to debate how he handles women its been well discussed elsewhere if you had any interest in looking into that specific piece of criticism that you think a movie involving the military should omit women even when the setting is scifi says enough 

i came to express my disappointment in a film i was hoping id enjoy from a director whose early work i loved i didnt realize this was only meant to be a hype thread",2023-07-26 05:58:01
seriously this is a detail i did not know about the manhattan project and now i will never forget it,2023-07-26 18:35:48
this was never a real possibility the movie makes it sound like it was everyone knew that the world was not going to blow up,2023-07-27 13:53:39
when you get caught while being political and then you suddenly stop the activity that’s being apolitical,2023-07-27 13:52:29
sure but they didn’t put the big yellow bow tie on their vehicles back then their modern emblem is pretty distinctive,2023-07-22 06:43:51
it didnt add anything to the movie like even when theyre asking about his mistress in front of his wife im thinking get back to the bomb cause this doesnt do anything for the 3 hour run time we dont even learn his kids names but the  scenes and this girl are a must,2023-07-21 20:18:02
i forgot about the slideshow total mistake to not show any of the slides to the audience it’s important to the story that we see just how brutal the effects of that bomb were on people the movie does not make it clear the side effects and people who died later it doesn’t make it clear what happened and how they died it’s  gnarly stuff and important to the story,2023-07-25 18:11:39
tbf the film did a better job on an imagined version about the carnage being inflicted on fellow americans the hand wringing of wanting to see japanese people eviscerated on screen is such a weird and creepy expectation as if you need to see their trauma visualized in order to empathize with them the dilemmas of using the bombs on japan the unserious decision making on which city to target is enough to illustrate how morally bankrupt the people waging war was and yet the civillians eat it up as a triumphant moment hundreds of thousands dying being celebrated  is absolutely a horrific moment,2023-07-22 13:44:30
algorithm written you know this is adapted from a book right,2023-07-24 11:10:34
it carried weight just not the kind you wanted,2023-07-22 16:51:29
"as i said i’ve already seen the explosion and of course the way that the real explosion is shot isn’t as interesting but it is still far greater than the one in the film the movie one may as well have been a stock explosion from any marvel film with a couple of closeups my point is it was nothing special like how it was marketed to be there was zero sense of scale something which is very evident in the real footage

as for the second comment you are completely missing the point the films attempt to be complicated and intelligent comes in the form of characters speaking fast and quipping at each other as for nuance i think this was one of the least subtle films i’ve ever seen how can you get any less nuanced than the gymnasium scene or oppenheimer reading out the “i am become death” quote in sanskrit whilst having  or the scene of kitty imagining oppenheimer and tatlock having  in the boardroom those were honestly some of the most unsubtle pretentious cringeworthy and uncomfortable scenes i’ve seen in a film for a very long time",2023-07-25 13:01:04
i just think for what we got in terms of visuals and spectacle it could’ve been made for 6080m it was 90 boardrooms same with air  mainly set in an office why  aside from the cost of actors  would it possibly cost that much,2023-07-21 15:36:06
common sense and context clues should answer that for you but i guess common sense and context clues are lost on most people now,2023-07-22 22:07:33
probably because oppenheimer’s profiting off of the barbie crowd for the meme he said in an interview that he will not be seeing barbie and scoffed at the question lol,2023-07-23 18:24:12
been a long time since i’ve seen inception but if they’re talking about a man it doesn’t pass the bechdel  two women having a conversation and the topic must be something other than a man not just love interest related ,2023-08-01 00:00:23
"it was important in the context of how ludicrous the red scare was the paranoia that the bomb creates undid oppenheimer himself

the security clearance is just a physical example of how much his reputation was destroyed by mccarthyism",2023-07-23 12:11:53
i wish it was the movie the trailers made it out to be instead it was roughly one third about the bomb and two thirds about oppenheimers politics not meshing with the post war government,2023-07-23 08:38:02
"because nolan did not make a character i cared about enough for me to be invested in that part of the movie the extent of oppenheimer’s cheating should have made me not like him but with the way it was portrayed i honestly didn’t care 

oppenheimer should be able to stand on its own as a movie without requiring a bunch of context i feel like i was only able to piece together a lot of the movie because i knew a decent amount about him

the imitation game a film about alan turing did a much better job about getting people to care about the character and sympathize with him when he gets ostracized for being  and on top of that deliver a film that builds excitement to breaking the enigma code and in that movie there’s a scene where they discuss when they can appropriately use the intel to save lives balancing it with the cost of the germans discovering the british know the code we barely got the equivalent scenes in oppenheimer",2023-07-23 15:29:51
exactly so just cause people on here think this film is amazing doesn’t mean it is to others,2023-07-23 21:43:06
"well thats what the filmmakers have said

i wrote the script in the first person which id never done before i dont know if anyone has ever done that or if thats a thing people do or not… the film is objective and subjective the color scenes are subjective the blackandwhite scenes are objective i wrote the color scenes from the first person so for an actor reading that in some ways i think itd be quite daunting 

oppenheimer is the first person subjective viewpoint",2023-08-01 01:34:13
"im sorry i was being unfair when i asked that question

my brother is a physicist and i am a filmmaker i am personally very familiar with the story of j robert oppenheimer his story has fascinated me for a long time

the fact that you missed that line isnt a fault on your part a film shouldnt be incomprehensible because of a missed line your critique of the film as a means by which to tell a story is legitimate and i shouldntve dismissed your criticism out of hand as i did",2023-08-01 03:42:15

i think i need to watch it once more tbh",2023-08-10 00:43:09

this movie is beautiful perhaps a masterpiece",2023-08-14 01:15:53
sure but i dont feel like that point is made when it its not aweinspiring compare the visuals to the shockwave of sound which honestly was incredible,2023-07-22 07:42:52
that may have been what nolan intended but sitting in the theatre thats not what it felt like,2023-07-22 15:32:38
"also heres the test footage and the blackand white film honestly looks better than the color version i get that cgi is expensive though but we didnt really see the development of the explosion we only got the final result it was almost like we were supposed to be seeing the movie through a characters eyes

this comment has me crying 5 days later ,2023-07-29 01:38:57
they made him look like a buffoon they had him just waiting on a neighbor’s lawn in the dark at one point and he walked over to oppenheimer when a car left and the entire theatre cracked up i think they tried to make a more irreverent take on him by removing any gravitas but it just looked silly and didn’t help the film,2023-07-23 19:20:28
"and ask a north korean what america did to the peninsula in the 50s

theres no moral victor here",2023-07-26 22:48:30
yeah because they literally all took part in it and agreed with it right there were definitely no civilians simply trying to go on with their daily life when they got a nuclear weapon dropped on them,2023-07-26 23:06:53
im filipino japan did nasty things to us during ww2 but i still think the manhattan project was dumb and couldve been handled better and less innocent lives would have been lost,2023-07-27 02:39:55
i said its flawed but to paraphrase tarantino when someone like nolan  up its not like when a bgrade director  up its still an interesting movie but once the dust settles i think more people will agree its far from perfect,2023-08-25 16:27:54
"i was just being tongueincheek about ops overview lol

i enjoyed the movie a lot the  scenes were mega awkward it couldve benefited from a pg13 rating it was definitely really talky in the end and if youre gonna do an r rating they should have let us seen the bomb drop on japan couldve been an interesting scene in a really good biopic",2023-07-21 21:31:12
"highlight the absurdity of the witch hunt against him

yeah exactly as director nolan80 could have focused more on different aspects of oppenheimers life but the whole movie hinged on that event

highlighting a specific event or period is not something that just happens thats a deliberate choice on the part of the director

putting particular emphasis on his choice to stay out of the communist party but also focusing so much on him getting eviscerated for his involvement with communists anyways is the voice of the movie",2023-07-23 18:05:34
i see that makes more sense,2023-07-23 23:58:24
"my b i read ur message wrong

i went into the movie with a preset mindset thinking it will put an emphasis on the bomb which it did i dont have a great grasp of the history so i didnt understand why it was important to show the conflict for that security clearance it was pretty clear even in the beginning how his allegiance was being questioned why spent a huge chunk of time from strausss perspectivedepicting oppenheimer being questioned now that i know a bit more of its history i def understand how crucial it is

as for the nudity that second part where they both sat down and talked that was necessary that really showed how flawed he was but i respectfully disagree with that frontal nudity where he read that line that was a bit corny",2023-07-24 00:07:20

granted i have not watched the prestige in a while its definitely due for a rewatch memento is great too i have both of them above insomnia dunkirk interstellar following and the tdk trilogy the man does not miss though has never made a bad movie imo",2023-08-04 17:03:16
it’s not an opinion tho,2023-07-21 20:57:03
i’d probably say the 3 hour movie with historical figures that aren’t introduced well and a director known for convoluted story telling is the issue but too each their own i suppose,2023-07-21 21:38:55
everything around the explosion was fine with me just the explosion itself looked and was cut into few scenes like some totally cheap 90s action movie that was really bad look at any trinity test footage how it starts with basically white screen and then out of it the big cloud slowly rises to the sky the flames they choose to use were so obviously not atomic bomb it was completely painful for me after all that preparation for it and they do this using cgi is sometimes really good this scene needs it but nolan choose to blow off few canisters of gas do few cuts and slow it down instead total letdown for any atomic energy enthusiast,2023-07-25 08:24:57
couple of seconds of silence before shockwave wouldnt make sense because they were 6 miles away it takes almost 30 seconds for the sound to reach them the magnitude of the explosion was well presented just by the time it took for shockwave and sound to get there which was incredibly loud for something that far away,2023-07-26 02:12:42
aren’t they all about their workers unions for the coal mines and ,2023-07-26 03:17:23

"holy  thanks for sharing that i know what im watching next yeah thats pretty  close maybe the camera pan into the explosion wouldnt be the artistic choice for nolan but the nuke itself is really close to what i think it should resemble

that song is also incredible i remember it was briefly used in children of men",2023-07-28 01:32:42
"now let me rant why i like david lynchs version so much

it starts out showing the massive scale of the detonation site and the stillness of the desert morning no human hands on a big red button this is beyond human in scope and scale

when the bomb goes off the strings in threnody to the victims of hiroshima explode in its iconic jarring cacophony of noise we dont need to hear the bang the music portrays the power and prophecy of the bomb better than any sound effect could

every shadow the fireball casts makes the whole shot look absolutely massive as we approach and dive into the explosion we got to see it far away now we get to see it up close

where the ensuing video disintegration really makes it feel like reality and our human understanding breaks down at these energies

then the scene shifts into color as we travel down whats presumably the shaft of the mushroom cloud etching closer and closer to the source of evil shockwaves ripple towards the camera and riiight before weve arrived large bubbles of tremendous energy form like the film reel caught fire and burned up

the victims of hiroshima and nagasaki didnt think a bomb hit them they thought the world was ending and this is how you show the weight of the weapons that makes a human assume such a thing not what nolan did in my opinion",2023-07-28 01:41:38
come on man use your brain,2023-08-02 15:55:51
apple poisoning of course,2023-08-02 15:57:19
it did feel like the film was bounding across a much bigger story with some of the pacing this happened we made it pretty got it next scene especially in the first act,2023-07-29 00:51:09
thats way conservative yes theres quite a bit of rich detail that was either left out particular the beginning and the end of oppenheimers life or was condensedcompressed but nolan crammed a heck of a lot more than just 20 of prometheus in his adaptation,2023-07-29 02:14:34
it is but i think it would have benefitted from delving further into that personally,2023-07-22 14:53:05
"why no ones even really come close and the prevalance of them means any nation is guaranteeing their destruction by using one what scenario do you see one being used

this movie isnt about white ones and black ones its about oppenheimer back then the majority of european and american scientists where white so its expected if you think they all look the same you need to take off your racist glasses,2023-07-24 07:13:55
yes i did see that but that is definitely not the same,2023-07-22 11:26:21
"which films which films tie it into oppenheimer and the manhattan project by your logic there are also a  ton of films about the red scare and mccarthyism

i mean you guys would have loved te lawrence over lawrence of arabia",2023-07-22 11:46:31
it was marketed as being about the abomb,2023-07-22 12:39:40
its never just about the man thats what nolan doesnt understand and apparently neither do you,2023-07-22 11:10:35
yeah they should’ve left that out it felt so cheesy like this was all a prequel in the jfk cinematic universe funnier that ehrenreich delivered the line,2023-07-22 04:26:39
"i recognize that my brain makes weird connections sometimes  sometimes its a brilliant insight a lot of times its just a weird connection my brain made

i dont know much of the actual history regarding the people in the film and i had just listened to how strauss was incredibly vindictive and preferred to act from behind the scenes and get other people to do his dirty work for him",2023-07-22 04:41:15
maybe they made the mistake of drinking a large soda and having to  really bad halfway through the film,2023-07-30 21:54:23
"i didnt fall asleep in any of it but i honestly wanted to just walk out just like some people in the theatre did because the third act was a complete drag and the first two acts were barely cohesive with its constant time jumps and perpetual one minute cuts from scene to scene without providing any context  


how much do you think you actually learn about oppenheimer just from watching the movie did you find out how oppenheimer was raised what were his parents like what got him into physics in the first place what drove him what were his goals why was he sympathetic to communism  
  
the movie is 3 hours long called oppenheimer but it doesnt even show audience the most fundamental and essential information and qualities about the titular character  


so were you asleep for most of it and dreamt that you watched a great biopic about oppenheimer",2023-07-31 06:28:00

ah that’s what it was thank you,2023-07-30 02:30:08
im not wasting 4 hours of my life if i am unhappy with his portrayal at large,2023-07-21 11:15:24
with chains dangling stupidly that was the dumbest part of the whole movie just so they could have the sounds of chains clanging for 1 minute after the trucks left,2023-07-25 22:38:59
"i just felt like it was building to an obvious point and it didn’t need as much detail as it had or it needed to be a more direct narrative they spent an hour jumping around and back and forth to say “everyone decided he was a problem and didn’t give him security clearance then there was a committee meeting about that clearance denial”

meanwhile we covered like a decade in the first 2 hours and it had a much more narrative structure

ultimately for me it made it feel like the first 23 were just buildup for an hour of falling action it was obvious from early on that they would never approve his clearance even if this wasn’t historical lol they spent so much time reminding us about his communist ties that there was no other way it would go so there was no suspense or tension in the end",2023-07-21 13:45:42
intentional imo the whole thing was about the implications after the bomb goes off not the explosion itself,2023-07-27 05:20:23
"no i wanted to care about the characters in such a characterdriven movie and feel anything whatsoever

0 attempt to make them more than plot accessories prevented me from this strauss is a child in an adults body this is the riveting character development from the mastermind  christopher nolan

 you’re disappointed that the splosions weren’t good

weird how i never mentioned the trinity test in this comment anywhere

 you’re just sad that it didn’t glorify nukes

imagine being so insecure about the movie youre viciously defending that you think everyone who disliked it dislikes it from a prowar sunk cost stance",2023-07-27 04:19:24
let alone top 5  its his worst work,2023-07-23 04:59:10
thank you i tend to do ok most of the time but i’ll be viewing in an imax theater for the first time in my life and i hear the sound quality is a lot different in imax i’ll be bringing extra pairs in that case haha i’m clumsy,2023-07-21 15:46:25
i just couldnt bring myself to care about strauss or the senate stuff the big moment with david hill fell totally flat,2023-07-22 02:11:46
that is what nolan has said it was for it also makes sense since there are heading transcripts of the senate committee hearing which was what most of the black and white was for,2023-07-22 01:25:41
"huh i have only been to one viewing but the pacing and editing seemed straightforward enough to me but again like i mentioned i was already pretty familiar with most of the events and characters apart from the lewis strauss parts i knew oppenheimer had issues stemming from his leftist connections that led to him losing his clearance but i never did any reading into the details so im not the best judge of the average persons experience

the runtime also seemed fine to me considering its actually two hearings happening in parallel i do think the convergence of the timelines in the final 40 or so minutes could have been handled better  the straussfusion perspective needed more time and the oppenheimerfission one couldve been streamlined

as to the bomb being underwhelming i dont think we can do anything other than agree to disagree i understand that peoples sense of real powerscale is irredeemably  by pop fiction but i strongly believe that not all works have to toe the line forever to compensate

 that said i did like the delayed audio arrangement

i mean thats literally just how observing an explosion from such a big distance works light travels so much faster than sound and all and yeah part of the underwhelmingness is the fact that the scene is attempting to portray the first few moments of the explosion in which yes its a big bright flaming fireball lol edit to add i said it was practically perfect before for me its marred by the lack of bluepurple which is a phenomenon multiple eyewitnesses reported",2023-07-22 19:09:44
thatdoesnt really tell me anything like youve just said he used practical effects instead of cgi and that was bad as if its selfevident,2023-07-22 17:24:38
right because it made sense the first time,2023-07-23 09:16:23
"titanic is about the titanic yet it has peripherical scenes

its really not hard to understand lol why are hundreds of people all of a sudden predenting that a movie cant have any scene that doesnt directly include what its title is about

its not unrelated whatsoever it would put into context the guilt that he feels i dont understand why i have to explain this a scene that is related to the subject the movie is about him making a bomb not cooking burgers is not irrelevant

 why am i explaining this",2023-07-22 22:59:42
there’s a total of 85 movies that involve nuclear issues that’s almost one for every year since the atom bomb was invented that doesn’t include animated movies neither does it include cartoons or shows,2023-07-23 23:59:43
i mean underwhelmed if you lack critical thinking skills and can’t see the thematic purpose of how they portray his guilt imagine if someone you deeply loved was brutally killed would you not feel grief upon hearing the news or would you have to see the body first to feel any sort of emotions,2023-07-22 19:39:44
oppenheimer never saw the bombs this is through him the movie called oppenheimer he was detached from the actual bombings,2023-07-22 20:31:43
dude its not hard to follow the guy got betrayed its from his point of view he was a friendly figure who betrayed him,2023-07-23 19:11:07
niche movie lol sure,2023-07-23 13:46:16
blaming the education system is misguided the destructive capacity of nukes is thoroughly taught starting in middle school history classes a lot of people just dont pay enough attention,2023-07-22 16:29:27
typo meant to say “most” negative it’s a brilliant movie,2023-07-24 02:38:58
yeah fair enough i can agree with you about wanting to see more of oppenheimers state of mind and less of rdjs personal vendetta its almost like nolan wanted to give rdj some oscar bait so he wrote the third act for that purpose alone,2023-07-24 21:22:12
"yeah you just sit there thinking who the  is this guy and why are we seeing anything from his pov  hes not that significant a figure in history  except mabye he was behind the scenes  like a robert moses type

if  they wanted to get into the deep state forming out of the ossaecetc id buy that  but it might help to 1 make that a little more explicit and 2 get oliver stone to do  it",2023-07-29 18:26:01
the last hour after the trinity  borderline a disaster hard to follow and boring rdj terrible acting and worthless storyline killed the movie,2023-07-21 20:06:54
why does any of this matter,2023-07-22 03:13:51
the movie wasn’t about the bomb itself don’t be so dense,2023-07-22 04:08:56
he was saying it started a chain reaction that would or could destroy the world not the nuclear chain reaction literally igniting the atmosphere but the chain of events that will lead to the same outcome,2023-07-26 20:42:58
his last words were definitely i believed it in reference to fermis theory i dont know why im getting downvoted reddits wild,2023-07-26 20:55:01
lol flip all those adjectives and you got my reaction,2023-07-23 04:27:02
what do you recommend,2023-07-21 21:28:44
experienced are in the moment bro,2023-07-21 23:25:03
its pretty great to like all things you should try it,2023-08-02 20:42:45
no i did lol maybe try reading again ,2023-08-06 14:06:41
"i didnt have any bias against the film until i saw it and was underwhelmed ive enjoyed most of nolans films and have always considered him one of my favorite directors

why would using the word dreck make me feel clever its a word and i claimed no superiority intellectual or otherwise over people who enjoyed it sounds like youre projecting some insecurities the fact that people who didnt like oppenheimer have been told in multiple threads to go watch transformers or the mcu is what im referring to 

there are many other comments taking issue with the film that have been downvoted to  despite providing much more substantial criticism than the one that led off this thread youre right that i probably did pick the wrong comment thread to post my little rant in but my point is bigger than defending one persons criticism of oppenheimer",2023-08-02 18:10:19
yep thats the issue thank you for your substantive contribution to what was already such an intriguing discussion,2023-08-02 16:19:21
not really about that most nolan scene pieces have some purpose this was plain gratuitous there have beautiful love stories in nolan movies that did not need this so this definitely didnt nolan has technique to show it more aesthetically it was just too in your face like look   lol idk felt very un nolan to me  also whatever depth the intimacy of the scene could have garnered was spoiled by the whole ominous quote in the moment a quote which would be so significant later on,2023-07-21 22:11:59
yeah i understood all that it just seems insignificant when they split an atom for the first time in the history of mankind and then spend an hour trying to convince you a politicians grudge matters at all,2023-07-25 00:22:14
i just don’t see why everyone is becoming so defensive it’s a movie not only that i commented a very neutral comment that wasn’t attacking anyone or any group and people are becoming defensive over a very basic opinion that has no effect on their lives i will never understand the aggressive nature of people on the internet when it does nothing but hurt themselves when instead people can just be chill relaxed and just enjoying life through productive means sigh,2023-07-23 03:51:50
youre right sorry,2023-08-07 18:24:27
bruh idk anything about islam tbh i’m not religious myself i just know their followers generally don’t like to see  on tv lol and my brother is the same way thanks,2023-07-25 23:00:53
"i gotta say i did like the sound they did an excellent job there but theres really only 3 story lines i really didnt follow the movie at all then lol   


did you know about the story before watching the movie i really do want to understand why people liked it its either some people like me  at following any complications to story lines or everybody that liked it already knew the story to some extent",2023-08-03 02:57:02
completely understandable loved the movie as a whole genuinely though phenomenal,2023-07-25 22:11:28
"really you think he could have made oppenheimer read passages of the quran torah and bible while someone is riding him with no repercussions really are we serious lol 

ofcourse the destroyer of the worlds quote from the gita is important to the story 

nobody has a problem with it when it was used right after trinity 

it was the way it was used in the first instance thats outright disrespectful 

again i have no issues with it i had more issues with the  scenes being gratuitous at best not the quote being used 

but it doesnt mean i dont understand where people are coming from when they point out that nolan couldnt have done the same with other religious texts to have a woman demand oppenheimer to read it out while she was riding him thats what made it problematic to them not the use of the quote not the use of the gita in the story 

its not about who cares and who doesnt i am certainly not the one throwing a tantrum lol clearly as i see it the indian film board kept it in which is great but it wouldnt have been able to keep it in if the quote belonged to the bible or quran thats the point and its a valid point there is a clear demarcation of what is acceptable and what is not if anything this helps the hindu communitys tolerant  stance even more at the same time the lines are clearly drawn on the sand 

and am no white knight   literally or figuratively the assumption is indeed hilarious",2023-07-22 19:28:39
well i find the thought of oppenheimer having  disgusting,2023-07-29 18:19:31

"“on december 25 1991 the soviet hammer and sickle flag lowered for the last time over the kremlin thereafter replaced by the russian tricolor earlier in the day mikhail gorbachev resigned his post as president of the soviet union leaving boris yeltsin as president of the newly independent russian state”

russian wasn’t started until 1991 you should’ve learned that in school do your research people in this country like you worry me",2023-07-24 05:30:25
i just left the film too like i said way too many characters who are unexplained totally convoluted scientists and politicians with no explanation of their story zero mention of axis vs allies which is absurd for a film that takes place during ww2 called “russia” throughout movie not as soviet union oppenheimer missed the deadline to fight the germans with his bomb so no he had no “head start”  had killed himself before japan was bombed,2023-07-24 05:21:18
"i would assume its a valid thought to ask the lead of a product to ensure qa if youre building a product you would deal with the habits of your users eg apple succeeded because it dumbed down their ux or reddit causing controversy because their users want a different app or placing accountability on  sm when fake news spread by their users or on gun manufacturers when the users 

id figure someone who expounds the virtues of the cinematic experience would find a way to ensure qa eg the theatres who had technical issues  even my theatre was doing mic checks up until the movie started the screeching of the mic checks was not fun",2023-07-22 02:39:01
this was a helpful explanation and now i understand the movie better thanks i would like to mention that i don’t know anything about history and i’ve never taken an in depth ww2 history lesson i was in high school during covid they cut a lot of stuff out of the curriculum so as someone who hadn’t heard of oppenheimer prior to a few days ago it was a lot to process,2023-07-25 22:56:23
i think i kinda overplayed the “fell asleep” part because i’m pretty sure it was only for like 10 ish minutes it was also kinda right around the part where the bomb went off so i don’t think i missed too much of the strauss parts of the movie the strauss parts are what confused me also i think even aside from falling asleep the movie isn’t super easy to understand for someone with minimal knowledge on the topic i know i should have just done pre movie research but tbh i don’t care enough about ww2 to research it,2023-07-26 00:01:41
surprised this wasnt explained in the film,2023-07-27 21:30:47
"yeah and there is also a scene where his wife throws a glass against the wall accusing strauss of being behind it and when albert asks him why he is going through with the hearing he says i have my reasons  


like most of the movie i think they make it ambiguous there is a strong argument to be made that oppie had strong suspicions the entire time to your point you can make an argument he did not it isnt clear to history his reasons for going through with the hearing and nolan did a good job of staying within the grey there i thought",2023-08-23 22:24:04
seems dangerous to ascribe labels like great to any of the men represented in this movie kinda the point of the film,2023-07-26 19:23:00
yes you can his comment was good yours  simple to understand,2023-07-28 04:28:38
"i think most would say physical as it’s a lot easier to see it and picture it an emotional affair is tough because you can’t feel exactly what the other person is feeling to know how strong the feeling really are

like for example you could have a friend that you love more than your significant other but your significant other is the only person you have  with so to them the latter hurts more if you cheat with 

however emotional cheating from the cheaters perspective probably feels more wrong or at least it should in theory i’d feel",2023-07-23 12:34:19
such an interesting question add a  addiction to the mix and youve got a premise for a very interesting philosophical question in a movie about cheating,2023-07-28 15:02:29
emotional loss of trustlove hurts more  you can have with anyone pretty much,2023-07-31 10:12:41
thought he had said lonely both times makes more sense now ha,2023-07-30 19:34:00
"my general read on that scene whatever nolan says philosophically i’m going with “bw” roughly corresponds to strauss’ viewpoint and “color” is oppenheimer’s is that it’s the kind of comment that oppenheimer and frankly i myself might make to  two birds with one stone it makes his relationship with wealthprivilege clear i grew up with some degree of wealth and privilege while also making it clear he’s not from generational money and does understand what life is like for “normal people”

his “lowly shoe salesman” comment is a similar thing…from a certain pointofview it’s dismissive but the more likely read given who j robert oppenheimer was is that it’s ironically lampshading the past i doubt that he gave enough though to shoe salesman to think of them as particularly lowly and that it’s acknowledging an achievement and simply acknowledging what would otherwise be an elephant in the room

i think it goes overall with j robert oppenheimer hiding his arch ironic playfulness this was the guy who’d amuse his colleagues by jumping up and touching the ceiling behind a serious “straight man” facade and often putting his foot in his mouth because he didn’t understand that not everyone was in on the joke

and strauss is literally and symbolically abstract “power” for the purposes of this story he knows enough science to know that he doesn’t have the capacity to create wondrous things like oppenheimer or einstein do even though he gets to ultimately direct and wield them and that constantly eats at him

i know it isn’t established historical fact that strauss was the one who took down oppenheimer but it’s the bet guess so it goes well with this portrait of him",2023-08-17 19:40:08
i saw it it twice and my first was kind bad but tolerable the second was exceptional,2023-08-06 19:21:26
thats kinda what i was hoping for but i walked away with the impression that he was gloating its good to hear that it was more complicated than simply painting him as an ,2023-07-30 21:06:22
also an incredible amount of people were involved in this entire endeavor it wasnt just on oppenheimer the us killed far more people in ww2 than those killed in hiroshima and nagasaki,2023-07-25 01:04:55
similar to the conversation with his wife about the mistress selfindulgence limiting perspective a theme of the movie,2023-08-02 02:46:48
i dont know it sounded truman was like i launched the bomb not you how can you be annoyed that he was sad about building the bomb what the moral implications are what the movie is about there is no way to know what the result would be thats the whole point of the movie if he didnt feel guilt or be troubled by it that would be a problem its good and moral to question yourself and be  yourself to do the right thing people who dont do that are the problem,2023-07-25 04:04:29
"as the movie progresses it gets less scattered this is intentional nolan was heavy on this with the chance the atmosphere might continue the chain reaction almost 0 but theory can only get you so far 

the jumpy first act narrative second act and focused third act mirror the movement from random quantum mechanics to theory manhattan project to reality cold war",2023-07-29 03:30:34

debatable acting wasn’t always about that jimmy stewart was always jimmy stewart john wayne was always john wayne even when not in westerns et  and that was almost the intent because people came to see their star not a role it can still be effective check out rdj’s earlier work if you haven’t already chaplin two guys etc he’s always been who he is but he’s still manages to slip into roles,2023-08-02 05:56:36
yeah i read about it later and found out the scene was factual which is pretty incredible given what a movie moment it was,2023-07-27 05:42:25
 oppenheimer totally disregarding him the first time they meet and then him slapping the clipboard out of his hands the 2nd time was so  funny,2023-08-06 22:05:44
"david l hills testimony really did happen  the scene was from the senate hearing’s transcript he was testifying in his role as the chairman of the federation of american scientists

and though the film didnt flesh it out he was one of the scientists who built the chicago pile",2023-07-27 04:56:24
but he was against using it regardless of how you feel about the situation the militaryoffice is the one who used the bomb not the scientists he would be against them especially when at this point jro was against the advancement of it but again moreso than strauss or jro he was against the ideal and said what he said on that basis,2023-07-24 14:17:37
it was the world’s first nuclear reactor,2023-07-30 16:14:14
its actually not clear that espionage sped up the soviet bomb program at all they were held back by the time it takes to produce enough fissile material not by the theory of bomb design they got it so fast because they had plenty of brilliant scientists of their own and because knowing that something is possible makes it a  of a lot easier,2023-07-27 00:31:44
"truman didnt understand the atomic bomb at all he just thought of it as any other military weapon until the reports of the aftermath of hiroshima came in

far from being a selfish act it was one of immense cultural understanding that few people today would believe an old white guy in the 1940s would be capable of people  on stimson for this line dont understand the complexity of that situation or japanese culture",2023-07-25 14:48:26
us bombers were already killing almost a million japanese by that point  nuclear bomb  count were only a fraction of that   and i think the movie does not take any stance whatsoever in it  the movie is just about oppenheimer  even he was not against bombing of japan just against the development of hydrogen bombs a contradiction that was pointed out to him in one of the pivotal moments in this movie,2023-07-22 14:17:39
"i suggest watching “fog of war” it’s a documentary by errol morris about the life of robert mcnamara 

he explains at length just how terribly we’d already firebombed the  out of japan he admits if we’d lost the war he’d have been prosecuted as a war criminal 

they even mention in oppenheimer briefly how the fire bombing of tokyo killed 100k civilians 

i’m not justifying it but at the same time we were already kinda doing worse damage",2023-07-22 15:36:35
when did i say they were justified the original commenter said that nuclear bombs were inevitable are you that naive to think that even if the us decided not to drop 2 bombs that someone in sometime in history would not have eventually dropped it the movie even included the philosophy of ‘does the end justify the means’ when you try to think of the moral dilemma here there are magnitudes of devastation of whichever way you want to frame or reframe the problem  the chain reaction oppenheimer started was more than just civilian lives the us bombing of those cities were less devastating than hundreds of conflicts before and after that event however nothing consumed more lives in less time than that weapon try to understand beyond the political circus in the movie and think why would the us turn so quickly on oppenheimer since the bomb pretty much started the cold war that is implied heavily this movie is way beyond your own comprehension of what’s morally right and what’s morally wrong humans are rational actors who continually do irrational things to the detriment of hisher own kind,2023-07-22 15:40:12

secondly the race to build atomic weapons was on no matter if the us wanted it or not it comes down to game theory each player is going to optimize their position and assume the other player is going to optimize theirs it isnt that they were trying not to think of the future its that they wanted to have control of the future and assume they are the most rationale player

not to mention that it isnt one person making a decision large human organizations are beauracratic entities of their own you may could argue the president had some control but the film points out how little any one individual has control of situations on this scale of humanity even oppenheimer himself",2023-07-23 04:34:02

"no i’m asking for better visualization the scene where the scientists all gather after the bomb show a blonde woman laughing then suddenly contrasts with a scene of that woman crying you saying that showing a japanese woman crying would have been “too many visuals”

and later in the film his guilt is mentioned several times you think that it makes more sense to show his visual ponderings on the structure of atoms and energy in the beginning of the film but even hinting at japanese imagery would have been “too much” okay",2023-07-22 02:40:34

thank you for mentioning this almost everything else was great about this movie every word and dialogue was great especially loved the initial banter between pugh and murphy in the first few meetings with chevalier but the gita scene irked me a lot too it definitely felt out of place and a little disrespectful,2023-07-21 11:20:13

"a lot of people associated the bombing to truman before oppenheimer for sure though especially those arent in interested in science

i bet the movie changes that",2023-07-25 11:45:02
i think it was interesting in that while his reasoning showed his disturbing emotional detachment from the violence it was also very sensible to recognise that kyoto was not a viable target for the message they were trying to send because of its cultural significance,2023-07-26 07:03:34

i don’t know how you can watch this movie and come away still really thinking that yes the bombings averted a larger loss of life from an invasion of mainland japan but the consequences down the line have been disastrous and brought us much closer to the brink on multiple occasions than we ever were during wwii there was no right call just varying bad ones,2023-07-21 11:48:09

"it didn’t have to be you were meant to be left in awe at the fireball the pinnacle of science oppenheimer looking into that world he always thought existed beyond ours it’s meant to be surreal

kinda agree tbh but i didnt watch it at the best theatre,2023-07-21 19:37:07
i was also just whelmed by that but i dont think there is a way you could do justice to that kind of destruction on screen in retrospect letting our imagination take over was the right move creatively,2023-07-22 12:54:11
thats cool its just obvious to me that anyone making this statement hasnt been beau i barely felt anything watching oppenheimer aside from brief anticipation before the test,2023-07-21 13:48:20

"of course he wouldn’t have stopped the hydrogen bomb but limiting oppenheimers impact to this minuscule detail is losing sight of the bigger picture 

a person with oppenheimers profile in the lime light for ten more years could have changed significantly impacted the stance on how many of these bombs we really need of course that would have been only the us but it could have dramatically speed up the process of deweaponizing or even hampering the amount of weapons build",2023-07-24 00:04:07

the refining process for u235 from u238 was arduous whole plutonium was readily available iirc the uranium bomb was 64 kg of material while the plutonium one was 6 kg we also had multiple spare cores at that point trinity the one we used demon core so obviously mass producing plutonium was easier,2023-07-24 18:28:07
agreed they could have made that way shorter like huges’ legal proceedings in the aviator didn’t feel like a good use of time to spend it all on strauss’ beef if they were going to make it this much longer i would have preferred to have learned more about the bomb,2023-08-06 22:47:14

i actually want to go back and look for the moment when oppenheimer stops becoming the influencer and starts becoming the influencee because i feel like that moment happened way before the bomb dropped strauss kept saying he ran los alamos like a cult and maybe there was some cult of personality for a time but i think by the time they were deciding where to drop the bombs oppenheimer was being bombarded by opinions to the point of complete indecision at least as depicted in the movie,2023-07-21 13:31:57

"truman was right in that case oppenheimer was a genius at building the bomb but he wasn’t qualified to deal with the moral ethical and strategic implications of using the bomb 

oppenheimer’s soft spot for communism left him blind to the danger posed by the postwar soviet union the iron curtain was descending over europe and oppenheimer’s suggestion of sharing our nuclear weapons with the soviets was lunacy to politicians

as for the “crybaby” comment it’s worth remembering that oppenheimer had never known the horrors of war before his invention  tens of thousands of people truman however had commanded a heavy artillery battery in wwi specifically the bloody meuseargonne offensive he knew the devastation that bombs could bring and saw this silver spooned intellectual as a pansy for not being able to handle the burden of it",2023-08-05 14:43:21

what else can i tell you we almost ended up with einstein as an electrical engineer his dad and uncle owned an struggling electric company he grew up middle class and albert nearly called back from his physics studies to take over the family business cool huh",2023-07-26 11:46:17
yea i think getting away from a structure helped a lot i guess there was a structure here but it seemed a lot more fluid and in service of the story than some of his past efforts i should say that i still really liked the structure of dunkirk but it also feels somewhat unnecessary to the story,2023-07-22 17:50:58

that was the theme of the entire ending einstein monologue,2023-07-21 21:49:34
"what i got from that scene was multiple nukes going off but just one and only one starting the ignition of nitrogen spreading around the globe with it distinctly different to the others with that and the past tense of i think we did and the repeated emphasis and repetition of non zero odds though out the movie and they very scene suggests to me the movie is implying a split world hypothesis 

which means einstein is saying he think the world might have already ended just not our one as implying a future fate set in motion i think would have got a different wording not in past tense 

which means einstein is saying the world already ended just not our one which means einstein is saying the world already ended just not our one

i think we experience free will far more deeply than we actually have it this movie was a great example of this everyone had their role to play and the totality of this program government people whatever you want to call it becomes an entity of its own no one person can take the blame responsibility or anything else

i think most peoples lives are the same just on a much smaller scale everyone has their place in the world and thats a role that we can never really escape and i dont think its one that we really get to choose either",2023-07-24 18:48:38

they even discussed the fire bombings in the movie,2023-07-22 02:52:27
the realistic alternative wasnt invasion it was starving japan they surrendered just in time for the us to ship massive amounts of food to japan had they delayed their surrender by even a little bit crop failures would have led to a double digit percentage of japans population possibly tens of millions to succumb to starvation,2023-07-21 22:30:30
the alternative they were most worried about was russia entering the war against japan which would have been imminent had the bomb not been dropped the geopolitical considerations of the bomb were as consequential to the decisionmaking as the strategic military considerations,2023-07-21 17:51:21
"literally in the movie it went from a race against the  in building an atomic bomb into a race against the soviets

and yes we knew what japan was up to and knew they were up for surrendering and even then even if they werent going to surrender saying that it was necessary is just psychotic to say especially when you learn that

1 soviets were literally ready to go to invade japan and help end the war with the us 

2 dropping a nuke wasnt even nearly close to where the generals were which we knew at the time they werent even there it was far away from where they were and it was literally drop on civilians only

japan was also on low supply as well the morale was low but yet saying that it was necessary to drop the bomb is psychotic because it wasnt when you add all those factors in

how can you win a war when morale is low all of this was to show off to the soviets why else do you think in the movie they even mention not wanting to share this information with the soviets",2023-07-22 15:26:12

there’s a lot of criticism surrounding that book because it is very biased toward shedding oppenheimer in a good light that omits a lot about the negative aspects of his character as reported by those who worked witharound the man

"i think the scenes are great especially the one in the interview room haunting

but the only reason i wouldn’t hate if they didn’t exist is because it would open the movie to even more people and young people like it or not a lot of people straight up will not see a movie or show it to people in their family if it has nudity it’s the only reason i understand people calling it “unnecessary”",2023-07-23 12:59:45

if the question is about choosing the lesser evil then i have no doubt most people would choose a world with nuclear weapons which demands fewer sacrifices to be made but at the expense of a precarious balance however if we end up destroying each other in one fell swoop will those sacrifices have been worth it history has shown us that despite all the devastation weve inflicted upon ourselves so far weve continued to endure and survive but the advent of nuclear arms means that our fate is now less certain,2023-07-23 03:05:31

"yeah its clear a later government thought he was hard done by and gave him a medal as a public show of making things right

his reputation and legacy being the stakes of the committee hearing arent strong narratively either because at the time his reputation to himself is the destroyer of worlds who was responsible for upwards of 200000 dead japanese people

him fighting for his security clearance  while giving emily blunt her best scene in the movie  was the weakest part narratively",2023-07-22 01:15:53
point taken playing devils advocate though i think its reasonable to assume politics had to play a part in this but im not sure how much you or even i expected there to be i think the third act is what alot of people will see as the most problematic and i can see why but it worked for me i can understand why it seemed underwhelming though i will agree that the trailer and everything presented in marketing led me to think it would be alot different,2023-07-21 12:24:54

"1st funny in any sense of the word doesnt mean more splosions

2nd dark comedy doesnt mean silly or laugh out loud and the darkness or the comedy doesnt have to be pointed at the deaths of the japanese or the internment it it just as well be pointed at the developers of the bomb or the politicians that used it or even at the absurdity of the traps humanity sets for itself

3rd have you seen dr strangelove deals with essentially the same subject and went over just fine im not saying oppenheimer should be as quirky as dr sl but it shows that even deadly serious and unthinkably horrendous topics can still have life to then and mustnt necessarily be bores",2023-07-27 11:06:09
 this  got me i felt the movie was unresolved then totally relays an inaccurate ending of the movie,2023-08-26 04:10:56
"i will in fact eat crow on the scene in question being  completely unfounded nolan did mention that he twisted the story when he chose to show einstein looking over the numbers 

anyway the whole point of my original comment wasnt to knock on nolan but rather to say perhaps the subject matter would have been better formatted as a mini series it helped cover chernobyl and would have done great with oppenheimer",2023-08-20 16:24:26
tennessee is midwest no,2023-07-24 21:57:53
"i actually came up with that all on my own i guess i’m unoriginal or the critique is accurate

it’s more an exhaustion of explosion and action movies than a critique of people that didn’t enjoy oppenheimer",2023-07-25 16:18:38
"i guess i said that due to the historical context i read about nolan definitely made it seem like more of a personal vandetta against oppie due to humiliating him regarding exporting radioisotopes and thinking he made einstein hate him  it was slightly implied since strauss was chairman of the aec and the lawyer he appointed as prosecutor was hammering him about opposition to the h bomb although in the context of the movie strauss was just using that as a say to get back at him rather than actually caring if he was a soviet sympathist 

regardless the atomic bomb was a huge plot point for the first 2 hours of the movie the aftermath and oppenheimers feelings about his creation is also just as interesting in my opinion he regretted giving humanity the fire that he thinks will allow themselves to destroy themselves",2023-07-24 22:36:11
70mm imax or liemax imax digital only saying that bc i read the digital conversions like imax digital of the film didnt have the same sound quality as the 70mm imaxregular  which nolan needs to spend more time on the conversions  not everyone is near a good 70mm theater,2023-07-23 04:38:18
losing his security clearance is not a small outcome that meant that he was effectively out of a career it meant that the same government that once used him  turned on him the last hour shows how people especially the powers that be can use others to achieve their ends and dispose them theyll award you but itll be for them saying the third act is boring when its probably the most important part really demonstrates how this movie completely went over your head go back to tic tok,2023-07-22 20:21:31
for sure and if you want to share more thoughts dissenting or not i love having my pov challenged it often helps me realize things or think about things in a different way i think many films are better after a 2nd watch but definitely nolans this movie still clears tenet for me which i enjoyed but i still think is intentionally confusing after multiple watches haha,2023-11-29 01:21:31
i think the point is to show the nuanced nature of the bomb it has also saved many lives and ended a war titanic had nothing to do with war it was a flat out disaster while oppenheimer’s story also builds up around the hubris but gives a more complex insight it’s common in both pictures that a “crash” is inevitable but what facilities it in oppenheimer is more intimate,2023-07-25 10:19:09
i don’t think it was remotely a let down even knowing it didn’t resemble a nuclear explosion at all,2023-12-25 19:21:48
yes but it seems that you’re only supporting my point  the most interesting aspects of oppenheimer are those which relate to the development and effects of the atomic bomb not his security clearance hearing,2023-07-29 04:54:54

"in light of past nolan filmsyes that is very very true lol

i still maintain that there were a lot of moments that could have used some breathing room i also never said that i had trouble following the story but there are a lot of people online stating definitively that they struggled to follow so its a bit strong to say that nothing was hard to follow when the evidence clearly suggests that many people were finding it hard to follow

i do see however your statement about the pacing and structure being deliberate i can totally see that but i think it was a mistake that will make it extremely difficult for a lot of people to connect with and care about this film as it remains in theaters and after",2023-07-24 02:25:04

also ive never read the book but i feel like he couldve cut down on the information conveyed i think he tried to tackle too much a story about oppenheimer and the making of the bombs and then the subsequent shame and fame that overcomes him would have been enough for me",2023-07-21 20:54:23

im not the one who didnt understand the story telling style of oppenheimer you cant even follow a simple reddit comment thread no wonder its hard for you to follow a movie,2023-08-20 17:36:54
i agree and it shows in his most recent films,2023-07-23 04:56:58

the security stuff is also part of the red scare so i find it kind of important to the story telling of the world before during and after the war,2023-08-21 20:28:26
"i guarantee you the majority of people in the world have know idea who oppenheimer even is he is not some well known well loved figure because of the security clearance hearings and his removal from political life he basically faded away into obscurity because of the the effects of the hearings the fact you think its irrelevant to his story and think its the equivalent of getting a drivers license shows how little you understand the effect it had on him and his life do you have to sit through a hearing and have every aspect of your life dredged up and scrutinized every time you get your license renewed not only are the hearings a major turning point in his life and worth showing especially the underhandedness of it it was also used as a story telling device for the earlier parts of the movie

and the main explosion jump scare as you call it is how explosions work with the distance they were from the bomb they would see the explosion and not hear it until moments later its literally how it happens in reality and i didnt ask you how many jump scares there were i asked you what jump scares you are talking about can you name the others because i cant think at all of what youre talking about",2023-08-20 19:47:20

its not a joke there was a special feature on the dvd i laughed the whole time because it is then soooo obvious how the other charactrers are manipulating this guy and running circles around him because he cant remember i think the success of that film is what lead christopher nolan to his obsession with nonlinear first person narratives that has gotten to the point of his style eating itself today,2023-08-21 16:53:14
"your argument is that you think maverick isn’t about  maverick

 but you can humbly  

 okay nevermind i guess

 is it even a top 5 nolan

"although the movie was bloated beyond measure it still managed to get all the details of his earlier mid and life during the hearings encapsulated in 3hrs it got confusing at times due to the character decisions that they made due to reasons known best to them like kitty not leaving her husband after facing humiliation in front of hearing committee oppenheimer still wanting to make bomb knowing nazis had stopped and that the bomb could start a nuclear weapons race among the countries and why strauss would feel that oppenheimer thought of him as inferior as to making einstein not make contact with him and insulting him about his concerns of freely transporting radioactive isotopes as the movie follows real life story of flawed and conflicted characters at the same time it only seemed only way possible to present the facts in the way they happened without trying to provide much logic into the decisions characters made ‘cause that would’ve made the film pretentious beyond measure
it also made clear with oppenheimer being the character study main subject of the film why his nemesis who tarnished his reputation and made him face the guilt that he already had over and over again with shifts in oppenheimer and staruss’s perspectives being intertwined  it surely was exhausting near the end but still it was quite satisfactory to know and think that all of these events happened and it closed both their perspectives on a good note with that hint through that last scene that oppeneheimer could never really escape the guilt knowing what could happen 7510",2023-07-25 18:39:36
"unfortunately im getting the sense that people like getting  with needlessly convoluted information dumps and calling it brilliant drama

this is a work of fiction yes but this is a part of history and there are no shortcuts more importantly its a part of history which has and is going to dictate your future there were some inaccuracies yes but the delivery was perfect in showcasing multiple povs and how misinformation actually works

im getting the feeling that youre one of those people who asks for proof and  doesnt read an essay when someone ultimately provides it to you

i dont blame you many people find history and its gory details boring but that ignorance is on your conscience i guess

timing couldnt be any better either were at the brink of deleting ourselves and its more intense right now than it was in the cold war",2023-08-07 17:46:47
"i think the point was that the movie was bieng told from the perspective of two people

oppenheimer and lewis strauss
and we as an audience saw and knew exactly what these characters saw and knew nothing more

in order to see the bombings the movie would either have to randomly cut to a scene of the bombings which would have been jarring and not mesh narratively with the rest of the movie
or the movie would have to introduce the point of view of a 3rd character which would be equally jarring

besides the point of the movie wasnt to see the consequences of the atomic bombing everyone knows what those consequences are
the point was to see oppenheimers reaction which the movie focused on",2023-08-14 07:41:40
"the loss of his security clearance ended oppenheimers role in government and policy he became an academic exile cut off from his former career and the world he had helped to create the reputations of those who had testified against oppenheimer were tarnished as well though oppenheimers reputation was later partly rehabilitated by presidents john f kennedy and lyndon b johnson the brief period when scientists were viewed as a public policy priesthood ended and thereafter would serve the state only to offer narrow scientific opinions scientists working in government were on notice that dissent was no longer tolerated

you dont need to be smart to understand this movie or any of the scenes in it it  and so do you,2023-11-27 05:04:11
alright buddy ill let you finish  nolan off in peace  bye lol,2023-11-25 17:36:53
it had the scene where they watched pictures but we only see their reaction and i believe that was far stronger than if they actually showed the bombings themselves the movie is about oppenheimer and his feelings not about the bombs,2023-07-22 07:41:47
my guess is that it just wouldn’t have worked from a cost standpoint that would pretty expensive and nolan clearly wasn’t interested in cgi from a practical standpoint idk how you would be able to recreate a blast so big that it would create a mushroom cloud and they also would’ve had to somehow recreate japan’s cities to some extent from an artistic standpoint i think having two shots of separate explosions would’ve been repetitive once the cats out of the bag it out in all it just seems too ambitious and would’ve probably doubled the already insane budget,2023-07-22 07:18:12

"from my understanding the letterbox shots are shown inside a widescreen presentation that already has black bars above and below the screen the theatre doesnt handle changing the aspect ratios shot by shot they just play the film as received

the versions of dunkirk in your example that had the correct viewing experience would have been properly set up imax screenings and not a typical theatre version

this is the whole reason anyone would even see these films in imax for the optimal viewing experience",2023-07-26 19:29:03

"joker is rated r for strong bloody violence disturbing behavior language and brief  images

oppenheimerit received the r rating for sexuality nudity and language 

you see the difference it couldve easily been 13 without the intimate scenes it sounds ironic but thats the world of hollywood we live in a nuclear bomb or some  is surprisingly too tame to immediately recieve an r rating so if you want to blame guys like me the first to blame is the mpa

you are blind trailers are about making the bomb not his private lifes,2023-08-03 17:52:16
i think the horror of it was portrayed beautifully in those white hot flash scenes and his reactions to hearing of the results of the bomb no need to show anymore since we’ve all seen enough ww2 stuff to understand and the charred body and child screaming as they are instantly cooked is enough misery for me,2023-08-12 16:18:26
i think that’s a bit played out we’ve seen enough ww2 media to not need that direct of a portrayal and humanity is destroyed the chain reaction just hasn’t got there yet which is the actual horror to focus on from the movie murphy’s law and what not ,2023-08-12 15:51:02
"why can’t all the criticism on here be more like yours lol

"knowing that the script is written from oppenheimer’s first person perspective it sort of explains the seriousness in tone that’s how he saw the world saw himself 

but i agree with steven that your criticism is something i can understand at least it could have used a little bit more warmth at times 

nonetheless a phenomenal film imo",2023-07-23 02:15:23

"appreciate the conversation i don’t think there was anything subtle about that scene which is why i found it heavy handed oppenheimer states to kitty that none of the details of his affair were new he misinterpreted her angerhurt as she states the issue is now it’s all out there for everyone to know she hates what they’re doing to his name his legacy throughout the interrogation we see her take issue with oppie not “fighting” back 

anyway the film could’ve done without the florence scenes which could have shaved some time but that’s just my perspective thanks for the chat",2023-08-28 13:27:29
totally difference of opinion and i appreciate your perspective your right it definitely invoked feelings of discomfort in reflecting on the movie though i felt it could have been removed and the story still tightcompelling but then there would have been even fewer female characters which is an entirely different issue,2023-08-28 13:29:28
that all his wife could see after the details got out to the public,2023-09-02 21:56:47
"the ultimate stakes of the plot were oppenheimer potentially losing his political influence in a sham trial because of his extreme views and thus losing the political capital to steer nuclear policy toward deescalation it wasnt made explicit until nearing the end of the movie

until then it was a mental game of okay this is probably going to be relevant later let me save it in my mind palace for when it becomes relevant to the point you cant to hold all these limes before we finally know what the story is really about by then you already forgot who this name they mentioned belongs to because they spoke two lines one hour ago",2023-07-28 16:57:05
im sorry but none of what you said is even coherent,2023-07-28 23:14:09
i fully expected people to be vaporized in that scene while oppenheimer was have an anxiety attack maybe not extreme gore but something unnerving to really cement the horrifying effects of the bomb or if not that burnt shadows like those seen in japan after the explosion i dont know i expected more but i understand the bomb wasnt the main point of the movie was but still,2023-07-21 09:43:51

if you don’t find  to be beautiful then you’re just telling on yourself the quote is used there to run parallel with his feelings of culpability in her death as well as when it’s used again because of his feelings of culpability when the bomb is successful it’s very straightforward i don’t understand how you don’t get that,2023-07-21 15:25:55
"j robert oppenheimer didn’t view the bhagwat geeta as just “poetry” the real man knew it was a sacred document

and youre completely ignoring 99 of what i said

oppenheimer wasnt born into a buddhist tradition therefore his knowledge of and respect for buddhism had to be acquired from somewhere when jean is looking at his bookcase he tells her that he is still learning sanskrit therefore we can infer that his knowledge and appreciation of buddhism is still in development the film also makes it pretty clear that this scene happens when he is still very early in his career and while i dont know when he came to develop his understanding of buddhism we can further infer that this scene takes place when his knowledge is still in development youre expecting the film to portray his relationship with buddhism as fullydeveloped throughout the entirety of his life

its also worth noting that oppenheimer is seen with a copy of ts eliots the waste land which contains the poem the hollow men given the content of the hollow men this is fairly onthenose and also very ironic but more importantly the western poetic tradition presents epic poetry in a very particular way epic poetry recounts the founding of civilisations thats what the iliad is  the independent citystates of ancient greece band together for the trojan war and in the aftermath of the siege the coalition holds together thats why the period is referred to as the hellenic period  because of helen of troy likewise the odyssey recounts odysseus journey home and emphasises his relationship to the gods its a way of passing on the cultural values of the time western education would have seen the bhagavad gita as being of a similar ilk especially given that oppenheimer was educated during the modernist period

the real oppenheimer may not have seen it as poetry but the film is absolutely trying to position him as someone who approaches this as an intellectual pursuit first and foremost but misses the context thats his flaw now i am become death the destroyer of worlds isnt just referring to the atomic bomb  it also refers to the personal and private worlds that he destroys",2023-07-21 23:20:31

"i’m no filmmaker but until my opinions on the film solidify and i watch it again i’m going to softly stand on the side of ‘nolan chose the story that he thought would be best represented thru the chosen medium’ the movie affected me deeply and from my perspective he produced a film which succeeded at being a romantic and political drama a documentary an action film i felt every emotion nolan was trying to elicit from me and maybe that makes me a fanboy

i was also baked off my ",2023-07-22 19:20:12

"that is not the defense you think it is 

besides a whole act of the movie is split with a character that isnt oppenheimer a lot of the emotional impact of the third act is also supposed to come from the scientists that oppenheimer worked with but we have literally no idea from the movie what their relationship was like it makes it empty i think an important part of oppenheimer is the people he worked and lived close to for 4 years of his life

certainly the most excitement i’ve seen around a biopic in a very long time i assume some of it must be due to the barbenheimer cultural phenemon but it’s also just pretty timely subject matter told by a masterful director i don’t love everything nolan does but he’s definitely a theater lover’s director,2023-07-30 09:24:02

"easy

1 oppenheimer a european taught physics student who prefers theory over practical experimentation returns to the us and takes up a job teaching at uc berkeley
2 oppenheimer develops relationships with communists both cardcaring and sympathetic including his brother and first and second wives
3 ww2 to breaks out and oppenheimer is selected to lead the manhattan project believing atomic weapons necessary in order to beat the nazis
4 oppenheimer and groves assemble a team of scientists including edward teller to work on the bomb in los alamos new mexico
5 after years of work the atomic bomb is successfully tested and eventually used against the japanese
6 oppenheimer embraces his newfound celebrity as the father of the bomb but suffers from guilt regarding its use especially as he had ignored the objections of some of his fellow scientists
7 following the war oppenheimer becomes an advisor to the us atomic energy commission where butts heads with lewis strauss over the exportation of radioactive isotopes the development of tellers hydrogen bomb and the nuclear arms race policy
8 strauss orchestrates oppenheimer to lose his security clearance in a show trial digging up oppenheimers previous brushes with communism and turning oppenheimer into a political pariah
9 years later the senate rejects strausss nomination as secretary of commerce in a hearing after criticism from the scientific community about strausss handling of oppenheimers security clearance
10 some years later oppenheimer is later awarded an award by the president of the united states in an act of reconciliation",2023-07-22 17:24:54

i keep saying this too i learned nothing about him half the movie is about him losing his security clearance everything else is completely rushed or just chalkboard mathematical talk that feels meaningless he goes from meeting emily blunt to her saying shes divorcing her husband for him in like 15 seconds its terrible storytelling could have easily been a good story just telling his life in a linear way starting with him as a child so we could understand him as a character,2023-07-25 16:45:18

"yea the movie gave me the impression that the development of the abomb from the manhattan project was inevitable and it was just smooth sailing for over 2 years we never learn what technological and engineering challenges the team faced which im certain there were many the movie criminally never showed the urgency that the us team faced in the theoretical bomb race against  germany which was a huge factor in the whole operation

the movie also never showed us the true scale of the entire operation how secretive it really was and the lengths the us government went through to hide the entire city from the entire world as a history buff i think this is such a missed opportunity and it would had been ways to build tension as to who the soviet spy was",2023-07-24 09:02:54
" it ruined his reputation and he could no longer speak up about his beliefs

i feel like maybe because the dialogue was drown out by the music and sound but its hard to understand what exactly his beliefs are when you can barely hear it imo that round table discussion aside from strauss being humiliated at that one hearing a pretty important point in the film thats supposed to paint the conflict between oppie and strauss but that single scene got cut into bits and pieces and shown probably a minimum of 10 times throughout the film making it pretty incoherent to follow between all the other things going on sure you can say its an artistic choice but it feels wholly unnecessary and reeks of nolanisms",2023-07-24 16:42:56

i have not,2023-07-22 13:03:03
you seem confused,2023-07-21 16:18:40
i think the issue here is your expectation everything in the movie is done to show us something about oppenheimer it isnt about jean tatlock or kitty in fact the only characters shown are the ones who impacted roberts life everything is only explored far enough to get a point across not to get you invested in these historical people it could be argued that the approach is too robotic but thats another topic its totally intentional though and the actors  nolan are aware that jeans role was small they said so in interviews,2023-07-27 04:02:26
"maybe i wasnt clear enough but theres a difference between liking movies which are made by nolan and liking nolan movies theres plenty of his movies that did well and had great appeal for reasons other than the things that define nolans work

i think oppenheimer is a much stronger nolan movie than it is a movie that happens to have his name in the credits thats all im saying",2023-07-23 09:34:57
"okay sure but then why go so hard with this one choice it’s not like it was a restrained creative choice if he’s gonna go there he should go there

i thought the additions of mccarthyismaddled dc power politics did a lot for the overall themes of the movie seeing oppenheimer come to terms with they need you until they dont was incredible,2023-07-22 02:51:42
the movie is about oppenheimer not the bomb i thought it was important to explore the long lasting impacts of it on his life,2023-07-22 03:17:02
"bruh what everything after defines what happened before you cant just end on the test or on hiroshima because not only did the political environment fall through but the nuclear arms race during the cold war is super important it changes the moral imperative from ending a war to fighting an endless arms race seeing how people who were previously against the bomb or literally wrote petitions turn into leading men in the arms race is important 

the last 30 minutes is the necessary come down it would be  tasteless to end on a shaky triumph like hiroshima the nukes effectively changed geopolitics forever",2023-07-22 03:16:29

"strauss is there in order to emotionally connect us to the microscopic lenses most of the military brass viewed the bomb with for strauss the bomb was just attached to this guy who humiliated him they envisioned it only as a personal issue while we see the contrast with the scientists and oppenheimer who grapple with the macro effect 

his entire point is to vector oppenheimers emotional response to his actions into a political scheme",2023-07-22 03:19:27

anyways you can’t actually portray nagasaki or hiroshima in 10 minutes if you want an indepth hour long telling of nagasaki or hiroshima you should probably look for a movie titled nagasaki or hiroshima",2023-07-24 01:52:37
exactly this his part of the speech i just wish germany hadnt surrendered before we could bomb them too as if he didnt just obliterate hundreds of thousands of innocent people now hes joking about nonchalantly wasting hundreds of thousands more like its just a cool little thing to do like it was a video game to get the new high score,2023-07-24 02:04:59
"you can absolutely differentiate making the atomic bomb versus the aftermath making the atomic bomb was a 3 hour movie the aftermath of hiroshima and japan wouldve been equally long there’s simply not enough time to cover every topic so they made the topic about oppenheimer who the movie is named after you can’t effectively show the effects of hiroshima and nagasaki in a 15 minute period if you think it should’ve covered an hour or more of the movie you should find a movie called hiroshima or nagasaki 

how much insight do you want i to an affair it doesn’t take a long dialogue to understand cheating is wrong everyone knew when the cheating happened it was wrong and a flaw of oppenheimer 

what personal responsibility did you want them to give to oppenheimer the film already mentions how much the bombing weighs on him with him telling the president he has blood on his hands to the room shaking with the cheering best i can describe it 

i think you just weren’t following the film closely enough it’s clear in the film he’s an exuberant arrogant ambitious man at the start of the film and someone with cognitive dissonance by the end who can’t handle the guilt properly",2023-07-24 01:39:58

i agree with the overall complaint of the 3rd act being more “tell” than show but i also think that was the only way to keep the movie to 180 minutes and overall i think it was the right call",2023-08-04 22:32:02
"it’s the same experience and why i feel pretty strongly about the last hour of oppenheimer being bad

it was the first 2 hours were that,2023-07-23 00:03:05
yeah you clearly didn’t read or know anything about him very obvious you don’t,2023-08-08 19:46:58
this is ignoring the insane explosion scenes again not everything has to be marvel man sounds like the movie was just not for you in general the movie is already selling like crazy so your last comment is honestly just blatant stupidity,2023-07-23 07:25:02
"a single typo is what youre harping on thats your argument

watching it in imax was lit me and my wife are most likely going to drive to the next city which is a few hours away to watch it in 70mm,2023-07-23 16:19:29
"i have been questioning over the last few years why i used to like his films as a teenager every since he got rid of his editor lee smith and hans zimmer his movies have been too quickly edited less interesting stories and filled with music that is illsuited for the scenes also his disdain for women in his work is something that makes his filmography increasingly problematic to me

i just feel like her being  was unnecessary because it was clearly done to arouse the viewer and if it wasnt then why have her  in frame with   and in focus during the seated conversation scene or during the trial fantasy

nudity can be fine for me in the right context and more skillful directors have used it to great effect titanic is not a film i like at all because of its exploitation of a tragedy and my aversion to james cameron

this nudity was distracting for someone like me that has trouble focusing and is irritated by the lack of visual storytelling of the film thus far it felt like he added it in specifically because he needed butts in seats both cillian and emily blunt have been ok with nudity in the past but why not here too perhaps nolan only wanted to have the youngest woman in the main cast  because he only wanted her to be a sad  object for his protagonist and anything more would be a turnoff it definitely wasnt an excuse to use her rising star power and  appeal to get his main demo of straight men

why was oppie seated weirdly crosslegged in a prudish manner hiding his genitals from the camera it would be more realistic to have them sitting without regard to that 

the movie is too quick and it failed to make me care about hidden meanings when i cant follow the basic plot on screen

sorry but i need time to process my feelings on this and this might not be the most eloquent response",2023-07-22 14:25:06
youre dumb,2023-07-30 21:45:41
what do you mean you are someone else entirely lol you a robot  anyway let’s agree to disagree,2023-07-22 13:20:18
thanks karen ,2023-07-23 20:10:13
thing is it’s not like the hiroshima and nagasaki bombings are these secret bits of history that no one knows about no one’s going into this film not knowing the impact of them,2023-07-21 20:40:08
"x200b

again its showing the aftermath through oppenheimers eyes he chooses to look away and so do we i personally thought that scene worked great tell dont show",2023-07-21 20:28:03
"i’d argue they do show the devastation but once again through his eyes you see him when giving the speech he imagines the bright flash and the woman’s skin falling off etc

i don’t think this film is essentially just a focus on what happened in japan it’s about oppenheimer taking responsibility for opening the forbidden door into nuclear weapons that still threaten our existence to this day as displayed in the ending",2023-07-21 20:12:26
i suppose so but at the same time he was complicit in it so you need to really see the consequences of his actions they showed him having all this guilt but you dont really see why,2023-07-21 20:18:57
i have to partly agree partly disagree  i liked the whole straussoppenheimer angle hes the man who discredited the father of the atomic bomb the reason for his exile from further influencing so hes definitely needed why he did that his motivations why others helped its compelling what wasnt was the back and forth of the narrative we wasted too much time on him if this was a hbo max series with hours upon hours to spend this would have been perfect we couldnt really focus on los alamos because of how much importance hes given the trialsenate hearing became the focal point not the making of the bomb and the consequences that followed,2023-07-22 04:42:08
tricky question its grand in imax but at the same time its got very few imax worthy scenes if its gonna be a one time watch id say go ahead theres like a definite chance you might not agree with our opinion cause its been such a divisive movie in that case you might just regret not going for imax,2023-07-22 00:57:33
its so interesting to me reading all these takes and how they are split between greatness and boredom  since i have your attention what is another movie youve seen you could compare the level of boredom to  what is a movie youve seen thats not an action film that wasnt boring  not trying to flame or start a who is better im genuinely curious because i was far from bored in it and i love action films,2023-07-25 13:05:34
"but everybody knows that the bombs were dropped and the consequences of that showing it doesnt alter the story at all its just disaster  for people into explosions

ww2 movies and nuclear bomb movies have been done a million times before the topic of building the bomb and the many decisions that surrounded it is fascinating",2023-08-21 00:19:56
yeah when it isnt a fantasy but also not a documentary its not up to the movie to explain literally everything and serve it on a platter and this movie didnt have to because if you paid attention its not hard to connect everything,2023-07-21 12:44:03
the film is called oppenhiemer not nukes or manhatten project it was always gonna be more about oppenheimer and less about the bombs i watched the same trailers and i never once got the impression that it was actually gonna be about the bombs themselves idk how so many people took that away from rhe trailers,2023-07-21 13:22:16
the film is about oppenheimer and his story told from both subjective and objective perspectives thats why its called oppenheimer and not the gadget or trinity or the atomic bomb all the science and engineering stuff is just one of side elements of the movie not the main subject people who expected otherwise really dont have a justification for that promo material is always designed to  you in to watch the movie regardless what it is thats why it featured many of the scenes with effects and intense score reading the short description of the plot is enough to know what it is about,2023-07-21 12:37:25
he makes pretty movies but his style is all over the place and his narrative structure sucks but yeah  someone who answers an opinion with an insult is exactly the kind of person i’d expect to flock to nolan movies,2023-07-22 02:36:50
you mean to tell me that when something bad happened to oppenheimer due to strauss it was because of strauss wow im so glad they gave us all the black and white i would have never understood that must just be a coincidence that they were almost all time jump scenes and to be fair a few  time jump scenes werent black and white which just means that it was used wrecklessly and needlessly,2023-07-22 18:57:19
"so i cant disagree with you

i love when people cant articulate a problem and instead say oh your opinion is evidence enough that you are wrong

"theres a reason why you didnt know it it was only ever considered a fun thought experiment during the project and became an inside joke between the scientists working on it


i hated that aspect of the movie the dialogue about this whole thing felt so soyfacey to me",2023-07-27 00:53:16
sure they did  a quick google found me camaros with them in the 60s but it wasnt especially rare  every 70s and 80s pickup from my childhood had it so 2002 is definitely a long way off,2023-07-22 06:56:39
"but the kids were not part of his life really he was never home not knowing the names tells a lot more about the character of oppenheimer  of which the movie is about the  scenes also reveal a lot about the character 

it is a biopic dude not a movie about the bomb",2023-07-21 21:10:36
hes a womanizer so yeah they were a must,2023-07-21 20:31:36
the audience can go look at those real pictures themselves though and most people seeing this movie have already seen the destruction in hiroshima and nagasaki as well as the graphic after effects,2023-07-25 19:33:52
which an algorithm can make an cinematic book report out of it i think id rather read the book instead,2023-07-24 14:01:10

"period pieces are extremely expensive people don’t seem to get how expensive they are 

also why again do you care if it is 6080 or 100 nolan is an expert in his field and he got a budget based on reality that someone agreed to half of this film’s budget would have resulted in a different movie 

this trend of complaining about big budgets when we are getting great content is just…don’t get it",2023-07-21 15:38:05
if you think nolan needs barbie to sell well youre kinda delusional  just because a movie isnt for him doesnt mean he hates it  all he has done is praise it,2023-07-23 18:28:15
ah thats a pity they are sort of talking about a man and some people believe that ariadne is actually cobbs wife and is trying to get him to escape the dream world nolans female characters dont talk to each other about anything interesting because they have no depth but in his defense neither do most of his male characters in tenet we cared about what the sidekick guy a little bit because of the ending everyone else including the main character could have died and i would not have minded at all,2023-08-01 00:45:16
"no it was mostly important because all the research he was working on was tied to government contracts which he couldnt continue without the clearance basically all his professional life was cut off then

see even if you get some of the context not explained in the movie anyway you still didnt get why that was so important

the movie does a very bad job at making us understand and therefore care for the third act which is why so many people have a problem with it all in the name of nolans forced obtuseness and complexity",2023-07-23 12:17:05
oh no your response wasn’t unfair at all there are a lot of reasons why i could’ve missed the line some of which are my fault all the missed line caused was a few seconds of confusion,2023-08-01 03:46:41
oh same that last hour with the hearings was still difficult to follow with all the different names i think in general the movie had the nolan vibe of not completely understanding what’s going on while still looking back and being able to say you loved it and that was quite a surprise for me when you consider that it’s a biopic,2023-08-10 00:49:21

well in terms of ww2 america is clearly the moral victor here honestly dropping the atomic bombs was the morally superior option,2023-07-26 23:21:58
obviously i dont deal with absolutes but who do you think produces the weapons who produces the food that feeds the soldiers even the mothers their babies could be turned into soldiers not saying everyone who died in hiroshima and nagasaki to the bomb were war mongers and personally  babies in china but i dont see how some people have a hard time accepting the fact that seemingly nice and innocent people can support directly or indirectly horrific things,2023-07-26 23:20:37
allow me to argue that the manhattan project saves more lives compared to the alternatives without the bombs amphibious assault was necessary which would result in more deaths beside that it would prolong the war which means more japanese and people they were fighting have more time to  each other while the allies prepared the amphibious assault oh yeah not to mention the conventional bombing would continuetokyo bombing killed a similar number of people as one atomic bomb,2023-07-27 04:47:23
eh all movies are far from perfect i personally don’t think the discourse is saying that the movie is without flaws and honestly given that you haven’t specified what exactly you didn’t like about the movie i think it’s more likely that the movie just didn’t work for you like it did for other people is that possible i’m struggling to imagine where the movie is lacking from a craft perspective,2023-08-25 18:01:30
the first  scene yes it was way out of place maybe to emphasize how flawed both of them were she did get turned on by telling him what to do he was still aroused and she let him in as he read maybe she liked the power over him anyway she was toxic and he liked the attention,2023-07-24 00:43:48

"ah yes the typical haha your brain cannot comprehend le cinema you must like mahvel guy ran into one sooner than i thought 

x200b

the sound design for the movie was incredible before the bomb it just felt like the actual impact or lack there of of the bomb was underwhelming  watch any other nuclear bomb vid real or recreation and you can get this sense of scale to them you could tell with this movie  that nolan was very much trying to dance around with an imitation of a nuclear bomb with very good editing and directing decisions which to his credit seems to have mostly worked for a lotta people just not for me 

x200b

top gun mavericks a pretty great recent example of a movie that touted its use of practical effects actually using jets for shooting and easily brought its marketing to the final product i had little to no interest in the movie before it hit but i ended up watching it around 5 times in cinemas last year bought tickets for like 5 other people just to see it because you could actually feel the jet engines roaring 5 minutes into the movie and  much more later on

x200b

with oppenheimer i feel like touting the use of practical effects just really didnt translate as well as it could have",2023-07-25 11:33:53
a movie having no cgi isn’t any more or less inherently impressive than a movie having a lot of cgi it’s 2023 and you’re making a 100 million dollar movie about j robert oppenheimer maybe a bit of cgi to show an atomic blast wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world,2023-07-25 11:07:58
not at all they virtue signal to those voters but the death of unions and particularly mining unions is a huge factor in what flipped west virginia from a dem state to a republican one a combination of automation making non union labor cheaper and the anti union policies that started with reagan drove that,2023-07-26 03:32:26
yeah many of them benefit from unions like everyone else but i think it’s worth making the distinction between politiciansthe direction of the party as a whole and the people who vote for them the former wants to see unions have as little power as possible while many of the latter are open or favorable to them but get distracted by the virtue signaling and moral panic of the party leadership,2023-07-26 12:05:34
the only crime i saw him commit was poisoning an apple but that didnt cause any deaths,2023-08-02 16:05:22

how much do you think you actually learn about oppenheimer just from watching the movie did you find out how oppenheimer was raised what were his parents like what got him into physics in the first place what drove him what were his goals why was he sympathetic to communism  
  
the movie is 3 hours long called oppenheimer but it doesnt even show audience the most fundamental and essential information and qualities about the titular character  
  
so were you asleep for most of it and dreamt that you watched a great biopic about oppenheimer",2023-07-31 06:36:09
dude you need to work on your media comprehension or maybe you’re just pretending you saw the movie when you actually didn’t sorry the movie did it give you enough boombooms,2023-08-02 19:13:37
" how much do you think you actually learn about oppenheimer just from watching the movie did you find out how oppenheimer was raised what were his parents like what got him into physics in the first place what drove him what were his goals

oppenheimer reminded me of the imitation game and your questions here reminded me of a nice detail alan turing tells us that when he was a kid the other kids at school bullied him because he had to separate the peas and the carrots because theyre different colors what similar detail did we get about oppenheimer the only earlylife detail that comes to mind is him reading the bahgavad gitta while having  later on we see glimpses of interesting personal affairs  jean kills herself and oppenheimer brings his kid to a friends house because kitty is an alcoholic  but nolan never explored these details and i didnt know why they were there or why we should care about them",2023-07-31 09:23:20
"the crux of the movie is how inventing the atomic bomb left him with an existential moral dilemma and how the government threw him under the bus after they no longer needed him

what his parents were like and how he got interested in physics are irrelevant to that point",2023-07-30 19:01:04
maybe how he was raised what his parents were like or what got him into physics werent relevant to the story we know why he got involved with the making of an atomic bomb it was because the nazis who were exterminating his people were developing one and he was sympathetic towards communistic ideas because most intellectual people at the time were matt damons character even said none of the scientists as los alamos would have been approved for the new security clearance measures because o their communist leanings he was a scientist whose goals and driving force is the understanding and knowledge of our universe the movie wasnt meant to be an autobiography of his entire life but of the time of his life around the development of the atomic bomb,2023-07-30 18:38:58

yea there are a lot of such instances be sure to wear earplugs whenever somebody is explaining science stuff or oppenheimer is hallucinating also dont remove earplugs during the trinity test it is a trick scene by nolan you would know what i am talking about when you watch it,2023-07-21 16:03:29
"so now i have to watch interviews with the director to understand why he made the baffling decision to shoot some of it in black and white seriously

why do people think this man is such an amazing director when he has to have bonus content to explain the nonsensical aspects of his films",2023-07-22 01:31:58
basically nolans trinity test doesnt match up very well with the archival footage of the trinity test its a bit limp and small and its very obvious what it actually is if youve seen a few movies,2023-07-22 17:30:40
it feels like a regular explosion because it is a regular explosion it’s supposed to feel like an earthshattering moment,2023-07-22 17:39:59

"why didnt titanic have scenes showing all the families that lost people on board  why didnt they show empty seats around dinner tables  why didnt they show parentless children at home

probably because thats not what the movie is about",2023-07-22 23:03:29
there are so many stories to tell when it comes to the war one movie simply cannot touch on all of them this one was about this man there are films out of japan that show the other sides,2023-07-22 23:06:37
ok cool which one of them glorifies nukes,2023-07-24 00:17:48
yeah im not a film critic like you  for a average viewing seeing the actual explosion that cemented oppenheimer into history wouldve been more impactful,2023-07-22 19:41:22
that is not the hard part it is the whole presentation of that affair what is this notreallyatrial why is it happening why are we supposed to care about this,2023-07-24 09:46:53
its a 3 hour biopic about a guy whose two titles are project manager and theoretical physicist yeah it was going to be more niche than mainstream which is why barbie has more imax screens,2023-07-23 14:00:21
i think its an awful movie and i wish i could experience life with the brain of someone who thinks this is brilliant for just one day to see what everything in the world is like to them the only thing this movie did for me is blow my mind to see how many people think its great i cant stop reading reviews and wondering if theyre from bots,2023-07-24 02:43:10
i love nolan but his editing has always been super weak,2023-07-21 19:53:32
i dont really get this take do you think the film should have ended at trinity its not really a storyline its his biography,2023-07-21 20:25:46
going to have to completely disagree but to each their own,2023-07-21 20:14:18
a movie about oppenheimer that created the first atomic bomb and we do not even get to see what type of bomb it was and why okay,2023-07-22 04:02:18
"because the point of the movie is what was actually said and what was shown 

it seems like you just chose to dislike oppenheimer the person so you want to disagree with any pieces of reality that do not align with that

the reason the movie shows his guilt over the bomb is because it’s a movie about his life and his guilt was a big driving factor as to why some people grew impatient with him and eventually along with strauss’ vendetta cost him his security clearance he went from someone that “won” ww2 to an outcast",2023-07-21 16:59:37
"i don’t think it showed him redeemed at all

having an antihero as a lead i don’t see an inherent issue with  many of my favorite films have antiheroes as leads that you could bring the same argument for  taxi driver fight club etc 

i think nolan consistently has morally dubious antiheroes in his movies people who believe they are right and their flaws are hinted at throughout  but then ultimately are revealed by the end to be deeply problematic the film didn’t seem sympathetic to him at all  he didn’t seem redeemed by the end he just seemed to recognize that he had done a horrible thing

i also don’t think nolan intended anyone to take it as oppenheimer being redeemed going off of his comments about the movie",2023-07-21 18:46:11
not at all he literally asked einstien is he remembered the calculations fermi brought forth and then said he believed them thats why einstien walked away furious,2023-07-26 20:56:07

the words were i believe we did",2023-07-26 21:01:10
because most of the world saw the movie with subtitles every theatre outside of primarily english speaking countries excluding dubs even if there were any doubts the subtitles clearly stated i believe we did also it makes more sense seeing as in reality by the time of the test the scientists were basically all agreed on how improbable a chain reaction was,2023-07-26 21:13:36

literally the first 2 hours were all about the science and how they made the bomb however having a whole dedicated to showing all the complex math and theoretical physics that went into creating an atomic bomb would probably bore most of the audience like i am not a physicist show me some science stuff but don’t make a college lecture as a came to watch a movie not sit in physics class and the grudge of that politician ended oppenheimers career bro i feel like that is pretty significant considering that the movie bares his name no,2023-07-25 00:26:37

"i honestly had no knowledge of robert oppenheimer before going into it i’m not super interested in time pieces either but that’s slowly changing i thought it would be good but i didn’t expect it to like it as much as i did

i really enjoyed all the emotion i’d have to write an essay if i detailed how well the cinema was from the use of lighting sound delivery of lines props camera shots etc everything was intentional i felt oppenheimer’s humanity as he began to question his own invention his love for science and inventiveness was his own downfall in his mind for example the scene with the rowdy americans and the lights flashing and getting bright and oppenheimer relating it the bomb detonating in japan hearing terror and screaming in the cheers of applause for his own work his realization in the end that he had a hand in mass destruction even the use of silence to show how grave oppenheimer’s invention would be and then the scene with the bombs being loaded into trucks and driven away all his dedication and work taken just like that 

i thought it was brilliant 

the line president truman said “they don’t care who created the bomb only who dropped it” really stuck with me because it’s so true the invention of the bomb was extraordinary but it’s use was so deadly and wrong although oppenheimer is credited with created it it was the government that dropped it yet he still feels responsible it’s interesting",2023-08-03 03:56:43

and again theres nothing outright disrespectful here theres legitimate irl people who will tell their partner to say religious  during  this is some bold or unrealistic thing thats done to be disrespectful this was to show how close he was with here and how much he showed herhow connected with death he was you missed the entire point and instantly went with hes just another racist which proves what type of person you areif you dont bend down to religion youre now racist and a piece of  wow great philosophy that people have shown to agree with

yes but the scene with kitty pointing that strauss was behind the events unfolding occurred in the actual timeline of events midappeal long after oppie decided to begin the appeal process it occurred before the scene in which strauss implores oppie to go for the appeal because nolan presents events nonchronologically

 it isnt clear to history his reasons for going through with the hearing and nolan did a good job of staying within the grey there i thought

one part they show her setting it up and dunking herself as suicide also mentioning she had barbiturates in her system

but another part shows someones gloved hand holding her head under water also mentioning she had some type of poison in her system

short version is that norway launched a rocket to study the aurora borealis and russia feared it could be a nuclear attack from a us submarine and prepared for a counterattack good thing they werent too triggerhappy and came to the conclusion that it wasnt an attack before doing anything rash

heres a whole list of incidents throughout history



the incident with norway from 1995 seems to have been the last one though not sure thats because those responsible have become reluctant to use nuclear weapons in the last few decades because detection system has been better at identifying things that can could be mistaken for nuclear attacks or because more recent stuff still is classified",2023-07-24 00:30:47

i think because oppenheimer himself gives him a pass teller from the beginning was someone who spoke his mind and said what he believed even if it meant confrontation and argument i think this is similar to oppenheimer and something oppenheimer recognized as admirable in the hearing he says that he believes oppenheimer is loyal without a doubt but cannot understand his national security owes and therefore cannot trust him in his position he doesn’t make anything up or leave anything out he just gives the most honest assessment he can,2023-07-23 02:48:21

from their perspective building a bomb made sense it’s my understanding and i am not a history buff admittedly that they knew the nazis were out of the race long before the trinity but they also knew that russia was going to start building somebody was probably going to finish the atom bomb and they wanted to be first  
  
but then there’s the jurassic park argument yes technology will continue to advance no matter what we do but we have the power to say “no” just because we can create dinosaurs doesn’t mean we should  
  
i always believed that dropping the bombs was a morally evil act but also understood that they felt like they had no choice especially given that more lives out have been lost at that time if they hadn’t stopped the war  
halfway through the movie i changed my mind i realized that whether their reasons for doing so we’re justified by circumstances or not finishing the atomic bomb was the worst mistake mankind ever made and i think that the film is trying to convey that",2023-07-23 05:05:58
" i think youre not reading the comment youre replying to 

no you’re the one who’s not reading the comment you’re replying to

in anticipation of an invasion of mainland japan a lot of purple hearts were made since the invasion of japan didn’t happen due to the bombing of nagasaki and hiroshima those purple hearts never got used for that purpose and they’re still using those purple hearts to this day 

that means that the anticipated casualties of an invasion of japan is less than the past 80 years of american warfare this isn’t a conversation of the validity of that warfare it’s a testament to how brutal the invasion of japan was expected to be and that’s just american soldiers not the expected losses of japan’s military and other “civilian” casualties

 what does it matter if a lot of soldiers would have died how does that change anything in this argument

the argument you’re missing is that once pandora’s box is opened it’s not shutting once the possibility of a world dominating weapon is believed to exist then it’s a race to be the first wasn’ einstein who said “i do not know what world war 3 will be fought with but world war 4 will be fought with sticks and stones”

there was a major theme of oppenheimer trying to keep the soviets involved in order to not create fear “we have this magnificent weapon that could destroy the world i want them to to know so our ‘frenemy’ doesn’t know we’re hiding it from them and anticipating us using it against them”

that could be what nolan meant although the planet on fire had to be a 3d render right but really any computer effect even digital compositing is cgi  for them to claim look at us we didnt use any dirty cgi seems pretty disrespectful to the huge amount of gorgeous compositing work that was done on this film,2023-07-24 01:43:44
my point is that for me personally the way it was done was more uncomfortable than just showing a bunch of burnt corpses or destroyed buildings i feel that would have been the easiest way to do it and i much prefer what was actually done in the film it felt like a realistic depiction of the building anxiety and terror setting in as he was trying to give the speech,2023-07-22 01:40:11

"i think you missed my point the gita isn’t a casual read and i don’t believe or didn’t assert that oppenheimer was a devout hindu nevertheless he still would have been serious about the philosophy 

the scene is ridiculous in numerous ways and a good parallel would have been like showing someone reading schopanhaeur during  the scene shows a lack of understanding of why it resonated with him and at worst is guilty of the same old tired trope of western movies mystifying asian philosophy for an exotic effect 

oppenheimer didn’t just quote the gita or hindu scriptures once he also quoted famously

“in battle in forest at the precipice in the mountains on the dark great sea in the midst of javelins and arrows in sleep in confusion in the depths of shame the good deeds a man has done before defend him”

the cat was already out of the bag though yes the germans didn’t figure it out in time but the us had intel leaking to the soviets even if the bombs were never used the ussr would have developed their own bombs while the us had theirs in storage and we would have ended up in the nuclear age anyway,2023-07-22 02:51:58

have the consequences been that disastrous when was the last time multiple major world powers were directly involved in large scale war with each other it was going to be developed either way and it’s impossible to say what the right call was anyway let’s say the bombs don’t exist is there a ww3 between the soviets and the west that kills tens of millions i think everyone would agree that the pax atomica is preferable what if the bombs were developed but not used against japan since the world hasn’t seen their effects in this hypothetical are they more likely to be used in large numbers in the future it’s impossible to say i don’t think we should assume that the grass would be greener without nukes,2023-07-22 12:57:13

this film is about what hubris and i was just following orders leads people who have power to do to those who have none just because they can  and because if they dont someone else will its not a greater horror than what happened to the victims at hiroshima and nagasaki but it is darker and teaches a lesson that we still have yet to learn",2023-07-23 00:38:21

it just felt a weird choice to me but nolan’s style doesn’t lend itself well to nudity i find it’s too cold

oppenheimer was also utterly passionless in the  scene which makes sense for the character at the time but it also feels at odds with his philandering ways as you didn’t really get the feeling he enjoyed  very much at least not from the instances we saw

idk i wasn’t prepared for the surreal and even though it worked incredibly well for the speech post bombings the scream got me the  scenes felt unnecessary to me also it kind of felt like a joke that whenever one of his babies was on screen it was bawling",2023-07-22 00:46:28

there is a zero percent chance that is what nolan meant  after seeing how russia immediately started going after the atomic bomb and then that led to the us wanting to develop a hydrogen bomb which would then lead russia to want to develop a hydrogen bomb etc etc etc oppenheimer was realizing that by developing the atomic bomb in the first place he had set off a sequence of events that gave mankind the power to destroy itself,2023-07-22 20:14:03
they dont really it is more complicated and subjective than that sure there are a bunch of companies many of which survive on vc money that are claiming to have quantum computers but none of them actually work for anything they arent finished devices that behave in a way that a final quantum computer would since no one has actually figured out how to build one yet it is sort of like saying that fusion reactors exist because the national ignition facility and various tokamaks exist sure they physically exist but they dont produce any usable power and they arent used for anything other than research it is the same way with quantum computers right now they are partially functional science experiments so it really depends at what point you call it a computer does it have to do something to be a computer or does any configuration of optical traps superconductors or other elements that might eventually be a quantum computer qualify as a computer now is 100 vacuum tubes on a table with power hooked up to them a conventional computer,2023-07-25 02:41:57

project director for the atomic bomb just doesnt have quite the same ring to it,2023-07-22 00:47:29
i mean i disagree entirely selfish doesn’t seem an appropriate word at all i say narcissistic because it’s as if to say that the atomic bomb never could or would have been created without him that he was a singular mind and the only person in history capable of doing it so even though many others worked on the project which the us government created the sole credit and therefore responsibility for the lives lost in the bomb’s use falls to him i just do not believe that is at all true,2023-07-27 02:59:35
"yea i mean this movie reopened the should we have used the bomb debate which i enjoy but ultimately what people miss is that really americans simply assumed the bomb would be used and thats bc they were living through what seemed to be the end of the world certainly if the allies lost its easy with hindsight to say we shouldnt have done it but the movie shows how the war had its own life and made decisions for people not the other way around 

ww1 was like this as well sure it seems sensible to stop the war once everyone realizes its a meat grinder but by then the meat grinder has its own mind it cant be stopped except by its own all absorbing will 

in some ways the movie shows the bomb once imagined was going to happen scientists in 1905 realized what an atomic atom meant it just couldnt be stopped",2023-07-25 02:18:31

" the alternative they were most worried about was russia entering the war against japan which would have been imminent had the bomb not been dropped 

russia couldnt have invaded regardless their far east navy was literally nonexistent and the imperial japanese were literally counting on the allies to suffer a pyrrhic victory on invading and having so much casualties theyd be forced back to the negotiating table to offer more concessions for their conditional surrender",2023-07-21 18:23:50

"if youre going to attempt to take batman seriously—and i think the nolan movies wanted you to the idea of putting a superhero movie in a gritty realistic setting was very novel at the time—then you have to reckon with the idea that letting an emotionally disturbed billionaire decide unilaterally what the greater good is while he beats up petty criminals is… maybe not something we should actually feel comfortable with

and tdk in particular is not entirely oblivious to this point imo theres a reason it draws parallels between batman and the joker theres a reason that morgan freemans character criticizes him for the phone surveillance in the third act but it doesnt commit to these criticisms because batman is alway proved to be justified in his actions in the end

"the censorship itself is very immoral and the movie itself is also immoral for a number of reasons 

one is that he reads the hinduism bible during a  intercourse with his mistress to portray himself as “holy” during the film he also reads the hinduism bible “now i am become death the destroyer of worlds” to justify creating such a destructive weapon and genocide religions and politics are supposed to be separated he is a scientist yet still relied on his personal belief that’s not based on a science in ancient times aryans formed hinduism in order to conquer india and its people

 



the explicit pornlike affair scene itself was immoral and unnecessarily long when it could be portrayed in a different way or much shorter especially in a movie portrays such a serious sensitive topic that could be devastating to the victims of the bomb and those who passed away it is to contrast the racial superiority of the survivors being justified even though it is considered a sin having an affair a genocide and the inferiority of the fatalities the  was effectively used as a brainwashing effect to defy peoples moral compass



the historical roots of ciahollywood propaganda


and all of this was exploited in a way however the creators of the movie wanted the reality is that he might probably never read the bible during a  intercourse nor read the line in a positive way but to moan unlike the movie oppenheimer passed away in 1967 and he does not exist anymore so “the dead can’t speak”

einstein was not allowed to develop a nuclear weapon because he was considered a left wing favoring japan as he set a letter to his sons on dec 17 1922 “the japanese do appeal to me… better than all the peoples i’ve met up to now quiet modest intelligent appreciative of art and considerate nothing is for the sake of appearances but rather everything is for the sake of substance” and his appreciation to japan did not stop

einstein upon learning of the drop of the atomic bomb said according to the bulletin of the atomic scientists woe is me

if i had known that the germans would not have succeeded in creating an atomic bomb i would not have lifted a finger the physicist noted

szilard and wigner were of the same opinion

even robert oppenheimer who led the development of the bomb hoped that it would never be used

none of this was portrayed in a film but einstein only appears with not so much of an interest but with an agreement 



the film doesn’t portray the entire background but cherrypicking how they chose japan to drop the bomb there was a racial motivation that played a major role on a decision to drop the bomb in japan there were many racist ideas from truman that could never be shown to the public but never should have been omitted everything portrayed in a hollywood movie is justified even when they said “kyoto was an amazing beautiful historical city we went on a honeymoon so exclude that” how easy was it for them to decide whether to conduct genocide or not every city in japan is indescribably beautiful for the people who live in in many different ways and so is any city in the world how can be so stereotypical and judgmental without him genuinely knowing about japan and it’s people without any filter

an article by the united states department of defense says ”some observers express the view that japan was a victim of the atomic bomb primarily because of the united states racist views toward japanese and that we would not have done the same thing to caucasians in the european war the facts mentioned in the preceding paragraphs decrease the credibility of that argument that does not relieve president truman from the charge that he was racist evidence shows that he was truman used the nword frequently including in letters to his wife bess in one letter truman writes his uncle will says the lord made a white man of dust a  from mud then threw up what was left and it came down a chinaman he does hate chinese and  so do i although this is an example of his racist attitudes and the attitudes of many americans at the time and perhaps — unfortunately even now harry did do some things that show a different side of him such as integrating the military services after the war “

 

this kind of propaganda hollywood movies have been used to motivate hate during the war even though it is just stereotypes and not factual

know your enemy  japan 1945

“trained to be a soldier since they were born” “shortheighted” “everyone is the same” “completely different race” “only eats rice”they dont even know colorful sushi miso soup and so many japanese cuisine one of the most beautiful cuisine in the world “violent and they have extreme power” with western clothes and technology



this movie displays traits of the dark or d factor of personality narcissism moral disengagement selfinterest amorality egoism greed machiavellianism psychopathy  or spitefulness

elevated levels in d predispose individuals towards a broad range of socially and ethically aversive thoughts and behaviors such as aggression bullying cheating crime stealing vandalism violence and many others

in the propaganda video streamed in us it was all racial based motivation to hate japan and called japanese “savage” with manipulations even created all fake hollywood footage using the chinese gang group and military “this is the japan’s savagery“ us still using the scenes today to justify the white colonialism with an extreme emphasis

“know your enemy japan” propaganda 

“trained to be a soldier since they were born” “everyone is the same” “completely different race” “only eats rice” they dont know colorful sushi miso soup and so on one of the most beautiful food in the world “shortheighted” “violent extremely powerful” with western clothes and technology

where is the truth in this this is only racism

japan opened a country in 1854 and wwii ended in 1945 before 1854 japan was completely closed in traditional japanese clothes in kimono etc with absolutely no zero contact with foreign countries except cultural exchange with neighbors
the national isolation policy “sakoku” lasted 265 years was to protect japan from the worldwide white colonialism of almost 500 years
after 15 attempts us finally deceived japan into opening a country threatening britain which obtained british hong kong india china in  war will colonize japan force dressed in western clothes and militarized japan 
in the american military training not only they provided and taught all the western technologies how to use weapons vehicles us brainwashed japan to hate the other and be as savage as possible

japanese had a high cultural sense as van gough said “all my work is based to some extent on japanese art”


some observers express the view japan was a victim of the atomic bomb primarily because of the united states racist views toward japanese and we would not have done the same thing to caucasians in the european war
—that does not relieve president truman from the charge that he was racist evidence shows that he was truman used the nword frequently including in letters to his wife bess in one letter truman writes his uncle will says the lord made a white man of dust a  from mud then threw up what was left and it came down a chinaman he does hate chinese and  so do i although this is an example of his racist attitudes and the attitudes of many americans at the time and perhaps — unfortunately even now harry did do some things that show a different side of him such as integrating the military services after the war

einstein about japan

“the japanese do appeal to me… better than all the peoples i’ve met up to now quiet modest intelligent appreciative of art and considerate nothing is for the sake of appearances” dec 17 1922

“among us we see many japanese living a lonely existence studying diligently smiling in a friendly manner”  during his visit to japan

in an essay published in 1923 he contrasted western culture with that of japan the former characterized by “individualism in the extreme cutthroat competition exerting one’s utmost energy feverish laboring to acquire as much luxury and indulgences as possible” the latter by “harmony and equanimity strong family bonds and public civility enforced by social norms” “the japanese rightfully admires the intellectual achievements of the west and immerses himself successfully and with great idealism in the sciences but let him not thereby forget to keep pure the great attributes in which he is superior to the west—the artful shaping of life modesty and unpretentiousness in his personal needs and the purity and calm of the japanese soul”

the caucasian race severely disliked other races they neutered mongoloid women in greenland north europe and spread propaganda on how “violent and savage” genghis khan was even though covid was an american government funded project called it “china disease” and spread the news all over the world

in hiroshima the world’s bomb andrew rotter suggests that racism explains at least in part the decision to drop the bomb for diplomatic reasons at the expense of japanese lives he writes “white american racism caused or at minimum enabled the united states to use a devastating weapon on the japanese brown people whom they considered inferior to themselves barbaric in their conduct of war and finally subhuman—‘a beast’ as truman put it” rotter suggests american antijapanese racism accounts for the genocidal expenditure of nonwhite lives for diplomatic reasons this american antijapanese racism rotter notes manifested itself in the aesthetic portrayal of japanese people as “subhuman” the misrepresentation of japanese people as subhuman narrates an unreal hierarchy of race in which white americans are humans and japanese are not american antijapanese racism resulted in the framing of the japanese people as subhuman which in turn enabled the use of the atomic bomb on the japanese people not for pragmatic or expedient reasons but to demonstrate “american military might” to the soviet union i argue that american antijapanese racism enabled the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki american narratives of race fostered antipathy toward the japanese to the extent that the japanese became expendable the accumulation of an increasingly racist antijapanese popular aesthetic which took the form of textual visual musical and filmic propaganda resulted in the animalization and subsequent dehumanization of the japanese people this dehumanization allowed for the “ethical” bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki for diplomatic advantage with russia i conclude the aesthetic and its accumulation possesses the ethical power to condition genocide and america’s dehumanizing aesthetical narratives of the japanese people enabled the  of 105000 japanese and other nonwhite people

how many times us keeps deceiving the world just to justify the colonization in a name of “protecting the country” just to name a few

• us deceived the native americans and stole america and says “the only good indians are the dead indians” keeps calling them “indians” which was a mistake to begin with

• us deceived japan that us will protect japan against the aggression of britain when they received a fake permission to force open japan on the side us told china us must protect china from japan 

• us says they will protect japan from china and north korea to demilitarize japan and make it a submissive country while us controls china and north korea uk already colonized china in the  war had the british hong kong us funds the chinese military and lab after the wwii us officially colonized south korea and russia colonized north korea 
then militarize again to make an excuse “they’re aggressive and have to be eliminated”

if any country started attacking it is always the us behind their back and calling them evil

its impossible to argue granted a lot of people died so its a touchy subject but no one ever takes the nuanced approach something like 250 thousand total people died at okinawa japanese and american one could see why atom bombs were looked at as an option invading the mainland was going to take the lives of even more the other side is the can of worms opened from being the only country to actually detonate atomic weapons on civilians who of which thousands still suffer today we werent alive to make the decisions but everyone is eager to hand out judgement as if the people in charge looked forward to picking between having hundreds of thousands dead or hundreds of thousands dead there are no easy decisions in a time such as world war 2 and to anyone who thinks they are morally correct or smart for their opinion on how america should have handled the final fight of world war 2 no one cares you and every other person whos read a text book has one,2023-11-23 08:47:27

they discuss how they used the bombs to save gi lives but there wasnt enough impact to make you question if it was worth it we heard how many japanese died from the bombings and after but those are just numbers nothing was shown

the movie focused so much on the communists spies without ever focusing in on the spies and the wrongs done to oppenheimer that it missed so much more thought provoking topics

i love history and go to sleep reading a history book nightly the topic can he incredibly engrossing or it can be incredibly boring

or heres an idea if nolan wanted to adapt the entire book faithfully make it into a 10 hour long series instead of cramming everything into a 3 hour long incohesive mess how can a biopic calls itself a good biopic when the audience walk away watching it without even knowing the basic motivation and drives of the titular character

i really have no idea what you didnt enjoy about this movie  you seem to think it was supposed to be pure entertainment that involved unlimited creative license which is simply not what a biopic is supposed to be

it sounds like you simply didnt care for oppenheimer as a person or what his life was about which is fine  not sure why you have to trash the movie and the director over his preference to do a movie about him though",2023-07-22 11:51:49
that’s the thing you have wrong though most people thinking a theme park is more interesting than watching paint dry is still a subjective opinion just because everyone agrees about an opinion still doesn’t make it objective there is a difference between objective and subjective regardless of how many people agree,2023-07-22 15:28:36
lol yes i wanna play double jealousy ive never played that one before,2023-07-23 18:52:47
"but thats not the point of this film the whole movie is a biopic showcasing oppenheimers rise to fame and eventual collapse in the eyes of the american public due to the political squabbles he had  

like its literally the name of the film oppenheimer if the movie was exclusively about the bombs it wouldve been named trinity or something similar its about his perception of his creation not about his creation itself",2023-07-25 08:12:24
thats how they sold the movie with the trailers and it wasnt that at all ,2023-07-25 22:31:41

yeah it was a bit confusing in that regard lol,2023-07-31 15:31:58
"i understand that i just think there are other ways of doing that aside from sensationalistically putting it directly on screen i feel putting japanese kids faces melting off in a summer blockbuster biopic about a guy who very much did not get to see that and had to live for decades with the horror of imagining it would have been exploitative and dishonest

grave of the fireflies exists

its not christopher nolans place to expound on the anguish of the japanese people and especially not as the object in a sentence where the subject is a white guy",2023-07-30 07:12:31

"i actually love how they glaze over him being the time man of the year and how popular he was leading into 1950 when the long term effects were becoming obvious that alone tells you how little of a  it gives about history and wants you to accept this version of him he was a major part of the us bomb hype machine until it started become obvious that there were issues with that narrative and what the bomb does

theres an argument that the only meaningful part of the movie is where strauss is screaming about how people remember him for trinity and not hiroshima or nagasaki because thats exactly what this movie wants you to do",2023-07-24 04:15:33
i mean that scene is meant to be disturbing,2023-07-24 11:28:58
"the real issue that the movie skirts hard is that oppenheimer spent years denying the effects of long term radiation poisoning the jury is out on how much of that his conscience could handle and how much the us needed the same pr but its  asinine to leave out the actual effects of the bomb that hes allegedly so tortured about

the reason its left out is because the point of the movie is to make him into what everyone yells at him about  you need to quit being such a holy martyr oppy

im not giving him benefit of the doubt because he was one of thousands of scientists and foreign experts that said hey this entire strategy of building a bigger bomb is hamstringing the scientific  community and leading us down a road where someone has a bad day and the world ends it was not a unique thought and he doesnt get to hop on that train because he was the leading mind that lead us down there

re the other  the issue is less with the affairs themselves and how theyre handled he has like what 5 through the course of the movie and the only one they seem to take seriously is the one that mattered because it has dramatic value vis a vie suicide

the movie is very focused on showing how much of a flawed genius he is while handwaving any of the actual responsibility he has in the long term or his actual  long term takes

it actually goes out of its way to call him a martyr like 9 times so you know how crazy it is how humble hes being",2023-07-24 04:11:39
it means that oppenheimer found out that the bomb was actually used and was successful the way everyone else did by listening to truman on the radio once the two packages left los alamos he was in the dark about what would happen next until the bombs use was made public,2023-07-24 04:52:52
you can go look them up for yourself if you want to see them most people in an oppenheimer viewing have already seen aftermath photos of the bomb drops on japan and adding those real pictures to the movie wouldnt necessarily add anything to the presentation,2023-07-24 04:51:17
"ohhh i see thanks a lot i only got bits and pieces of that not the whole story maybe i mentally zoned out

so i knew there was some source that oppenheimer lied about and didn’t reveal until later but i didn’t know that was chevalier so didn’t realise that’s what the chevalier incident was and then i only realised the guy with the moustache was chevalier right at the end and by that point i couldn’t remember anything that character had said apart from he took the baby for a while so yeah it was all quite confusing to me ",2023-08-04 23:08:38

" this is ignoring the insane explosion scenes

where were those the bomb was a wet  basically a macro of a can of gasoline on fire",2023-07-23 09:04:26
"which two of the explosion scenes were insane  iirc they blew up two little crates ahead of the test and then they had the trinity test which was clearly a 90smovie gasoline explosion what other explosions am i forgetting  

also does everything have to be marvel man",2023-07-23 18:44:16
"  every since he got rid of his editor lee smith and hans zimmer his movies have been too quickly edited less interesting stories and filled with music that is illsuited for the scenes

i mean i dont see any particular decline in quality besides in his audio editing which is a deliberate artistic choice particularly bad in tenet but not too bad in this movie  but i wont quibble about the issues with the technical aspets

 also his disdain for women in his work is something that makes his filmography increasingly problematic to me

i literally dont see any disdain for women in this movie at all  and im trying to think back at his other more recent movies  maybe theres stuff im forgetting  i thought the main woman characterthat tall blonde womanwas pretty interesting and at times badass in tenet although i also think a woman being badass as a form of empowerment can be a pretty shallow form of writing good women but it wasnt too bad in that movie  i dont remember any women in dunkirk  elliotthenellen pages role as aradne in inception i think was also pretty well done  its been a while but i dont remember any hatred of women written into his role

in this movie we have two main woman characters one of them an unstable communist paramour who took her own life  i actually love the communist characters in this movie and found them to full of integrity and passion and i think this character was a part of that  she was a real life person who really did have an affair with oppenheimer and really did commit suicide  her death was a huge blow to him  i dont really see how the movie hates her  and the second main character kitty was very supportive while having a backbone  her scene during the hearing was one of the best parts of the film and also quoted directly from history  there was also a great rejoinder by one of the woman scientists in which she points out that her male colleagues are more suceptible to radiation poisoning in their reproductive system than hers  

i simply dont see any valid argument that james cameron hates women or views them as  objects in this film  and given the time period women are pretty wellrepresented albeit all in relation to oppenheimerbut it was the 40s what are you going to do

 i just feel like her being  was unnecessary because it was clearly done to arouse the viewer and if it wasnt then why have her  in frame with   and in focus during the seated conversation scene or during the trial fantasy

titanic is more liekly to have been done to arouse the viewer and to put butts in seats  that was a love story and sexualitysensuality is necessarily a part of it  arousal isnt actually a negative emotion and it heightens a love story by putting you into the shoes of at least one of the characters  when you see roses  in titanic you are put into leos shoes as youre put into this moment of intimacy and budding romance between two soontobelovers  it was respectfully done and it represents real life

i dont really see how this movie did it differently

as i mentioned the hearing scene was to make people uncomfortable  the private details of his affair were being aired out in front of his life so just as he was  in front of jean he felt  in front of that committee  

 why was he seated weirdly crosslegged in a prudish manner hiding his genitals from the camera it would be more realistic to have them sitting without regard to that

so your solution for mild nudity in the film female  is to have more extreme nudity full genitalia of both a male and female  i woulndt actually be upset by thisnudity is simply nudity  i wouldnt be surprised if oppenheimer raised the idea to cillian and he said no  cillian did appear  in the film even if you cant see his  so it wasnt like it wasnt uncomfortable for him  pugh has appeared  in multiple movies and im seeing discussion that she purposely psuhed the  scene in the film  many actresses are like thatthey see nudity as empowering  

 the movie is too quick and it failed to make me care about hidden meanings when i cant follow the basic plot on screen

maybe you have adhd  a lot fo people in my generation and the zoomer generation are like that  im sorry you felt that way  however i think you went into this film with a certain frame of mind to view it as antiwoman but you dont really show how its antiwoman except by being upset that women have  and sometimes these  are visible  its not like this is a national lampoon movie where the whole point is to basically be a  show objectifying women the whole time  if theres evidence that nolan pushed for the  scene hard and pugh really didnt want to do it then id agree with you

it seems like instead we had a  conversation that was like

nolan there will be a  scene toplessness only and it will be extended but it makes sense as you are having an affair with oppenheimer

pugh im fine with that",2023-07-22 14:50:19

"the kings speech is far better than oppenheimer and is set in the same time period no action  
tora tora tora is far better than oppenheimer and is set in the days before pearl harbor it technically has action but its not the bulk of the movie

both of these movies are far more thoughtful than oppenheimer",2023-07-25 19:04:34

right so we can just call it a regular cheap marketing gimmick to bring people in right wasnt expecting that from nolan i thought hes honest with his work and audience and then the whole 70mm imax thing good to know someone is passionate about the art of filmmaking and is doing what he loves but does this movie need it i dont think so",2023-07-21 12:51:21

"right that’s what a 3 hour movie should be doing giving the viewer homework

you’re drastically overestimating how many people in 2023 that watch blockbuster movies are intimately familiar of the after effects of a nuclear bomb dropped 80 years ago",2023-07-25 19:49:26
"what even is your argument here that a real explosion is less grand than one created for a film i don’t even see how that is possible my critique is that the explosion scene was incredibly hyped up and for nothing it was a disappointment of course the real explosion is ‘better’ it’s real you can feel a sense of grandeur and scale despite how stylised the movie is that doesn’t translate

i don’t get what you mean about eye witness testimony from a quick google search you can find many quotes from people who were there which directly disapprove your point “no one who saw it could forget it a foul and awesome display”  kenneth bainbridge that is just one and there are many more which evoke far more than the film could ever hope to convey

as for every important decision being made by people quipping in a room that makes me feel like you have never spoken to another human being anymore real people do not talk like they do in this film this is an issue i have with a lot of films hence why i prefaced that critique by saying it may be due to my personal opinion the dialogue is too perfect it is not realistic and in my opinion it is pretentious and to be honest cringeworthy

and thank you for going through my post history and using it to make a personal jab at me really tells me a lot about your character you must be very mature and much much more intelligent than me i am just a business student

also i think you’re missing my point about the scale i don’t care if the explosion was technically the right size for how far away the characters were the way that it was shot and conveyed onto the screen made it seem like a small explosion that was why i feel there was not a sense of scale",2023-07-25 13:16:10
the explosion was barely shown and wasnt what a nuclear bomb looks like in real life youre just not correct on that front why are you so aggressively defending something that clearly got it wrong,2023-07-25 13:27:03

this is not a good movie neither as a biopic nor documentary about oppenheimer",2023-07-25 15:53:15
i genuinely don’t believe something like indy 5 justified costing as much as all three original films put together  do you it also hasn’t made its money back which just further puts a choke hold on hollywoods willingness to pay out for future projects i don’t doubt nolan’s film will make its money back but there’s no denying that movies are getting insanely expensive 200m used to be the high bar now it’s the standard 300m for the new mission impossible that was unheard of just a few years ago  the cost of this film has almost doubled it’s budget it’s not a huge deal but it’s worth discussing at least,2023-07-21 15:44:55
"never said that he needs anything but you cannot deny that he is profiting off the crowd that would normally only watch barbie who are also seeing oppenheimer for the meme barbie is the more universally accessible film and has tripled oppen’s gross revenue already so it’s obvious that barbie is going to carry oppen a bit due to the barbenheimer memes lol i’m not a nolan fan but i still did the whole barbenheimer thing and most of the crowd at my oppen showing were in pink 

there are several interviews where nolan stated he won’t be seeing barbie and rumblings that he was less than thrilled regarding the dual release date but in the end it’s bringing more people to theatres and both films will profit heavily off the memes so

"you havent disproved any of my argument 

answer these questions if you can

how much do you think you actually learn about oppenheimer just from watching the movie did you find out how oppenheimer was raised what were his parents like what got him into physics in the first place what drove him what were his goals why was he sympathetic to communism

stop pretending you have actually sat through this 3 hour drag of a failed biopic and jump on the nolanisgoat fad bandwagon praising how this is the second coming of christ for cinema lol",2023-08-02 19:20:50
agreed so many subplot lines that were never followed why show us these details if they have no relevance to the story,2023-07-31 16:32:07
"it actually does because the main crux of him being thrown under the bus is because of his communist connections that the aec exploited this is the premise of the entire third act

so why was oppenheimer sympathetic to communist cause why was he drawn to it what exactly were the consequences of the atomic bombs in japan that led him to an evidential moral dilemma

we were never shown any of of the above in a 3 hour long film the main purpose of a movie should be to show not tell otherwise it may as well be a podcast or a book",2023-07-30 20:44:50

how so the archival footage of the trinity  low fidelity blackandwhite capturing of what is very obviously a fireball  the first feature to form postexplosion flash  which is what oppenheimer is looking at through the instrument

the gigantic mushroom cloud people seem to be hankering for takes minutes to fully form not the literal seconds the sound hadnt even reached them yet that nolan was trying to portray",2023-07-22 18:02:30
 that in itself is the glorification of nukes in media  the fact that a vast majority of pepper who went to see oppenheimer didn’t care about the movie before hand and just went to watch the explosion is self explanatory,2023-07-24 00:35:39
i don’t consider myself a critic as long as a movie is entertaining that’s all that matters to me but yeah the average viewer probably went in to see the bomb go off i value their opinion and at least hope they enjoyed most of the movie cause it was 3 hours long that’s allot of time to set aside for a movie,2023-07-22 19:45:45
well then this film isnt for you showing the explosion is cheap,2023-07-22 20:11:46

"idk what to tell you man just watched the movie and if you even remotely payed attention to the final dialogue between einstien and oppenheimer there is no mistaking the meaning of the final shot the discussion is literally about the fermi predictions of the atmosphere igniting and oppenheimers last words to einstien were i believed it as in he believed the mathematical calculations and went ahead with the launch anyways which lines up with one of the main themes of the movie being about oppenheimers moral ambiguity nothing in that convo was about oppenheimers belief about the metaphorical chain reaction nukes would have on society pay attention before you go correction people

edit im eating my words because i was wrong",2023-07-26 21:04:30
"ive never needed likable characters to become engrossed in a story so oppenheimer and rdj being unlikable doesnt bother me at all one of the reasons impacted me personally was seeing the way oppenheimer was treated by those in power in the government for the country that he diligently worked to serve and then to see them try to reconcile the wrongs and unfair treatment they gave him at the very end during the einstein conversation when really it was all just for show and for their own designs not because they genuinely felt sorry for him was a striking message thats why seeing damons character be the only one who really stuck by oppenheimer that entire time was so powerful to me personally oppenheimer was a man who gave his country the most powerful weapon the world ever saw and even with his past connections remained loyal to the usa to the end never revealing a single secret and then to see the classic dc politician attempt to destroy him because he said things they didnt like was a slap in the face to oppenheimer and everyone who gives service to their country thats why seeing rdj not get the cabinet position mattered to me and why seeing groves and the other scientists rally behind oppenheimer was so satisfying 

personally just how i reacted to the themes around service for ones country and what being a patriot is oppenheimer by all accounts in the film was one even after the kangaroo prosecution einsteins conversations touched on these themes well throughout the final act of the movie too the fact that oppenheimer might not be super likable wasnt relevant to me considering the injustices he faced which massively overshadowed any personal flaws he might have had",2023-07-23 04:48:54

people that did not like this movie did not think it was too hard to get it was very easy to understand it used frenetic editing and needless convolusion to mimic complexity it was not complex people that liked it keep commenting and saying the people that did not like are not sophisticated enough to get it because they are faux intellectual 

the fact that you couldnt parse that and completely missed my point confirms my suspicions the fact that somebody called me a soyboy confirms my suspicions

it ended his government career but he still gave speeches and sold books around the world for the remainder of his life but agree to disagree i suppose everyone in my group was laughing at how bad the third hour was  i mean they couldve spent more time on the manhattan project developing the bombing the fallout in japan the war itself to show why oppenheimer and the government are so motivated the continued proliferation of atomic weapons and the cold war nuclear arsenals and yet you believe a politicians who 99 of people had never heard of before this movie grudge is more interesting than the greatest scientific discovery to ever exist got it,2023-07-25 00:39:45
i would argue that it was a neutral comment as i didn’t say the movie was bad nor good i just said i thought it was boring and you’re totally right i can’t say if the movie was bad or good because i didn’t see the whole thing but i can say it was boring to me,2023-07-23 04:12:23
haha it’s not like i haven’t tried,2023-07-25 23:13:06
the way you describe it makes sense i guess literally the only thing that ruined it for me was not being able to follow the story it takes me awhile to care about characters and things so the scene when he hears screaming in the cheering crowd is a great idea but what ruined it for me was not really carrying about how oppenheimer felt so what would have been an awesome scene turned into people just making noises i guess everybody is rather different in their tastes,2023-08-03 04:30:39
"id give you christianity and bible 

but if you think nolan could get away with a quote from the quran and torah in the same way then we are living in two completely different worlds rihanna tried that for a song and she had to publicly apologize before a fatwa on her head lol 

whos calling nolan racist for this not me hes far more deserved of that title cause of his erasure of alamos hispanos completely from the story if we bring up racism in any context 

the point remains the same some religions you can touch some you cannot doesnt make what happened in the scene wrong just makes it unequal in respect whether that respect is out of knowledge or fear of repercussions thats another story

as someone who isn’t american and had no idea about his story the implication of his security clearance loss seemed to be pretty obviously implied and stated within the film to me,2023-07-29 05:07:31
"then you are completely unaware of the red scare and mccarthyism you should simply read a quick wiki page to understand 

it’s the main reason socialism and communism are still shunned in america to this day

they very very very showed that happening from the fbi stalking to the offer to feed information to the russians to the whole trial… i mean if a scare tactic can take out the one who made it how is it not implied that anyone else could have gone down too",2023-07-26 13:56:40
i think the point was that removing security clearance served multiple political purposes,2023-07-29 21:52:29
late comment but it wouldve been much more than japanese soldiers they had this idea that theyd fight to the last man woman and child before surrendering and they did that thing on some of the nearby islands like okinawa they were training women in how to ambush american soldiers with wooden pikes and preparing to bury children underground with aircraft bombs that they had no fuel to deliver with a hammer and tell them to hit the detonator when they heard vehicles overhead it wouldve basically been cultural suicide for the entire island of japan if the atomic bombs didnt give them the excuse to surrender while saving face,2023-08-01 11:33:08

people who link things like this and dont understand that the caveat to not dropping the bombs was continuing and increasing the firebombing effort are just embarrassing it  me off actually,2024-01-11 22:03:21
but it communicates that they already realized they werent going to make it out of the other end is the thing like you dont arrive with conditions for surrender unless you think you have a good chance of not winning,2023-07-24 17:14:00
if japan was already on its way to surrendering then why drop the bombs,2023-07-24 17:13:03
they probably would have surrendered do we continued to strategic bomb as well but that would result in even more japanese dead than the 2 nukes i don’t think an invasion was an absolute necessity,2023-08-02 03:06:53
"cant say i agree with it being necessarily the right thing but it was one of the first things me and my brother and i talked about it and its pretty insane how much japan had to change culturally after the war i guess you can say it helped i am aware of the pardons given in relation to 731

if you havent theres good videos my cinematyler on youtube about the film akira that goes into a lot of the connections between the nukes dropped on japan and their effect and the in story bomb dropped in the film",2023-07-27 09:28:51
no they wouldnt have surrendered they werent ready to surrender either thats why there was a coup to stop surrender even after nagasaki,2023-07-23 02:51:44

"no it was a reasonable decision the windshields on truckscars have treatments to block uva and uvb light uv light is the light that can actually can damage the eye 

regarding the solar eclipse the thing is to not stare at the sun during one  looking at one for a brief moment is perfectly fine just like briefly looking at the sun is perfectly fine during an eclipse enough light is blocked to not trigger the natural response to squint and therefore avoid damaging you eyes with uv light exposure as a result its possible to look directly at the sun during an eclipse for an extended period of time and expose your eyes to too much uv damaging them without realizing it",2023-08-28 21:13:08
i dont think so because his concern with the bomb and the sheer magnitude of the devastation of hiroshima and nagasaki are played completely straight at no point does nolan suggest that oppenheimer was ridiculous for his fears,2023-07-24 05:18:09
the movie literally starts with the prometheus quote on screen its supposed to be serious,2023-07-27 03:25:07
important to note that oppenheimers quote wasnt likening himself to vishnu but the bomb he was the prince witnessing his form,2023-07-31 00:46:43
yes but it was nolans choice to make the quote originate from the  scene thats one of the few nonhistorical inventions in this film and it leads to this result,2023-07-28 00:28:40
its also historically accurate  she didnt sign the note in real life and there are some who suggest there was foul play although most believe she committed suicide,2023-09-01 16:38:39
shes angry because tony wants to have his cake and eat it just like with the oppenheimer scene,2023-07-26 18:17:05
the only exception i feel is lewis strauss were definitely meant to hate that guy,2023-07-26 17:11:31
for sure she was great in the film her character was a bit of a mystery though we didn’t get much info on her,2023-07-31 01:30:41
it’s not really the content of the context it’s the timing and the delivery it’s like starting a joke with the punchline— it loses its effect because you need a little leadup before delivery having a story type build up gets the audience attention especially in the spoken word since you can’t easily understand the words unless you’ve already heard it i get the feeling that people who didn’t know the quote already didn’t really feel the impact i sure didn’t and i already knew the quote the fact it came from ancient hindu scripture really makes it seem more “ official “ of a quote also instead of just something he thought of,2023-07-23 23:36:58
the context introduces a distinction intent and consequences the intent was to “impress” one of the consequences is becoming death can draw a line between that and the intent to impress the world with the trinity test one of the possible interpretation of the passage is that the two can’t be morally separated,2023-07-23 13:42:46
"you really don’t see the parallel between the duty of the prince and the duty oppenheimer felt he had to his country as well as the consequences that result from that duty

the quote is far less meaningful without that context",2023-07-23 22:35:24

"i feel like teller isn’t an easy case to judge as a villain in a way it feels eerily familiar to oppenheimer himself both wanted to build a bomb and i believe that both thought it being built was inevitable and that being their first would be for the best both wanted the „go at it“ and get they recognition for doing it while still knowing they load that out it on themselves 

just that it might seem to teller with oppenheimer denying him that it edged into hypocrisy on the part of the latter you cannot argue against the hbomb with the reasons presented while also building the abomb",2023-07-23 23:01:50

they also made it clear that the bomb is getting developed no matter what at that point it’s a race there was never really a choice,2023-08-23 07:53:45
we’d already bombed the  out of them japan was not getting the message,2023-07-22 17:05:00
this isnt american propaganda this is will established and debated ww2 history and military strategy a lot of non americans also hold this view,2023-07-25 02:16:46
it must be so easy to second guess an action that ended the deadliest war we have ever fought on the planet you are welcome for the privilege to do so,2023-07-22 23:58:59
"the effect it would have on the japanese governments decision to surrender if the bomb was to be dropped in a non civilian area would unfortunately not be the same and be uncertain like someone else said bombings were dropped all the time demonstrating a single bomb explosion in the water or some field is unlikely to persuade a government hellbent on doign everything to continue fighting  this was even mentioned in the movie 

you imply that its not ok to bomb civilians but most countries in the world have done so so why call this an american propaganda",2023-07-27 00:01:01
american propaganda is the only reason why the japanese empire isn’t reviled like the nazis are i suggest you educate yourself on the pacific theater of ww2 perhaps you should learn more about how japan colonized  and genocided more than 30 million people most of them civilians across the continent of asia that is 5x the amount of jews that were killed during the holocaust japan never would have surrendered they were arming their children to continue fighting on they were happy to perpetrate some of the worst crimes against humanity but i guess that doesn’t matter to you is it because their victims were asians,2023-07-30 09:25:17
correct but that’s the issue with being human collectively as a race we could stop carbon emissions and save the earth but that’s not our nature,2023-07-23 06:37:41
its definitely not conveying that almost to the point of explicitly stating it the atomic age was inevitable those who wished to avoid it were like einstein getting passed by the quantum scientists,2023-07-24 04:25:15

"the argument you’re missing is that once pandora’s box is opened it’s not shutting once the possibility of a world dominating weapon is believed to exist then it’s a race to be the first

see this is an argument against what i was saying i dont agree and i can get into that but it is a valid argument the entire first part of your argument and what usoapdispensary was saying is not a valid counterargument and is completely pointless thats what i was saying thousands of soldiers might have died in the invasion tens of thousands of them maybe and hundreds of thousands of civillians without that second part of your comment which usoapdispensary didnt have it has no bearing on the conversation 

this isn’t a conversation of the validity of that warfare

this is the whole thing right here yes it is thats what we were talking about just pretending that its a different discussion doesnt make your comments relevant 

apples are green youre gonna have to respond to that because this isnt a conversation of oppenheimer or the nuclear bomb its about apples now and if you dont agree then i think youre not reading comments correctly",2023-07-22 23:49:26
they didnt thats the point saying there could have been a few hundred thousand more casualties more if not for the bombs is not an argument for risking several billion lives,2023-07-27 08:51:10
the scene where oppenheimer was in leiden apparently giving a lecture in dutch had the audience in amsterdam laughing nobody understood a thing,2023-07-27 17:42:03
it was ok leo szilard was played by a hungarian actor his accent is what the hungarian accent really sounds like,2023-08-29 21:27:48
yes hydrogen bombs use nuclear fusion which requires a small nuclear fission to start,2023-07-21 20:34:52
actually often a pretty big atom bomb the first stage is usually more powerful than the one from the trinity test but the second stage is many times more powerful than that,2023-07-27 00:42:19
"yeah we successfully reduced the nuclear stockpile of both the ussr and the united states by tens of thousands of warheads because both sides realized the insanity of what they were doing those efforts should continue and if the result is that we only reduce the number of nuclear weapons by several thousands more thats a victory

unfortunately yes,2023-07-29 12:36:21
it could have been something shot on a smaller scale i remember in one of the interviews nolan mentions how they used paint ball collisions and other practical effects to shoot oppenheimer visualizing strongweak force early in the movie,2023-07-27 04:06:34
"right and what i’m saying is that he didn’t have to have burnt corpses or destroyed buildings there could have been a singed bamboo sandal or the laughing blonde woman could have been turned into a screaming japanese woman not even a burned one

there were so many ways nolan could have meaningfully alluded to the japanese victims of the bomb instead he turned the white scientists into victims of their own guilt completely erasing the japanese from the story",2023-07-22 01:46:08
" is wrong with you point out in any of my comments where i said anything about making a spectacle or “making better use of an rrating”

i just think it’s pretty  gross that the victims of the atomic bomb weren’t referenced in any way beyond the names of the cities they lived in that were destroyed 

and i think it’s even more gross that rabid nolan fans like yourself are so determined to shut down any criticism of his creativity and worship at the altar of his mediocrity that you resort to ad hominem attacks 

grow up then respond with a coherent argument that’s worth reading",2023-07-23 02:41:27
"…yes but he was capable of imagining the devastation that would befall the japanese after the bombs were dropped he mentioned his concerns for the death toll and the effects multiple times throughout the movie

and yeah thanks i got the symbolism of the laughing woman but if the contrast was supposed to highlight the horror that they created the ability to destroy the world then where were the reactions of oh i don’t know horror 

this is an example of a scene that would have been incredible in the hands of a more competent director instead we have “laughing womancrying woman” and the complete erasure of the japanese from the story",2023-07-22 02:56:27

im not sure the film earns it in spite of the organic way the characters got there and any thematic resonance because of the absurdity that thats the quote she stumbled upon by accident the most iconic quote you could possibly link to oppenheimer",2023-07-22 19:49:30

"i know youre getting down voted for people disagreeing with you but i agree 100 with you 

the last act went on for far too long i really started to get bored with the movie at that point the classic nolan intense score was such a ridiculous juxtaposition to basically watching cspan for most of the last hour of the movie 

we get it the us government is filled with shady bureaucrats it just kept going on and on

oppenheimer was also completely powerless to do anything about nuclear proliferation he served his usefulness and nothing he could have said or done would have stopped the inevitable rise of the military industrial complex",2023-07-24 15:03:28
when you make the movie you can do that,2023-07-31 09:41:56

maybe she can fit in a lady bird or little women type smaller scale movie in between like nolan did with batman and the prestige or bigger scale like with inception before dkr,2023-07-24 00:00:39
criticizing gerwig for this but not nolan when he did a whole batman franchise sounds slightly misogynistic to me,2023-07-23 20:32:10

yeah thats fair they still did a ton of bomb testing and other research so i still think theres a lot of things that still remained to be covered in los alamos,2023-07-23 06:18:44
i think thats definitely meant to indicate how his creation has been taken from his control its just a question of when exactly that hand off occurred because it happened way before the bombs were loaded on those trucks,2023-07-21 19:47:36
it’s historical and the consequence of his action when you shield the audience from the results of what he did you deprive them of an honest analysis of his character it’s educational not crass any more than learning about the holocaust is crass,2023-07-22 14:44:13
i think that adds to my point,2023-07-21 17:39:55
"every action oppenheimer took directly impacted those people and the things those people went through directly impact oppenheimer this movie is about him his bomb and the millions of lives that bomb has impacted

but the scene on its own is fine tbh it feels like a cop out because this is an rrated film and easily could have done more there was no reason to make it rrated if nolan was only going to show some nudity",2023-07-21 12:44:56
"it would’ve allowed audiences to see oppenheimer for who he was based on what he actually did i mean ffs the movie is largely in part about his regret and the examination thereof but they couldn’t have the balls to actually show what he did quite frankly it’s dehumanizing to not show the devastation he caused almost as if they were either protecting his reputation or straightup don’t care about nonwhite suffering 

look i liked the movie but it is a glaring omission that would have been educational and accurate and added to the impact",2023-07-23 00:55:19
i’m not sure it’s as simple as that because of her comment about them putting it on the record and him deflecting with “it’s nothing i haven’t told you” or something to that effect he didn’t seem to be one to get embarrassed really the two women making eye contact was the most important part of that i think,2023-07-22 00:00:46
but the scene is framed as kittys perspective which is confusing as its the only time the whole film switches away from opps perspective yes theres strauss scenes but his feelingsthoughts arent displayed in the same way and his timeline is clearly defined in the beginning by the title name and the black and white,2023-07-23 13:58:13
i agree the  scenes were unnecessary but i think the children screaming was symbolic of loss of innocence or the neglect of children opps basically being an absent dadhusband to build a bomb to  innocent families with,2023-07-23 14:00:18
"i said elsewhere strauss’s perspective was established in the opening scenes as being the secondary main storyline so that’s to be expected i don’t really care about the one second of kitty riding a horse to find opps because that scene was still all about him anyway 

the chair scene was just gratuitous she didn’t need to be fully  to that extent on screen and they could’ve done it literally any other way literally just had one pov shot from kitty where side chick is visible over opps shoulder  you could just zoom in on kitty’s face and her expression would’ve made it perfectly clear 

but ya know ",2023-07-27 03:43:32

right oppenheimer was not the sole person capable of doing this if he has been denied a security clearance in 1942 groves would have just hired lawrence as the project manager and the bomb still would have been developed on a similar timetable,2023-08-05 15:59:38
"the fact that some ija officers went as far as to try and put hirohito under house arrest in order to continue the war despite people starving and japan literally being unable to produce much if any ammunition or weapons spoke volume to the level of commitment that they had towards fighting

the movies are a lot more realistic than the burton or adam west batman movies but theyre still comic book movies",2023-07-22 06:32:17

the person saying that kyoto is a beautiful city and they shouldnt bomb it thats not a choice by the filmmakers to justify bombing hiroshima or nagasaki its to show the disgusting amount of power that these people had over millions of livesand how they are so incredibly ignorant of how to use it to think that someone chose not to massacre everyone in a citynot for any specific strategic reason but because they vacationed there the person said not to bomb kyoto because it was a cultural center forgetting that when you bomb anywhere you are destroying cultural elements no matter what human lives and stories homes community centers places of worship etc etc etc its inane its supposed to make the person look bad for making that decision such a nonchalant manner as if its deciding what to eat for dinner instead of deciding the place where you will  innocent civilians

oppenheimer quoting i am become death is not justifying anything either there is no indication that him reading it means that he is religious he simply makes the connection when he witnesses for the first time the testing of the most destructive weapon that has ever existed he is not saying it in prayer he is saying it because he realizes the horror of what they have unleashedit is a weapon that can literally destroy the world as shown again and again by the conversation about nuclear arms races and the talks about the atmosphere catching on fire and destroying the planet",2023-11-19 04:36:28

"movie left a lot to be desired

i left having no idea if oppenheimer gave a  about communism the movie portrayed him as generally apathetic going with whatever politics in the current room helped his scientific ambitions or chances of getting laid

did he regret developing the atomic bomb in the movie it seems maybe for 24 hours he felt a bit bad about instantly incinerating 200000 civilians but took an aspirin for that and was all good

great acting but a rather dull figure",2023-07-29 05:36:38

"due to the extremely secretive nature of usled censorship in japan few people knew that censorship existed its existence was kept secret and the only ones aware of it were those directly in contact with the censors  writers editors and journalists45 however its inner workings have influenced the landscape of postwar japan leaving a lasting impact on its society

one of the most controversial and difficult to censor topics impacting occupation forces’ reputation were the aftereffects of the two nuclear bombs dropped on nagasaki and hiroshima us officials both within the united states and in japan immediately worked to suppress information about the effects of nuclear radiation19 while the blast of the bomb was celebrated by president truman’s radio broadcast as a powerful weapon of war information about the resulting radiation deaths and illnesses caused by the atomic bombs were suppressed by officials20 medical reports case notes and other records collected by japanese medical professionals who treated survivors at hiroshima were confiscated by american officers and remained classified for years21 occupation officials outright denied radiation effects and censored public criticism of the us bombings22 they labeled japanese and european reports of lingering “radioactive poison gas” as “propaganda” most likely wishing to avoid international stigma surrounding chemical weapons which had been banned during the first world war23

the ccd specifically undertook the censorship of public opinion in the press publication film television and radio as well as monitoring the postal letters phone calls and telegram1 in this period more than 200 million letters 136 million telegrams and 800000 telephone calls from japanese citizens were monitored12 to assess telephone calls 63 japanese and 12 foreigners monitored calls throughout japan by using 70 eavesdropping devices for postal surveillance 4000 japanese and 60 americans sampled 2 of domestic correspondence and finally for telegraphs 100 japanese and 12 american workers sampled 15 of total telegrams13

 “no destructive criticism of the allied forces of occupation and nothing which might invite mistrust or resentment of those troops”

 no “false or destructive criticism of the allied powers” which included criticisms of general macarthur and scap

 no “mention of the “fraternization” between occupation troops and japanese and of involvement of soldiers with the black market”

 no “dissemination of extremely pessimistic views of the food shortage”

it was assumed by some at the time it would take russia 20 years to make the bomb and that the us would be alone with the bomb for that amount of time instead it took 4 years

because ones history is being told within the context of the thing they break off to they arent leaving randomly theyre interrupting by jumping to event that are the reason why the story is told in the movie in the first place

 they stray from that countless times

not at all the story had three layers the secretary hearings the security clearance hearing and events from oppenheimers life the secretary hearings were dominated by the topic of security clearance hearings which were all about oppenheimers work and his personal life his character

nolan made it seem like it was vitally important that the moviegoers public spend as much money as they could and see this movie on as big an imax screen as they can get to because the trinity test they filmed was something no one had seen before yet what we were presented with in my mind was something severely underwhelming,2023-07-22 06:09:19

"i dont believe the claim that theatres were given instructions to zoom in portions of the film just because you saw a viewing of a different movie that didnt have issues 

i dont even know how they would begin to do that either considering most films are just received on a hard drive these days by what means would they be able to go in and time zooms throughout the film especially in a film like oppenheimer where the aspect ratio can change a dozen times in a minute theres no way the studio or christopher nolan would expect the movie theatres to alter the film in that way 

the theatres are responsible to play the film as received if the theatre is playing the film in a widescreen format and the screen itself is taller than the projection you will see black bars on top and bottom when the film aspect ratio changes to the 43 rounding of course then the film would be seen with black bars on the left and right and top and bottom since the overall presentations vertical resolution wouldnt change

if the theatres screen matches the aspect ratio of the movie then you would only see black bars on the left and right of the film during the 43 shots and no black bars at all for the widescreen shots",2023-07-31 10:43:40

ill concede that this is a dumb criticism although its not one that i made although i will say that the criticisms of the trinity test scene are valid it just doesnt look like a nuke

people who can’t stand non linear story telling at all

this is an oversimplification most people are okay with some degree of nonlinear storytelling youll never hear anyone here criticize pulp fiction

the criticism that ive seen is that its impossible to get attached the story or characters because the movie jumps around between three or four different eras in oppenheimers life if youre going to defend the nonlinear storytelling you have to make the argument that the lack of linearity actually benefits the story characters and themes which in the assessment of myself and many others it doesnt

people who can’t stand dialogue

people cant stand the dialogue because the dialogue is bad it is stilted and cheesy and cliched matt damon yelling how about because this is the most important  thing to ever happen in the history of the world is ridiculously cheesy and melodramatic kitty oppenheimers dialogue is basically every disgruntled wife character from every movie rolled into one everyones already talked about the destroyer of worlds scene but it is dumb i could name more examples but this wall of text is long enough

as i said earlier i found the film extremely digestible i cant name every single scientist we were introduced to in the film but in terms of key players i think nolan did a great job of introducing them and establishing their significance the constant repetition of names in the hearings didnt hurt either",2023-07-22 17:40:22

the  scene in particular was so distasteful and it feels so forced and cringe

agreed the second scene especially was just unnecessary i havent seen any valid explanation as to why it exists i feel like the film couldve gotten away with 0  scenes thus avoiding the r rating entirely and it wouldnt have turned out worse

but the issue is that the movie is still boring awfully edited and hard to watch

disagree on this i thought the way it was edited flowed nicely and worked better than a chronological telling would have i also watched with people who despite disliking long talky films like this still found it interesting 

it does not work

for you sure it works for a lot of people its all subjective i was just commenting on how your critique was likely an intentional part of the script not trying to change your already formed opinion on the movie",2023-07-27 05:19:57
"you don’t know why i was confused that nolan decided to have one bombastic scene where he and his girlfriend are  in front of a clothed board but then never employed anything remotely that weird in the rest of the movie 

no i didn’t expect it to be pure entertainment but i did expect it to be more cohesive as i said in another comment this movie subject was fascinating the story was compelling and some of the visuals were amazing and dramatic but i spent the whole movie shaking my head that this wasn’t done by someone who knew what they were doing

and i’ve given examples as to why i thought nolan’s directing choices were sloppy despite the fascinating story but i guess it’s easier to say “you obviously hate oppenheimer” than it is to provide any rebuttals to my complaints about nolan’s incompetence

nolan is the director not the marketing team which is under agents and distributors literally every movie trailer is designed to create as much hype as possible and bring attention to it doing the opposite makes no sense unless studio doesnt care about making money i havent watched the movie in 70mm nor imax 70mm so i cant definitively judge but when the image quality was decent in a digital imax theatre 70mm and especially imax 70mm would make a big difference in the experience and how visceral it is its a massive step in image resolution around 6 times more for imax 70mm compared to regular digital imax which is 29k equivalent and not 4k as some may think while laser imax is around 5k equivalent,2023-07-21 13:23:26

is that not entirely subjective though i personally took a lot away from the movie i also came to conclusions on how i felt about oppenheimer and i thought nolan did a good job of showing both the good and bad of oppenheimer and how the events on his early life repeated and influenced his later life i loved the score and the editing i don’t think i’ve ever seen a 100 million dollar movie cut with such pace i will admit the first time i don’t think i caught all the details and nuances of the movie but i didn’t leave the movie confused like you said it really is a pretty straightforward story you say it was confusingly told for me it was interestingly told and i felt the ending was incredibly powerful and harrowing again i think you would have rather just seen a different movie i don’t know if there is anything inherently wrong with the things that you disliked,2023-08-25 22:12:02

"i think you fell asleep for part of it then he was shown interacting with communists during his entire time at berkeley he expressed his feelings of solidarity with workers while speaking to lawrence we dont need to go down the rabbit hole of what he thought on every issue to know he had sympathies to some of its ideas but didnt necessarily agree with all of it he said to tatlock at one point that he didnt want to fully subscribe to one ideology over another

in front of the committee he claimed to be interested in it in an academic sense i dont think the people that wanted to see his clearance revoked really cared about that nuance though since we saw that the committee was a kangaroo court whether or not he was actually a communist wasnt really relevant to what happened to him

and you really need more specifics on what consequences of the bomb caused him to have a moral dilemma what consequences do you think perhaps made him feel bad about it",2023-07-30 20:59:43
"sure i deduced that the black and white was for the senate hearings but what was the reason they couldn’t be in color

because strauss’s own flashback scenes that he narrated were in color iirc 

and are you honestly telling me that you saw the black and white in the theater and went “ah yes this is the cue that we are now working entirely from strauss’s point of view” i would be fascinated if that was the truth especially because those scenes seemed to be from the point of view of the senate aide…",2023-07-22 02:51:20
thats what i mean the fireball doesnt match up very well this is the archival footage and the one shown in the movie is very much your typical barrels full of gas wrapped with det cord look a tall narrow wispy explosion that doesnt have much presence or permanence,2023-07-22 18:07:46
"yeah no that is not glorification of nukes in media and this take is so exceedingly ignorant andor  that i think im done with this discussion  by that logic any war movie is a glorification of war no matter the content  every movie about anything can be taken as glorification  thats not how the word works

i find it utterly laughable that you think nuclear weaponry and the implications of its existence are over represented in films seeing as how its been one of the biggest issues facing us as a species since ww2 even now you cant escape the realities of living under mad when you have countries like korea and iran trying to build nuclear weaponry and countries with huge arsenals becoming less than stable ie russia  this isnt some minor thing that doesnt plague our lives and affect society so your take is bizarre   

if you think films like the day after grave of the fireflies and dr strange love are glorifying nuclear weapons then i seriously question your grasp of the english language  what about historical films set in the cold war like 13 days  or films depicting the devastation like black rain 

i struggle to think of one highly rated well known film that portrays nuclear weapons as anything but the existential threat that they are",2023-07-24 01:36:33
also while there are some that just want to see a big explosion youre wild on thinking that an accurate depiction of the bomb and its aftermath is a bad thing  the day after among other anti nuclear war films of that era were instrumental in affecting the viewpoints of the populace on nukes  it even affected politicians with reagan commenting on the film saying that it impacted his views and influenced actual deescalation legislation  treaties,2023-07-24 01:42:25

what does trying to enjoy life and the things around have to do with it i love nolan and i went in fully expecting to love the movie i kept trying to find things about it to enjoy even after it hit a point that i knew it wasnt for me the only thing i enjoyed in it was the 20 minute testing scene and even that was just okay its not like i have some dark view of everything and wanted to hate it,2023-07-24 02:49:48

"your entire argument is based off of your own interpretation and imagination of how things look instead of taking them for what they are 

the film itself is highly accurate and you’re arguing it’s not because it didn’t make your own imagination towards oppenheimer apparent in the ways you want

you wanted the film the validate your feelings and because it didn’t you’re acting as if it’s fabricating reality whether or not you agree with the movie the majority of it is accurate and represents reality",2023-07-21 23:21:14

and from what i’ve read  oppenheimer did feel guilt over the bomb whether you feel that was a manufactured guilt is besides the point  why not just take that at face value in the movie it’s saying it doesn’t matter if he feels guilty",2023-07-21 19:04:01

"im sorry but that is not at all my recollection of how that scene went 

they talked about the calculations yes but theres a part in between where oppenheimer asks einstein if he remembers the possibility of setting off a chain reaction that would destroy the world then it ends with him saying i believe we did intercut with footage of multiple atomic bombs being dropped the imagery is clearly of multiple bombs detonating in different cities not the entire atmosphere igniting which would have looked like a single source of flameenergy spreading worldwide 

i cant prove this until theres footage on youtube i can show you but im certain im correct about this

"the japanese werent dumb they knew they didnt have a chance of outright winning a long war their entire war plan was to give america and britain enough of a bloody nose that they would accept giving up a few colonies and ceding japan hegemony over china and southeast asia their entire plan was to bait the usn into one decisive battle and failing that attrit them and grind them down through a series of battles without losing the absolute defensive line

their terms ceding that this plan did not work were status quo antebellum basically this is like if in 1944 the nazis said time out we want to surrender but we keep austria the studetenland and dont lose any territory 

the japanese also wanted to keep their current regime in charge much hay is made about hirohito keeping his head but this was american wisdom even though hirohito kept his head the emperor died he renounced his divinity and the death cult that was state shinto was burned out denied a martyr",2023-07-25 04:24:36
to force american domination in japan that is the soviet’s were preparing for an assisted invasion of japan and american leadership didn’t want another berlin wall situation in tokyo you can do more research but it’s true that japan wanted to surrender before the bombs were dropped,2023-07-24 20:16:52
because it wasnt that the entire government of japan was about to surrender the civilian leadership was pushing for it but the real power was held by the military and the emperor who did not believe it was time to surrender the civilian leadership was also holding onto the belief that the soviets could offer better terms but then when they invaded manchuria it became clear to japans civilian leadership that the soviets were duplicitous and therefore even less amenable to offering a favorable peace than the americans were,2023-08-18 14:10:27

"im reading the actual testimony of dr hill during the confirmation hearings its quite fascinating he goes a lot into how strauss forced a sham hearing into oppenheimers security credentials still working through that part

but ultimately it seems like his disapproval of strauss is that he is a controlling  that most scientists couldnt stand fermis only press conference was to bash a book about the hbomb that gave way too much credit to teller and strauss and that apparently strauss had fed all the information to the authors and dr hill included a remark that einstein apparently made about working under strauss at princeton

 i would rather choose to be a plumber or a peddler in the hope to find that modest degree of independence still available under present circumstances

so yeah it wasnt anything that oppenheimer said to einstein he just  hated strauss apparently

from reading about it more it seemed that truman wanted to shoulder the burden of responsibility of the bombing alone he told the pilot who dropped the bomb paul tibbets dont you ever lose any sleep over the fact that you planned and carried out that mission it was my decision you had no choice

he was probably peeved that people like oppenheimer felt guilty about it as if it was their decision to authorize the use of the weapon and  all those people for truman it was he who executed the order and therefore his responsibility alone so in his eyes oppenheimer was just being overly sensitive a crybaby",2023-07-22 04:23:06

what they dont mention in there comments is that at that time the us military was undergoing huge changes because of the bomb they were facing massive cuts to their budgets and individuals wanted to protect their own branches of the military army generals didnt want the government to think the bomb could replace the army 

the air force was created after the war the other branches worried theyd get all the funding their comments reflect that 

the generals statements offer insight but precisely because they were in the moment their reflections are difficult to accept at face value similar to any other historic event 

lets also remember the us needed to justify nobody ever using the bomb again their statements reflect that as well 

eisenhower who i love btw was commander in europe not the pacific

they may have believed the bomb was not needed but they didnt know what the japanese were doing inside their own borders and how they felt the country was not going to surrender short of believing total annihilation with no hope of retaliation was coming that may be difficult to accept but it is the truth what we did was cruel and horrible because our enemy was cruel and horrible at that time",2023-07-24 01:14:08

imax with dual laser projectors can also offer the full oppenheimer but is location specific so just because the ticket says imax that doesn’t mean the movie isn’t cropped imax 70mm is the only format guaranteed to have the full oppenheimer

heres another article for reference

digital projection can look very good—especially at a highquality imax a dolby cinema or another premium format—but film has a higher resolution and a different aspect ratio than digital which means the digital version of the film will be cropped horizontally compared to the 70mm version a phenomenon movie nerds have taken to calling “croppenheimer”

i dont know if you have read the bhagavad gita but the context oppenheimer is trying to give is that arjuna doesnt want to commit to war against his kin but lord krishna an incarnation of vishnu convinces arjuna that it is his dharma ie duty to wage war

in that moment where she tells him to read the words it reflects the expectation that he just does the maths without the broader context and without his ethical agency

he was tied with lots of liberal causes that put him very near lots of convicted communists and part of communist gatherings pre manhattan project did he believe in some of what they did maybe did he believe in treason no everything else is a bit murky  the brand of communism be believed in though wasnt the red communism rather more so helping refugees etc at the time though he had to play with what the politics was in the room otherwise he could have been charges with worse than security clearance issues

he was both shown to be regretful of aspects of the bomb but not of others the objective black and white view shows strauss complaining near the end of how oppenheimer probably likes being the matyr figure who was the father of the atom bomb at times as it led him to be able to advocate against further bomb creation at the time of the bombing itself he did feel regret for the victims  but also held dual beliefs that the bomb itself may have been a necessary evil provided it stopped further atomic bomb creation his growing regret and wish to meet truman etc was due to usa not showing like they will stop if anything it looked like he set off a big arms race which is what he truly regretted most 

cilian murphy acted the heck out of showing that ambiguity and tug and pull of ideals a man who seemed to have some ideals but also wasnt the best moral person who would play with the trust of the women in his life but then also ironically wish that the government would keep trust in him rather than using him for his worth at the time",2023-07-29 08:09:19

"because ones history is being told within the context of the thing they break off to they arent leaving randomly theyre interrupting by jumping to event that are the reason why the story is told in the movie in the first place  


can you rephrase this are you trying to discuss the reasoning for perspective shifts

 the story had three layers 

yes im being hyperbolic three different framing devices is still a lot

why the movie delivered exactly what you specified in the post i replied to 

no it did not deliver on that it is one thing to subtly reference something and to actually show it

why is that insufficient

showing the actual bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki could have created a more visceral and emotional response from the viewer while internalizing guilt is an effective narrative technique it pales to witnessing the immediate consequences

im by no means saying it is invalid to deal with in abstract like the movie did with the gymnasium scene it is a matter of artistic taste and a matter of casebycase for example say you and i did a movie about the nuremberg trial and discuss if we should flashback to showing innocents being gassed or if we should just artistically reference it both are two strong artistic paths to take  

but in this hyperspecific scenario and context nolans oppenheimer showing wouldve been the stronger artistic statement in my humble opinion",2023-08-08 15:56:20
"im a physicist hes cool but pales in scientific achievements compared to others hes still pretty well known  exactly as expected as he did that other great thing i dont think hes either over nor underrated if you will he was well known before and after his clearance thing which freckly today no one knows about particularly outside of the us

you also haven’t made a single argument supporting your opinion you just keep stating things as fact so either you don’t know how to argue your point or you just can’t think of a good response it’s okay i’m sure michael bay will have another movie coming out again soon that you can talk about on your forums until you’ve figured out how to watch and appreciate a movie with a plot other than “a happened then b happened then c happened”",2023-07-28 17:20:24

i pointed that out by referring to the last two minutes of the movie my assertion and the assertion of many others is that it fell flat because his execution was off

it was really important and the director was trying to communicate that so has every director of every  historical movie ever

"although i will say that the criticisms of the trinity test scene are valid it just doesnt look like a nuke

thats fair though i disagree especially in the later shots looks exactly like the trinity video ive seen for me its good enough having one done with cgi or whatever wouldnt have added much value for me 

x200b

the criticism that ive seen is that its impossible to get attached the story or characters because the movie jumps around between three or four different eras in oppenheimers life if youre going to defend the nonlinear storytelling you have to make the argument that the lack of linearity actually benefits the story characters and themes which in the assessment of myself and many others it doesnt

this is in the minority from what ive read on here most people complain its confusing and they cant follow it i view as just a different way to tell the story its part of the art i didnt have an issue getting attached to the story or characters but if others didnt thats fair 

people cant stand the dialogue because the dialogue is bad it is stilted and cheesy and cliched matt damon yelling how about because this is the most important  thing to ever happen in the history of the world is ridiculously cheesy and melodramatic kitty oppenheimers dialogue is basically every disgruntled wife character from every movie rolled into one everyones already talked about the destroyer of worlds scene but it is dumb i could name more examples but this wall of text is long enough

even if i agreed that a few lines were cheesy i wouldnt blanket the entire dialogue as a whole bad as for matts line thats exactly what a no nonsense lieutenant general would say and it was one of the most important things to happen to the world now maybe you didnt like the delivery of it which is fair 

x200b

youre just listing things at this point the complaints about the sound and audio are valid as far as im concerned

"i get where youre coming from but its funny to me youre talking about being unoriginal when there are only so many opinions and stories for that matter it all boils down to some variation of i liked it noissues i liked it but have some criticism neutral or they didn’t like it they didnt  like it but liked some other aspect of the production 

people in general care way too much about what other people think about art or anything they mistake someone expressing their opinion for them declaring it  to be a statement of fact when thats not remotely the case 

or they think that person likes something i dont like and are happy or dislike something i like and i tied my identity to that one thing so thats a personal attack on me and if im wrong about that one thing what else have i been wrong about now thats unoriginal and were all guilty of it

one of the reasons i initially mentioned people not being aware of their history is that most americans arent to a large degree most of the country cant even read at an eighth grade level i understand that some people are more fortunate than others and have had better opportunities but it is mildly frustrating when you do hear something you enjoy being critiqued by people who dont really have the background to  understand it again thats not saying you have to have that background to enjoy the film on its own merits people arefree to engage with things the way they want to but youre definitely going to understand more and appreciate it if you have a familiarity with the subject matter",2023-07-23 01:13:02

and in regards to oppenheimer it being technical masterpiece doesn’t suddenly make it one of the best movies of the last decade

the cuts to visual effects depicting a fission reaction  

the scene in the gym where it was literally louder than the shockwave from the bomb even though the gym only had a couple dozen people

these have to be used sparingly otherwise it risks creative license going overboard  i still do not know why you have a problem with this

i spent the whole movie shaking my head that this wasn’t done by someone who knew what they were doing

i simply wished i knew why you thought this way

i’m really not a  person so perhaps it’s nolan’s style i can’t jibe with but i do think he makes it very hard to follow some plot points like aaron sorkin uses a lot of dense language but usually you can still follow the main plot in his scripts with nolan i think he’s always trying to do twists and surprise people and in doing so just loses the audience at least in tenet and oppenheimer i didn’t have a problem with memento inception interstellar etc and understood everything important in the first viewing",2023-08-04 23:35:04

i do not agree memento and interstellar has great female characters i think theyre all 2dimensional paper dolls nolan uses to get his male leads emotionally invested in the plot i think you conveniently omitted inception which has some of his worst representation of women of his career and i think that just because a film has a military setting doesnt mean every female character should be relegated to bland love interest it may be a shock to you but women did actually exist in the 1940s and 50s

id give dunkirk a pass because its taking primarily on an actual battlefield during an real war tenet is a scifi future so there really is no excuse and oppenheimer decided to make its only female characters exist solely to make oppy feel guilty and also sleep with him",2023-07-26 06:13:54

you’re a twenty year old business student i can guarantee you know exactly nothing about anything in particular

you keep undermining my own intelligence but i am yet to see a good example of your own i wonder why only your lack of reading comprehension and your short temper and insecurity are shining through i see that some people have looked down on your mba so i’m sure there’s a little bit of resentment and embarrassment fuelling this fire

like i just said if the bomb explosion in the film is technically accurate that’s great do you know what i mean when i say “scale” in regards to the scene in the film because i don’t think you do what i am saying is that despite how realistic it may have been it was not impressive in the film this is as a result of the way the scene was shot and edited i feel as if this did not allow the explosion scene to have the sense of scale and impact that it should have i don’t even really know why we’re arguing about this it’s sort of down to personal preference but of course your personal preference is probably right though seeing as you are obviously much smarter than me

i’m sure you’re going to respond with “i didn’t mean any of those quippy scenes obviously i meant the other ones”

that’s a great strawman argument there i like how you’re preemptively getting angry at my responses very intelligent discussion

"firstly thank you for responding civilly i am all for civil discussion if we have differing views

i do understand the stylistic intention and i do respect it in this current climate of films which seems to be so dominated by franchises and sequels and remakes j really really appreciate films like oppenheimer and i think it’s incredible how an almost 3 hour long biopic has become so successful

i do like the symbolism in the gymnasium scene and its similarities to  rallies i do feel as if it was effective at conveying the emotions it was trying too

as for the bomb explosion i do recognise why nolan would hold back from showing it in its entirety i just my critique of that is down to personal preference i suppose after how it had been hyped up which admittedly is a negative of hype and not the actual film itself i was expecting more and so when i first saw it i was a little disappointed but again i completely understand why they would not want to show it as this epic and ‘beautiful’ scene",2023-07-25 14:24:00

"i didnt fall asleep in any of it but i honestly wanted to just walk out just like some people in the theatre did because the third act was a complete drag and the first two acts were barely cohesive with its constant time jumps and perpetual one minute cuts from scene to scene without providing any context

again oppenheimer was telling the committee and by proxy the audience why he might have been interested and had connections with communist members but it wasnt shown show us why he was even interested in communism to begin with how did the political ideology align wih his person beliefs and moral compass

and yes i would very much like the movie to show audience the actual direct consequences of the atomic bombs in hiroshima and nagasaki because this is something that 99 of modern audience in 2023 dont actually have an idea about it would have be much more convincing and powerful as to why oppenheimer had such a staunch reaction to the development of hbomb if we are actually shown the direct human consequences and the extent of destruction of nuclear weapons

"it doesn’t even matter if you understand american history because they don’t even properly highlight why the “unreliable narrator” angle is even relevant until the last third of the movie which makes the whole rdj heelturn fall flat and in my opinion really hurts the viewer’s immersion in the narrative

its one thing to reference events that will be fully explained later to build intrigue for the audience but the structure of the movie means the first third was just referencing stuff that even outside the narrative you would have no context for unless you already knew the stories of all these characters in that sense it is a movie that probably benefits from a rewatch but i can’t help but feel like it would have been a lot less annoying and more impactful if it had just been reedited into a straight biopic

to put into context the beirut explosion was less than 2 the size of hiroshima bomb and with the many many videos floating around on instagram of that beirut blast… it’s crazy to think what happened to  hiroshima and nagasaki",2023-07-28 06:33:17

"i’m sorry i am not super conversant in modern era history but would you say that was very similar to the plan the vietnamese had and whathow they were able to achieve

discounting any atomic weapons do you think the allied powers would have eventually gone for that plan or would they have landed armed forces along the beaches of japan and forced surrender region by region through the entire country eventually setting up a military hegemony to keep the peace 

do you think the vietnamese got this idea from the japanese during world war ii or is this a common aspect to cultures that revere elderstheir leader above all others was the death cult sich a major component 

sorry i don’t mean to question you like i’m an ap history test your comment just brought up a lot of questions that i will probably spend the next couple of weeks researching and looking into

last thought americans would maybe fight invaders city by city to include the women and children taking up arms though i’m not entirely sure it would depend on who the invaders were i guess do you think americans would be as fanatical about it as the japanese were purported to be or was the divinity of the emperor a huge factor in that cultural component of their society",2023-07-31 03:46:39
a soviet invasion of japan would have been even more brutal than an american one if there really was an imminent soviet invasion then the bombs probably saved even more lives,2023-07-27 02:13:20

and it was basically the entire function of the imperial japanese government post 1920 of so like literally the entire function of the government was attempt to guess what low level army and navy officers want us to do and then attempt to jump out ahead and do that before they  us   
this was increasingly complicated by the army and the navy wanting different things which made the government incredibly dysfunctional and resulted in a lot of politicians getting sworded by junior officers

this is literally what led to japan going to war with china some  junior officers staged a false flag and invaded china on their own and everyone up to and including the imperial cabinet just sort of went along with it to save face",2023-07-25 04:33:58

dude my point is they didn’t show any of the victims at all it adds to my point it protects the audience from the victims of oppenheimer’s actions,2023-07-21 19:09:42
"i am watching the  movie so i do get to say if i feel its really utilizing that rrating or not art isnt anything if the people you make it for arent allowed to express how they feel about it

the scene itself was good it is just underwhelming when you remember this is an rrated film the excuse that he didnt see it directly is such a cop out since he still sees the bodies and the crying women anyway and he does come to know about other details of hiroshima survivors through the radio that would have let him imagine it in more details

again its a good scene but it lacks that punch it feels like a generic way to represent the horrors of the atom bomb which would have been fine had this movie just been a pg13 romp but this was rrated it could have done more i find it dissatisfying that the only scene in the movie worth an rrating was that ridiculous  scene",2023-07-21 13:50:33
"im not sure why you came to the conclusion that i or anyone else are asking for real images of real victims to drive home the point that is missing the point of the argument that this film has an rrating and yet makes about no use of it i cant think of any other atom bomb related movie that is rrated not barefoot gen not even the original godzilla so this movie had the opportunity to do something with that rating

what the film did and what im asking for isnt any different i just wanted more visceral imagery that took advantage of the rrating but instead the rating hinges wholly on a laughable  scene",2023-07-31 06:32:00
"by that logic are all war movies disrespectful no of course not it would serve an important educational purpose in the film and narratively towards the themes as well

it’s not like it’s unethical to view photos of the victims is it no it depends on context it wouldn’t be unethical to show cgi people dismembered to drive home what oppenheimer felt guilty about which they did anyway just on white people because that’s how little they cared about confronting there reality of what he did 

do you oppose historical education should we whitewash everything for your sensibilities and shield people’s reputation from their crimes

it sounds like you care about protecting oppenheimer’s legacy more than driving home the atrocities that were inflicted on these people",2023-07-23 01:42:34
well what you “feel like” is completely wrong “full frontal nudity from pugh and murphy” is not “her  are out several times but he sits cross legged once” that’s not equal full front nudity it never is it’s like when game of thrones was airing and there was a topless woman every 25 seconds but the male fans would rant and rave about the one  shown in 9 seasons meant that there was male nudity “as well” it’s a joke there was no reason to have either  scene shown in the film and to have only adulterous  scenes shown while wifey just obediently births kids off screen and weeps for three hours while being cheated on could’ve easily had both scenes without showing anything and actually keeping it “equal”,2023-07-27 14:00:08

when truman died they cleaned out his personal desk and found a purple heart that hed saved from the korean war along with a note from the late recipients father which stated that he wanted to return the medal to the person most responsible for his sons death truman kept that note in his desk until he died which really speaks volumes about his character

"sure it has beauty in it but it doesnt communicate that as its main theme it is more about the emotion of anxiety rather than lovebeautydisconnectpain or any other emotion trough any art or medium is the art of reaching out and touching someone elses soul because you can never truly know how anyone else feels we have to communicate it interpret it and that is done trough symbolism or to try and communicate the disjointed thing we call subjective reality to communicate our inner world to someone else 

i think nolan did a fine job with this movie but anxiety in a sense is not my favourite subject its something i have enough of in my life and therefor did not enjoy it as much as i had hoped",2023-07-26 21:25:54
"i have to disagree showing the actual bombing would be boom boom bam bam to the viewer the abstract way especially since we dont see the past from anyone elses pov but oppenheimers was better if you want to focus on big explosions and not artistry like youre clearly saying here not the characters pick bayformers instead

the movie is very consistent we are shown the present with strauss and the present was all about retelling the story of the security clearance hearing which in turn was about oppenheimers life

those werent three different framing devices that was one framing device with three layers if you cant tell the difference here then all i can do is politely smile and walk away shaking my head each layer moved chronologically and each layer portrayed the events in it consistently

"last response from me

the official oppenheimer aspect ratio guide for non imax digital screenings of the film is to display as a flat 221 projection inside a 1851 letterbox which would result in black bars on the top and bottom of the screen for the widescreen portions of the film and black bars all around the image for what would have been the imax 70mm taller shots

its here 

for someone who comes off as seemingly intelligent as you do youd think youd be better at being less of an idiot youve had me tell you the same thing three times in a row now just to help you understand

tldr the theatre is not responsible for fixing anything about the aspect ratio of the film theyre going to display the film as received based on their theatre if people want to see imax resolutions displayed optimally they should see the film in imax",2023-08-03 05:48:53

"you are one extremely dense cookie first of all my original comment was in reply to someone who was making the point that the pivotal part of history that the hearing represented was the taking down of an american hero thats simply not true the hearing had minimal effect on oppenheimers legacy i noticed how you conveniently left out the end of my comment when you initially quoted me it was a behindcloseddoors private hearing which had the effect of not renewing a security clearance hardly changed americans opinions of the man

but yes lets go beyond that lets talk about oppenheimers ability to influence policy which you steered me towards now youre saying that the all important effect of the revocation of his security clearance was not to do with the us pursuit of the hbomb but rather the all important effect was to do with oppenheimers ability to influence policy how his ability to influence policy could be so important while simultaneously the realization of his most avowed policy position ie against the hbomb race be so unimportant one wonders

the facts are that a oppenheimers policy positions were already known well before his security clearance was revoked b the truman administration had already established the policy direction of pursuing the hbomb in 1950 well before his security clearance was revoked c his opposition to the hbomb was on moral grounds not out of strategic concerns and d the geopolitical realities of the cold war and strategic considerations dictated nuclear policy to a far greater extent than anything else",2023-07-29 19:17:07
"it was one of the most important parts of oppenheimers life lol did you watch the movie do you have any idea about his story beyond the 4 years he spent on the manhattan project

google is your friend  its littered with articles discussing dune in the pantheon of all time great sci fi movies it won a ton of awards made a ton of money and yielded at least two sequels almost immediately after releasing  by any standard imaginable its among the best films of the last decade

and in regards to oppenheimer it being technical masterpiece doesn’t suddenly make it one of the best movies of the last decade

michael jordan won 6 championships multiple awards and is in the hall of fame but that doesnt suddenly make him one of the best players lol",2023-07-23 20:06:41
"all i know is he liked to cheat lol 

it seemed like he barely wrestled with the fact they just created a word killing gadget 

sure they did flashy out of bodymind experiences but thats not how you effectively get an emotional shift across that just made the move tense",2023-07-25 22:35:39
i enjoyed the movie i knew a lot about oppenheimers life going into it so maybe that helped idk just seems weird to me that people are willing to put that much effort into tearing down something they didnt like get over it and move on,2023-07-25 16:39:09
"the security clearance interview is what i was talking about the actual  scene wasn’t out of place and even then he didn’t use the same style for both scenes

sure to being with the visuals were all over the place stylistically in the beginning of the movie oppenheimer dreamed of atoms and flashes of electricity and that all goes away about the third of the way through the film not too egregious but noticeable

then almost every decision made about strauss’s presentation was pretty sloppy like during the scooby doo moment where strauss was revealed to be some behindthescenes villain there was audible confusion in my theater because outside of one anecdote about how he kind of got embarrassed by oppenheimer one time and then once offered him a job no one knew who the  this guy was in relation to oppenheimer sloppy

and then the total lack of any kind of creative representation of japan or the japanese people when there must be like 20 instances of someone alluding to oppenheimer’s guilt by saying “i know you feel guilty” is pretty freaking egregious

nolan is trying to be david fincher or stanly kubrick but he just doesn’t have the depth as a director to pull these epic movies off",2023-07-22 15:40:46
it would be wrong for the 2 to call that boring as obviously they are in the overwhelming minority they are of course free to say i personally find this boring but that is not the same as this is boring,2023-07-22 15:54:42
yes i know but it wouldve been a really good opportunity to show the suffering of the japanese,2023-07-30 17:28:54
to each their own personally the combination of the acting namely cillian’s trinity test showing both sides of oppenheimer instead of touting him as a hero or villain among others made this a brilliant movie in my eyes,2023-07-24 02:40:30
i think the real issue is the dialogue is just hard to hear and nolan refuses to do adr it was less of an issue for me in oppenheimer compared to tenet i’ve only seen it once and i genuinely don’t think i understood 50 of the dialogue with oppenheimer i think i absorbed 85 of the movie with the first viewing and 100 with the second i’d honestly recommend seeing it again i liked it a lot the first time but after the second viewing i thought it was genuinely a masterpiece,2023-08-05 00:12:14

yes it isnt about the victims of the bombs the title of the movie is oppenheimer and every trailer shows that the movie is about him and the story behind developing the bomb where did you get any indication that it would be about the people who died in hiroshima or nagasaki,2023-08-21 00:51:52
"have you been in the army i have and even today there are almost no women in special forces that wont change in the next 30 years so tenet is accurate in not having women in the film

just because something is set in the future doesnt mean gender balances will be 50 50

i didnt conveniently omit inception i gave you a data sample set its not my job to list every single instance for you to demonstrate a point fyi

also funny how you dont know the definition of a data point

a data point is a discrete unit of information in a general sense any single fact is a data point the term data point is roughly equivalent to datum the singular form of data

you want to argue about properly arguing on the internet get a hobby dude you accuse the movie of not having anything that it actually does it’s like saying the sky isn’t blue in your opinion then going full manbaby keyboard warrior over people that point out how you’re wrong just silly no point in arguing with a brick wall,2023-08-02 19:30:35
"i think if you want a deeper dive into the intricacies his beliefs buy the biography

and i think showing the bombs drop is overkill and unnecessary we know what happened two cities got obliterated it also takes us out of the immersion of the time the people who worked on the project built the bomb and then saw it picked up shipped off they only heard about it on the radio that they were used oppenheimer never saw the death and destruction that they caused he was only left to wonder about it for the rest of his life after witnessing the test

thats literally what the scene is about when he gets a raucous ovation from the los alamos researchers and families his thoughts were dominated by what his creation had actually been used to do a world away",2023-07-30 21:18:31

after watching the doco that came out and a few youtube videos i feel a bit more educated about what happened in that era",2023-07-23 19:10:39
"doesn’t have to be a documentary to be as accurate as one a biopic can be just as accurate as a documentary it will just be presented by actors instead of archive footage even some documentaries will have recreations 

like i said earlier the only thing not accurate in the film is when oppenheimer started seeing the crowd as bomb victims",2023-07-21 23:34:47
"i guess that’s where we ultimately differ here whether his guilt was genuine or not  it’s impossible to know i don’t see it as a mark on the movie that it’s portrayed as being likely genuine  and even still there are moments that suggest it isn’t actually genuine its portrayed as fairly nuanced  so i don’t see what would have been made more interesting by leaning hard into it not being genuine that seems very black and white 
and reductive like it would’ve reduced the dramatic impact of the whole thing if it gave some easy answer like that especially when by the end the film is telling you it really doesn’t matter if he felt guilt one way or another",2023-07-21 19:43:33
