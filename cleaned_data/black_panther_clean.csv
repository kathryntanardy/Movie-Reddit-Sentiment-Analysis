namor casually giving shuri a water suit of someone he probably killed painfully and removed their body from was pretty morbidly funny,2022-11-11 11:05:38
i was a bit confused when okoye was fighting namors soldiers on the street she stabbed them with mortal wounds and they healed instantly but when nakia shot them rescuing shuri they died and couldn’t heal what’s the deal,2022-11-11 07:40:26
"the ironheart suit looked too much like baymax i hope they give her a suit that looks like the comics in the show 

the midnight angel suits made me think of rowlet the pokemon and once i saw it i couldnt unsee it their design couldve been better 

i wouldve liked to see shurri in action as black panther more the final battle felt kind of rushed 

the ross and elaine stuff felt shoehorned in to set up thunderbolts they could have cut that stuff and saved it for the tb movie 

and minor gripe but it did feel kinda weird that none of the other avengers were there for tchallas funeral i get the logistics of why they werent in the movie but just having bucky sam pepper etc off to the side wearing white for the procession would have been nice 

on the positive side namor looked cool as  and im impressed they pulled off his wingsflying without it looking super goofy talokan looked super cool too and i dug how it parralled wakanda the acting was also really great 

and oh  she has an ironman suit is my new official favorite piece of dialog from an mcu movie",2022-11-11 22:05:35
this movie is another example of when serving the greater universe interrupts the current movie riri is a plot device that was evidently inserted because shell be getting a disney plus show fine but the story surrounding her characterwhy is namor trying to  her when the cia already has her machine are they really implying that the cia wouldnt record the work she did it doesnt matter if u  her when the technology is already out there lol also why is she still just in school when shes basically made the most important invention in modern history lol,2022-11-13 02:22:55
when namor returned to land to bury his mother and said what he saw was more than he could comprehend i legit thought we were gonna see a starbucks,2022-11-12 23:34:28
"so the wakandans only brought one boat for a technologically advanced nation why didnt they use something like a helicarrier or anything that didnt need to touch the surface of the water 


also what happened to all their pew pew spears that theu used in infinity war 


idk why but i was siding with namor and his people",2022-11-11 10:52:05
the amount of time that the production team spent on okoyes suit was the same amount of time it took shuri and riri to find namors weakness,2022-11-11 18:22:29
"my biggest gripe with the movie that’s not being mentioned here is how this completely does away with what we walked away from in black panther 1 killmonger was the eye opener to how  it was of wakanda to close its borders and turn their back on the world while blacks were first slaves then eventually treated like 2nd hand citizens wakanda did nothing and killmonger came for revenge well fricken t’challa recognized this bs from the elders in the ancestral plane slap their  and said no more his whole character growth in that movie was realizing that his cousin wasn’t exactly wrong in his thinking but that he was wrong in his execution 

but nah black panther 2 is like  that  humans  france for some reason and  the world we’re just gonna forget that ever happened and share nothing with y’all what an awesome way to honor t’challas passing by just forgetting what he stood for just ignoring it entirely actually in the first 10 minutes of the movie

namor was badass though needed him for like 45m instead of the 10 we got with him",2022-11-14 07:14:26
"i think ai might be the end of us all

ai is not like the movies mother

they literally live in a universe where an ai almost took over the world",2022-11-11 12:31:59
i’m going to need a reacting gif of mbaku seeing all of those people on the whale,2022-11-11 04:11:45
shuri might be the skinniest superhero,2022-11-12 01:02:11
namor was like hit me on the shell when you ready,2022-11-11 17:21:35
okoye’s suit made her look like sonic,2022-11-11 03:37:55
"hold up so the queen went to haiti to ask the mother of her grand child to go on a deep dive rescue op leaving her child and the future heir to wakanda alone


listen i know a good ole fashioned orphaning is a way to make a good superhero but that seems pretty drastic",2022-11-12 04:28:36
so there was vibranium in the coast of the mayan empire but it was never discovered by western civilization besides namors moms tribe,2022-11-11 03:22:00
"i had to build a quantum computer to decrypt the security code i wrote

okay what the actual  are you talking about ironheart",2022-11-12 02:16:05
angela bassett killed it as ramonda the scene where she yells at okoye felt so raw,2022-11-11 03:23:28
angela bassett is 64,2022-11-11 23:45:52
makes me wonder what the original script with chadwick was supposed to be like,2022-11-11 09:04:35
star of the movie was lupita’s side profile,2022-11-12 00:03:26
psa there is no end credits scene only a midcredits scene,2022-11-11 03:18:57
did okoye  martin freeman’s guards i can never tell if they are killing or temporarily knocking people unconscious,2022-11-11 12:38:16
looks like shuri shouldve listened to okoye about that midnight angel suit lol,2022-11-11 03:10:38
namor is a  badass mans was euro stepping in the sky,2022-11-11 05:47:17
"so namor didn’t wanna trust wakanda with riri and wanted to  her 

end of the movie leaves riri alone 

felt like he killed a bunch of people for virtually no reason",2022-11-13 11:29:49
if that final fight was namor weakened then him at full strength is insane his action was very well done the way he moved was so unique pushing off his winged feet and changing direction so quick in the air but still feeling weighted and strong was very cool to see,2022-11-11 05:25:44
so my take away was wakanda cant defend themselves thier queenprincess and protect their borderswhile patrolling on the water after being informed their new enemy lives under the sea if shuri didnt pop up with namor at the end on the ship she would have seen all her men dead on that boat like whos on charge here  i need to see a manager ,2022-11-12 03:06:04
namor origin story was pretty visually interesting,2022-11-11 03:13:54
"angela bassett is still amazing in this  she acts her  off

namor was a good antagonist and i’m glad we don’t seem to be done with him by a long shot

the killmonger cameo was a nice touch",2022-11-11 03:30:55
 havent seen anyone mention the introduction of the talokans  felt like a horror movie at that moment with the sirens singing and those on board jumping off from the ship that and the funeral scene were probably my favorite parts about the film the movie was alright too 710 i would say,2022-11-11 10:34:12
okoye was right that suit is hideous,2022-11-11 03:05:04
why was it important for namor to  ironheart her vibranium detector was already known to the cia killing her will not have stopped them from detecting vibranium again,2022-11-13 02:21:42
wakandan army try to win a fight challenge impossible,2022-11-12 10:28:58
"i enjoyed it but i think it still fell short or expectations  they did a good job all things considered  i definitely got teary eyed a few times angela bassett was fantastic

the intro was very well done first 15 minutes were super promising imo

riri didn’t fall as flat as america chavez helps that we know we’re getting a show with her though

my fav scene was easily ramonda stripping okoye of her title easily the best acting we’ve seen in the mcu imo

i think it was too long i really liked namor’s backstory but feel like where his story ended didn’t warrant as much time as we did spend with him

vfx was not great at times the use of volume was easy to spot towards the third act",2022-11-12 23:51:39
i’ve never heard a theater as quite as it was during tye chadwick opening credits,2022-11-11 03:27:39
i find it deeply ironic how shuri protested that her ai isnt like the ones you see in movies yet it behaves exactly like any ai would in a typical scifi movie,2022-11-11 10:35:30
so assuming he was unchallenged does mbaku just become king of wakanda now are they gonna let two people run around with black panther powers,2022-11-11 03:16:52
"for all people complain about mcu films being too formulaic or generic phase 4 has been heavily driven by director vision and style

the film was as im sure everyone will point out too long  the cia plot was unnecessary and only saved by the charisma of the actors  and it did somewhat function as a breathing moment between the other events  the most egregiously unnecessary bit was the prolonged car chase scene with domestic police that ends with several cop cars destroyed an international incident and a completely deserted bridge somewhere near boston  it made no sense and they did the car chase thing in the first movie

chadwicks death was handled well  it doesnt particularly matter but i felt like they should have gotten the hes sick concept out faster  

ironhearts inclusion felt quite shoehorned  riris characterization never really solidified either  

angela bassett is absolutely amazing in this movie  she and danai gurira carry the first two thirds of the film which is why their characters removal from the primary focus in the final third weakens things so much  

this films first issue is that it starts off asking the viewer to care very much about an arguably minor interest side character from the first film  and it makes that character rigid and unlikable through the whole of the film shuri doesnt believe in the spirit realm despite her entire family line having seen it first hand  not to mention the whole space magician vanishing half the universes population thing  

this problem of unlikable main character is worsened by the fact that the villain is charismatic and mostly justified in his actions  mostly namors choice to attack civilians and then assassinate a queen makes zero  sense  he flips from protecting our people is important to ill  your civilians and assassinate your queen which brings me to what i think the core problem is with this movie  

all of these people are terrible leaders of insanely powerful nation states  well powerful if not for their crippling stupidity  the broad bones of this story namor and the wakandans is a political one  about how another rival nation with access to vibranium reacts to knowledge of the mineral spreading  about the transfer of power from a strong leader to a novice  about how militant advisors can goad a leader into irrational responses  unfortunately thats not the story coogler was remotely interested in telling he wanted to focus on the family drama and grief and all that which is fine except its like putting an ill fitted human meat suit over the skeleton of an orangutan  it works but its also bizarrely uneven

on the whole i liked it but it was rather dull certainly not fun  not interested in seeing more of shuri as black panther or wakanda in general for that matter",2022-11-14 15:47:05
“you made an amazing suit but i can’t allow you to take it” “…disney mandates you must atleast have 6 episodes of your own show to build one again”,2022-11-11 04:59:51
i just wanna say i love the underwater city if only they did more scenes in it,2022-11-11 03:24:57
"i dont understand how ten years into superheroes being a thing in this universe that the navy seals and special forces still exist more or less exactly like they do today in the real world

were going to break into a wakandan research lab and steal  were going to guard a secret that will literally change the balance of power in the world 

 heres a gun have fun doing jack  to anyone with a superpower or sufficiently advanced technology

why arent there teams of supes for this exact situation",2022-11-11 05:45:46
"shuri was nearly the worst part of this movie she was upstaged in every scen she had by namor by m’baku by the queen by naki by okoye

she’s going to get absolutely swallowed in the team up movies",2022-11-15 01:52:02
the origin of the name namor was pretty creative and cool imo i like how they blended that in with mcus own rendition of the character,2022-11-11 03:30:04
dont dont fight the talokans on the ocean ,2022-11-11 05:22:36
i was really hoping to see more from my dude m’baku  i thought he’d definitely have a bigger role in this one but felt like he was on the sidelines for a lot of the movie,2022-11-11 03:19:28
i feel like i could have cut out most of the cia plot and shaved 30 unnecessary minutes from this movie,2022-11-11 03:26:06
so you have a very important prisioner and you decide to send him alone with only two officers over a road that is completely alone and with no backups,2022-11-11 06:18:14
real question how does the food in talokan not just get super mushy,2022-11-11 05:55:05
that was the dumbest most hideous suit i’ve ever seen  they did okoye dirty,2022-11-11 03:15:20
of course they have letitia wright fighting an enemy that wears facemasks,2022-11-11 04:21:00
love they cast lake bell to  her in three minutes ,2022-11-11 12:54:33
"namor is such a  and at times an outright  and yet you cant help but find him in some ways noble in how much he wants to protect his people

i have my fair share of problems with the movie but overall i had a good time namor is awesome and cant wait to see more from him,2022-11-11 03:07:45
"did a great job paying tribute to chadwick without being egregious most of the acting was on point cgi buckled a bit in spots the new suits looked hideous literally look like something out of the power rangers some very creative choices and then some very awkward choices 

i have not seen the last couple of shows but julia louis dreyfus character needs to be explained already she first showed up almost 2 years ago and it is getting exhausting",2022-11-11 04:47:04
the predator handshake between shuri and m’baku when she made her entrance as black panther was awesome fun way to test her strength,2022-11-11 06:07:22
it just kept going at the end no wonder they named it wakanda forever,2022-11-11 19:20:49
"okoye deserved to be fired 

i noticed early on that angela bassett had a lot of screen time and immediately thought “uh oh”  that was really hard to see her face down in the water like that 

i was concerned that they were about to pull some shurimbaku mess and was trying to calculate the age gap but fortunately that didn’t happen 

overall i wish we had more time in wakanda and not so much in the us  act 2 was trying to cram in a lot and i think the movie creaks under the weight of all of it  i still had a good time",2022-11-11 03:08:15
the opening marvel studios credits with the tribute to chadwick boseman was fantastic everyone in my theater went quiet for that part,2022-11-11 03:03:43
this felt like two different movies one was a big epic blockbuster dealing with a war between namor and wakanda probably written when chadwick still alive the other was a more somber dark movie with the characters dealing with the loss of tchalla  and the fractured political  state while america trying to steal vibranium both were good but i dont know if they gelled together so well still enjoyed it though,2022-11-11 18:28:10
this movie needed more mbaku though,2022-11-13 04:14:26

i just feel like phase 4 has really fallen flat for me other than shang chi and spiderman",2022-11-12 04:31:30
great tribute for chadwick namor was fkn cool movie was a bit too long imo,2022-11-11 03:09:13
"after 2 viewings and some time to mull over this one i think this film is a mixed bag it does a great job of paying tribute to chadwick and i think letitia wright and angela bassett are phenomenal namor is a great villain and i cant wait to see namore so happy they didnt force in a billion unfunny jokes every second and i actually appreciate the length after lat and mom suffered from their runtimes 

x200b

unfortunately a lot of things didnt work for me as well ironheart is very shoehorned and imo she isnt a great character and i feel she was taking attention from characters like mbaku and nakia that i felt were underused as per usual of the modern day mcu there was some wonky cgi the final act is straight up bad and one of the worst mcu final battles and the resolution to the talokanwakanda conflict wasnt good imo the editing was really off on this one so many scenes felt cut short and the editing in the action specifically wasnt good 

x200b

overall while this movie does have some high points i still think it is overall a disappointment",2022-11-11 23:34:24
did anyone else feel like the movie was shot really dark there were at least 2 or 3 scenes i couldn’t tell what was going on,2022-11-11 11:39:16
"i loved the talokan people loved their introduction loved the whales loved their little water masks and combat skills it was always so creative and i never knew what was going to happen i’m so glad i went in without knowing anything i thought i was crazy when it seemed like mermaids would be in the mcu

also…when shuri i think sets the cop cars on fire…did she just  several cops ",2022-11-11 03:02:46
"so namors fighting style was awesome looked like he’s swimming even in the air

his throne was also awesome 

however they really should have further fleshed out his peoples powerslimitations

also this feels like yet another marvel movie where nameless government foil in the beginning is actually pretty correct since wakanda didn’t share anything about vibranium if namor doesn’t concede or somehow wins there they  everyone on the surface right like they’re about to  off ironheart and the wakandans on that ship",2022-11-11 05:30:15
"fire the head of security namor not only figures out how to break into wakanda but specifically can find just the queen and one week later wakanda gets caught with its pants down again

did the side character stuff with martin freemen amount to anything other than setting up thunderbolts ,2022-11-11 04:02:32
what they did with namor taking him from just an atlantean doing atlantean  to being the prodigal son of a mayan tribe driven to the sea by the spanish that is an incredibly inspired change that makes him so much more interesting as a character imo it grounds him in something real and it furthers his connection with wakanda they are the only two people who had been truly free from the chains of colonialism in a very believable way,2022-11-11 05:12:00
the midnight angel and ironheart suits looked like actual  jesus christ,2022-11-11 03:06:12
gotta say after shehulks ending it made the formulaic marvel third act seem even more noticeable here especially with such a bizarrely unimpressive set piece,2022-11-11 03:14:30
the final battle was basically this,2022-11-11 04:53:31
enjoyed it very much but that final battle was really lackluster,2022-11-11 07:37:03

3 i really wanted the queen to become the next black panther just because angela bassett is amazing and ripped and i would have loved the salty tears of people complaining that an older woman couldnt keep up with superheroes despite bps powers coming from a plant",2022-11-12 01:19:29

im confused why did namora attack them on the bridge in boston namor told wakanda to get riri back to them so as far as he was aware thats what they were doing why expose your secret underwater society to where theres a ton of possible witnesses around to grab her if the plan was to  her anyway why even involve wakanda 


also was it just me or was the third act fight a bit messy shuri full on gets stabbed and kind of just walks it off like i know that flower is supposed to make you strong but didnt killmonger die in a similar way 


also was it implied namor was of partial spanish descent judging by the  hair and accent i remember reading some leak a while back that seemed to line up a lot with this plot",2022-11-11 08:02:44
"this movie was at its best when dealing with the grieving of t’challa’s death and how the country and those closest to him move forward i feel like the talokan conflict would’ve worked better with t’challa as initially planned with he and namor confronting each other as equals instead you have shuri who isn’t fully cooked and hasn’t yet come to terms with her brother’s death that said letitia wright is great angela bassett is phenomenal

riri and ross and contessa by extension feel really tacked on to the movie like just to remind you to watch ironheart and thunderbolts

also we know from aou i believe that wakanda is somewhere in east africa and talokan is in the atlantic how the heck did they get all the way to wakanda the nile",2022-11-12 04:21:55
did anyone else feel like shuris moral arc and righteousforgiving end was undeserved when she loses her mother and gains the black panther mantle all she does is lie to everyone who tries to support her and offer advice the flashback to her mother in the ancestral plane appears in effort to justify her shoulder angel or conscience but because she actually saw killmonger in the vision when ingesting the purple juice this feels so cheated a thought thats been bugging me and wanted to know if anyone sympathises or would disagree,2022-11-16 16:22:51

i also really disliked riri she wasnt funny or interesting after the the scene in her room and completely took me out of it the scene at the end with car just felt like product placement

also dont understand how shuri was still alive after being impaled and then suddenly on a ship as if nothing happened

loved some of the cinematography especially when namor descends onto his throne as well as some of the music i thought it was funny to include a spanish song during the talocan scene considering his history",2022-11-13 01:11:12

the imagery from the funeral the underwater world stuff like that was awesome then you had guys slapping water when a button wouldve worked differential equationzzzzzzz and the  suit they put okoye in that was so dumb looking they literally made it a plot point of the movie",2022-11-17 03:41:57
just walked out and wow the opening funeral before the quiet marvel banner with scenes of chadwick my theater was absolutely silent perfectly done,2022-11-11 03:56:07
"so have you got a new sequel idea for me

yes sir i do its about a group of indigenous tribespeople with blue skin that weve never seen before because they all live in the ocean and theyre angry because some other people are trying to take their natural resource which is a special kind of metal unlike anything on earth so theyre going to fight each other and there will be a lot of really cool water effects

oh yeah the new avatar sequel is going to be tight

avatar what no im talking about the new black panther sequel

really because it sounds a lot like an avatar sequel

well its not

you know because of the indigenous tribes with blue skin special metal water scenes and everything

sir im gonna need you to get all the way off my back about those plot similarities

oh let me get off of that thing then

very good sir and i was thinking we could call it wakanda forever

thats the line from the movie

indeed it is sir indeed it is

edit pretty much nailed the avatar comparison ",2022-11-13 21:38:47
"the movie was fun and i really enjoyed the visual design of everything namor was shockingly powerful and his nation earned their threat

that said i thought the third act fight was a mess too many cgi characters that didn’t feel solid all on an overly simple set that seemed like poor planning from a story perspective it seems like a shame considering how good the action scenes were in the first two acts 

oh and every time m’baku spoke was the best",2022-11-11 03:24:02
the cia  never even mattered at all i was hoping at the very least while the mexicans and wakandans were busy fighting each other wed find out that elaine stole a bunch of vibranium,2022-11-12 23:35:52
nah youre the queen now was cold,2022-11-14 12:24:41
i wish nakia became black panther,2022-11-14 16:13:39
"this movie would be more enjoyable if they cut the cia  and just ask the queen or nakia to be black panther  

also funny how the film talks about honoring tchalla and doing a 180 on everything he learned and strive to be at the first movie",2022-11-15 07:41:04
i like how they were cool with killing the american scientist until they saw it was a black chick lol,2022-11-17 02:44:33
"i am happy that other people liked it but i did not like this i would give it a 4510

what i liked

 queen romonda scenes are pretty good she is honestly the only character i genuinely liked for the whole movie  though i guess i liked nakia a lot too 
 killmonger cameo interesting character so it was good to see him used again but in a way he just highlighted how lacking other characters are 
 namor has some cool aspects most notably seeing how strong he is    
 i like mesoamerican history so that stuff was cool to me 

did not like  

 suri is the true weak link of the movie for me at best she is extremely boring at worst she is annoying towards the end and letitia write just does a bad job acting in most of the important scenes    
 the end of the movie with suri becoming black panther and the final battle just feels really rushed 
 outside of the initial funeral shots in the beginning none of the serious scenes about tchalla passing connected with me at all or made me feel anything    
 it is too long there are huge chunks that are just boring there is no other way to say it    
 i didnt find any of the action scenes to be that exceptional or memorable   
 namor is pretty cool but what he is trying to do is so ridiculous it ruins the character for most of the movie    
 the central conflict what to do with riri could easily have been handled in a very easy way that no character seems to even consider i will admit this is a nitpick    
 none of the scenes with everett ross and fontaine add anything to the movie their scenes slow everything down  and honestly the movie would have benefited from all their scenes being cut 
 a lot of it is just too dark visually  though this might just be a problem with my theater cause it sucks  
 ironheart looks like a cheap cartoon in action scenes
 if getting to riri was the so important why only send one person and the princess again this is a minor nitpick 

questions

 when ironheart is making her suit in wakanda they make sure to show her welding and hammering out the heart do you see that heart shape cutout on the final suit i feel like i didnt notice it
 why couldn’t they just explain the situation to riri and tell her to  destroy her research on her machine and not to make another one why did they act like killing her or making her live in wakanda were the only options",2022-11-12 19:39:38
angela bassett acted her  off in here there have been some stellar actorsperformances in the mcu but ive never felt someone more deserving of an oscar nod than i have after seeing her in this movie the emotion that she bring and the command she has over every scene shes is was so captivating the scene where she fires okoye holy  she was hands down the best part of this movie for me,2022-11-11 03:37:37
"man what a disappointment the film has some good moments but its drawn out with way too much filler and a lot of the connective tissue isnt all that engaging with some shaky internal logic

the good

 the chadwick tribute is emotional and understated
 strong performances all around from the cast
 interesting themes of loss and grief
 the michael b jordan cameo

the bad

 films internal logic is all over the place a lot of character decisions only happen because theyre necessary to move the plot forward
 way too bloated with filler content the everett ross subplot is dull and pointless
 both riri and lupita nyongo dont really have anything to do riri is essentially a mcguffin that namor then immediately disregards when decides to go all invasiony
 despite a soldi performance from tenoch huerta namor and the talokan still feel a bit underdeveloped and his 180 from wanting to be secret to going to war with the surface feels a bit out of left field
 action scenes are generally underwhelming

the weird

 shuri tells her mom that ais going rogue and attempting to  us all is just in the movies despite living in a reality where there was a very public case of that exact same thing happening ultron",2022-11-11 08:30:50
the critics i follow made it seem like id be sobbing the whole movie and that really was not the case,2022-11-11 04:50:11
they could have cut out the cia subplot and iron heart they didnt add anything important to the movie and would have cut down the runtime,2022-11-11 20:43:35
"does anyone know when production was 2021 

i had watched the first bp the day before and this one just felt like it was made in a pandemic clear sets clear green screen or the led wall clear cgi third act but then even the cinematography felt different  it felt mostly handheld with singular shots not as much diversity as the first film which surprised me since it’s coogler returning 

did anyone else pick up on it i need to watch it again i had to get up a few times in the beginning so maybe that affected my watch",2022-11-11 16:05:34
"pretty dissapointed with this movie as someone who loves the first one 

it wasnt super interesting and was far too long for its own good",2022-11-13 01:01:27
im really glad they kept it as serious as they did too much comedy would have undercut the movie,2022-11-11 07:04:44
"can anyone clarify this plot point for me or is it truly just a gaping plot hole like i think it is

how tf did this conflict initially start namor told ramonda and shuri to capture the scientist bring her to wakanda and blow the conch shell to turn her over

shuri and okoye captured the scientist and were in the process of bringing her to wakanda when namor’s people attacked them with explosives at this point he had no reason to believe they were going to defy him so his people basically almost killed the princess of the nation he supposedly wants to ally with for no reason 

further he essentially kidnaps the princess and holds her captive and then… what declares war because wakanda had the audacity to take their kidnapped princess back because two servants were killed in the process

this dude is supposed to be 600 years old and still he’s behaving like an impulsive mortal hothead like killmonger but dumber i would’ve expected something a little more than “yeah we attackedstole their princess and they took her back” to trigger war between two world superpowers",2022-11-11 20:58:05
when shuri finally put on the suit i thought she looked like a kid wearing a black panther costume then i thought about it and was likewhat did i expect,2022-11-11 11:50:28
was it ever explained how when okoye stabbed those talocans on the bridge they seemingly rose from the dead when nakia shot that one with a sonic round she died as if she was completely mortal,2022-11-11 21:03:57
my favourite part was when he completely forgets to mention that half of his hidden sea village vanished for 5 years and the people hes trying to fight with were directly responsible for bringing them all back,2022-11-16 07:51:17
the part where namor is floating down to his  megalodon jaw throne while wearing that headdress is so badass,2022-11-20 00:52:06
" be me be wakandan general

 have the queen princess and random american return to wakanda

 they have escaped from namor

 queen informs me that he threatened to attack wakanda if she saved shuri

 informed that all conventional weapons failed to  them

 informed that the only weapon which was effective was  sonic weapon which one shoted two enemies to death their medicine can not heal them of these wounds

 informed that bare their leader they are stuck breathing underwater

 do not prep the military for imminent invasion

 do not order mass production of these sonic weapons

 do not order our air fleet to stay in the air to provide air support

 do not create barriers to stop a tsunami

 do not evacuate the capital city which is besides the ocean

 do not do anything with our chief military base which is right besides the ocean

 do not even order our military to be at a high level of readiness

 we are invaded and the queen is dead

 what have i done

 decide to step up and prepare our troops properly this time

 retreat to mountains as per our leaders request a wise move

 in deep underground fortifications a wise move

 planning to release our air fleet with sonic weapons to defend our selves

 mfw the princess returns as a black panther

 mfw eveeryone acts as if this single soldier is sufficient to turn the tide of battle

 mfw they abandon my plans and turn to her soneone with no military experience

 her plan is to drop and disempower namoe 

 her plan assumes that his forces will stop if he js dead

 her plan assumes that namor will personally come with his forces for this battle

 her plan assumes that a quick theory she came up with five minutes ago is completely correct

 try to protest is ignored

 take only one boat with us out into the middle of the ocean remind everyone that namor has just said he was going to invade in a weeks time that we are already well fortified and can take that week to prepare our defences further

 my idea is shot down instead we come to them 

 the entire military is shoved into one boat there is no room to manuevre or dodge the enemies attacks we are complete sitting ducks

 there isnt even two boats

 battle begins amazingly we somehow draw despite 90 of our military bejng slaughtered

 quit the next day",2022-11-20 12:43:16
im sorry but shuri was totally devoid of charisma couldnt help but root for namor and the talokan the whole movie namor was just too cool,2022-11-11 03:03:10

"everybody has a suit now i appreciate the more uniquely powered characters like namor hawkeye scarlet witch to everyone having a robo suit that occasionally pops the face up 

 even a large chunk of spiderman we’ve seen so far is in a robotic suit just very samey to me 

enjoyed it as much as thor 4 another where the villain character is the most interesting and less than dr strange 2 

i did like the small hints that m’baku is manape in the comics the chest pounding the hooting the different tribes in wakanda being distinguishable is great design and i like histheirs the best",2022-11-11 06:52:38

"i find it crazy that not one person decided to hide or keep some seeds for the heart shaped herb after killmonger said to burn it 

youd think someone would have said nah this dude is crazy wakanda will need a protector in the future",2022-11-16 16:42:30
"given the situation i think coolger did an amazing job 

the main story was good and basset was probably my favorite from wakanda i was sad to see her go

i didn’t love shuri but i didn’t hate her either she did a good enough job 

but man you could feeel tchalla and the black panther missing from this movie i couldn’t stop thinking how amazing the story would’ve been if he was here with the parallels namors story and the fight between them honestly could’ve seen this being a top 5 marvel movie 

namor was so  cool might be a bit biased as a mexican but i couldn’t get enough of him and his story wish we saw the headdress more and a bit more of his world but i hope to see him again soon because everything about him was so sick

the ironheart plot was the most forced part of the movie it felt so out of place sometimes i didn’t care for riri at all and the suit was terrrrrible

rip boseman",2022-11-11 05:50:46
i think this film struggles to find its identity between being a sequel and almost like an origin story,2022-11-11 15:40:22
who built all the buildings in wakanda the population seems to be a few scientists a bunch of tribes leaders and everyone else living a chill life trading basic goods they made themselves,2022-11-17 18:45:20
lupita nyongo is really pretty,2022-11-19 05:50:27
movie was way too long,2022-11-19 13:12:22
that was a weirdly bad movie,2022-11-23 01:57:04
"i honestly feel they missed the mark i understand the difficulties in moving forward with the loss of chadwick they would of had to completely rework the script


they had all the right puzzle pieces but just failed to put them together into the picture it could have been


i would have approached it very differently and cut out the cia fodder",2022-11-11 11:23:03
the cplot was so remotely related to the rest of the movie and couldve been cut without affecting anything only thing it did was setup the thunderbolts and explain how selina meyer related to the rest of the mcu her scenes were clearly shot in one day and she does not look like she wants to be there at all,2022-11-15 14:52:02
am i allowed to say i was disappointed by the film,2022-11-20 09:03:17
wth this was really well shot for a marvel movie i mean there was little to no cuts during the dialogue scenes which i always appreciate especially the warehouse scene where where they are checking out ironhearts lab and them escaping the fbi i was impressed with that sequence,2022-11-11 11:00:33
i just need to know why they took the coffin into the hovercraft as part of the funeral hard to wrap my head around the purpose of it,2022-11-14 23:38:33
"there was a lot of plot armour i feel like the talokans could have easily destroyed the wakandans namor pretty much destroyed half of the city also are we going to pretend that yuri wasnt mortally wounded at the end as such i didnt like how namor conceded that the black panther was the strongest person on earth he clearly is

overall it was entertaining i just feel like were back to where we ended with the last film where we are just waiting for killmonger now namors fears of the outside world to finally be properly addressed by the main characters all this stuff about nobility is too idealistic and there needs to be consequences for the characters",2022-11-18 06:15:41
movie was a narrative mess plot was messy and all over the place there was no real character growth and shuri is not a strong enough actor to carry the franchise,2022-11-20 21:48:20
would have been cool if the avengers were there for king tchalla funeral i wonder how avengers are gonna address his death,2022-11-12 02:30:54
"im sorry but i was fully ready to come in and cry my eyes out and though some tears were shed i just found the movie kind of boring  i think it was a gigantic mistake to introduce something as fanciful as those seapeople and namor in the same movie where were trying to reallife process bosemantchallas unexpected deaths  i felt like i wasnt allowed to have any fun  the guy died and it was tragic but i dunno maybe after an hour we should get to have some fun right  especially in a movie with blue people and a dude with wings on his heels

even endgame started out depressing but after the first 40 or so minutes it got fun and gave us some relief  here the relief never came and there’s a dude with wings on his feet flying around while his blue people threw water bombs  the movie should have shifted tones or there should have been a more realistic villain  

not to mention the pacing was choppy as   scenes just began and ended with no real flow between them linking them  the last scene was really beautiful but it was the same tone as the rest of the movie  i wish it could have been more cathartic with more energy  maybe even have her laughing and smiling so we can see that shell be okay  something to make us feel like it was the end of a journey  

the music selection was strong though as they usually are with coogler movies  

shuri is a great character but i still felt like she needed more character development to round her out as a person  i wish she was with her mom more during the beginning learning from her and giving us insight into what she’s thinking  as it is i have no idea who she is what her motivations are her long term goals  i liked her in the first movie because she was a genius and seemed super playful which was enough for a side character but we barely got any of that here  i get that she’s grieving her brother but is her entire character just based off her relationship with this one person  the movie dropped the ball establishing her as an individual
 
i also could have used more character development on the new irongirl  she seemed really cool but like what in her life made her feel the need to make a suit like that  i can assume sure but tell us  i want to get to know these people  makes it easier to cheer them on later  overall it was supposed to be their movie but i felt like i barely knew any of them by the end  

bassett nyongo a goddess on earth and gurira were great and they had some good scenes  not many complaints there though i wish shuri were with them more for her muchneeded character development 

the bosemantchalla tribute in the beginning was beautiful  honestly his death was handled very respectfully i thought

i just wish i liked this more  it feels like the ingredients were there but it was too long and way too dour  i came ready to have a huge emotional experience but after a few tears in the beginning i was like okay lets get this going and then it never quite took off  it just stayed the same sad tone throughout which gets boring after awhile  i don’t mind long movies and i don’t mind melancholy movies but when you do both it adds up and feels like double the running time  this is all my opinion of course",2022-11-11 03:14:06
don’t really have to much to say as it is hard to ignore him just being gone the tribute to him in the beginning was great all in all i brought myself to see this just for namor who was indeed a badass and that’s all i really got to see say shame if the rumors are true that they scrubbed the  dr doom appearance,2022-11-11 03:09:37
"after watching it a grand total of one time so far i honestly felt mostly underwhelmed i mean its not all bad and it handled most things well but man it felt aggressively average at best anyway i made a few points and ill try to be kind of constructive

the good

 they handled chadwicks passing very tastefully and it never felt too in your face

 the performances were great for the most part especially angela bassett

 namor turned out great and well be seeing him quite a bit going forward

the bad

 marvel are clearly gearing up for thunderboltsironheartwhateverthehell and it was so obvious it was distracting

 the cia storyline was completely unneeded and could have been replaced with more talocannamor development or something

 riri williams probably didnt need to be in it that much she really should been semideveloped before this 

 the cgi still looks  in some scenes which blows my mind its 2022 ffs 

 the entire 3rd act felt like a generic marvel thing that they do now",2022-11-11 13:22:32
"liked the movie but as someone mentioned i was puzzled when shuri got speared by namor

looked up black panther and one of the abilities doesnt include invulnerability  or deadpoolwolverine type healing",2022-11-13 01:28:32
that was awful,2022-11-21 06:18:23
"there are vestiges of a good film in here and i understand it was a difficult situation for everyone involved but what a disappointment

the pacing and tone were all over the place though not in the usual marvel bathos style and it felt like multiple movies stitched together at times i was honestly shocked that the runtime was only 241  it felt longer than zack snyders justice league

i saw this in imax 3d and unfortunately i cant recommend it  various reviews have noted that the film is poorly lit and 3d glasses make this even worse

the prologue and epilogue were touching tributes to boseman at least",2022-11-11 03:08:50
they failed to serve us more wakanda in this film i wanted to feel more immersed in the culture and see more of the city the challenge waterfall set gave us that in the first film and we returned there a bit but they should have given us different wakandan sets and culture we should come away feeling like we know wakanda well now after the second film and i don’t think we know it anymore than we already did there’s a whole city give us a wakandan sports  scene something light and fun the whole film relied on grief and emotion that was caused by flip flopping motives and ideas on namors part,2022-11-15 01:09:02
a truly awful movie,2023-02-02 03:55:27
so in the scene when namor is telling shuri he wants to go to war with the world why didn’t she just tell him “oh uh multiple aliens and dimensional beings have tried that you don’t want to go there” maybe just show him the avengers movies,2023-02-03 04:18:36
haaaated the shoehorned inclusion of riri williams no character development and she added nothing in my opinion,2022-11-11 15:48:16
people might complaint about the runtime but i appreciated that we spent the movie with all these characters instead of having them underdeveloped like the previous phase 4 installments,2022-11-11 03:13:52
"what exactly was namor’s battle plan for fighting a land war on terrain actively hostile to his people

like his people didn’t have guns or even tanks i guess they did have some sort of water transport used at the bridge but never used it after lol they rode of the backs of whales he and his jordan 90s were their entire air force and when we got to notatlantis i expected to see all sorts of cool tech but nope literally children playing with the underwater version of a hoop and stick

i have sincere doubts about their supposed military prowess and strategy",2022-11-13 00:37:17
"having shuri feel alone and finding killmonger as her source of guidance for how to live in the world without her family instead of just having her see her parents was such a fun direction it really left me disasappointed though by the end of the movie it felt like marvel was teasing that they know how to take their characters in interesting directions and have them struggle with conflict requiring growth to become a true hero but in the end we inevitably get the main character instantly doing whats right after being in a mindset of doing what feels right

i know there are a number of reasons why marvel wouldnt want to go this route but imagine if they had shuri  namor and the next movie featured shuri still doing good deeds as black panther but also with growing animosity towards the un and having her attempt to consolidate her power after mbaku and the jabari people return to being more isolationist and separated from the rest of wakanda movie could display her as a conflicted hero who then goes on a journey to realize that shes doing some good deeds but ultimately is not being the hero the black panther should be nor fulfilling her brothers wish of wakanda playing a more benevolent role in global affairs

never thought they would dare end the movie with shuri not being a perfect hero due to the previously unnamed reasons bad pr for the black panther to not be anything but a hero leaving the movie possible production issues with how black panther would have to tie into the rest of the mcu and how stand alone movies would play into that etc but still disappointed because for a short window of time marvel showed a window where they coulda come out and said in black adam they use the term antihero a lot without ever really establishing much of one this is how ya do it and micdropped on dcs latest mediocre effort",2022-11-11 03:13:09
"really run of the mill marvel film quite boring the wakandans are wholly unlikable

my theater was packed with people clapping screaming whenever the dora milaje moved 2 inches whatever its a marvel film so wasnt bothered

it was boring though letitia has none of the charisma chadwick brought to the table everything is so formulaic  martin freeman is running through the woods lemme guess some wakandans are going to materialize wow they did audience hollers repeat with him in a van at the end of the film

character reveals are barely barely earned am i supposed to jaw drop when ironheart shows up i dont know this character i dont care suit design is  midnight angel  ok lets just say the name and throw them into the next scene

college kids just make iron man suits like its nothing now did i miss something
theyve been dialing up the young adult fiction tropes in recent releases

no consequences  wakandans didnt  the navy seal cia vibranium miners they would never  10 minutes later  like 10 cops in boston trying to stop them from kidnapping a college student

the final fight scene between panther and namor was akin to the scene in taken where theres 30 jump cuts to have him jump over the fence audience was audibly puzzled

effortlessly unimpales self
namor limply towards water
front flip 
jump cut
wakanda forever
jump cut
rocket motor
jump cut
flames engulf screen
jump cut

okoye in civilian clothing hurt me to my core,2022-11-11 23:07:11
"i thought it was good but not great the mourning over tchallas death is handled very well and forms the emotional core of the movie

lots of other stuff doesnt work nearly as well

i was very underwhelmed by the scene where we finally see talokan  it seemed like there were barely any people there and i didnt see as much of the imaginative potential in such a society as i would have liked if wakanda is afrofuturism in an uncolonized african citystate then i would have liked talocan to offer something similar for indigenous central americans but it seems so beholden to a mayan aesthetic that it wasnt able to really create the sense of a living thriving society with its own relationship to tradition and modernity like wakanda

we barely learned anything about talocans culture or its people

namor also doesnt work as well as killmonger killmonger is reacting to the injustices of contemporary america namor apparently saw the horrors of colonial spanish america and destroyed one hacienda and called it a day until 400 years later when he decides that the surface finally poses a threat and needs to be conquered

unfortunately the nature of the hidden country aspect of the story necessitates namor putting his revenge on hold until his sudden reappearance  never forget spanish colonialism but he let it play out more or less how it played out in our world presumably wwii came and went but it was america almost discovering them that sets the events of the story into action

eternals had a similar issue with the mindcontrolling hero he apparently decided to give up after one peacefully integrated village and give people their free will everywhere else for reasons

im a little unclear on why namor gives the wakandans a week to regroup theyre the main obstacle between him and control of the surface and his initial small strike force seemed to have been devastatingly effective if he had just kept going he could have won and wiped out the only serious threat to his taking power except perhaps the avengers",2022-11-15 09:44:59
okay these enemies crushed us on our own home turf and are dominant in water lets fight them on a big boat thatll work for sure,2022-11-19 09:07:09
this movie was a mess namor and his tribe was the highlight marvel needs to step back and figure their  out the cgi costumes   they’re just so  man,2022-11-30 07:05:18
" this movie could have been such a masterpiece but its terrible the concept of the film is great the sister of the black panther struggles with grief and the loss of her brotherfailure to save him meanwhile she is the one who can make two countries go to war or have an allience and this all with wakanda and talokan as a backdrop 2 countries with amazing rich cultures and peoples great pitch 


lets write a  script as the cherry on top


this is what i call a 3 hour recap movie its just things happening on a screen no weight to the choices made by the characters development is meaningless because the stakes havent been properly established and at no point does the movie actually try to pull you into a story arc its just bullet points on a list just going through the motions 
wakanda seems like such an amazing place and they dont explore it at all its all about the vibranium 
these things dont make a film bad they dont make a film good but it makes this film terrible because it could have been something great 

also what did martin short even do no hate on him but why was he even in the movie



pros mbaku every scene with him in it is an exception to the things ive said above because his character is just awesome and hes played very well love the little scene where he tests the new black panther

the scene where namor actually pleads for cooperation is a good moment i was kinda thinking it was gonna be an alliance by marriage at some point but that didnt go through dont know if that would be better or worse than what happened in the movie tho",2022-12-04 01:05:46

i feel like they didn’t go in even more into namor peoples livesculture because it would just remind us of the new avatar coming,2022-11-11 05:18:17
felt absolutely no hype when shuri wore the suit its supposed to be a great moment where the black panther returns but its just fell flat same with iron heart,2022-11-11 13:29:30
i didn’t necessarily understand the main plot the taloken were shown to be invincible in the beginning of the movie so what exactly were they concerned about regarding people finding vibranium and why did they initially need wakanda’s help some cool shots and concepts but i just kept thinking avatar is going to look much better underwater,2022-11-11 03:17:12
"why was the majority of the film captured in  medium shots and completely out of focus backgrounds it really screamed mid tier camera work despite the nice production design 

and did they really give a teenager a super suit to shoot at the water people now she can go back to class as a stone cold killer ",2022-11-15 04:12:54
during the buildup to the final fight the scientist girl was banging and cutting bits of metal what was that for was it a draw the rest of the  owl deal and it turned into her new suit,2022-11-14 08:58:56
am i the only one who thinks ironhearts helmet looks like walle’s girlfriend,2022-11-15 22:25:14
they call that battle of the 2 strongest nation in mcu lol ok it reminds of civil war aka airport parking lot  skirmish,2022-11-18 04:12:49
"well that was terrible the cgi was really bad especially at that final fight scene okoye and riri looked like floating heads and the suits looked terrible no idea why they would give okoye that suit when her old battlewear and weapon were so much better movie was way too long the cia subplot was kinda dumb i thought this would be a more emotional film about bp given the trailers but it just quickly devolved into standard marvel  after that intro

really disappointing film marvel really got me again with the trailers",2022-11-22 16:28:52
movie was a solid 810 for me but did anyone else find ririironheart annoying i almost cringed every time she went on screen,2022-12-04 07:58:30
holy  this movie was a slog to get through i remember being about 90 minutes in and expecting the final fight to happen any minute only to see there was another hour of runtime left,2023-02-02 01:40:45
opening night and the theatre was loud and reactinglaughing throughout the movie but dead silent when shuri took the mantle of black panther in the suit  i almost cringed of the silence,2022-11-11 15:04:54
 was too ducking long started off strong and i just lost interest as it went on so many unnecessary scenes,2022-11-11 07:52:48
did riri  like 10 cops on that bridge,2022-11-11 21:10:19
what was the point of martin freeman and julia louisdreyfus’s characters in this movie  i feel like this movie could have been almost better without them,2022-11-12 05:18:30
"the whole thing was just pretty poorly shot

not that mcu films are usually masterpieces of cinematography or anything but it was really distracting here

like half the film was so poorly lit you could barely see the actors faces and virtually every dialogue sequence was entirely shotreverseshot    seemed really lazy

the fact that so much of the movie was reused costuming and setpeices didnt help distract from it either",2022-11-14 08:10:03
well its a marvel movie the most marvel of all marvel movies with extra marvel,2022-11-16 11:05:56
did anyone else think this movie was not at all as emotional or contemplative as it waa built up to be it kinda just carried on as normal albiet solid mcu flick i felt,2022-11-19 00:12:58

i was hoping to enjoy this movie a lot the trailer floored me and i was ready to have my emotions played with such a shame then that after an hour of watching the movie i got to hear possibly 5 total lines of dialogue spoken over the nonstop audience how should we say this contributions every like of dialogue was met with a hivemind yelling and full volume talking easily the most miserable experience in a theater ive ever had and i had to leave half way through because i couldnt  hear the movie over the talking if youre someone who enjoys talking during a moviein a public theater please dont reproduce guess ill try again another day,2022-11-11 06:03:54
sorry if this has already been posted but this movie is literally about letitia wright genociding a race of mask wearing people a true  lol,2022-11-12 05:14:54
"some thoughts
are the talokaians immortal because theyre killed by gunfire in the first scene they are in then okoye says they come back from what should be mortal wounds then she kills attuma by kicking him off a boat im very confused by that and also if that really killed him it was a super disappointing last fight for him 30 seconds then boom death by kick
why would namor not  the wakandans when he has them all cornered or at least take riri when shes right there and clearly noone can stop them
couldnt namor just flood the  world easily while those people siren songed everyone to death
why wasnt nakia the black panther or okoye or mbaku all three would have been better than shuri
how did a career scientist take on a centuries old warrior in a fist fight and win i know shes super powered but what the  if it was anybody else it would make sense
the action was lacking with the exception of the first attuma vs okoye fight but the music and performances were very good cg was spotty but thats because of the overload of projects on the animators shoulders
it was fine but it could have been much better about 15 minutes too long 6510",2022-11-11 03:21:05
the 19 year old casually murdered several police officers on the bridge lol,2022-11-13 03:23:44
i’m sorry but this movie just did not work for me i think because it has amazing acting pretty good cinematography and so many pieces for a what should’ve been a simple story about a girl taking her brothers role as black panther but there was so much  going on unnecessary scenes and weird moments… it just felt very sloppy i’m guessing a lot of it was messy because of script changes but they should’ve just made it simpler i didn’t feel like the torch passing was emotionally satisfying… it felt so awkward i think that would’ve been fixed with a tighter story about shuri her grieving over her brother and her mom acting as her mentor… but the movie doesn’t take the time to follow through with that set up and i think it suffers for on a story level,2022-11-13 06:58:32
the final act was rushed which is too bad because the movie until that point was pretty ok cgi was also janky especially with the weird blue suits okoye et al were wearing the cgi of shuri’s suit at the beach fight was also janky the score on the other hand was amazing especially whenever the atlantianssorry not familiar with the lore enter a scene the initial attack on the ship at the beginning was my favorite scene,2022-11-11 04:49:21
"oh man i dont know why but i completely blanked on the fact that parts of the movie would be in wakandan tongue and since im in spain the subtitles were just in spanish

then they started speaking the other languages including spanish which of course had no subtitles at all and i barely understood half the stuff people were saying though i got the gist of most of them i feel

can not wait for this to be released digitally so i can give it another watch

but for anyone saying those flying suits were hella  100 agreed holy  they said it was  and they still kept it even this version of the ironheart suit was  as sin",2022-11-11 21:14:52
mfw nakia isnt the next black panther,2022-11-11 23:04:56
was it just my movie theater or were there a lot of scenes that were just too dark the underwater scene i couldnt really appreciate because it was hard to see the world also multiple fight scenes like the massachusetts race scene just felt too dark made me wonder if it was the theater i was in or if it was the movie,2022-11-14 19:36:27
"apart from the chadwick tribute it just didnt work for me two nations went to war over a science project they could easily change it to a plot where namor is losing his vibranium resources and wants wakandas he threatens a war or offers an alliance he also wants to attack the surface world and sees an ally in shuri solozzo seeing sonny as an opening

then you have shuri find riri but get abducted while riri and okoye go to wakanda riri bonds with ramona shuri initally sees eye to eye with namor but then learns of his plan to  the queen and sees him for what he is plus learns that he needs water to survive we also see his army isnt war ready yet animals and people are unwell she escapes when nakia okoye and mbaku come to save her

they take that time to make the synthetic herb using the gift from namor and planning their defence strategyshuri takes that herb but the powers dont kick in and the attack stars eventually they kick in and she fights using the same necklace suit she gave to chadwick

ramona lives on as queen and you end with shuri deciding to head to haiti alternatively you can have riri try to save ramonda but fail and stick with the current end but still have it in the end and be it the reason she goes ahead with the fireplace ritual its a tighter film with less suit upgrades and no sudden revenge plot or bad war strategy ship attack",2022-11-19 22:33:52
so riri straightup murdered a bunch of cops on that bridge right,2022-11-21 02:51:33
"anyone else just find shuri unlikeable i seriously found myself liking every character more than hers i just found her a poor choice to lead the film plus she was upstaged in every scene 

with that being said i thought the film tribute to chadwich was really well done",2022-11-28 18:04:51

really liked the killmonger scene and the throne room scene where the general is stripped of her rank the movie was also a bit more brutal than the normal marvel affair namor is also a good villain

i do think the fight scenes werent great and the pacing could have been improved",2022-11-11 07:29:15
thought it was a mess to be honest a lot of nice scenes and nice ideas but just didnt come together,2022-11-12 15:17:44
"my biggest issues is the context of the film the world governments are so concerned with getting vibraniumin a world with demons and magic nano machine stark tech a grander universe of planets and societies full of sentient life and tech years beyond earth ancient godly societies with their own forms of near unlimited energy even more ancient primal beings that stand above all multiple alien invasions where the result was a lot of loot to plunder and yet the one thing they are most concerned aboutis vibranium

like for christs sake the avengers discovered time travel entirety of the avengers heist and fight against thanos was made public knowledge and not a single soul has ever mentioned or talk about a literal  time machine

like they literally built a 6th time machine just to send cap back in time to return his items and stones if the tchallas death was contingent on shuri not being able to make a new heart shaped herb in time why tf didnt she just ask to borrow the time machine and go back and get an herb before they were burnedthis is especially doubled down because the tva no longer sticks to a sacred timeline




also  i know the usual gripe about the lack of cohesion in the mcu where the mc could call for help especially as the amount of alles in the mcu grows but for some reason they dont

like it was kind of weird for wakanda to intervene and help bucky and sam in their own showand yet not a single mention or peep from them in this movielike not a even a showing at the funeral or a condolences to shuri",2022-11-15 23:44:45
is it just me or did the quality of the dialogues went down in this one the first one had many dialogues that made an impression and connection with me in the first watch itself,2022-11-11 08:15:42
i sympathize with namor wakanda did all that to themselves by letting the world know which led to ppl encroaching on namor terf he approached them nicely and showed shuri around and she couldnt bother mentioning that they meant no harm to wakanda nice movie though,2022-11-12 04:20:03

"so just finished watching the movie left thinking it was great after a bit of time still think it was very good but there were some clear things holding it back

pros

 namor was great his actor did a fantastic job he was threatening in every scene he was in his outfits were cool his fight scenes were more of less awesome very excited to see more of him him zipping through the air into the water onto land and so on was so cool

 atlantis was cool the special effects for the underwater city were badass and their soldiers fighting on land were great also im a big fan of anything aztecy so i did love all their headdresses and clothes

 namor was the best villian in the mcu in awhile not just for his reasoning but because he followed through and was a threat he told the queen you attack my kingdom i  you then he did

 the tone was much different than other marvel movies it could be very somber at times the fight scenes would have no music it took itself seriously more or less still a few quips here and there that would take me out of the scenes

 killmonger showing back up was badass i didnt think he would but coming back as a spirit of vengeance was really cool i dont think he will ever show up in anything again but i would like if he did

 lacking the lawful good main protagonist of the first film forced all of the side characters to step up and created for some very interesting plotlines im not sure how i feel about shuri 100 but having her deal with her grief with anger and rage was interesting and something they should have played into more even but that part of her character only shows up for the last half hour

cons

 namors final defeat felt a bit cheap to me i really wanted the resolution to happen a different way i know it wouldnt because its a marvel movie but when they crashed right at the oceans edge i was thinking  okay your plan failed hes going to get in the water what will you do now how will this situation be resolved but no he didnt go for the water he just kept fighting

 the final fight didnt have enough spectacle and felt forced even so youre going after the strongest navel power in the world by fighting them on the water they legit said they were coming back to wakanda  why not just set a trap in wakanda why give up home field advantage it made no sense  you even had multiple scenes showing you escorting civilians away  why not just have the fight in wakanda where you can make full use of your armies and fight them not in the water

 in terms of spectacle these are the two most powerful armies on the planet in terms of tech and it was just a bunch of small hand to hand skirmishes and a bit of flying around to compare  in the aquaman movie when aquaman comes back to the war with the mermen and crab people  is going crazy things are exploding and its hype this felt very lowkey even like look at this  what the  is going on this is so hype we should have had something like this but happen in wakanda where we see this two global forces go at it


edit i also didnt like how shuri won that fight im fine with her winning but its just so marvel to have it be hanr to hand heres the thing  she shouldnt have won a straight up hand to hand combat fight thats not her thing thats her brothers thing namor has 500 years of combat experience and is one of the strongest people on the planet she should have won with a great plan and devistating technological attacks coordinated drone strikes missiles high tech weaponry chain guns vibranium based attacks tricks literally thrown everything at namor but have it be technological show that if they are fighting hand to hand he has the upper hand but she can win because shes smarter ruthless and cunning hes now an even greater threat because shuri has to pull everything out to stop him thats more of what i was hoping for going into that fight because she wasnt trained to be the worlds greatest warrior her brother was she probably has some training but shes a scientist she should have used that way more

 the movie is long as  and theres legit 2030 minutes that probably arent needed if this wasnt an mcu film ironheart  everything cia related is not needed at all for the film to function they are only there to jumpstart other mcu properties you could replace ironheart with any rando scientist then continue the movie and nothing else would change

 that wasted time could have gone to fleshing out namor spending more time on fight scenes anything

 the midnight angel suits were both  and its a  name lol

 not enough blood in the fight scenes when they are stabbing and killing each other

 m’baku should have been used more as an actual character rather than just comic relief half the time

 the fight choreography felt bad in the larger fight scenes just a lot of flailing and swinging while spinning to look cool while barely grazing each other 

 some of the ironheart stuff didnt make sense when they are running away she flies 30000 feet in the air with no mask why she should have died this is more personal but she does the classic movie writer doesnt know science and starts mumbling about eulers formula then blows up the drone which lands on cop cars and kills them shes 19 and just killed some police officers what 

in the end i still give the film a 7510 best marvel movie of phase 4 but held back by some bad pacing marvelisms lack of blood too many quips and unnecessary plot details get rid of those this goes up to a 9 this movie may also have worked better as a 2 parter frankly set up the wakanda  atlantis rivalry then execute on it but still a solid film dont think id ever watch it again though",2022-11-11 08:59:18
you could tell letitia wrights accident took a toll on her action scenes because we see very little of shuri as black panther in action,2022-11-11 09:45:11
"i really wanted to like this movie and in the beginning i did but as it steamed along i liked it less and less you could feel the absence of chadwick boseman  characters decisions made no sense there was no stakes or repercussions it felt like a lot of unnecessary things were shoved in this film like the cia subplot or riri

speaking of what stands out to me in this comment section is the complete lack of discussion around riri williams her character introduction felt like a dud her suit looked awful honestly some of the acting from dominique thorne was down right bad",2022-11-12 11:22:21
"movie was well made but i just found it difficult to care about anyone

shuri just isnt that interesting a character and lacks the charisma of a leading actor

okoye was fun as usual but felt underutilized i didnt hate the suit design like some but it didnt feel that cool

mbaku was also fun but felt kinda sidelined which makes sense as his character wasnt as vital this time around

i dont get why they brought martin freemans character back it makes sense to but then they gave him nothing to do

ruri was a plot device more than a character and it felt so weird to have her be important and set her up in a suit when there was no indication she was a fighter they also didnt give her enough time to develop she was here to be setup for her upcoming project

namor might be the biggest disappointment though his actor did a good job but the character just came across like a whiny  i get that he was supposed to be consumed by vengeance too but it was too separate from his actions in the film they also just end the conflict too easily for yet more setup in future films",2022-11-11 03:30:35

i would have liked to have seen more exploration of the underwater society  it seemed a bit odd comparing the wakandans to them during shuris little flashback of mutual understanding  the implication was theyre just like us but the wakandans are living a vibrant life with normal human activity and it cuts to the fish people and theyre just floating around doing nothing looking awkwardly at the camera  like is that what underwater life is  just bobbin about until a war happens and then you hop on a whale and head out,2022-11-12 23:37:52
can someone explain to me why they needed to go protect the scientiststudent when the vibranium detecting machine was already invented was that addressed in the movie as i understood it namor wanted to  her so she couldn’t make another but if it was already made once wouldn’t they just manufacture another using the same specs,2022-11-13 21:28:27

also why did martin freeman have so much screentime the guy had no real impact on the plot after the first bit but he kept showing up either commit to americacia being a serious faction in the movie or cut them entirely

namors crew attacking the vibranium miners was by far the best sequence great music great tension very good

as a whole it reminded me of the office season 8 chadwicks absence was felt and the other characters couldnt carry the movie i know people hate cameos but a few other heroes being part of the plot would have helped increase the screen presence",2022-12-03 21:37:39

cons
	fairly corny overall lots of eyeroll moments 
	riri ironheart was dreadful and a terrible addition to the movie
	the movie dragged and i felt myself looking at my watch a few times

overall just one of the mediocre marvel films it’s good that they did a sequel but i have no interest in shuri as the black panther or another black panther standalone film in general or ironheart because man her character was absolutely terrible",2022-12-03 23:40:44

was pretty disappointing and felt really long in stretches

"lupita is distractingly attractive and she’s built like a brick  my goodness i’d buy her more as the new bp over shuri but i thought letitia did a fine job honestly and i wasn’t a huge fan of her in the first 

namor was just  cool him zipping around with his wings and being agile as  was the best action in the movie i did think the action overall kinda  though and this movies fails once again to show us how technologically advanced wakanda is when it comes to fighting 

riri was okay but still don’t care about her show a character in iron man armor that doesn’t haven’t a tenth of tony starks charm doesn’t sound appealing the suit looked like  too…just too clean…it had like zero texture to it and just just looked terrible also putting the female warriors of wakanda forgot their names in suits of armor defeats what makes them cool to me

also what kind of logic is namor using here  wakanda better team up with me so we can then directly initiate an assault against the entire world  a world where superpowered chumps exist at every corner else i will wipe wakanda out what deep sea vent fumes is this man huffing down there creating conflict for the sake of plot how his people follow this suicidal madman i do not know

"i love black panther but found bp2 to be lacking

however my favorite part of the movie was the female cast okoye was perfect n’yongo was perfect bassett honestly deserves award recognition for her work

i loved namor and his backstory

however i felt that much of the story did not live up to its predecessor

agent ross was severely underutilized he purely felt functional which is not a good thing

talokan felt underutilized all we really got was a quick swim through the city if coogler wanted to create a parallel to wakanda then more was needed

the final battle on the wakandan ship felt like a green screen cwesque fight perhaps people may disagree but like most third acts in mcu films it was a mess

t’challa midcredits felt tacked on

i still enjoyed the movie more than the other mcu films this year but i cannot say it breaks my top 10 mcu films overall

however it does have one of the best performances in all the mcu bassett is gold has she not given everything",2022-11-20 16:22:58

"i took my boys 10  15 soho are huge marvel fans to see it last night  they thought it was confusing boring and made no sense 

we all walked out agreeing it was way too long the action was lame shuri is way too skinny so the black panther suit looked weird on her and overall the movie was boring  

the best part was the tribute to chadwick when the marvel logo played on silent and the tribute in the movie",2022-11-23 22:57:34
"someone once said the best thing about mcu is that they listen to reviews as an african one of the most annoying things about bp1 was the failure of representation the diversity of african tribes was morbidly showcased it basically looked like a black american movie with a sorta african name and a few references here and there most native africans said so an i thought no one would listen but they did

i loved the constant and very much improved use of the african languages i think pitting them against namor helped to preserve the cultural sense and let it shine i loved the visual representation of african elders it was real cool i was afraid it would be not so well received by the western audience but  they good a good enough job that everyone could relate kudos ryan

edit 
some people are saying they failing to understand how shuri got that good after getting her powers when she barely fought before to me it kinda sets the black panther powers into context i failed to understand what those powers did for killmonger and tichala since they were already seasoned fighter but seeing shuris transformation it really helped",2022-11-27 05:19:44

"really boring movie i hope they wont make a third black panther movie because that one was terrible

lots of girl power but kinda boring plot bad fight choreography

lots of plot holes

the robot suits were really awful looking the new black panther was boring didnt connect with them at all

the ironheart suit was like a terrible iron man copy",2022-12-03 04:28:50

"my biggest problem with marvel films is weve reached the point where technology is just alien and does this thing which saves the day

it had always been going that way but with infinity war and the nanomachines  it really went from plausible to just straight magic sure there was always magicdemigods but the humans countered that to keep it somewhat grounded


 iron man was a missile shooting protecting from bullets hefty machine even his energy pulses had mechanical charge up sounds his flight jet engine sounds iron man 2 the special portable giant briefcase was the pinnacle war machine kind of took that place when iron man suddenly became magic nanomachine man

now riri is just a power ranger floating about there is very little to ground the films and feel like no battles have any weight because of it im just waiting to see what magic gets pulled out of the hat",2022-12-21 12:28:20
wonder how water grenades pack enough punch to blast through vibranium reinforce windows that stopped a raw vibranium spear stabbed by someone they said came close to hulk strength also when wakanda had a few million years of using vibranium and technology how would a civilization using it for 500 years or so be able to completely neutralize their barriers and radars and ships and everything,2023-02-02 06:07:19
i know its a disney movie and that kind of necessitates that it ends on a feelgoody note but seriously i just wanted shuri to take retribution,2023-02-04 05:33:18

"were battling an army of fish men and weve established their leader gets his strength from water lets go fight them on the  ocean

i absolutely hated this movie not a single thing any character did made a lick of sense namor being worried about conflict when he lives below the bottom of the ocean is just dumb especially when he absolutely destroys in every single fight hes in and his people are seemingly immune to bullets knives mbaku and his wooden stick and impossible falls the talokans being just as adept on land as in the water felt like a contrived way of making them a threat which again didnt really make sense given their backstory i know the sanitary pads on their face helped them to breathe but having them be equally if not more acrobatic out of the water is just silly

"the mit girl subplot was just super contrived

 a 19yearold girl is the only one in the world who could possibly figure out this tech something that the entire world desperately wants
 the girl selling homework for tens of thousands of dollars which is an absolutely laughable amount btw i cant believe no one rewrote that didnt realize she struck gold with completely unique technology that again all the worlds governments badly want the feds never offered to buy it or that failing force her to divulge the secret
 the cia had completely novel tech and just threw it into the field without dissembling it or figuring out how to replicate it their plan was to take their one vibranium detector and drag it across the entire ocean until they found something

also apparently the vibranium detecting ship wasnt in contact with anyone about the fact that it found virbranium andor the cia cant work out that its virbanium detecting ship was proooobably attacked because it found vibranium",2022-11-11 23:12:46

expected better i really wanted to give letitia a chance but she’s just not a convincing black panther also we just gonna hand wave her being stabbed through with a spear and shrugging it off with no blood or wound whatsoever additionally i felt like the movie was primarily a way to mourn chadwick boseman’s passing but struggled to carry both the weight of that responsibility while also being entertaining narratively why not take this as an opportunity to elevate wakanda and it’s people it almost makes me wonder if they should have dealt with t’challa’s death in a d series or similar freeing this movie to be black panther 2 one thing they absolutely nailed was namor his backstory and casting was perfect,2022-11-11 17:25:27
"i thought it was very good however the after production was subpar for being marvel and just in general 

in the first half some of the outdoor and indoor scenes had messed up lighting like on the diver and boat scene it was so hard to see anyone it was too dark also about 34 through the movie some of the translations were cut off from the screen 

it might have just been my theater but also then audio for many characters speaking was messed up",2022-11-11 05:14:17
i don’t need another movie with letitia wright as the lead she was probably my least favorite part of the movie i feel like any of the other women in the film would’ve made a better black panther,2022-11-11 08:04:46
"it was kind of a mess the overall themes are fine but the character arcs are unjustified like shuris change of heart at the end made no sense especially after the vision from her mother who didnt seem particularly giving there could have been something there like the final plan was absolutely idiotic and nearly got everyone killed that could have lead to the realization that vengeance had blinded her and she needed to reevaluate but the idiocy of the plan never gets acknowledged at all

i liked the introduction to ironheart its just a shame that she only had 5 minutes of screen time also im pretty sure they didnt have a completed model for her first suit the home made one because it we never got to actually see it

the montage of making the second suit was comical torching a ragged hole in a thick plate of steel while surrounded by the most advanced tech on the planet

tolkien white guy had nothing to which was kind of weird it should have been either a 30 second cameo or else actually lead to something

i did like mbaku and namor was a charming  okoye was pretty great too but its weird that her storyline of being dismissed by the queen was basically never resolved",2022-11-11 16:35:41
"i can now say with 100 confidence that they should’ve just recasted chadwick boseman and called it a day

"ended up catching a show for it tonight  buit feels like i may be an outlier regarding the movie

the movie was a great sendoff and tribute to chadwick boseman

but overall i didnt like it

i think a very big part of that was that i wasnt a fan of shuris character and actress which i tried looking past and i was mostly just hoping nakia would have more of a spotlight 

namor was really cool though i lost all sympathy for him the moment he decided to go full warfare after losing one or two people after he himself has killed dozens reminded me too much of how so many americans only care or value american lives 

i could see where shuris character development was going to go from the get go but i was hoping for more once i realized she was indeed the only central character 

the other aspect that i felt was really lacking in the movie was the action so much of it felt lackluster and uninspired let alone the last fight which was a disappointing end but pretty much the entire films action sequences were bland to me it could just be that shang chi spoiled me in that regard and ive now been expecting that level of care and passion on mcu action though 

soundtrack was awesome though 

maybe ill like it more in rewatches but ill end this with perhaps my hottest take here 

i enjoyed aquaman considerably more than this movie

"this has to be one of the dumbest movies ive seen all year

 the french launch a secret attack to steal vibranium from the strongest nation on earth with literally just some guys with regular  guns 

 same thing with the boat the us finds the rarest strongest metal on earth in the ocean and they defend it with just some guys with guns not even a hero

 whats preventing the us from just making more vibraniumfinders unless they were  enough to make a oneoff 

 wakanda essentially proves the world right that they shouldnt be the sole holders of vibranium when in the span of one week their princess gets kidnapped and their queen assassinated by water people when they got interrupted in the process of trying to kidnap a us citizen with a team of 2 people

 wakanda straight up loses the war like their capital got destroyed their queen assassinated and their army was about to be exterminated before shuri shows up also why wouldnt they use the  fishpeoplekilling guns instead of spears

killmonger showing up was the best part of this movie but other than that the usual pow boom stuff was entertaining",2022-11-23 09:23:10
i had to stop drinking my water for that opening credits that and the end in silence  thank you marvel,2022-11-11 03:05:43
"this movie had a lot to overcome with bosemans loss and they did a great job paying homage to him as a character and person but i also think because of that the movie itself felt kind of off to me i dont know how to put my finger on it but it felt like there was just too much going on in this one and it felt rushed 

everyone in this did an amazing job acting i dont think there was a weak performance from any of the main characters and it was good to have lupita back 

 i liked that marvel did something different translating namor to the screen with the mesoamericanmayan background and tenoch was really good but imo the character was a little too meek at times to be namor i expected him to be a bit more imposing i guess but when it came time to fight he was appropriately ruthless i really liked attuma and namora as well and the siren calls awesome

 i think you couldve taken riri out of this and lost nothing the character didnt really bring much and the movie felt overstuffed as is 

 the cia stuff wasnt necessary either also did the wakandans straight up  the boston police 

 the costumes that okoye and the other dora milage in were a misstep danai is a great actor and it makes no sense to cover her face also why make them blue when theyre fighting blue people

overall i thought it was pretty good but not great",2022-11-11 19:17:40

"namor was right and had the best rationale of any villain thus far in the mcu

"pos i thought all the stuff with chadwick was handled beautifully angela bassett did an excellent job leticia wright did well considering she was unexpectedly  from supporting character to lead an emotional center of the movie namor was pretty good but a worse version of killmonger and im glad that the movie was more serious


neg the pacing was just off the stuff with elaine benes and bilbo just seemed so unnecessary i didnt like riri williams in the comics i dont think she was horrible here but i dont think she fit very well into this movie not to mention her suit as well as okywe sonic suit just didnt look good im not going to lie i laughed a little too hard at drying him out being the solution idk lol and maybe its just me i like lupita nyongo but she just feels so  forgettable in both movies",2022-11-14 07:04:45

whenever angela basset was on screen it was great when she wasnt it was okay the super science got pretty eye rolling after a bit and the costume designs became cartoonish the talokans were cool but i think their visual design needs something more their equipment was intriguing but the details got lost in the low light and action i wasnt sold on their underwater society there seemed to be few people and not much industry or commerce i was expecting a corollary to wakanda a highly functioning society was namor bluffing i wouldnt have expected to say this but aquaman did it better,2022-11-16 20:18:46

everything besides the water elements in the final fight scene wasnt worth watching in theaters and i found myself not even wanting wakanda to win,2022-11-25 10:11:48
im inclined towards the motive and objective of namor he got exposed because wakandas weak foreign policy if wakanda had a good foreign policy department this entire movie could have been avoided and issue would have been resolved via diplomacy,2022-11-25 18:00:30
"this marvel movie paints itself into a corner plot wise the cia is the enemy here and it’s clear you have two powerful oppressed nations fighting each other while the initial instigating event was the cia’s extraction of resources 

the logical outcome plotwise is for the talokan and wakanda people to come together to destroy the cia but this cannot happen because it’s a marvel movie and you can’t have the conclusion be that destroying the oppressors ciausa is the right way to go

so the film has to resolve this puzzle in a few ways 
1 the cia isn’t all bad it’s just a few bad apples in the form of  exwives with bad intentions imperialism is just a couple bad apples 
2 at the end it appears that there’s unity between talokan and wakanda which logically would lead to an anticiausa conclusion but no the final scene with the king of talokan is him plotting for wakanda to be vulnerable 

i don’t really understand though why paint yourself into this corner in the first place don’t bother with delving into latin american colonization and the concept of third worldism and solidarity if you’re structurally incapable of reaching the logical conclusion of your own premise it makes no sense 

but alas it’s a marvel movie i paid money to watch it so i lose and they win",2022-11-30 02:38:20

good

 acting was great
 vfx were well done especially namor
 music was nicely selected

bad

 riri was bleh her lines felt like they were written by a kid trying to act cool great another super smart person that comes out of nowhere
 the war between the talocan and wakanda was just  why does namor hate the surface world so much whats he gonna do when he has to fight on the surface against real heroes what will he do after he wins nothing makes sense
 the actual battles first in wakanda wakanda keeps saying theyre the most powerful nation on the planet but theyve never shown or proven that they got invaded by namor and could do nothing they had no army no weapons they still use sticks and spears lol we know talocan can be shot but its too bad wakanda doesnt have any guns their air ships were completely useless as they couldnt hit a single target except for namor could just shrug them off then leaving and saying well be back in a week lol who does that
 battle 2 on the boat also  why would you go to the ocean where the enemy is strong to fight on a boat they got completely overrun and should have died namor saying he now has wakanda as a powerful ally but wakanda is weak afwhy do the talocan even care at this point they could have wiped out their entire army right then
 the shuri vs namor fight was pretty disappointing also are we gonna gloss over the fact that she somehow knows how to fight instantly overnight as the black panther also when the future of wakanda is at stake why wouldnt they give more people the herb
 those blue suits were horrendous",2022-12-31 23:03:09
"i think we don’t talk enough abt how op the dora milaje are 
 even though she lost in the end okoye literally held off four talokans who all had super strength and she had no armour at all she basically killed three but their attributes kept them alive even then the big guy attuma only dislocated her shoulder he could’ve done a lot worse 

they literally beat killmonger in bp 1 and would’ve killed him if it weren’t for his kinetic blast 
 in the comics they assisted t’challa in defeating dr doom himself 
 blocked literal bullets with their spears 
 not mention how swift they are 
 plus their theme music is cold as  

i would most def put them in the ranks as some of the best marvel fighters fs 

like c’mon give them their flowers",2023-01-02 08:52:57
the movie was incredibly terrible they should have just recast the black panther,2023-02-02 01:15:13
 angela bassett was awesome in this movie but i did not enjoy this movie even less than thor love and thunder i guess endgame was really it i dont feel they are rewatchable do you feel theres a significant drop as well is marvel just cashing in and sleeping in their laurels seems loki has been the only thing to move things forward sorry to rant,2023-02-03 22:33:28
"no mention of the snap by namor the fact that they were all blue and then they werent and then they were the whole premise of an historically oppressed race fighting another historically oppressed race probably not relevant to lore accuracy but it felt gross i dunno   
ive just finished watching the movie and i felt like so many things were just missing or glossed over maybe im getting too old for these movies but i just couldnt connect with any of the characters it felt lacking in so many areas maybe an extended directors cut could help but i just felt it lacked the weight it deserved",2023-02-04 13:07:02

"black panther without chadwick boseman will always feel weird to me but that aside the plot is pretty good on its own at least i enjoyed it enough to not be boring the only few gripes i have are


 inconsistent plotlines shuri was being empathetic with the talokans prior to being rescued but after nakia rescues her suddenly shes like the talokans are dangerous people like what also i hate how the healing and sonar waves thingy are inconsistent as well


 riri williams being a mary sue i know shes already a pretty woke character in the comics genius inventor since young age smartest black girl on earth etc but i thought they would make her more downtoearth in live action instead they up a notch build a machine at age 3 lol


 most of the scenes in the first 2 acts are too dark add that with their accent and i could barely comprehend what those scenes are about

 the designs for the midnight angel suit and riri williams ironheart suit are pretty goofy",2023-02-16 19:40:33
how did they just let riri return to the states the government is going to make her build another machine and they are going to find talokan they just forgot the whole reason for the movie happening like she’s gonna go back and ride around in her car and go to red sox games,2023-02-20 15:48:43
shuri’s better than me i would have at least ate them feet wings in front of namor before i sent him home fire was everywhere just stand over him grill it and eat it while giving the speech send him home shooketh,2023-03-10 03:41:38
if this gets nominated for best picture im gonna officially lose faith in humanity,2022-11-11 05:16:31
i liked the movie overall but you’re telling me shuri’s plan to fight the people who live in the ocean was a boat,2022-11-11 12:10:32
"i think the film falls well short of being exceptional scattered thoughts

there are good moments but the pacing felt weird the tone shifts felt weird some plot points dont make sense and some of the effects work is silly looking shorten it up waste less of my time

what was the point of martin freeman the cia enters into the equation 0 times his only purpose is to put pressure on wakanda to reveal namor

they couldve done something interesting but instead we got a lame cgi horde fight and another fatally wounded hero who shrugs it off like it was nothing also why did the jets fire when she said wakanda forever was it just for dramatic effect

when the french mercs broke in to the vault and got attacked the scene was edited to  same with the attack on the boat there was basically no fight choreography

why did shuri need to go off on the bike at the garage what did she accomplish

iron heart can build a nanomachine ironman suit overnight i wouldve preferred a more iterative suit for this outing and less combat aptitude

why base your entire final attack so far out at sea cant you do the same thing like 100 miles closer to shore

so the wakandans moved to the mountains for 1 scene and then moved back to wakanda

postcredits was really bad if nakia had a son why the  did she go off to war her priorities are wrong wakanda has plenty of similarly skilled people

those dive suits looked  and the underwater city was so poorly lit even after the vibranium sunrise

mediocre film 610 its mostly saved by some strong performances from danai guirira and angela bassett",2022-11-11 19:07:12
"as with pretty much any movie with this kind of runtime theres a lot to talk about but ill just start with saying i thought this was good but not great as much as this movie was able to really tackle the emotional beats and had some really exceptional acting the action was just sloppy as  i could forgive that in a drama that happens to have some action but this is a series where good action should be a given

there was a lot to appreciate here angela bassett was just incredible and even wright was putting in a surprising performance although she just doesnt feel like she has the leader charisma bosewick had the movie looked great when i wasnt having to dig a fight out of some simply unreadable shots the city and people of talokan were really interesting and well done and that michael b jordan cameo was a very awesome surprise

speaking of michael b i did like namor in this movie but he still doesnt hold a candle to the great villain that was killmonger they were definitely still covering themes of colonization and a big point of contention continues to be how wakanda tries to be the moral high ground where the rest of the world is happy to not meet those standards but the plot revolving around namor obsessively wanting to  someone who is clearly not a colonizer and clearly is a child who had technology stolen by the government just didnt ring true to me

it seemed pretty clear that if namor had a five minute conversation with riri hed realize shes not a threat but the movie avoids this by never having them interact even though he captures her they were even willing to  her in the street but once shes captured with shuri even though namor has made up his mind that she has to die and its nonnegotiable they just dont  her so that she can get rescued even though namors backstory on exposition island was interesting his motivation that caused the main conflict was flimsy to say the least

is shuri the best option for the new black panther actors beliefs aside i thought she put in a nice performance and i did like the theme of what kind of panther will you be even if it made for a predictable ending whereas i was kind of wanting her to give in to the darkness a little but i stand by the idea that it should have been lupita i imagine she doesnt want to be on call for marvel but shes the more badass character and the better actress and i was hoping they were holding back the reveal during promotion so they could make a deal with her

all that said with the hand this production was dealt and with a visionary like coogler behind the camera this was still a pretty solid movie the actual action wasnt great but it wasnt totally devoid of great action set pieces and the way this movie handles the emotional beats makes it stand out more than your average marvel fare if clean action is to be expected from marvel successful emotion is a nice surprise when they get it right i would give this a solid 710 theres enough going on that you can ignore the way the action is shot if you want but i just cant fathom why the fights had to be so mediocre

"one of the biggest disappointments of the year horrible pacing no plot threads that led to nowhere every emotional moment landed with the impact of a bagel black panther transformation was boring and confusing  happened 

i’m baffled",2022-11-11 03:42:06
the inclusion of kamaru usman and francis ngannou at least it looked like francis for a quarter of a second at the waterfall was kinda weird the camera lingered on kamaru even when he wasnt giving lines so you knew it was him and it was just kinda awkward likewise it focused on francis just to have him smile for half a second i get that theyre african world champion fighters and it fits in a movie about african super heroes and warriors but as a ufc fan it was just too noticeable and not very subtle lol,2022-11-11 05:16:02
namor tells shuri what his name is and she still decides to pronounce it wrong lol,2022-11-11 15:36:11
very dissapointed movie was not even close to the first one my hope in the mcu decreases each day,2022-11-13 00:49:54
"i thought it was slap bang in the middle of meh with this wave of marvel films

had a few issues i couldnt get passed

im 90 wakanda is land locked in the middle of africa so isnt the most obvious solution to dam any rivers

wouldnt burning namore alive be the smarted play than making him sweat it out fire will burn all the oxygen and also melt his skin space heaters were not a good idea

namore was really chill until was like yo bro im actually gonna  the world you in

i think this film has taken the reins from eternals as the worst marvel movie nothing made sense the only redeeming quality was angela bassetts performance,2022-11-11 03:30:06
i didnt like this outside of the chadwick tribute he was missed here letitia wright just doesnt have it for me it was too long,2022-11-11 03:19:04
it was kinda  ngl,2022-11-11 06:30:26
pretty mid movie had no business being so long,2022-11-11 03:04:22
"overall i had a good time not amazing but good enough that i dont regret the evening or the price of admission

the good

 bosemans passing was handled quite well
 movie found a decent level of humor to settle at
 music was flawless
 ramonda was astounding
 riri was amusing enough

the bad

 holy  the midnight angel suits were gaudy af
 i didnt dislike shuri but  i just did not care about her character arc
 set piece for the final showdown wasnt remarkable it wouldnt be dishonest to describe it as a big boat
 that cia subplot really did not need to exist

lastly and ill give this its own paragraph i hate namor i have always hated namor so the movie is in an interesting place for me in that it adapts him extremely well and is very true to his character in the comicswhich means i hate his guts and not in the fun way you can hate villains but in that way you silently groan whenever they appear on screen

like i said overall i had a good time dont think id sit down to watch this one again if its on in someones house though",2022-11-11 04:35:48
very touching tribute to chadwick boseman the movie was good but needed to be about 45 minutes or so  shorter it was much too slow in my opinion,2022-11-11 04:35:06
"ironheart was a major piece at the start of the movie then completely forgotten

okoye’s suit was awful 

namor was interesting but the power of the talukans seemed to change scene to scene

this movie felt like 25 hours of coogler and the cast mourning chadwick and that just seemed like way too much it sucks he died and i can’t imagine being in their shoes but it seemed like they were just pushing it in our faces the whole time beginning was a great tribute to him feels like they should have let that be it",2022-11-11 22:21:57
i would watch 2 hours and 47 minutes of just lupita nyongo walking around mexico in different outfits,2022-11-12 04:00:39
"just saw the movie a second time with family to give it another chance and have to say i like it even less than the first viewing and i was pretty disappointed in that first viewing 

the core problem is still the fact they moved forward with the movie at all everyone in the film is clearly trying to mourn and pay respect to chadwick in their own way and none of it works in fact all of it hurts the actual film this is 100 going to be a movie the filmmakers look back on in 510 years with regret much like spielbergs views on temple of doom 

killing tchalla just doesnt work from a narrative perspective i wont even go into how this is the third time the character has died in the universe once in the og film once in infinity war and this but dealing with the fallout of his death just consumes so much of the time and tone of the film the result is time is lost elsewhere namely building up the talokans and namor in particularly to be interesting antagonists this leaves the film feeling like two movies squished together into one the plot of shuri dealing with her grief  a geopolitical thriller on how tchallas actions in the last movie exposed a new threat from under the sea 

none of it works the film is bloated moves a glacier pace and has none of the life or color or charm that made the first film so distinct everything looks like a poor facsimile of the first film with the wonder of wakanda looking like an afterthought to the clear drab grief everyone in the production was feeling this also impacted talokan which no one prepared me for the undersea world looks terrible all washed out in shadows and lame blue lights the color scheme and creativity that made wakanda feel like a real place is not used here at all it looks cheap even compared to aquaman which came out a solid six years ago 

even worse shuri has to carry a film the character is not made to handle part of the reason this thing moves like a four decade old bus is because she lacks the gravitas and charisma to serve as lead no one else bounces off her at all in that charisma void leaving the film without a center to make us connect with anyone in the story 

i think it sums it up that at both screenings i went to different groups of kids were annoyed black panther didnt show up until the very end at the screening tonight a pair were upset the real black panther wasnt in the movie when the parents explained he has died they just got bummed again sorry kids the production crew had to process their grief and we were stuck with this three hour mess 

they should have delayed the film and recast those same kids would have figured it out the minute they saw the og iconic suit and if they needed to push this namor plot out they should have just shuttled tchalla off world or something and let shuri lead without dragging the thing down with a thousand pounds of unresolved loss",2022-11-26 06:58:54
"loved namor and talokan definite highlights for me

as usual i wish for more mbaku duke has major presence any chance his challenge at the end means he takes over as black panther in the future with her battle finished and quest for vengeance over maybe shuri can head back to the lab and leave the violence to someone else

to me the movie did feel like it lost steam once the rest of the cast largely fell away and shuri had to carry bosemans absence was felt wright gave a decent performance but doesnt have the same presence",2022-11-11 15:20:32
one thing i really hated about this movie was the us people ross val riri the seal or cia it doesnt have any contribution or good thing about the film but to cause many problems especially for val like everytime i see here ill getting quite mad this points should be remove in the film and focus the grief of shuri and the queen or the conflict of takolans thats all,2022-11-12 15:19:23
"bro why the  was namors hype music in spanish if they were gonna make such a big deal about colonizers

as a latino it all felt super weird i still liked the movie but yeah",2022-11-13 20:50:54
i find it a bit fun that wakanda is supposed to be so powerful vs the rest of the world but when fighting talokan they scramble 50 ppl with sticks and spears feels like a country like the us could run them over easily,2023-02-04 22:05:40
"a great example to show how a death of an actor totally ruined the story of the original film

this film felt very choppy editing was all over the place and namor while cool did not feel appropriate to have here considering the stuff going on with the wakadans losing tchalla

two different types of movies here and they dont work at all",2022-11-11 04:09:59
okay just out of the movie now and i’ve got to let it out it was too damm long like i did enjoy but it felt like the script had to be rolled longer like a flatbread out of a dough,2022-11-11 13:25:30
was anybody else’s movie super dark i could barely see anything the whole movie,2022-11-11 14:11:00

a part of me was rooting for namor lol,2022-11-11 20:16:08
this movie did a great job at nailing namors attitude they portrayed him perfectly as a ruthless  who cares for his people,2022-11-12 00:21:51
everytime chadwick came on screen my theater got quiet rip man,2022-11-12 00:22:42
maybe i’m missing something but why couldn’t they just explain the situation to riri and tell her to destroy her research on her machine and not to make another one,2022-11-12 02:24:24
why were some of namors people blue and then the ones in his city weren’t,2022-11-12 04:35:31
was anyone else confused by whether or not the talokan warriors were bulletproof or not the big dude apparently took several pistol bullets at point blank range but didnt flinch we see some bullets ricochet off his neck brace thing but the other warriors get shot down as lake bell takes off in her chopper so apparently they are susceptible to bullets but the big guy just got really lucky lake bell sucks at aiming like she shot at a shirtless dude with an exposed chest and she couldnt plant one square in the chest,2022-11-12 04:56:34
"i honestly found it a bit dull shuri was a pretty good secondary character but i didnt find her compelling enough to carry the movie also didnt really care for the villain too much either

"namor seems crazy powerful  i wholeheartedly believe the mcu needs some more meaningful deaths not these long drawn out character arcs where the character finally goes out on their own terms because the actor is tired of doing the role

and the comedy didnt feel forced",2022-11-13 04:04:42
"namors motivations seemed to change from scene to scene

 he so desperately wants knowledge of his civilisation kept hidden that he will attack a water station approach wakanda for aid and seek the death of this scientist who is capable of building a machine that will inadvertently reveal them to the world and yet
 he also wants to attack and take over the world which he will do with or without wakandas help and if they refuse to help then he will attack them first revealing the existence of his civilisation to the world

to me at least and this is an issue spread throughout the mcu it felt as if they werent sure of how to write a villain and instead fell into the trap of writing another killmonger 

it would have helped substantially if it were revealed to shuri during her tour that namor had already been militarising and preparing his people for war against the surface world and simply didnt want them to be revealed earlier than their planned invasion  wed then have a villain with consistent motivations and not a reactive antagonist who had otherwise done nothing for half a millennia and yet supposedly has desires on conquering the world as well as remaining secret",2022-11-13 04:07:39

soo shuri beats namor and tells him wakanda will protect talokan from the outside world but then runs off to a vacation and did not face mbakus challenge for the throne doesnt that mean she forfeits the crown and the promise is now moot mama ramonda isnt there to take her side anymore and she wont win the fight anyway especially if the power remover handicap is still on didnt they accept killmonger as king because he won fair and square what a ,2022-11-14 01:37:12

the namor change is fine and kind of makes sense however i think they could have better explained how they became the talokanil and how hes a mutant  
  
youre gonna tell me that a skinny shuri with no real combat training whatsoever can beat a warrior namor who might be as strong as the hulk  
  
also they kind of just threw in ironheart in here as she plays no integral part to the story it could have been any random scientist that made the vibranium machine  
  
i think they should have waited longer to do the sequel or they just should have recast tchalla he was too important of a character to  off in the mcu the franchise could have been so much more",2022-11-16 14:37:26

i was hoping anyone but shuri would be bp it made sense for her to go to the ancestral realm given all of her grief but her superpower is her brain and seeing her in fight scenes felt so awkward also terrible decision making at the end fighting the talokan on the water not really having a plan b seemed like the bp powers gave her brain fog,2022-11-22 04:41:26
okoye is a straight bad  loved her fight scene on the bridge,2022-11-24 05:37:23
"i enjoyed the movie overall  810

however i felt it was ironic that a movie that started to feel too long halfway through when i realized it wasn’t close to being done felt so rushed at the end i couldn’t help but sit there and feel a “that’s it” moment after the sad boatdesert fight 

as for the cia stuff i’m  to the mcu adding stuff to set other stuff up that it didn’t bother me but i wish it felt more important for this story 

if i didn’t know ironheart was a thing and a future project i would’ve felt riri was a complete waste of time since i did know about ironheart she felt like a really poorly executed origin story 

everything relating to grief was well done 

everything with namor and his people before the last bit of the movie was great except the bridge scene what was the point of that shell if they were just going to attack when wakandans had the scientist it felt like namor didn’t give them a chance to keep their word 

the mid credit scene left me with mixed feelings i had a feeling nakia had a secret kid when ramonda visited her but i’m worried they won’t execute his story right also the fact that the scene was literally a continuation of the last scene felt like a cheap way to have a credit scene i wish they would’ve done something with riri or the cia instead to better tie it all in or set up future stuff",2022-11-28 04:52:42
"i dont know if anyone is going to see this since its been 18 days but a friend reminded me of a plot from agents of shield that kinda contradicts the black panthers plot 

in the movie they made such a huge fuss about riri williams being the only person in the world being able to create a vibranium detecting machine but in season 2 episode 11 of agents of shield mack was able to fit a tiny vibranium detecting machine inside a model car which he gifted to coulson so that he could scan coulsons office to see where he hid the toolbox 

even if mack didnt build the vibranium detecting machine someone else must have built it which means that riri williams wasnt the only person who could build one that kind of breaks the entire plot of the movie if the government had specs on how the tiny one was built they could have used that to build a larger one even after riri would have been killed by the talocans",2022-11-28 18:35:21

"it was fine truly having said that…

 it was overlong

 it dragged and was quite boring at times

 it became bogged down by real tragedy and was oftentimes merely a circlejerk to mourn chadwick boseman  more than anything else

 they chose the least charismatic  and only un charismatic person in the cast  to take over the mantle of black panther

 to paraphrase dr ian malcolm “there will actually be a black panther in this black panther movie right”

all in all it was fine it was a competently made movie but it’s not one i’ll ever feel the need to watch again the first was so much better it’s not even funny

side note i get it would be that dark underwater but come on  it’s a comic book movie it looked like zack snyder’s atlantis scenes james wan did it way better in “aquaman”",2022-11-11 19:09:14

"unfortunately a lot of this movie didn’t work for me — strange editing and story choices ironheart and ross felt super forced and out of place could be half an hour shorter with a more focused story messy third act 

the recruitment scene with riri felt like a watered down version of tom holland’s introduction in civil war i wish she had more time to breathe as a character she felt like she was in this just to have a backdoor pilot

every scene with namor rocked hard though he stole every scene he was in appreciated the great tributes to chadwick stunning cinematography and production design particularly underwater the dedication to telling much of the story in mayan was great",2022-11-11 07:58:29
"i had a decent enough time with the movie i just do not understand who the heck this fontaine lady is or why she keeps appearing with little to no context that whole cia plotline totally messed with the pacing 

i also think and this might be met with criticism but i did not like shuri as black panther i sort of wished they had someone else to play the role i just dont think she had enough charisma or screen presence for me 

honestly as wild as this suggestion probably is i would have preferred if shuri towards the end had died but succeeded in making the heart shaped herb then have queen ramonda take the herb and become black panther",2022-11-11 16:47:23
can someone explain how the blue people can travel such vast distances so quickly what’s the top speed of a whale obviously the only reason to ride a whale is because it’s faster than they are they better not be headed towards another hollow earth thing like godzilla also if the blue people are so advanced they somehow let their prisoners get swiped undetected,2022-11-11 20:00:18
why was ramonda the queen instead of shuri  im trying to envision a scenario where she was next in line to the throne and i cant figure it out,2022-11-12 12:54:41
"i kinda wish this was two movies one where foreign powers try to exploit wakanda after t’challa’s death and another focused solely on talocan vs wakanda

i liked letitia as the lead she sold it attuma and namora were pretty cool from what little we saw of them

coogler has a weird thing with not showing blood shuri getting impaling showed nothing the ship fight showed nothing bp1 also had a scene where killmonger slices a dora’s throat but it’s bloodless

i wish nakia had a bigger role if not being the black panther

overall a good tribute to chadwick but the convoluted plot kinda falls flat due to all the unnecessary stuff",2022-11-12 18:56:20
"well it was terrible storyline wasnt too bad i guess but man that was really quite shocking too many chefs in the kitchen maybe obviously too many yes people in the design team not pushing back on bad ideas

no no we will use it as a small area to fight on 

 

we will fight in the sides too itll be fun",2022-11-12 20:14:39
don’t watch this in imax the contrast for dark scenes and black skin made most of this movie a muddy mess,2022-11-13 06:28:30
i thought the movie had noticeable plot holes why did namor keep riri around instead of killing her outright upon capturing her why did the talokans survive being stabbed with vibranium spear but died when a vibranium gun shot them why did the wakandans downgrade from blasters and force fields in infinity war to hand to hand weapons again  if the talokans lived underwater and were stuck in 16th century tech and society how did they mine and shape vibranium and keep up with the latest happenings in wakanda is riri really safe at the end of the movie nothing really improved for her on the cia perspective shuri sent her home and even confiscated her suit wakanda is even more vulnerable now that queen ramonda is dead and shuri went on a vacation,2022-11-13 11:02:40
why would namor randomly change his mind after being  bent on his revenge arc tired of these movie cliches,2022-11-14 11:41:17
"this movie had some really great moments moments of sadness of comedy of action 

unfortunately the bulk of the movie was made up of scenes of one character stationary talking with another character cut together with quick travel montages 

everything felt like it was on a sound stage

not enough action to fill the massive run time 

i choked up more from the trailer thinking about chadwicks passing than i did from the 60 of the movie that was devoted to talking about what next 

the opening sequences were beautifully done and namor was a great character but the entire plot fell apart for me with the single justification from him that the world is looking for vibranium so we must  everyone and the idea that shuri would even for a second buy in to that idea",2022-11-14 12:15:02
"i could never understand how namor can go from being caring and understanding and turn into a coldblooded killer  never be a  my eyes considering what he did in the film  

it wasnt like bucky who had the excuse of being controlled and brainwashed namor purposefully killed queen raimunda and never once did he show remorse and shuri still chose to spare his life i dont get it",2022-11-14 20:07:42

"yeah did not love this movie  in fact i think i liked eternals more  not sure why  just felt a little long and drawn out  i loved namur and the amazing backstory but as a long time comic book reader i also felt that there is no way the shuri could take down namor  this is a character who has taken on nazis the fantastic four and the avengers  the whoe two nations at war thing was good and it was a good tight story just didn’t work for me  

with that said glad it was made and many people love it  just looking forward to the next marvel movie",2022-11-24 15:40:30

it’s racist to black men and plays into the trope of absent black father with the strong independent black woman being the “man of the house” idiotic and not the right message for teenage boys the supposed target demo

"610

just got out of the theatre good movie if you’re interested i guess

action wise black adam is better mom and nwh is more memorable 

personally i was rooting for namor and the talokans could never believe letitia wright as bp with that small muscle her speeches was weak was hoping she died during the fight scene love namor the talokan girl and the big guy philosophically and politically namor is right 

hope they recast the black panther role in next movie to anyone except letitia wright",2022-11-12 09:26:16
"didnt love it to be honest for one it was much longer than it needed to be but also shuri becoming black panther just didnt feel right  the role she played in the previous movie felt much more right for her i dont know how they would have written it exactly in a way that makes sense but nakia or okoye would have been much better taking on that role

namor was interesting at the start but his plan to just attack the entire surface made next to zero sense and the entire battle between his people and wakanda was underwhelming but also pretty non sensical

i had read that unlike other marvel movies in this phase that this felt like a return to form and i didnt get that at all didnt really do anything to further  phase 4 at all

im sure many others enjoyed it and if you did great but it just didnt work for me",2022-11-12 14:00:50
"i just saw it and am i wrong in saying this is a mess of a film

the opening credit tribute to chadwick was sweet but the actual plot was so misguided and sooooo so boring

like i don’t know what was happening other than a general “protect riri or something”",2022-11-14 01:19:58
movie was weak af im not impressed,2022-11-15 09:49:49
"why is an african calling an american a colonizer

why is this mayan dude clearly of european descent

why are they speaking a south african language in east africa while wearing west africa style of clothing

why would namor not only spare the life of the scientist but bring her to the place that they were scared of her finding

how did namor even get into wakanda with its force fields

bad acting bad dialogue and bad story probably would have been great if chadwick had lived because the pseudo atlantis thing was brilliant",2022-11-14 01:05:31
ok so i didn’t see the film just came here to see how bad it was,2022-11-11 03:43:28
this what happens when you go woke and make shuri black panther when will hollywood realize,2022-11-11 03:48:26
chadwick boseman must have died of boredom,2022-11-11 22:24:10
this is one of if not the worst marvel movies to date even ignoring the difficulty boseman’s death had on the franchise the story is an absolute mess,2022-11-13 07:21:58
the movie was a borefest,2022-11-11 13:40:52
this movie wasn’t that good,2022-11-12 23:55:06
nakia’s butt looked so good in her outfit that i had to say it to my girlfriend during the movie and she agreed,2022-11-13 14:36:27
 what a boring mess,2022-11-13 21:27:10
not a lot of black panther in this very long black panther movie,2022-11-11 05:12:08
disappointed 610 namor reasoning isn’t strong enough why don’t you just stay hidden and antagonize nations to join to war against wakanda and to conquer surface world you can’t start with a few nations,2022-11-11 05:13:42
i’ve always hated shaky cam in movie fight scenes but this was one of the first times my eyes legitimately hurt seeing action scenes in a movie unless it’s shang chi or the russos the only time i can trust marvel choreography is when the characters are cgi,2022-11-11 08:17:01
thank you for sharing was interested in seeing this film but it was lackluster maybe the director meant this one to be slow and somber because it was too much dialogue and the characters’ motivations were paltry for a “black panther” film there was little black panther this felt like a steel magnolias remake with an africanamerican cast and the black panther name and brief cgi action affixed to it rate it a 410 would not recommend,2022-11-11 16:04:21
i was disappointed by this movie it could have easily been 30 or 40 minutes shorter it wasnt terrible but it doesnt measure up to its predecessor,2022-11-11 22:38:18
movie was such a drag marvel really dropping the ball this phase besides spiderman,2022-11-12 02:27:24

"anyone feels that the funeral for tchallas funeral was too small scale he is the leader of wakanda and forty people show up and gets uncermoniously abducted by a ship i expected something grander

theres a problem with shuri being black panther she was cast as a side character and letitia wright feels small and ill suited for the role",2022-11-12 21:39:11
"did they leave something unresolved

mbaku challenged for the kingship near the end when shuri was finally doing the goodbye ceremony supposedly

dont they have to fight it out like in the original

and how could they do that anyway an unpowered shuri would have no chance",2022-11-13 01:46:38
after watching thor love and thunder this movie might as well have been citizen kane,2022-11-13 03:00:07
no as good as the first one and kind of regret watching it,2022-11-13 03:38:22

though still find her hard to picture in this role long term she needs to get on those weights",2022-11-15 21:22:45
"holy cow that was bad why put the dora milaje in those garbage suits they literally looked like power ranger villains

and everyone is gonna get an ironman esque suit now
iron hearts suit also looked ridiculously animelike

the cgi was not good at all not sure what movie people watched who are praising it can’t believe how bad this was",2023-02-05 19:48:17
"i quite liked it a beautiful tribute absolutely loved the use of silence it was stunning to feel how quiet it was in a packed theater 

some things i didn’t like too much  the dora milaje mech armor was a bit much third act in the water ship wasn’t that great liked the fight in the desert but it kept changing imax ratios and that was distracting didn’t love some of the music choices in introducing talokan and i think it could’ve been done with more impact if it wasn’t scored with a modern popy song",2022-11-11 03:19:43
"it wasfine honestly i was more excited for this than i have been for a marvel movie in a while

it definitely was about 30 minutes too long jackson was actually my favorite part of the first one but i just dont think she has the chops to carry a movie like this i really wanted akoya to be the next black panther 

yes i know shuri gets it in the comics but she has a very different characterization in the comics in this she suddenly can fight and do all kinds of acrobatics ok it is the heart herb but

i think originally before boseman died the plan was for shuri to be riri more or less just not in name i predicted it after the first one and the fact that the riri character in this felt a little just kinda glommed on makes me think it actually was what the plan was 

i am glad they got to make it if only for the fact that it clearly let a lot of them process their grief",2022-11-11 05:16:59
maybe it’s just me but more than superhero fatigue i definitely feel the hateisbad arc fatigue,2022-11-11 08:40:40

this was such a disappointing movie,2022-11-12 01:04:14
"so many boring long pointless scenes “is it true you found an underwater kingdom” “yes it was beautiful but they’re dangerous”

they also forgot to put in a main protagonist with a goal who does things by the time shuri was sightseeing underwater i was pretty done

lupita nyong’o was just out of bounds gorgeous in this movie though yowza",2022-11-12 09:13:50
is it weird for me to say that i wanted the movie to be sadder i was expecting an emotional gut punch that would have me bawling my eyes out like tony stark’s death or something bittersweet like morgan’s “cheeseburgers” line in endgame but i felt a sort of emotional disconnect with this movie there were some sad moments but i didn’t feel as emotionally invested as i thought i would i still think this is a good movie but not as great as i was hoping it would be,2022-11-13 07:00:16
it was worse than the 1st bp movie it was one of the better phase 4 movies but phase 4 sucks so this was just mid really,2022-11-15 05:01:19
i checked the time at least 4 times during this movie holy  why was it so  long not having a black panther until the last 20 minutes really hurt it shouldve just brought back michael b jordan to take over the main role,2022-11-11 07:29:21
so how many heroes do we have now that are both super smart and super powered i feel like it’s getting old,2022-11-11 05:56:37
an actor is not a character im sorry we need to say that bluntly tchalla does not need to be dead because chadwick bozeman is dead no matter how big of a tragedy it is you could have carried on his legacy think of how many actors have played james bond batman etc there are so many black male actors that could have taken up the mantle a proper tribute and providing another black male actor the opportunity to carry the legacy was the right call imagine giving dumbledore an offscreen death before the third harry potter movie because richard harris died now you have to multiverse the character back or just have a black panther franchise that cant really continue thats just the worst of both worlds,2022-11-11 18:16:48
the opening scene trying to save tchalla had to be the weakest scene in the movie i dont like how they glossed over his cause of death the way they did i would have liked if they attributed it to the snap like getting dusted and returned took away his fruit powersconnection to the ancestral plane,2022-11-11 03:19:05
 this film was godawful how can they knowingly release something so ,2022-11-15 15:48:19

so how did they explain tchallas death,2022-11-11 08:21:25
i hope they release the original script one day i really want to know what the conflict would be i’m guessing it still would be namor tripping off vibranium i wonder if he still takes shuri hostage and how t’challa would respond,2022-11-11 08:56:32
"movie was fine

felt like there were a lot of checklist things that need to be hit  and made for a more bloated film than necessary

cia parts could have been cut entirely ironheart probably could have been tampered down too if not cut entirely as well

namor intro felt like it may have been better served as a coldopen or slimmed down a little the chadwick tribute obviously took precedent for the opening though

most of the fight scenes didnt work that well in my opinion especially whatever that end 1v1 was the movie did an excellent job of hyping everyone up only for the actual fighting to be rather bland a bit of a shame

a lot of the dialogue was really really quiet you have these epic musical tracks going and then theyre speaking over it and its like could you repeat that

visually pretty sweet great score

i wanted this movie to be better than it was looking forward to more talocan",2022-11-11 09:11:27

"i really liked it everything in wakanda and the tributes to chadwick were great but man the namor stuff was weak 

the whole “we’re not so different be better” stuff they tried to do at the end with shuri and namor really goes out the  window after namor murdered the queen in cold blood if it was namora that had thrown the water bomb and namor looked on with some regret or something that’s all solved but there was literally no reason for shuri to not  namor right there t’challa was ready to kll klaw for less in the korea scene from the first movie 

i get it namor is a big character and making him a one off villain that gets killed would be a disservice but if the intention was to make us look forward to more namor stuff it did not do it for me personally 


really liked the rest of the movie but the villain stuff just drags it down a good amount 77510

edit oh yeah and m’baku’s talk of not killing namor because it would mean endless war how is flooding the city with dozens of civilians dead and murdering the queen not an act of war nahh shuri had every right to slice him up",2022-11-11 23:08:19

felt bad when they put okoye in that dumb midnight angels outfit",2022-11-12 07:29:34
i thought the movie was just ok until the queens death it was pretty good but after that it went from very boring watching shuri yet again try to invent something on the fly to an overlong action scene where it was obvious shuri would make peace with namor the mid credit scene was nice and poignant but there should have been a post credit scene with a typical easter eggfuture storyline teaser i understand the uniqueness of this movie as it tried and succeeded at honoring chadwick but ultimately its a comic book movie and it just lacked the fun and escapism you expect when watching a marvel movie,2022-11-12 07:34:20
namor really tipped his hand coming to wakanda in the first place if he was as confident as he claimed in his armys ability to overpower wakanda which did seem justified going there seemed unnecessary he could have launched his war on the rest of the world and by the time wakanda got involved conquered half of it certainly didnt need to involve them in their assassination on riri,2022-11-12 08:09:24
"the talokan greeting just was too funny to me
like everyone is greeting themselves with a kamehameha",2022-11-12 17:24:36

namor deserved a better suit what were those shorts,2022-11-13 23:23:50
did it say how namors mom knew about wakanda i can understand him having spys in the world so he can get information on how the world is progressing and that now wakanda is not in hiding but how did his mom know about wakanda 500 years ago maybe i missed something but im thinking maybe they have a history we didnt know about,2022-11-14 03:28:06
"hmmm definitely had mixed feelings about this movie it started off really great between memorial to chadwick the moments of silence were touching and the princesss struggle between modern times vs tradition it was all compelling however right after namor floods  is when it starts to go downhill and quickly right when the battle of the wakandans and talokans start having shuri lose all of her immediate family to fasttrack her to revenge felt like a cheap gimmick   
i will say bringing killmonger back as the ancestor she sees after taking the herb was actually genius i do have my issues with him but one thing i will give killmonger is that he was actually making points in both movies execution was  poor everyone wants black folk to take the moral higher ground after having the worst things done to them by everyone else namor wreaks havoc on her homeland and kills her family but she’s supposed to just turn the other cheek nah if we not gone  him i would’ve at least made sure he wouldn’t be able to use them hermes 3000s anymore it’s funny that the film chose to go this route but then had named tchallas and nakias son after the haitian revolutionary hero toussiant loverture those that dont know hatian history should read up on the man that fought back to free his people speaking of haiti were they speaking creole i grew up around a lot of haitians and it didn’t sound like it more like french but maybe it was actors poor replication haiti has so much cultural richness and haitian creole is apart of that shoutout to them including cape verde in the movie too the global black diaspora was really getting its shine and we love to see it  
riri was really great in this film i didn’t know what to expect hearing she was gonna be in it but she was so relatable and funny the only thing i didn’t really like was her final suit maybe it was the bad cgi or the  bootcut jean design with the bad color scheme  but it looked kinda  what deputy williams say “can’t fight crime if you aint cute” but no fr they should’ve reworked the design just a tadbit more it’s frustrating that ppl say she didn’t add anything or need to be included in the movie like did you watch the first bp at all killmonger’s whole deal was about how wakanda was thriving but let black folks in the diaspora around the world struggle i think it was great that they kept this in mind after his death why would they give a gifted young black girl over to namor so she can be put to death that would bring us right back to the whole conflict of bp 1 again  
the battle between the wkandans and talokans was kinda underwhelming ngl the wakandans were getting washed so badly i had to change sides halfway through the battle what happened to the kinetic suit tech that shuri created for t’challa the one that charged up with kinetic energy and reflected it back namor is strong asf and she was struggling big time at first even without formal training she had “dey strengt of dey black panta” and that suit would’ve given her another advantage i will give her that she did get the upper hand towards the end but she really took a beating during the hand to hand combat portion them lil scratches baby girl was giving wasn’t doing enough for me i needed her to be breaking some bones  
overall the movie was really good definitely different from the first but in a good way it was its own unique story and i really loved how they explored shuri’s journey with belief and grief namor was a brilliantly written antagonist i loved his backstory and learning about the talokans the underwater scenes were beautifully depicted and i really think ryan cooler hit it out of the park again",2022-11-14 16:30:22
"quick question why are some “talokans” blue and others not 

it’s my understanding after watching the movie twice that namor’s ancestors drank that vibranium potion to escape colonisation drinking that caused them all to “die” and be “reborn” as blue entities who no longer could live on land  breathe air

however in the scene of namor’s mother giving birth to him underwater she is back to being her original skin color…

likewise when shuri goes to talokan with namor she encounters talokans living there who are not blue

i got that because namor’s mom was already pregnant when she drank the potion namor did not turn blue

in light of that is that why some talokan aren’t blue aka their ancestors were but their descendants weren’taren’t

… but if so how is his army all blue as far as i understand he’s the exception being this old no one else got to live as long as him so his current blue army aren’t the original ancestors who drank the vibranium potion…

is that a production oversight or is there some kind of logic to this that i’m missing",2022-11-15 06:30:57
loved the cop on the bridge who’s first reaction was to be like “hey are those guys blue” also crazy to realize namors actor was in narcos mexico i knew he looked familiar,2022-11-15 19:59:50
the more serious tone of this was so refreshing i cant tell you how glad i am namor wasnt out here spouting quips everything involving him felt really inspired compared to recent marvel outings from his background and motivation to the visual style of his fighting wakanda remains extremely visually creative and interesting and that goes for the new underwater kingdom as well im so glad they went back to shooting in locations and on nice sets,2022-11-16 00:36:41
i don’t like shuri the actress definitely colored that perception but she’s just not inspiring at all to be black panther the best part of the movie was the mid credits scene,2022-11-16 02:22:43
there were some good scenes but overall not a very good movie just like the first one it needed to be at least 45 minutes shorter,2022-11-16 05:01:20
i think i liked it better than the first one both had kind of similar villains in the im really mad at the whole world because of colonization theme but the motif works better on someone who has actually been around for 500 years to witness it rather than petulant child whos mad that he didnt grow up as wealthy as his cousin im sorry killmonger stans but not sorry that being said jordan ate the scenery in his cameo,2022-11-16 05:24:00
"im not super sold on having the son be named tchalla as well  its a bit too obvious of a recasting for chadwick without recasting him

very pretty movie though",2022-11-17 18:59:58

not so much as a comic book movie i felt the fight scenes were pretty sapped of potential tenoch huerta meija was amazing as namor and he had great chemistry with letitia wright when he was showing her talokan but their fight scene was pretty lackluster and given that he killed her mother you would expect much more emotion between them then",2022-11-19 04:23:32

honestly i think for the rewrites that had to be done because of the untimely death of chadwick  they team did a great job of keeping things tied to a plot that made sense it seemed to me as if everything in the movie from wardrobe to acting aligned perfectly  my biggest gripe is the cinematography it had its nice moments with a few outstanding visual shots but the other 7080 of the shots in the movie were horrid it felt like we were watching spy kids or power rangers at times  which for what we expected from that franchise is insane  the cinematographer is the one that fumbled the ball maybe its because of disneys requirements as well i wont blame it entirely on the dp but the dps lack of blocking aesthetics and lighting for the majority of the movie devalued the entire thing the sum of the parts add up this part gave very little to the overall experience the latest season of atlanta had way better cinematography even if it didnt have to deal with cgi it was so wack to think what could have been if we had gotten the shots we deserved and the respect as the audience to enjoy a more thoughtout dp experience,2022-11-21 00:30:34
what a beautiful movie… the emotional weight was even greater than endgame’s,2022-11-27 18:35:19
ironheart and midnight angel both looked like suits in anime,2022-11-28 11:22:31
"meh i dont like it and i dont dislike it lol 
the end after the fight scene 90 of wakandans are dead and yet the next scene its all rejoiceful and happy because there is a truce come on 
she didnt even throw the funeral garment on the fire at the end but shots from above its right in the middle of the fire lol its those little things i cant help but spot
i loved the tribalism of the film that was great and the engery was fantastic but the rest felt like the same old re hash and so many things felt like repetition or copying older filmsit didnt feel like marvel it was so stand alone",2022-11-29 08:39:12
overall i thought the movie was pretty good especially the action and end scene but the thing that confused me was who the actual enemy was supposed to be riri didnt give the machine to the ciaas far as i know and the cia was the group invading talokan waters the climax was hard to watch knowing that the cia was probably the enemy they shouldve been worried about and that the whole wakanda talokan beef couldve been squashed in a few sentences,2022-11-29 23:32:53
"finally got around to reluctantly watching this i saw the first black panther in a packed preview screening and it was one of the quietest showings i ever saw before it was released and became massively overhyped its actually only the second marvel movie ive ever nodded off to the first one being kenneth branaghs thor so i was in no rush to watch this sequel honestly i think ive become somewhat counterculture in the past couple of years movies like dune the batman top gun maverick and shows like the rings of power and andor have been competely overhyped in my opinion and i found each one more boring than entertaining why does there seem to be a trend for movies becoming longer and more dull and joyless i just didnt get any enjoyment out of any of it

i will say the one part i did like was the ending when the film finally just quiets down and allows shuri to mourn tchalla the midcredits scene was also sweet but the lack of any real greater tease towards the future of the mcu kind of made it feel somewhat anticlimactic i stayed to the end of the credits and there was nothing which was an even bigger letdown honestly one of my least favorite theater experiences of the year i dont care what the critics or audiences say",2022-12-01 08:00:46
this movie  dawg martin  was right,2022-12-03 02:53:14

"doing a run through of oscar nominees and just finished this one not very interested in marvel stuff the last marvel movie i saw was the first avengers movie but i enjoyed this my big complaint was i just couldn’t get interested in the talokans i was surprised by how invested i became in everything wakanda related but the other side of the fence didn’t spark anything in me

edit  looking through other comments people here are much better at critiquingreviewing than i am ",2023-02-02 10:23:02

"surprised by what seems to be an overwhelming negative early reaction in this thread

i really really enjoyed it angela bassett absolutely brought it in every scene she was in the women in general all felt so  strong 

namor is an exciting addition that i can’t wait to see more of

the final fight set piece was pretty bland but i thought the shurinamor fight made up for it

they could have cut some time out but i never felt bored throughout this and no way home are a toss up for me as the best film of this phase although i know it’s been the weakest phase of the franchise 

very excited to see where we go from here",2022-11-11 03:49:09
"i dont know how racist these movies are the africans lower the forcefield by banging on drums rhythmically maybe a keycode would be better

the evil cia lady has a thin blue line streak in her hair because coogler like subtle metaphors white people are bad a bunch of cops got killed

how the  was the cia going to overthrow wakanda that line does not even make sense

julia l dreyfus has a large head never noticed it til now

everetts speech about them being good people was cringey their army stopped thanos like seven years ago and maybe the colonizer jokes are now lame he was about to go to prison for wakanda

iron heart looks like some early 2000s cgi

it wasnt a covid vaccine so leticia swallowed the magic juice

why was namor sometimes dry",2022-11-15 02:11:56
wow this was a massive drop in quality from the first film,2022-11-11 18:30:26
410 for this movie imo horrible plot and if it werent for angela bassett  the tribute for chadwick this movie would probably be ripped apart by critics and fans,2022-11-14 03:32:33
so i guess the strategy to defeat namor is to dehydrate him,2022-11-11 03:58:00
definitely a lot worse than the first one phase 4 has really been a huge disappointment,2022-11-11 06:04:10
"i didnt mind the cia subplot at all tbh ross was a big part of the first movie and it also served to showcase what countries outside wakanda are plottingplanning for the nation i dunno i quite enjoyed it 

also it saddens me to see literally no discussion on here of the numerous themes this film actually hyperfocuses on like grief and legacy or the circle of violence cant help but feel some here legit just undervalue it simple because of it being another marvel movie
like theyve legitimately tried and in my mind succeeded in make a truly big special film 

i especially loved how they visually showed shuris change of heart when she has namor at her mercy there was no music no dialogue just images and the audience immediately gets why she doesnt  him

namor was incredible as well with tenoch huerta doing an amazing job balancing the numerous facets of the character from his perspective you totally understand him and why he does what he does i thought he was a fantastic antagonist and the way he explains how he got his namor moniker with the flashback just felt utterly badass loved it

in a lot of ways this film felt epic and expansive in a way very few superhero movies manage to be and yes its not without its flaws i wasnt a big fan of iron heart but i do appreciate how she was introduced quite organically but i wish they saved her suit up for something else 

other than that and some wonky cg i cant help but feel that this film just felt huge it felt like a film worth going to the theatre for and experiencing with a plethora of emotions on display",2022-11-11 07:20:39
not a fan of this film i loved the tribute to chadwick with the opening scenes and how impactful they made his death throughout the film but i dont like how they killed the queen by drowning her i didnt like ironhearts character at all shes introduced to us pricegouging a fellow student at mit 1 grand for any student isnt chump change her entire demeanor throughout the film felt edgy and useless also her suit design looks baaaaad like power ranger levels bad why was there a gundam flying around at the end of the movie,2022-11-12 10:58:42
was anyone else really disappointed with the movie i felt quite uncomfortable with the way they used chadwick’s death it seemed very exploitative,2022-11-13 15:42:21
that was extremely subpar,2022-11-11 05:21:09
pretty mid like the first movie,2022-11-11 12:18:40
holy  that was bad,2022-11-13 01:33:13
"i mostly enjoyed the movie although there’s a pretty massive hole in it which is that shuri is just not a compelling main character imo it’s not all on the actor because she was literally  into this main character role with like no build up for obvious reasons but man she does not help it her character is paper  thin and the attempt at a heel turn lasts all of like 30 minutes 

i thought namor was cool as  although they did the thing all cbm do that robs the films conflict of any like nuance namors initial reasoning for having beef with wakanda made sense like why should they have to suffer because of t’challa telling everyone about wakanda but they couldn’t have him be reasonable they were like “nah he has to want to literally  a teenager and go to war with the surface” 

also very big last of us 2 vibes on the ending beach scene where she’s about to  namor",2022-11-11 06:04:42

"first of all im mexican

why the  do you call him namor and have absolutely nothing to do with namor except for the pointy ears and wings in the feet might as well just call him something else hes pretty much a new character and the origin of the name namor is the stupidest thing ive ever seen good thing the priest didnt call him pendejo or worst",2022-11-13 06:58:12
man this isnt the worst movie of phase 4 but its absolutely the most disappointing,2022-11-12 05:56:27
"looks like im in the minority here but i really liked it it think its a good movie and probably in my mcu top 3


the tone was much more serious than i thought from the grief thematic to the mercilessness from namor and his army especially the mermaid songs i went in mostly blind so it was full of good surprise for me and both the visuals and music were great


the cia scenes lack resolution but theyre important to show the hypocrisy of the us and how agressive they are i dont get why people are complaining especially when it amounts to like 10min the social commentary really hit the spot imo i love that they called out france at the beginning and wish it would have been stronger toussaint is a great reference though",2022-11-12 06:49:58
"way too long could’ve cut all the cia bs 

i was surprised angela basset died i would rather shurri have died lol",2022-11-13 08:45:19
was a bit silly for me i think white guilt skews the reviews higher in spite of it not being a very good movie,2022-11-12 05:53:45
am i crazy or was namor totally in the right for like 95 of this movie was kinda cheering for him,2022-11-12 02:46:09
i was really surprised how much it focused on letitia and how little lupita was in it,2022-11-11 03:26:46
tchalla’s coffin being  into that wakandan plane just like how he dropped down from it in the beginning of the first film is pure circle of life poetic stuff chef’s kiss,2022-11-11 08:32:40
it was interesting to see how this become more a movie about metacontext than the actual story itself not complaining i think that some of the best parts of the movie were dealing with the death of tchalla  chadwick the rest of the movie was entertaining but felt like it could have been more impactful specifically thematically with a few small changes,2022-11-11 09:28:45

"all the ross stuff with val was absolutely unnecessary couldve shaved a chunk of the runtime without it

was thinking on the way home that shuris sudden refusal to  off namor was too rushed shouldve had a payoff to her conversation with ramonda about seeing the dead when in mourning by having her see an apparition of her mother while shes beating the living  out of him and then realizes that more violence isnt the way could also work as a great inverse callback to tchalla talking  to the elders in the ancestral plain before he has his rematch with killmonger in bp1",2022-11-11 16:02:33
i come to movies for escapism having to essentially relive chadwick’s death was heartbreaking and very somber i liked the way ff handled walkers death hope to see tchalla variants soon,2022-11-11 18:37:30
above all the mildly disappointing aspects the writing was so bad so so bad,2022-11-12 00:08:59
angela bassett’s deltoids could probably defeat namor by themselves,2022-11-12 00:53:18

"man that movie was really heavy my first thought was to compare this to rise of skywalker which similarly had to warp itself around the passing of carrie fisher this movie handled that real world death much better than episode 9 to be clear but i wonder if it didnt somewhat over correct

i think the decision to have queen ramonda die in the movie along with tchalla was too much i mean this was a movie that already had a pall cast over it with chadwick bosemans death but to have the death of angela bassets character be a central plot beat was just a bridge too far for me

i think of it in relation to the mcu spiderman movies far from home had tony starks death as a central element to the story and no way home had aunt mays death as the big 2nd act plot twist this movie kind of tries to do both these things and it just ends up being a bummer of a film because of it

between opening in media res to tchalla dying the musicless mcu title card the two funerals throughout the course of the picture and the stinger being about grief this flick just had too much death for me i needed more levity i needed more mbaku 

dont get me wrong i  loved this movie ryan coogler doesnt make bad films i just dont know if im going to watch it again any time soon",2022-11-12 05:11:35
"girl in the suit looked more like a bootleg iron man or mega man from the nintendo games they wrong for putting her in that thing 

but besides the end the movie was pretty boring i had no interest to see the new avatar movie but they forced them into this movie along with a spin off of aqua man",2022-11-12 16:42:54
"it was hard for me to watch this with shuri somewhat being the lead i guess i just dont like her she was quirky from the beginning and it was fine as a side character next to chadwick but her being the main character ugh i just was not feeling it


everyone else was doing a better job okoye amazing ramonda what a great queen nakia did not expect how much i missed her until now 

the music was also good as well",2022-11-12 17:29:44
"i thought the first movie was very special it came at a time and place that can never be replicated i like this movie but the 1st one felt like something special that could never be replicated the feeling of pride when we first saw wakanda for example

this one was still good overall i think it suffered some worse pacing issues than the 1st one but i still enjoyed it",2022-11-12 18:36:56
lot of thoughts about this movie how well it handled ideas of grief and coping with loss how badass namor is but my prevailing thought leaving the theater is lupita nyong’o respectfully,2022-11-13 03:41:34
bro they gave namor just the right amount of douchebaggery he needed he was perfectly reasonable for a decent amount of time,2022-11-13 05:55:59

"i loved 95 of the movie i needed way more namor on screen but there is one thing that felt like a raisin in my chocolate chip cookie

shuris change of heart felt too rushed her path towards wanting revenge was well shown and explained but i felt like her not killing namor came out of nowhere after a miniscule message from her mother i understand the decision of not adding a digital fake tchalla good decision but i needed a longer emotional talk with the queen i didnt sense any mental tug of war on her mind about being noble and her vengeful side during the film",2022-11-16 05:17:41
"good movie 810

just a few things that itch me

 its almost as if it wasnt part of the marvel universe no nonwakandan faces seen or mourned tchalla not even out side of wakanda other than our fav coloniser no mention of another characters other than papa thanos

 wakanda world building  as a nation it is a mess queen seems to be head intelligencequeencommander literally controlling ships by hand  a very weak controlling structure all in all and the nation is visually depicted with depth but not in dialogue or story telling ques

 some plot points didnt make sense but they are forgivable

by the time we met namor properly my pal turned to me and asked if im enjoying this something he never does then he informed me it was over an hour in the punch of realising there was so much more film to endure just killed me

for all the talk of imminent war coming to wakanda from the world they sat on their arses and did  all

the person who made this machine made it from parts found in a junkyard oh that must be ironheart considering they announced her series a while back hey ironhearts in trouble well shes obviously going to be fine since shes in the future lineup

we had no black panther to protect us shiri has 2 suits of midnight angel plus assists riris suit in the space of days it seemed 

shuri  ai cant replicate the heart shaped herb which is already a   name using samples but adding a different plants dna along with her brothers somehow solves it

if she can print a  herb that only grows in vibranium enriched soil why cant she just dissect tchalla and remove whatever is causing him issues then replace said tissue with something printed

and  iff with that mid credits scene

many more issues that i really cant be bothered trying to recall

the movie was brimming with great ideas but terrible execution and some really shoddy acting riri williams was perhaps the single most unlikableunbelievable character i think they have ever put on screen and the armored suits at the end looked simply ridiculous funny enough i thought the same things about the first black panther movie which also had very poor execution i’m thinking that ryan coogler is simply not the right type of director for these movies,2022-11-11 12:44:27
the good reviews from critics and audiences is kind of surprising because the script is utter  but i guess if a marvel movie is fun it gets a pass spiderman no way home is another example,2022-11-15 05:49:18

boring should’ve recast t’challa 510 wakanda whatever,2022-11-11 18:35:47
"this was insanely boring  and so lacking of any emotion that its honestly jarring i was really expecting something different here but no

there was even a scene where okoye and nakia start to talk about what happened when tchalla died and its suddenly cut short by a big flood action set piece  what a waste

and wow iron hearts suit was the ugliest thing i have seen so far same with the midnight angel suits",2022-11-11 22:08:16
"wakanda forever more like wakanda whatever ¯¯

they should have recast the lead it wouldnt be that big a deal and it would close up the hole left in the film 

the glimpse of namors underwater empire was all too brief 

join me in my conquest of the surface world or youll be the first to fall is pretty dumb if wakanda can repel foreign interlopers terrestrial or otherwise then namors people can do it twice as easily given their aquatic nature and vibranium assets or just let rising sea levels do it for them or they could have defeated the surface dwellers before the industrial age set in given their prowess 

siren song luring soldiers to jump overboard was neat 

wakanda boat was kind of whack youd think theyd have something bigger or a hovercraft or   their own version of a helicarrier the mining ship at the start of the film was more impressive

by the time namor uttered his catchphrase i had forgotten he had one 

bilbo baggins abuse continues and mounts 

iron heart suits wakandan upgrade made her look like a glossy power ranger but it was way better looking than the wakandan power armor riris to catch a predator drone ascent was a neat callback to ironman swapping icing for lack of oxygen 

the pageantry of wakandan fashion continues no points for accuracy but it looks good on camera 

strong performances from the cast redeem some of the films bloated runtime 

i can see them doing a son of the black panther sequel with a grown up toussaint coming home to claim his birthright that means either waiting a dozen years or so or doing a mcu wide time jump forward at some point to age him up to adulthood that depends on the success of this film and its merch the predominantly female cast makes marketing to boys a more difficult prospect and disney has scaled down their offerings to this effect its the same mistake made by young justice they can and should make umbrellas backpacks lunchboxes and whatever with the characters images and market them to girls which was unfortunately a missed opportunity for yj and was one of the reasons it got cancelled the first time after two seasons",2022-11-16 17:51:55

"it was okay 

like everyone else pointed out the worst part of the movie are all the actual “marvel” parts 

i was most interested when it was just about grieving and namor was dope 

all the other marvel tie ins and the big fight at the end had me kinda bored also i don’t know what the stakes are when shuri is stabbed and effectively left for dead then the next minute waving at everyone from an airship 

also letitia didn’t give the strongest performance it felt like a kid giving an impression of an angry teenager punches wall “ah i’m so angry at my parents aaaaah” wasn’t the worst but didn’t feel as strong as a lot of other entries

"the plot of the movie was pointless conflict for nothing i see no reason why he needed to threaten wakanda


it also didnt explain how those blue people could be healed by words when they received mortal wounds but then namor couldnt heal that other lady",2022-11-13 05:01:15
“midkanda bored forever” is a better title for this movie,2022-11-17 02:38:30
why wouldn’t he want his son to grow up in wakanda literally the best country in the world,2022-11-11 03:19:52
am i the only one that finds the wakandan accents silly and tiresome  wish they were less pronounced softer sounding  kind of makes it hard to take serious at times,2022-11-12 05:58:10
"this movie made not a single good decision not as a sequel and certainly not as a movie on its own what an absolut mess of a script 

but even worse the first movie had so many likeable and perfect fitting characters to fill in as the new black panther why would you pick shuri as the successor she is by far the worst choice okoye lupitas character mbaku and even the fuking queen would have made more sense than shuri who makes those baffling decisions can any idiot write a script nowadays

also  disney for forcing a second shuri copy i to this movie they are the exact same characterwhy just let shuri get a super suit and be her own thing that actually fits the character for  sake

im sorry but this ruined the movie and the character for me",2022-11-14 08:18:00
410 for me some of the action scenes were very poorly directed i was surprised because i really enjoyed the director’s previous work with fruitvale station and creed,2022-11-11 15:06:23
"anyone know how shuri learned to fight i mean the plant increased her strength so i get that but it doesnt make a person instantly know how to fight

we never saw any evidence shuri could fight up until this point and then suddenly with no explanation she is incredible at it just found it a bit odd",2022-11-11 15:09:48
"heres my problem with the movie

my one problem is namor namor in the comics was atlantean not mayan also his power level is beyond that of 10 black panthers in the comics he constantly fights with the entire fantastic four team which includes the thing and his power level is that of the hulk and thor he has even fought against dr doom black panther at best is captain america level which is nowhere even near as agile or strong as spiderman",2022-11-12 17:03:41
had to say this is the worst mcu movie 90 of it was just pointless dialogue… the presence of characters apart from namor and ramonda are pretty weak there are so many scenes that the movie try to make me sympathise with shuri but i simply couldn’t… pretty weak movie overall,2022-11-14 15:35:51
i am disappointed wakanda forever was absolutely terrible it was literally so bad i burst out laughing near the end fight on the ship,2022-11-15 03:04:04
this movie was all over the place it was like i was watching a nat geo special and then playing a live action ocarina of time also pretty ballsy to include haiti and flooding last thing was when did she have time to rebuild a muscle car and how did a 19 year old who throws heaters at people in her dorm room know how to pilot and  people with essentially a mark suit extra points for black panther being a deadbeat dad you wanted to have your son grow up without you so he didnt have the pressure of the throne but you name him prince father of a king yeah ok,2022-11-11 21:10:53
"average movie imo the score is great the acting good i guess watched it dubbed in german so some stuff is missing here but the movie needed to completely cut the namor cut the riri stuff and show way less cia stuff or recast and do the original vision of the movie with namor 

the aftermath about t’challa needed way more time the characters arent even really growing until the last act of the movie and then its way to sudden especially with shuri to keep the namor plot even after the irl death without a recasting was not the right choice now you got aquaman light without much deph and we learn almost nothing about their society at large even his motivation is not really good enough for a movie that wanted to tackle a more serious topic in phase 1 ok in phase 4 they need to write some more lines and more background for their villains in their movies

should have made a political thriller were the internal and international politics are the main focus and where the charactersactors are the driving part of the movie like everything else its kinda in there but just not enough to make the movie about this one thing dunno if they didnt trust the cast to carry such a movie but now its just a random marvel movie where they need to rush through the movie to not only show the main story but also 2 side stories and the impact in the marvel universe in general 

bet its a hot take but i liked multiverse of madness and love and thunder more than black panther 2",2022-11-11 20:14:36
plot was all over the place felt like a lost and confused movie i can sense the writers confusion about what to do throughout very childish overall poor dialogue the first one was miles better,2022-11-13 12:07:55

"great mcu movie … but with pretty predictable plot points

the tribute to chadwick was nice and ryan coogler made the best film he could with what he had

angela bassett and  tenoch huerta were standouts of the film",2022-11-11 04:01:15
i enjoyed aquman v catwoman more than i expected…,2022-11-11 03:38:13

"anyone else think the writing was all over the place for this one did they have to do a quick rewrite after bosemans death or what

the leap in logic from killing a scientist to preserve the secret of talokan to conquer the entire world was pretty wide the reasoning behind it also makes no sense since he hated the imperialism that destroyed his ancestral lands so hes gonna stop itwith imperialism it seemed alot like recycling of killmongers motivation but atleast killmongers plan made some sense killmonger wanted to provide weapons to stage coup detats across the world to upend a status quo that he believed couldnt be changed due to the large power disparities that exist without vibranium weapons namor wanted to invade the land people he probably couldnt hold with his fish people that need water and wear armor that covers everything but their vital areas i love the designs but cmon there is somekind of mmo female bikini armor logic going on he also had like 400 yrs to invade before the guys with muskets became flying metal weapons of mass destruction and jacked to the gills with super soldier serums

also im just gonna say it the final ironheart suit looked alot like a fanfilm power ranger suit im guessing this has to do with marvels increasingly worsening reputation on being difficult to work with for animationcgi studios",2022-11-14 04:36:16
namors backstory was well done and so were all the tribute to tchalla boseman moments but otherwise this movie was a mess the justification for the fighting was incredibly flimsy making it hard to care about any of the action the dialogue was also way too expository and overwritten but that tends to be the case with most of these movies,2022-11-14 22:56:40
it’s ok  long  tries to cover too much ground which causes it to lose its focus  i suppose the best and worst that i can say about it is it wasn’t a terrible way to spend 15 bucks,2022-11-15 16:31:16

"i think its pretty good for the direction marvel has been going for the last years however there are two things that felt meh to me 

one its a good story about seeking revenge but i am tired of revenge is evol story like lets watch a character that goes through with their vengeance and then confronts the consequences idk

two its just feels to  long i mean i get why it is but its too much i really dont need a tour of the underwater city or the entire background that is so gracefully exposed to us just ugh 

x200b

ps

this is just me but whenever killmonger came into the screen i felt a little sad if they hadnt  him in the first movie he came in and instead just imprisoned him like tai lung lol this movie could be a redemption arc for him i mean black panther is dead the royal family is in shambles and theres a new threat to which wakanda is not ready for 

i dont mean making killmonger the king but forcing him to become the black panther wakanda needs to live up to the expectetions of the man that spared his life and sure then namor and killmonger could  each other in the final battle idk its just sound kinda fun lol",2022-11-17 01:04:26

just watched the movie and im disappointed didnt feel any character except namor the snobbish wakandans really really frustrated me the namor character was really refreshing and it really wasnt necessary to make a second movie in my opinion but maybe they needed it to establish namor and the talocan empire,2023-02-06 12:32:38
ok i feel seriously conflicted about mbaku as a cultural representation and would like to have a sincere and civil discussion about it let me start by saying that i love his character hes aggressive and strong but rational and reasonable hes playful but serious in a blink hes opportunistic but fiercely loyal shrewd and discerning while being a touch enigmatic hes a dependable leader to a strong people that removed themselves from wakanda and is still a close friend of the royals in wakanda seriously hes my favorite character all that said i still cringe a bit at his portrayal because hes also one of the only ones that makes monkey noises and i thought we werent supposed to depict or portray black people as primates because that is a significant racist trope no disrespect intended to anyone im just trying to make sense of it i understand the apes significance in this context and the hanuman worship even though they allegedly had to censor that detail for india aspects of his tribe but still  thats really hard to reconcile with the social guidelines that have been firmly enforced and reiterated by black activists and hollywood throughout my life but i also understand that wakanda is really just a generalized africa blend seen through a western lens it still just feels weird to have that be acceptable situationally,2023-02-06 16:22:24
"the funeral scene for tchalla was beautiful and actually had me sobbing it did seem a bit weird though understandable that there was no big emotional sendoff for the queen though

id rank this just above thors lost world",2023-02-06 18:52:28
"i hate to say this but the movie was pretty bad

the bad

it was boring amateurish cringey at times and even though it was supposed to be a blockbuster if felt low budget it felt low stakes no sense of anyone outside the 2 factions being in any danger namors motivation was weak now theres wakandan iron man suits what ironheart was wasted to many callbacks to previous movies hardly original

the good

namor was ok micheal b jordan good

i doubt it breaks 800 million",2022-11-11 23:54:33
"quite possibly the worst mcu movie an extreme simple story that gets treated like a shakespearean drama with endless dialogues that never lead to anywhere besides even more boring dialogues poor action besides the military ship sequence extremely bad use of music with at least three sequences that felt like music videos and most importantly none of the main characters can lead the movie let alone shuri who was the most boring of all namor introduction was superb but ended up being villain of the week plus his retconned origin was lame as 
even the bloody mid credits scene was more babble

boring unexciting simplistic yet pompous at the same time with poor music choices and a lead character that cant be a lead avoid",2022-11-12 23:16:41
the movie was too long and i couldn’t help but feel like the wakandans were the villains here i was rooting for the blue people the whole time,2022-11-11 09:42:13
i can’t remember the last time marveldisney made a serious mcu film without cramming jokes in every scene it’s refreshing brings me back to the early mcu days circa 20082012 great film i’m glad the villain wasn’t actually a villain and gave the audience good reasons as to why he did the things he did,2022-11-12 11:10:43
"what annoyed me from the start was shuri rushing to make a cure for what was affecting tchalla when in real life letitia wright is an antivaxxer it really ripped me from the emersion 

i know grief can do different things to different people but shuri just came across as unlikable for the whole movie it is safe to say i didnt like her in the first movie and i liked her even less as the lead in this

highlights were winston duke as mbaku danai gurira as okoye michaela cole as aneka and dominique thorne as riri williams 

i genuinely think okoye should have become the black panther after she was stopped of rank

there were a few glaring problems such as the ai scene and no mention of what happened to talokan or its people during the blip namor wants the surface world to burn but it was the surface world that returned half his people with no help from him

overall a solid 6 out of 10 plot wise the tributes to chadwick boseman were well done and a touching tribute",2022-11-12 17:40:06
wow what a disappointment rip chadwick sorry they did ya dirty,2022-11-13 00:26:29
"i wouldnt say it was the worst mcu movie black widow for that but i thought it was boring and way too long

 i took my son who is 7 and i was shocked to see kids younger than that to be honest he generally enjoys these movies which he has started watching this year and claims the first black panther was his favorite basically if he had to review it the whole movie was like this to him when is black panther coming 20 minutes lateris he coming whenthen the end scene when she shows upthats not the black panther thats the scientist girlyes but she is black pantheroh well you lied to me you said black panther was in this movie 

and really that is when it hit me not saying you cant make a good story without black panther but it just felt like the beginning was rushed with an automatic death to black panther yes i know they were not gonna show a cgi chadwick but i feel like not even showing him in suit laying on a table etc really didnt register to a younger audience that black panther was gone

also i feel like the whole plot of her becoming the black panther was rushed at the end they should have just introduced it mid way which i feel like they should have done and incorporated iron heart the whole subplot around iron heart seemed to cliché to make her relevant like how do they have a whole mission around her device and yet dont think to secure her before that mission even takes off",2022-11-14 21:03:16

"nowhere near as good as the first but a pretty solid sequel especially considering the original lead actor has barely been dead two years and theyve already produced something that isnt a total mess  
  
good  
 they handled bosemans death very well it was incredibly surreal to see them basically translate similar circumstances of his real death into the story but it absolutely worked  
 its a shame letitia wright is an antivax chud because she gave a great performance and itd be disingenuous to deny that  
 angela bassett was great  
 namor was a neat villain wasnt always convinced by his motives but he had great presence  
 i liked how it was a lot less funny than most mcu films they really let the dramatic scenes breathe without constantly punctuating them with quips  
 talokan and namors people were really interesting  
 killmonger cameo was great i wasnt thrilled about him returning but making him the devil on shuris shoulder was a fun idea  
 loved how quiet the ending was a lesser director wouldve drowned the montage in a corny orchestral sweep  
 rihanna song was surprisingly good  
 postcredits was really affecting itd be easy for the inclusion of a son called tchalla to feel like a cynical replacement but i think it worked well  
 ludwig score was great  
  
bad  
 its way too long this was in dire need of a tighter script or a tighter edit in the very least there are so many excess subplots and characters and the 2nd act in particular feels very saggy i wouldve been happy with almost all the everett rossvalentina scenes being cut  
 riris inclusion felt pretty forced like she came from another script entirely had no problem with the actress but she barely felt like a character here and i could just see the disney content platter cogs turning because they need to set up the ironheart show reminded me of america in doctor strange 2  some random young kid who ends up being central to the plot without much of a personality that i dont really give a  about  
 cooglers direction seemed a lot spottier than before a lot of visual storytelling moments felt really awkward and clumsy like they didnt come together in the editing room properly cutting from ramonda swimming up to the surface to her face down in the water was weird to me also namor suddenly showing up on shuris ship and being like pack it up guys just felt off especially given all the death that just occurred on both sides  
 mbaku challenging for black panther confused me a bit i thought it was meant to be a joke at first but im honestly not sure  
 wasnt totally convinced by namors motives i think him being mad at wakanda was totally fine but after that it just keeps snowballing into help me take down the outside world and it just felt quite contrived  
 some very wonky cgi namor flying around looked goofy as  as did a lot of the final ship fight and er the ironheart suit  
 lack of standout action a few cool beats but nothing that really blew me away the coverage felt very pedestrian especially in the final fight  
 midnight angel and ironheart suits looked awful  jesus  
 the  moment near the end typical  that can be easily cut for bigoted markets at least they didnt spend weeks in the press patting themselves on the back this time i guess",2022-11-11 14:35:09
this movie was okay a 6 at best,2022-11-11 14:54:22
they really went for oscar season again with this one huh bet that one scene was added just for editing did this have to be three hours long they could’ve cut all the cia stuff and most of the iron heart stuff and still would’ve had the movie 510 imo the michael b jordan surprise was the biggest save here,2022-11-11 15:49:42

"that first trailer ended up being better than the actual movie a lot of concepts shoved into what was a movie with the vibe totally off because everyone involved was still clearly mourning chadwick some good things like namor did come out of it but man are they going to regret this one in a few years its going to age really badly much like love and thunder

they should have just waited and done a recast when they were ready maybe done a totally separate sort of spinoff movie about shurri and co getting involved with a conflict with the talokans 

phase 4 has sort of been a mess",2022-11-11 18:03:27
this felt like a dc movie,2022-11-11 18:49:14
"i wanted to like it i don’t think shuri is a strong enough character or actor to carry the entire film herself her presence wasn’t inspiring and chadwick was sorely missed

the movie just kind of plodded along and lacked much excitement too long

i did like namor but his whole story just didn’t seem to mesh with the world of wakanda

the entire subplot with martin freeman and elaine also was just kind of there obviously it’s setup but why do we care

edit forgot to mention the subplot with the young chicago girl was pointless too she was just there not interesting and barely added anything the fact i forgot about it already speaks volumes",2022-11-12 08:16:13
"movie dragged a lot way too long runtime the writing was inconsistent the humor just plain bad riri williams wasnt a likable comic book character and shes no better in the movie her and okoyes suits also look power rangers level bad

its an interesting interpretation of namor but to me he doesnt live up to comic book namor who is far more insidious then again the mcu hasnt hit the mark on that for a while now the new cultural spin is interesting but this is kind of erasure of the atlantian mythos ill take what i can get i suppose 

what really just let me down was shuri becoming black panther you cant convince me that if she went through the same trials and tribulations tchalla went through to become bp she would come out on top it wouldve been an interesting moment to leverage the multiverse happenings and put michael b jordan in the role

angela basset great as always martin freeman too but he really only served to set up the thunderbolts

"this movie was such a piece of garbage i lost track of the number of plot holes in the movie before i watched it today all i read was positive reviews and i was so confused when the film ended i get that them losing chadwick was a major setback and they were forced to go back to the drawing board but what they came up with was inexcusable 

first the movie wouldve fared so much better if they stuck with fewer characters i still cant see how riri ross vel etc contributed to the plot in a significant way 

the motivations and grief expressed by the characters seem so  shallow i never once felt sad apart from momentarily feeling the characters pain when namor first comes across spanish  owners and when shuri tries to frantically save the talokan prison guard from dying 

ramonda shuri nakia okoye and riri all seemed so plastic with their acting for one i just did not buy their accents the dialogues written for them just made me cringe during every scene i dont get how the coloniser comments are funny even as an indian it just makes the wakandans look like racist  with a superiority complex 

if you liked this movie im sorry for expressing such distaste for it i wish i liked it too as im such a huge fan of the black panther and wakanda i was really looking forward to this 

marvel really needs to start putting more effort into phase 4 underneath all that cgi and spectacle is just a story that makes you want the film to end so you can leave the theatre and go home i really love the actor playing namor it was such a such a shame to see this franchise go down the this route

lastly someone needs to tell ryan coogler that its possible to express black pride without aggressively trying to  on white people i dont understand how their comments are even allowed superiority can be showcased in ways other than constantly shoving rhetoric that flexes how advanced wakandans are in every way people who are stronger and wiser dont feel the need to chest thump every passing minute this is what made the black panther such a mysterious and badass character in civil war you just knew this character wasnt to be played around with just based on how tchalla presented himself to the world",2022-12-07 20:22:31

anyone else think the acting and dialogues in many scenes were subpar for example when shuri and nakia create the liquid and it turns blue their shock looks so fake also shuri in the aircraft after trapping namor says something about being the bp and the dialogue doesnt land i also felt that the music score was out of place sometimes and didnt capture the mood accurately anyhow i didnt like this one at all black panther 1 was way better,2022-11-12 10:18:32

no visual cameos is necessary but some dialog at least",2022-11-11 07:04:42

"my experience of watching this was dampened slightly to start with as i had to queue for about 40 minutes for the imax screening i booked due to odeons 2d imax content bring corrupted they ended up not being able to fix the issue so then i had to go into the nearest screening which was scheduled for 20 minutes later which then also had ads and trailers at the beginning of course 
ive never worked in a cinema so im probably being ignorant here but i wouldve thought the content would be tested before the day of release especially for a big film like this
dont worry i didnt take out my frustration with the situation on the people at the bottom who were having to deal with customers

anyway the film has some of the usual mcu issues of having some very noticeable cgi at times and looking fairly samey to some others but for what it was i thought it was pretty good
it didnt blow me away but i liked the story and characters the beginning and closing tributes to chadwicktchalla were very moving and respectfully done and i liked how they had a cameo appearance that didnt feel cheap and worked for the story

the action was a mixed bag but i really liked the music that often accompanied and it made a difference when one pivotal fight scene had no music at all until the last moments

its a shame that from what ive heard letitia wright was a real pain in the  during the pandemic and when filming this i like her acting and her character

overall though it wasnt a groundbreaking addition to the mcu but still one i might watch again on disney or maybe bluray when the price goes down",2022-11-11 14:31:29

the backstory with namor was handled well but the whole war between them and wakanda seemed unnecessary also the cia stuff was utterly pointless and purely there to set up the next appearance of everett ross and valentina  
  
the best part of the film was the attack on the vibranium detector at the start of the movie and namors subsequent reveal  
  
at the end of the day the film had two goals which it achieved paying tribute to chadwicktchalla and moving the story forward in wakanda",2022-11-11 23:30:12
the character design and details of the people of talokan was fantastic every time namora and hammer head dude were on screen i couldn’t take my eyes off them everything to do with namor and talokan was perfect so happy they didn’t  him,2022-11-11 23:36:16
"the cia is the worst part of the movie just like in the first one

angela bassett was the standout here hats off to the makeup and costume department",2022-11-12 01:26:35
what was the song when t’challa’s funeral procession was surrounded by lot of folks dancing,2022-11-12 01:53:38
"never read the comics or have any background in the marvel universe 

swore that nemo was supposed to be hermes for most of the beginning of the move",2022-11-12 03:17:46
"
everything after the first dr strange i had to watch in japan and its always dead silent the exception was when i went to black panther 1 and the screening was predominantly non japanese that being said its no surprise that my screening of black panther 2 was also dead silent the entire time

completely forgot that clapping and cheering during a marvel movie has been such a regular and accepted thing",2022-11-12 03:20:41
pretty solid follow up given the tragic circumstances but i really feel like this would have been better served as a series,2022-11-12 03:40:22
was kind of like people who tell you at thanksgiving that if you have enough side dishes you don’t need a main felt like it was missing a main lead  shuri didn’t do it for me sorry  it’s ok to not give the movie 4 stars it’s just meh,2022-11-12 06:38:38
i went in to the movie pretty blind and as soon as i saw the blue underwater people i thought “james cameron is gonna be ”,2022-11-12 17:52:48
ive seen a lot of people really liking twinkle toes and i just dont get it killmonger actually wanted to do something about injustice this guy just wants to hide away it was a big step back in my opinion,2022-11-12 19:53:20
"it was more emotional than exciting for me i didnt like how shuri didnt have a change of heart until the very end and if namor was going to agree to be an ally anyway why didnt he do it earlier and it was a gut punch seeing nakias son but did she just leave him in haiti

also did i see kamaru usman",2022-11-12 20:33:06
question would you say is imax or dolby worth paying extra,2022-11-12 21:05:53
cada dia me despierto y empiezo a romper solo es el chico sin amor,2022-11-12 21:32:46
"loved everything about namor and the talokan lore until they had to give namor typical dumb supervillain plans they did an amazing job paying tribute to chadwick the killmonger cameo was really well done

this movie is way way too long though there were multiple times i could literally feel the length which is never a good sign hated everything about ironheartriri williams everything about her character felt exactly like a copy paste of america chavez from mom also was not a fan of the cia subplot and even shuri’s character to extent it’s not her fault that she’s in this position obviously but i just don’t think letitia wright is a strong enough actress to be the 1 protagonist for a franchise i felt like they were building up to either okoye or nakia taking the bp mantle and then it just doesn’t happen

and  how are marvel getting worse and worse with suits as time passes ",2022-11-12 21:51:25
found myself watching for namor and hope they don’t do the classic villain to 100  the future movies lol fairly average marvel movie and had fun rip chadwick it would have been a much better movie with you,2022-11-12 23:12:10
"i liked the film over all okoye is just all round badass
our experience was ruined by a row of rowdy people talking taking their phones out and throwing stuff sweets and fried chicken of all things",2022-11-12 23:44:22
thought it was pretty good a tad boring tho what was the point of the fbi stuff,2022-11-12 23:48:03
i gotta say namor was an ice cold  killer,2022-11-13 00:30:06
the scene where ramunda was holding tchallas mask in the ship with okoye mirrors that one scene from the first black panther where tchalla prepares for a mission,2022-11-13 02:22:14
really enjoyed this movie but  this just makes me even more sad at just how tragic chadwicks passing was and what great performances we were robbed from shuri did a decent job at fulfilling the mantle but his presence was definitely missed from the story,2022-11-13 04:15:38
"im kinda confused as to who is in charge now

they leave it open that mbaku is challenging for the thronebut i thought only the black panther fought for the throne so our black panther doesnt have to fight for her role but the kingqueen does  that doesnt make any sense and if this is the case why didnt the queen have to fight for her throne",2022-11-14 04:01:58
namor was giving off mr nimbus vibes ,2022-11-14 09:21:18
i was getting major kotal kahn vibes from namor and his warriors even the sound effects were very mortal kombat esque  that scene on the bridge was the standout for me for sure,2022-11-15 02:51:13
i simply loved this new origin of namor the submariner and while we dont see much of his undersea world what we do get is pretty impressive  his warriors are certainly cool looking and badass not to mention the fact that they ride killer whales  but where the character does get tripped up is in his rock  attempts at diplomacy and tactics you dont declare join us in destroying the surface world or die as thats not really going to get you anywhere with a country as prideful as wakanda  then you attack and  their bloody queen and expect more threats will work at that point they should have continued the attack instead of giving wakanda time to regroup and retaliate,2022-11-16 03:56:00
my only issue is queen ramonda dying hasnt shuri lost enough,2022-11-16 05:58:07
"enjoyed the movie  thought it was better than the first one

however i really would be interested to see what the draft of this movie looked like before chadwick died  what all the changes were  theyve talked about it having a lot to do with him missing out on things during the blip  

anyway the characters were great all around  angela basset was just so powerful i loved her un speech putting those french asshats in their place im mad shes gone 

the cia storylines was lame  i know they have to keep shoe horning val because the thunderbolts but bleh they had too many scenes i guess martin freeman lives in wakanda now  he can take buckys house haha

the fight scenes were great  except for the one at the end where theyre all standing on a floating slow moving barge with no defences  and that midnight angel suit was awful  but kinda close to what the masks look like in the comics

the character intereactions were great 

riri should be a great addition to the mcu and i loook forward to seeing ironheart 

i was very much expecting nakia to have been pregnant  im sure most people did  but to then call the boy tchalla as well  cmon son  we knew they were going to replace chadwick for bp3 but this way haha ok  the only problem is most of the mcu movies are happening around the same time so i dont know how theyll be able to get this child into the suit without a massive time jump that would separate bp3 from the rest of the mcu 

i love what they did with namor  i love seeing mutants popping up into the mcu now   hope his wing grows back

the killmonger cameo was not expected but i dug it  

finally the memorial to chadwick inthe marvel logo was great

its just great to be able to sit empty theater and enjoy movies like this",2022-11-16 06:11:14
"that suit of okoyes was ridiculous  interesting design for sure

not a good as bp1 because of chadwick but still good imo",2022-11-16 13:11:21
we are just going to skim over this movie introducing real actual mutants to the mcu,2022-11-16 13:59:26
i have to say this felt like two different movies that got thrown together on one hand one of those was  phenomenal on the other…not so much,2022-11-17 07:50:53
lol they spare no police lives during this movie police bad,2022-11-18 05:07:43
"anyone know what the queen was going to
say about tchalla when neymor interrupted them next to the lake",2022-11-20 09:29:58
"i didnt like the first bp went in with no expectations even wanting to dislike it but i was pleasantly surprised i think its because i saw it as more of a fantasy genre movie between two fantasy civilizations and not a marvel movie

i really disliked the riri williams plot device they didnt have to bring her in at all they couldve reworked the vibranium finder plot with someone else every time her ironheart was on screen i was ripped out of the movie and was reminded oh im watching a marvel movie and not this cool conflict between two interesting civilizations

the cia subplot eh shouldve been cut too and reworked",2022-11-20 15:27:17
"what was the point of the rare jellyfish from the beginning that the divers saw before being attacked was it all to foreshadow namor
breathing like a jellyfish",2022-11-21 17:45:41
i didn’t know who would end up being the new bp but when riri said “can i get some of that” i thought it was foreshadowing i wish it were since the heartshaped herb is synthetic presumably they could print as much as they wanted wouldn’ be a great twist if riri and maybe others got bp powers as well would have certainly helped fight talokan as well,2022-11-23 14:37:46
black panther will return everyone in the cinema universally threw there hands with a what the  were  to getting clips or something of the next release this was a shock to all,2022-11-24 06:31:38
i liked the film generally but there was one particular part that i didn’t like when okoye’s rescuing the guy from the van being arrested don’t remember his name since he’s not the most important character in the movies  she makes the remark abt seeing a colonizer in chains  now she’s seen everything it makes me think abt the comment quentin made on some podcasts when he said how everyone needs to be politically correct  directorsscreenwriters even inputting part of their own political ideology now i totally get the message based on how i grew up but it dilutes the quality of the movie taking marvel jokes to a more potent level leading to not as much enjoyment personally,2022-11-26 11:48:01
on the first movie t challa drank something that made him lose his powers any chance that can also weaken namor since both of their powers came from the same source,2022-11-28 19:19:33
why does it make more sense to have muscular men hold a rope instead of mounting onto the ship,2022-12-05 02:56:30
my wife was like  so do they come up to the surface just to pick decorative feathers lol,2022-12-11 03:26:23
"i have several gripes after seeing this today i would love for someone to explain some of these to me in case i missed something

1 the entire conflict of the movie makes no sense the talocans want to attack wakanda for other nations hunting vibranium namor claiming its because wakanda revealed themselves but this is lliterally wrong the world has been hunting vibranium long before they revealed themselves to the point the events partially in the first film were sparked by it namor immediately soured the allyship by wrongly accusing them and attacking them instead of just coming forward and saying hey we are a nation in the same boat wanna help each other

2 killing riri was also overly hostile even if she was the only way for the surface to track vibranium unlikely once she made the first machine going straight to killing her makes no sense he could have just reached out and explainedthreatened her not to make it again

3 the war itself also didnt make sense they make it seem like it would be one sided for either let alone in favor of the talocans as far as war tech goes the wakandas in previous films have been shown to be way more technologically advanced than them with the most advanced thing the talocans have being their water bombs none of what they do should have worked on wakanda aside from the siren thing",2022-12-26 03:06:07
i noticed when nakia takes shuri and riri back to wakanda that she didnt bring a capsule for them how did they survive getting out of talokan when shuri tells namor she wants to see it he says your blood will become toxic and the pressure of the ocean will crush every bone in your bodyor we have a suit as much as i love his delivery of that line it makes me wonder how they got out i imagine where they were being kept it was more like a way point but wouldnt it still pretty deep is that why they didnt show them being taken there just waking up there,2023-01-11 16:59:11
"they did a willheim sp scream in thisthats all you need to know

the pacing toois glacial and the cuts are so weird to me",2023-01-31 06:52:30
i was going to write a long list but i cant be arsed so ill just write meh instead,2023-02-01 11:47:35
i’m confused when you committed  you have to be on trial nemor so wakanda is a unconstitutional monarchy with battles to death elections and which has not ratified the united nations  laws and keep africa in a kind middle age stage  disney ,2023-02-01 21:57:54
i know im late to the game but how does namor talk underwater to shuri when shes in the bodysuit  it doesnt seem like the other underwater inhabitants talk,2023-02-01 22:54:36
"i have to say the comments here are some of the wittiest and funniest i have ever read in a reddit a joy to read and they truly describe and critique the film 

personally i am not happy we lose the entire atlantis thread here i am not sure if that is an attempt to be cooler with surviving aztecs or because aquaman has already done it namor always seemed derivative though honestly i don’t know who did it first",2023-02-01 23:45:37
despite the source material i would have bet cash money they would have made lupita nyongo the new black panther,2023-02-03 02:35:15
any idea why the images are all purple and green in the movie ,2023-02-05 09:37:47
i thought it was alright bit long namor was great the underwater scene was really nice mbaku was a very string character riri was very poorly forced,2023-02-07 04:16:54
"watched this the other day and really enjoyed it aside from it being a little too long and the cgi looking like 

in terms of the midcredits scene though  have they just set up a house of the dragonesque succession crisis for bp3",2023-02-10 12:20:13
"lets talk about the marvel movie black panther wakanda forever the most recent black panther movie as both a content creator and consumer and as a christian i think its very important to keep in touch with the current and relevant trends in the entertainment industry   
  
so lets discuss a popular current and relevant movie  
  
the film opened with one of the most poignant and wellcrafted displays of grief and mourning ive seen in cinema to date following the death of the former black panther actor chadwick boseman the film chose to honor him in a way that struck me as both truthful and inspiring the first scene of the movie was dedicated to the funeral of king tchalla after he succumbed to a mysterious illness the acting was impactful and heartfelt and when combined with the skillful writing and cinematography displayed in the movie the effect was an incredibly impactful yet uplifting portrayal of loss in the scene tchallas family notably his mother queen ramonda his sister princess shuri and a close family friend nkoye seen as a pallbearer in the funeral procession all wear white from head to toe there is joyful singing and dancing accompanying tchalla to his final resting place in a clear celebration of his life and dignity the scene has a striking contrast between the crestfallen and grieving faces of some and the peaceful and joyous faces of others while his closer family struggles to deal with the loss tchallas former subjects honor his memory and his great deeds by lifting up their voices and choreographing beautiful dances   
  
the scene is such a powerful and skillfully crafted testament to the dignity and sanctity of life that is firmly rooted in reality despite its fictional nature the acting is so poignant and well done that the movie has the effect of taking a very real and sacred human emotion and exemplifying it by means of a fictional world culture and characters   
  
dont let me throw you off with my initial description of the movie though following the initial heartwrenching first scenes the rest of the movie is wellwritten wellproduced and lifts the mood considerably theres a particular scene where shuri and nkoye are sent to extract a young scientist riri from an american college to wakanda for her safety and the writing is incredibly realistic and humorous marvel movies can be prone to tonedeafness but this scene was a fantastic example of what marvel is still capable of with a team of decent writers i wont spoil it for you but suffice it to say that the dialogue in that scene and in several other scenes of the movie was a refreshing display of balance and realism

with this said the main criticism ive heard for this film is that the writing and development of dominique thornes character was a little rushed and sloppy while i dont personally have a problem with it and really enjoyed the actresss humor and casualgenius type i do agree that the writers could have done better and i think it is important both for the audience and the actors marvel hires to do them justice by writing wellthought out and skillfullydeveloped roles for them 

besides this minor flaw i found the movie to be enjoyable and reminiscent of marvels glory days although after the release of shehulk one wonders if marvels golden era truly died with stan lee   
  
when you watch the movie be sure to stick around for the credits scene the only credit scene in this most recent marvel movie has one of my favorite spoilers to date it is one of the most stunning uplifting displays of hope the sanctity of human life and the healing qualities of time and trust that i have ever seen in a marvel movie it clearly shows the attitude of the writing team for this movie and how they chose in this instance to approach the topic of life with a truthful uplifting and inspiring mindset 

if you werent planning on watching this movie or were concerned that it would be a tryhard or politicallybiased film or were simply not interested in the black panther franchise without its hero chadwick boseman i would encourage you to give the film a chance with an open mind 

ultimately the movie was a heartfelt tribute to the beloved former black panther actor and did a passable if not enjoyable job of passing the torch and continuing the legacy of one of marvels classic heroes",2023-03-21 20:35:42
"i can’t get my head around how shuri and namor flew back on a ship at the end 

wasn’t that thing destroyed by namors vib spear",2023-05-06 21:51:55
this is one of the more boring mcu films ive seen does it pick up in the second half,2023-05-23 18:05:53
i did not like the way queen ramonda treated okoye  shes a warrior who gave everything to her country and then she was shamed and dismissed,2022-11-11 03:17:00
pretty much a total mess that’s  as all  and cut together horrifically thought a lot of the emotional beats were good and the funeral scene was excellent otherwise shocked by how disgustingly  the underwater stuff was ironic considering the avatar trailer before the movie started had some of the most gorgeous water cinematography i’ve ever seen and the action was nearly indecipherable and cg was awful,2022-11-12 02:46:53
i wasnt a big fan of the soundtrack choices every time that chook chook chook chook sound started up it totally took me out of the scene,2022-11-11 03:12:48
"what annoyed me from the start was shuri rushing to make a cure for what was affecting tchalla when in real life letitia wright is an antivaxxer it really ripped me from the emersion 

i know grief can do different things to different people but shuri just came across as unlikable for the whole movie it is safe to say i didnt like her in the first movie and i liked her even less as the lead in this

highlights were winston duke as mbaku danai gurira as okoye michaela cole as aneka and dominique thorne as riri williams 

i genuinely think okoye should have become the black panther after she was stopped of rank

there were a few glaring problems such as the ai scene and no mention of what happened to talokan or its people during the blip namor wants the surface world to burn but it was the surface world that returned half his people with no help from him

overall a solid 6 out of 10 plot wise the tributes to chadwick boseman were well done and a touching tribute",2022-11-12 17:40:00
"to me this didn’t feel like a proper marvel film it was ‘avatar featuring marvel’ it felt like seeing james cameron’s film from the point of view of the antiheroes

oh and i also thought it was ‘free  35’ with shamu’s cameo in the fight scenes",2022-11-11 10:19:23
"overall a very good film my wife said to me at the end of the first act that it was depressing but i feel like it needed a somber tone to set up that finale  away all the explosions and this is a movie about faith in a way similar to love and thunder shuri represents youth  when youre young and aspiring you think youre so smart and all the talk of the ancestral plane and the wisdom of the elders and her brothers spirit being with them is nonsense scientifically impossible as you age a bit get some wisdom and experience thats when you can realize that sometimes the science of traditions and faith arent as important and sometimes you really do feel your loved one rocking you gently mbaku as well devoted as he is to his gorilla  he ages into a wise elder and his faith in his people and his ancestors is strong the atlanteans too are strong in their faith  namor is their feathered  and protector and ultimately he sets them up to win the war by ensuring wakanda will rely on them in the future all of that pays off in the final moments with shuri on that beach she doesnt abandon science but realizes it can coexist with faith

seeing mbaku take a more subtle advisor role while not visually thrilling was great growth for him he had been one of my favorites from the first movie and his growth to not only trust but love and lead the other tribes was satisfying he was comic relief at times and used to show the strength of namor during the flooding of wakanda but he had the wisest words of any of the elders in wanting to not give in to namor ultimately hes proven right as namors goal after their battle is to do exactly what mbaku warned of he will want more

the return of killmonger was handled decently but very understated to the point that some may have missed the point shuri was so certain that it had failed because that was the ancestral plane to her for tchalla his was on an open savanna his father clad in a robe giving sage loving advisement for killmonger his was in that apartment being worked up by his father for shuri at the time her faith was weak killmonger was her doubt in the mumbo jumbo in herself in her motivations the ancestral plane gave her what she needed as a warning to not be killmonger to not let vengeance win

my last point is a bit tongue in cheek but i felt like tchallas son was weirdly named wouldnt it be tchama instead if tchalla jr seems from tchalla and killmonger that the naming convention is to take the fathers named and change the last consonant just feels like marvel is trying to set up to have tchalla still be in the mcu through a quiet recast",2022-11-11 13:40:21
"probably going to get  on for this but did anyone else think the midcredit scene was useless and nothing but pandering

black panther has a kid great hes too young to show up in any movies minus a time jump and it didnt set up the next phase of the mcu at all thats also ignoring the question of  did black panther have  lol",2022-11-11 14:07:36
letitia wright in this was like christian laettner on the dream team completely outclassed except in this case they decided to make this dope the center of the movie,2022-11-11 18:04:46
this entire movie happens because this genius scientist decided to make a vibranium tracking device just so she couldprove her professor wrong here is something that could endanger my life create a power struggle among nations and lead to a potential war but i need my validation from this teacher,2022-11-13 04:11:55
"really enjoyed the movie

23rds of the super suits in the finale looked atrocious i dunno what marvel is doing especially since the costume design is otherwise exceptional",2022-11-14 16:57:05
“bury your dead mourn your loses you are the queen now” is such a cold line,2022-11-14 18:44:46
this feels like the first marvel movie in a while that was taken seriously and it was so refreshing no corny jokes no “he’s right behind me isn’t he” a villain with some depth and serious strength everything was done with great pacing and weight i will say iron hearts inclusion definitely felt pushed by kevin but other than her character this is hands down a top 10 marvel movie,2022-11-15 14:39:36
"the movie was ok for a little bit but  overall i wanted to see a superhero movie but instead i was forcefed some  evil “aquaman and hermes had a child” rip off with hardly legible plot line that lacked any meaningful resolution or relation to the larger marvel universe 

also  them for making us think we were gonna see black panther two i’ve realized half way through why the film is called “wakanda forever”…because it goes on forever about wakanda and not at all about black panther 

this movie was better than eternals black widow and she hulk but worse than everything else they made the bar was set so high but the movie hardly beat the worst movies on marvel’s track record 

movies i would rather have watched than this include such flops as green lantern birds of prey suicide squad 1 and 2 justice league original edit or the worst siendfield episode on repeat for 25 hours",2022-11-17 01:00:34
"namor jumping through the air reminded me of sanji lol sneak peak of the one piece live action

namor was fantastic and had some amazing moments

and echoing others here yeah the blue suit was awful

i get the ultimate goal was to get namor but man fighting the fish people in the ocean on a boat was so dumb

fight scenes left a lot to be desired

editing was really bad at times with scenes cutting way too hard

overall it was ok yeah they shouldve recast tchalla the movie broadly wouldve still worked",2022-11-11 04:01:35
trailers made this actually seem like a more serious film in the mcu nope just another by the numbers installment,2022-11-12 02:20:50
holy  did that silent allchadwick opening sequence hit me like a ton of bricks,2022-11-11 04:03:44
when the original black panther came out it was unlike any other super hero movie in my opinion but black panther wakanda forever felt like…any other super hero movie aside from a few great moments i was left feeling a bit meh overall,2022-11-11 17:31:12
please fast forward to whatever movie has wakanda and the talokan team up because lawd that alliance however shortlived will be a sight to behold,2022-11-11 17:46:17
"so i have two main beefs with this film  the first is why we’re none of the avengers at tchallas funeral  especially bucky he’s the white wolf and lived in wakanda  tchalla fought along side these guys in the biggest battle ever yet none of them show up  

the second is he had a kid…he had a kid and no one but three people knew he existed  not even shuri  he’s the king of wakanda and no one knew the king had a freaking son  not even his own sister  he was old enough that tchalla knew him and told them not to go to the funeral  sorry that’s just ugh i can’t with that",2022-11-12 01:42:18
there was a group of ladies in front of us at the movies who was talking loudly threw the entire movie all 3 hours ended up telling a manager who gave us free tickets but that was unbelievable it’s like they thought they were at home watching tv or some ,2022-11-12 04:40:21
"the opening scene was super jarring with the panic as tchalas heart rate dropped for a character just off screen that we as the audience know is doomed and it was very sudden and painful and strange and surreal like chadwicks death was i think for a number of people 


honestly though while it had many good moments overall i felt like this movie needed editing both in terms of scenes and script the first black panther also raised the bar for wardrobe and costume some of the suits here why  to be like toys to sell some really weird choices all of the cia scenes needed to be gone too",2022-11-13 08:33:49
the suits they made for okoye and the ironheart suit looked like something straight out of the cw truly hideous and poorly done,2022-11-13 22:41:31
"super average and lacked the style of the first one 

	beaming up the coffin looked goofy they should’ve went with a traditional burial
	bunch of  looking mech suits ironheart’s included
	martin freeman for no reason
	namor showing the beauty of his kingdom and people and then revealing he wants to wage war on innocent nations
	namor only having the upper hand when he can fly like how many other characters
	namor beat by shuri without any training whatsoever 
	namor and black panther come from plants
	shuri jumping over namor when he ducked looked unintentionally hilarious 
	entire climax fight was unexciting and awkwardly staged on a weird ship
	“wakanda forever” by the 10 wakandans left alive on the ship lol
	okoye’s mask coming off for her to say a oneliner and then immediately covering her face again before she attacked
	shuri looked super unconvincing as a skinny black panther
	end credits scene hey shuri this is your replacement",2022-11-13 23:46:16
there is a good movie trying to crawl its way out of the dirt but it’s repeatedly beaten down by a shovel and kept from coming back alive horrendous visual and audio effects a decent villain  origin story and theme kept the film passable good acting for a marvel film also it’s fun to try and guess which background actors letitia wright was showing anti vax youtube videos to on set,2022-11-26 03:19:33
namor was so  cool,2022-11-11 08:03:07
why does this movie have basically mexicans v blacks it would have been amazing if they came together,2022-11-13 23:12:06
namor’s throne room scene was awesome the rest of the 2 hrs and 40 mins was a snoozer,2022-11-11 05:10:42
"much better movie than the first wakanda felt more like a place here rather than a concept 

side characters always a treat with okoye being my favorite her new costume suuuuuuuuuck

movie was waaaaaay to long i dont know what i would cut but dang felt like 3 hours 

the actresses for shuri and the queen were phenomenal in this movie shuri had such a cool arc and i like her build she makes for an interesting black panther one who you would think would be silly and gadget focus but was rather vengeful and vicious 

i like riri williams to not a stand out by any means but i look forward to see her iron man armor in a movie in the future 

also they pick the cutest  child for tchalla junior my goodness was he adorable 

another negative would be namor the character was cool but the actor did nothing for me could he replaced with anyone and it would had left the same impression",2022-11-13 01:26:11
"why did namor want to  the scientist she already created the machine  or others used her design killing her solves nothing they can destroy the machine but they will just duplicate the way to detect vibranium 

the catalyst to go to war shouldn’t have been her it should’ve been some other “colonizer” event caused from a different country",2022-11-11 03:30:23
loved the film but  the cgi on the new suits was terrible,2022-11-11 04:38:52
"i think it’s ok considering the loss of chadwick this was good but nothing holds up comparing to the original bp everything from the main character the villain the story the action and even the music is a let down from the original 

the two biggest disappointment is the actress portraying shuri she was scene stealing and lights up the screen in the original bp but she just can’t carry the title role the big villain is forgettable it’s understandable that the  killmonger was going to be one of the absolute best but nemor was just boring and feels like a token villain

i also have problem with why they barely used the black panther theme music it was so inspiring and so awesome 

overall good enough but disappointed given the anticipation",2022-11-11 06:08:13
this movie turned into bubblegum crisis wakanda 2022,2022-11-11 09:19:19
nando v movies made a great point in that namor was kind of a more accurate black adam than black adam he was murdering people left and right to protect his people morality be damned,2022-11-11 12:04:29
i wanted angela bassett to take over the mantle of black panther,2022-11-11 12:48:21
we finally got a hero to represent us  a us hispanic,2022-11-11 14:21:36
"i really enjoyed the movie on the high end of phase 4 content

i’d be interested to see what the original draft of the movie was vs this final product you can feel how they used a lot of the first version of the film but then tried to fill in the missing t’challa spots 

i still think the extreme reaction against recasting was blown out of proportion shuri had a sick fighting style and suit and i’m assuming 10 years from now t’challa jr will be bp

i assumed after secret wars we would be getting essentially a universe reset with major players being recast but this movie seemed like it’s laying groundwork for the future",2022-11-11 14:32:12
namor fits with the illuminati my ,2022-11-11 20:03:57
easily one of my favorite mcu movies and its mostly because of namor,2022-11-11 23:49:15
one thing i appreciated is that it didnt take the mcu route of having some cheesy selfaware comment about namors feet wings looking silly they did look silly but the movie takes them seriously and it makes him a more compelling villain because of it and of course adds weight to a wing being ripped off,2022-11-12 02:54:28
"good movie welldirected and great action

few things  

1 wakanda is in east africa no and namors people were in mexico youre telling me they were casually traveling over thousands of miles of ocean and then thousands of miles of land to get to east africa lol

2 so ramonda knew nakia had her grandsonbut recruited her to go on a dangerous mission to rescue shuri 

3 did tchalla not go through shuris arc in captain america 3",2022-11-12 03:09:33
something tells me theyre going to change namor from being  tier  for sue storm and navigate that over to him  for shuri because i think having a latinoindigenous man  rather creepily over white women isnt going to fly  it was weird in the comics when he was a white guy lol,2022-11-12 05:23:52
regarding no one knowing about his son no black panther wouldnt have kept it secreti think they wanted us to think about how chadwick kept his illness from everyone he was an extremely private person and i do think there are still feelings among many as to why he didnt want to tell them shuri also mentioned that her brother kept his illness from her to not be allowed to say what you want to say to someone knowing their time is limited you can tell that the cast was still processing the why and of course the loss,2022-11-12 12:27:26
angela bassetts arms were so toned and muscled up that i was so sure she was going to have an action scene at some point she looked fantastic,2022-11-12 23:28:42
shoulda pushed this to 2024 to give more time to get over chadwicks death and recast,2022-11-13 02:21:40

"did anyone else notice that really odd edit when mbaku looks up only to see black panther descending from above  

ludwig gorannson continues to be one of the top composers working today  

namor was an interesting character but a lot of the film suffers from poor pacing  i wished it had a tighter script  some of the stuff with ross dragged it on plus the whole second act  it felt kind of aimless to me",2022-11-14 00:44:18
bruh the ocean battle scene they really had the doras fight like the crane corps in the great wall ,2022-11-14 03:26:43
ramonda having white hair took me out 2 times i was like wait who is this then i realized it was her without her crown thing,2022-11-14 15:13:01
is it just me or did the visual effects for wakanda look off the city always appeared kind of murky and low contrast kind of broke the immersion for me  i feel like visual effects should be better in these movies but maybe i’m just too critical,2022-11-17 00:30:31
is m’baku now the new king of wakanda that last scene with him showing up to challenge for the throne left me a little confused only because it seems shuri is going to live in haiti now so maybe she’s temporarily giving up the throne but that doesn’t seem like what her mother or t’challa would have wanted for her,2022-11-17 08:40:37
"just watched black panther wakanda forever for me it is easily one of the best mcu movies of phase 4 i really enjoyed it 

the movie has so many strengths the acting the direction the tribute to chadwick boseman namor everyone was on their agame in this movie loved especially letitia wright and angela bassett’s performance one of the most surprising things about the movie was shuri’s arc for me she was the weakest part of the first black panther movie but in this movie she truly earned the title of black panther no one can truly replace chadwick but letitia did a great job 

the best part of the movie was namor and talokan loved what ryan coogler did with them he’s so good at creating unique kingdoms and using inspirations from different cultures to make them namor was so good in this movie loved seeing his fight scenes easily the best new addition in phase 4 imo tenoch huerta did such a good job i need to see more of him playing namor his supporting cast was really good too 

my only negatives of this movie was sometimes the pacing and iron heart i understand why the movie’s runtime was so long and i think it earned it but some scenes really dragged and others went way too fast imo and iron heart was completely unneeded remove her from the movie and nothing would be missing i think the actor did okay but her character was so bland the character feel like an afterthought for me maybe it is because her role was exactly the same as america chavez in ds2 hopefully the character is better in her own show 

i would give the movie an 810",2022-11-19 18:02:27
cmon that movie was pretty weak so much unnecessary filler namor and his people were really cool though,2022-11-25 07:58:01
this entire thread packed with pathetic nitpicking of overly fed marvel fans  wild that you can’t find a basic thumbs up anywhere,2022-11-27 23:54:48
this is the first marvel movie in a long time i genuinely enjoyed and had no critiques for coming out of the theater others id know immediately something was off ever since the start of phase 4 easily one of the best marvel movies of all time you really have to dislike the comic franchise or nitpick to dislike this movie,2022-12-06 03:43:11
"man that movie was so longit just didnt want to end and it was so boring to boot  shuri black panther  you remember back in the days when games had big head cheat codes someone activated that for shuri it looked so terrible

the first one was already pretty bad but this  one feels like it could have been better but in the end just wasnt

i somewhat like namor and his first action scene in the city was the only good part in this movie buteverything else especially the wakanda stuff was ehh410 for me waste of time not even a good after credit scene to set some other movie up",2023-02-04 11:16:25
this movie sucks  and balls,2023-02-05 05:36:48
shuri is the worst,2023-02-05 18:41:13
well i thought thor 4 was bad this was somehow worse pretty much have zero interest left in watching marvel movies in theatres nowadays,2023-02-06 00:46:13
"this movie should have been cancelled after the sudden death of chadwick it was terrible without him no emotion just jumping scene to scene and complete lack of substance namor was ok but didn’t like the look of the actor he just didn’t seem fit enough to be a  the costume design was something a elementary kid could draw up why is elaine bennis in so many things now did she lose all her money somehow 

anyways it’s probably too late but if you’re thinking about watching this or paused after 15 minutes then i would suggest you just stop and pretend it doesn’t exist",2023-02-08 16:27:34
just terrible,2023-02-09 22:49:53
i was so excited to finally see some kick  representation for my people when kukulkan and the rest of his group came out then quickly went to oh im gonna be  if they make them the bad guys but in the end i was very pleased with the direction they went they made it so there was no bad guy between the 2 civilizations  the bad guys were colonizers trying to exploit them and their people they made a point to show that they were both still strong and powerful by giving each side their wins here and therenot having one completely stomp out the other they showed his motives and let the audience see that his intentions were good even if his method wasnt completely agreeable and i loved that they showed the similarities between the two cultures  imo mirroring irl with how there are actually alot of similarities in black culture  latino culture especially going to our indigenous parts of the culture and how we get pitted against eavhother often when really we have a similar goaldesire for our people and that we work better together  and how they came together in the end just tied it all in real nice and satisfyingly i sympathized with both sides and didnt find either in the wrong so excited to finally see some indigenouslatino representation some  latino representation in general without being the comedic side character or villain he was more of an antihero which is how he is in the comics apparently and i love me an antihero,2022-11-13 04:39:16
"my only gripes are 

1 the way they beamed t’challa’s body after his funeral seemed odd and not a tradition i would expect from wakanda

2 i felt the crowning scene at the end was rushed so is m’baku king now maybe i’m just an idiot but i was lost

other than that 9810 movie i cried more times than i can count

eta

3 did they have to  queen ramonda i felt like they were laying it on thick at this point",2022-11-11 03:40:36
i really did not like the end credit scene… it felt like it cheapened the entire movie and the death of t’challa other than that i thought movie was great,2022-11-11 03:37:01
anything in this film you find cringey,2022-11-11 03:43:53
namor was good but i disliked the ending they made him weak and lost to shuri  the guy that can solo the hulk  honestly i think they should have let him win and destroy wakanda that would be more interesting in my opinion,2022-11-11 13:05:26
"this movie hits some emotional high points that i genuinely didnt think the mcu would ever hit again after endgame that marvel studios logo gave me chills the ending is also incredibly moving

in between the film is a really messy experience i liked riri fine and i always enjoy seeing ross but you could have easily done the same main story of the wakandanamor conflict without either of those characters which just end up bloating the running time i especially found the jld scenes incredibly intrusive

great performances by bassett and gurira in particular i liked namor a lot wright is an appealing actress and i really liked her in the first bp but i dont think she is up to some of the dramatic heavy lifting that this film asks of her i especially dont think the part with the killmonger cameo and hinting at this dark side of shuri worked at all

overall id still give it a 75 coogler and co had a  of a tough job on this film and mostly delivered a good film and nailed the boseman tribute",2022-11-11 17:34:22
tenoch angela bassett danai etc were all great but i do think letitia stole the show and surprised me she had to act with everyone and really display her range  grief rage doubt self assurance growth etc especially loved her scenes with michael b jordan and when she tells mbaku what she wants to do,2022-11-12 11:28:22
i’m sorry but to me personally this movie was not it they def should’ve made usman or ngannou the black panther and they made the wakanda army so small when supposedly they are from this huge city the first black panther was so much better,2022-11-26 03:06:42
"this has some pretty mighty big shoes to fill with the behemoth that was the original black panther and obviously even more so following the reallife passing of chadwick boseman for me personally i feel that this is a surprisingly stronger outing that the first film with higher stakes better acting better special effects some more great cinematography memorable setpieces and another great score from ludwig 

somehow they managed to work in the death of t’challa in a tasteful way that managed to pay tribute to the real life man behind the character for what will likely always be the most devastating heartbreaking opening sequence to an mcu film 

i look forward to the return of namor as i felt coogler and tenoch knocked it out of the park in debuting the character and showing audiences with the sub mariner is all about seeing those ankle wings in action was so goofy and delightfully fun especially when juxtaposed against the violence and destruction namor is seen to be capable of also can we talk about the designs for attuma  namora absolutely sick

admittedly i wasn’t expecting okoye to play such an integral role here but thought her character development and overall usage was a nice addition even if i’m not sold on the midnight angels suits it seems an issue some are taking with the film is riri williams but i actually thought she fit in well and with a movie that sees shuri dealing with so much and i mean so so much trauma it’s nice to see two young smart ridiculously talented young people getting to find friendship with one another as riri  shuri do hopefully we get more of them together in the future… cough cough young avengers cough cough the other issue seems to be the inclusion of ross  valentina but like everett has been tied to wakanda since captain america civil war and valentina is one of the figurehead characters being established in phase 4 i can’t really see them taking away from enjoyment here especially ross but i guess mileage will vary 

the elephant in the room letitia wright problematic as she may be the film relies on her to carry a lot of the emotional weight and for those unaware she’s a reaaaaaaally talented actress without her in the role of shuri i simply don’t think wakanda forever works she may not be the hero fans want rightfully so but it would be ignorant to act like she didn’t deliver one of the best lead performances in a marvel movie here

tldr it’s great i liked it more than the original shuri  namor are fantastic leads the score is great the cinematography is great a few very memorable setpieces continued great worldbuilding with wakanda and talokan 

also loved the killmonger surprise and the fact that it played into shuri’s story and wasn’t just “hey here’s a cameo” thought they handled it really well tbh and loved that her suit had the gold trim of his suit in the first movie showing that her personality is now more of a mix of t’challa  killmonger

edit thanks for the downvotes for loving the movie i guess",2022-11-11 18:46:42
i cried 3 times at the beginning when they did the marvel opening with just chadwicktchalla and the whole funeral when ramonda died and at the end with the post credits scene this movie was beautiful it touched on so many things i cant even begin to express,2022-11-13 01:14:38
i like when shuri did the shoulder pat thing and said wakanda forever thats the name of the movie before blasting namor with her ships afterburner,2022-11-11 18:27:43
"given the impossible task coogler had to deal with i think this movie was solid everything that related to chadwick boseman’s passing was handled in the best possible way namor is a great addition to the mcu and i can’t wait to see more of him

ironheart was okay did she add anything to the movie other than as a plot device sure she was in the final fight but i don’t think she really did anything pivotal in it hopefully she’ll be more interesting in her series

ultimately i was really missing boseman’s presence in this movie his portrayal of t’challa made for such a great leader and screen presence that was on par with robert downey jr and chris evans letitia wright’s opinions aside i don’t think she has the screen presence to lead the movie and her shuri just isn’t the sort of character that fits as a leader or warrior

also was it just me or was most of the action just shot poorly the camera was just way too shaky which made me a little nauseous it’s been a while since i rewatched the first black panther but i remember it having some really solid action in it  plus creed’s fights were shot well maybe the 2nd unit took over the action more this time around…

all in all i think it served well as a tribute to boseman but there was no way it could make up for his loss

also as a little side note i think this is the first ryan coogler movie that doesn’t have a tie to oakland i was expecting riri to be from there or something like that",2022-11-11 03:45:40
while angela bassett and all the actors playing wakandans definitely brought their a game with performances i gotta say i was really impressed with tenoch huerta as namor he had such a commanding presence and was a total badass,2022-11-11 04:00:30
"it was fine

it’s a basic marvel superhero film with great action and good special effects the original black panther was enjoyable and chadwick boseman’s performance was great here despite his departure the film was still watchable and had some good moments the characters were alright while some were a little annoying i do like the costume designs besides one awful suit and all the performances were good as they weren’t a terrible performance throughout but honestly it felt like any cash grab from the previous film like most unnecessary sequels made nowadays watchable but really eh

510",2022-11-11 04:34:30
seeing michael b jordan back for one scene just reminds you of what this movie is really missing this movie needed a much stronger antagonist,2022-11-11 04:50:56
"did anyone else have this experience of an nearly empty theatre

i went to see this at 7pm opening day tonight there were 13 other people in the theatre total of 17 including me 

its a marvel premier i expected it to be packed i live a little north of atlanta so i was expecting it to be packed for anyone who isnt familiar with the us atlanta is the black capital of the us the city and metro are 50 black and the whole atlanta metro where i live is like a modern black wall street where there is a ton of money and success in the community that other states dont have 

i was shocked that there wasnt more people in the theatre for a marvel movie premier for a black movie in atlanta metro 

i enjoyed the movie a lot i wouldnt watch it again but thats how i feel about all marvel ive been burnt out on these movies and only sporadically follow them but never watch them twice 

really hoping that other people had a different experience in the theatre",2022-11-11 06:14:57

ok movie with namor being the standout

"its crazy that wakanda is called superpower in the movie their army was almost destroyed by the water balloons and spears both wakanda and talokan would be destroyed with the use of firearms let alone aviation and nuclear bombs

the movie wasnt perfect but i think this is the best phase 4 has had to offer glad to see phase 4 end well and to know that marvel still has some good movies in them because ive been disappointed with pretty much everything thats come out since black widow",2022-11-16 01:37:22

i have something to say about namor and his aztec society  when namor was a boy and returned to his land to bury his mother he witnessed the spanish colonizers enslaving his people and was horrified by this in the movie to the point that he killed the europeans and saved his people  but historically the aztecs practiced extensive slavery that was just as brutal if not more so since many slaves were used in ritual sacrifices and tortuous procedures in order to appease their gods  they would literally behead slaves use their heads as balls throw them down their pyramids and run thorned vines through their lips for blood sacrifices  the sight of spanish slavery would not have been alarming to him or his people at all since it had been a part of their culture for a very long time  another attempt of marvel to appease bipoc woke audiences by blurring historical facts in order to create sympathy for an oppressed and marginalized group of people of color who did nothing wrong except existing,2022-11-21 17:10:52
am i the only one who thinks that most superhero movies are  now they keep getting worse like the batman and joker movies were so underwhelming marvels movies looks like cartoon boring  remember the dark knight iron man man of steel  those were the good old days the only thing that made this movie a bit okay for me was letitia wright shuri,2023-02-03 21:34:21

its a bit messy but wakes always are

but the cia subplot and everything related to the government after the first 20 minutes or so felt a bit unnecessary especially vals character she really didnt add anything and her tapping into the pearls was super  riri wasnt all that interesting she felt more like a plot device than a character but she was better than america in ds2

its still good and a lot of the other good stuff outweigh the bad but it is not among the best of the mcu

maybe its all the political correctness i dont know i dont think thats it but it makes me wonder if a other people male or female would have been better

i love any reference to hansberry",2022-11-12 18:14:51
namor did almost nothing wrong,2022-11-12 22:15:29
i can understand why marvel didnt do it but i really think this movie wouldve been a lot better with a recasting of tchalla i mean i like letitias acting in this film but i still feel having shuri as black panther is just underwhelming,2022-11-12 22:49:13
 that all tchalla intro really hit hard,2022-11-12 23:26:36
loved the movie really happy there wasn’t a joke a minute probably my favorite mcu movie in a while,2022-11-13 00:57:21
"i liked it

namor was absolutely gorgeous

when queen ramonda asked about the vibranium and shuri said look at him i reimagined it

ramonda  how do you know about vibranium

shuri momma look hes dripping in it

i also really liked the mile high rock bottom he did on her at the end of the movie",2022-11-13 03:37:13
i was lied to that ryan gosling would be in this movie and tbh i’m kinda annoyed by that,2022-11-13 12:47:48
big hero six on a diet  ironheart suit,2022-11-13 14:58:48
talokan looked really cool,2022-11-13 18:42:01
i really liked this movie the music was really nice and i liked the amount of detail put into representing both cultures down to their languages after the steaming pile of s that was thor 4 this was a really pleasant movie experience also winston duke was awesome,2022-11-13 21:16:27
"imagine if doc oc had fallen into talokan instead of the hudson


the power of the sun",2022-11-14 05:04:33
"this movie has to do a lot adding iron heart felt like a straw that broke the camels back i understand she is a plot driver and the lighter side of the movie however it feels like it limps along 

with that being said the namor introduction was phenomenal tenoch was maybe one of my favorite performances and the respect it gives to chadwick boseman is incredibly admirable i also appreciated the containment of this being tied to two worlds without any other movies creeping in 

again it has to do a lot and also service fans both new and old

lastly more winston duke in any marvel movie he was doing work in this",2022-11-15 01:21:53
it would be cooler to see okoye nokia or mbaku be the black panther imo letita wright acted well but shuri isnt that interesting as the main character for the future adding killmonger was a nice touch,2022-11-15 15:19:48
movie was a 65710 just felt way longer than it needed to be,2022-11-16 08:53:03
im just surprised and thrilled namor said imperius rex,2022-11-17 00:47:27
didnt know what to expect for the movie but black panther vs mr nimbus and the navi was not on my list,2022-11-20 12:06:54
"i didnt really like namor they made him into a vengeful psycho akin to killmonger but at least killmonger tasted oppression and his dad was murdered by the wakandan royals

namor was a  from birth he was never oppressed or mistreated he was raised as a messiah so why is he so radicalised he murdered the queen just to be a  and theres no redemption for that

shuri sparing him is fine and in character but i feel like they were too chill at the end

namor being taken down by dehydration and a newbie panther was also pretty laughable they said hes on the same level as thor but even iron man circa civil war wouldshould be able to beat the  out of a super soldier can you imagine thor losing to cap he should oneshot him

the only thing i really liked was the chadwick tribute  nearly teared up wouldve straight up cried if i was watching at home  and the killmonger scene that one i absolutely loved i didnt expect michael b jordan to be back and it was my desire for them to pull multiverse  and make him the new panther but it was good to have him back and to see him double down on his ideology

the best villains are those who truly believe in their point of view",2022-11-21 23:55:16
critics have commended the performances of returning cast members such as boseman danai gurira letitia wright and angela bassett as well as new additions including actress tenoch huerta and actor winston duke they have also praised the film’s special effects and action sequences which are said to be grander and more intense than the first installment,2022-12-10 12:17:41
this was easily the worst of the entire mcu movie catalog dethroning thor  the dark world which i thought held that honor for nine years  just lackluster all around and dreadfully paced and overlong pacing and length being two different things,2022-12-11 06:52:42
i loved it almost made me cry 910,2022-12-19 04:20:28
"just watched i don’t have a bunch to say 
i felt disconnected from shuri namor was such a good character wasted in bad editing and writing his motivation was not clear and he was wishy washy the movie felt so disjointed and really lacked in a good story 

visually it was amazing 
underwater city was terrible looking 
the score was phenomenal",2023-02-08 05:22:28
i was worried about letitia wright and her ability to carry a movie as an actress  this movie proved me wrong  angela basset will get nominated for best supporting actress,2022-11-12 04:44:32
okay the movie was okay the plot was murky i still can’t understand why namor wanted to cause trouble with wakanda i found the ending a little weak even though i thought the mid credits scene was nice everett ross had such a small role and i wanted to see more involvement from jld as the fbi director man those fight scenes were weak and too long riri was a wasted character both good and bad the soundtrack was great this film is a testament to my belief that the “marvel formula” is lacking good costume design as someone who wanted a black panther sequel this met my expectations as someone who wanted a good film it failed at meeting my expectations 6410,2022-11-11 03:31:31
"it was very obvious that namor has never sent his people to war the second that ship appeared in the water the talokan should have had the advantage there was no reason for them to ever scale the side of the ship the mass bomb attack should have been the first move followed by opening more holes in the bottom of that ship for it to sink i dont see how you can fight the talokan in open water and not lose your entire army even with a sneak attack the wakandans should have waited for them to get to the surface at wakanda where they would have been at a disadvantage

other than that i enjoyed it i like that they didnt  namor or his lieutenants definitely liked it more than the first black panther movie",2022-11-11 04:52:26
"okoye should have been black panther she had by far the best fight scenes in the movie that said it makes sense why out of everyone it had to be shuri 

letitia wright handles the dramatic scenes the best its where she shines but as black panther and maybe it was on purpose she never felt permanent because shes driven a lot more by hate and revenge she even refuses to be queen of wakanda rather choosing to just be bp what struck me was that it implies shuri might turn evil and even possibly become a future nemesis for the next bp 

lupita nyongos screen time is okay but it felt like she didnt do much in the movie besides be a voice of reason we only get one shot of her fighting with her bracelets and thats it i wish we got more of the  kicking nakia of the first movie 

mbaku is a scene stealer but he was barely in the movie so dumb to bring back a fan favorite and just have him show up for 5 minutes to throw the funniest lines 

riri williams   unfunny and annoying and ironheart looks terrible this didnt make me excited to watch ironheart 

queen raimunda was the mvp when it came to acting she has one scene in the movie that should guarantee a oscar nom for angela bassett 

cgi was terrible but its the same old for the mcu i have no idea how these movies are so expensive yet have such lousy fx",2022-11-11 09:54:26
namor is  cool that i was kind of rooting for him they nailed his character and improved it i can’t wait for him to  invisible woman,2022-11-11 10:12:59
this didn’t feel like a mcu movie and i loved it not a single unnecessary joke in site,2022-11-11 10:44:54
i braced myself for emotional moments in the movie but it was so heartbreaking even after preparing myself i felt that the actors grieving tchallas death was that much more searing because we know that it is not just the death of a character but also the actor who played the character rest in peace chadwick boseman,2022-11-11 10:49:18
how am i supposed to wash the popcorn bucket,2022-11-11 14:18:17
"i know shuri was royalty but couldnt we have chosen anyone else to take up the mantle

killmonger from an alternate universe okoye one of the best warriors in all of the mcu mbaku just because i love him and think hes the best part of both movies

its a comic book movie it shouldnt be hard to write in a reason why someone with charisma is the black panther now",2022-11-11 15:28:48
"just finished watching the movie namor and talokan were super cool the involvement of whale and orca were cool too

 but i dont like the main character it seems that  all her assisants look super strong but she look so thin and weak and  with that dialog with riri at school riri said they dont accept my paper because im black what ",2022-11-11 15:37:53
man i went this movie with huge marvel fatigue from this phase 4 walked out with a   hype train ticket for future stuff choo choo 1010 for me namor was mwah,2022-11-12 01:33:29
this movie is darker than dcs,2022-11-12 07:07:05
it was mostly good it was too long the cia stuff was just padding and man riri was shoehorned in otherwise the movie was solid movie was missing chadwick boseman though and obviously there’s nothing they can do about that,2022-11-12 15:48:19
i really enjoyed it  it wasn’t perfect but i actually liked this movie more than the original black panther   both killmonger and namor were better villains than the average marvel movie,2022-11-12 16:37:22
bro at this rate eternals will not be mcu canon by next year  namor didnt care about the celestial in his place,2022-11-13 03:55:48
pretty awesome that odin’s in this movie,2022-11-13 06:13:27
angela bassetts clavicle made me feel so many different feelings tonight,2022-11-13 10:15:38
i feel like weve gotten to the point in this fandom where its easy to nitpick the little things but in a surprising breath of fresh air i think this movie was genuinely great and could stand on its own without the marvel nametag as a story dialogue was great acting was better it was a bit long but the pacing was still good fight scenes were pretty dope the character arcs were also excellent as well and everything more or less made sense they succeeded at what i feared they would fail at which was turning shuri into a serious character the raw emotion she displays in this movie and her genuine tilt towards the dark side after her talk with killmonger was great to watch and shes still pretty funny when she wants to be definitely looking forward to see how she continues to develop in the next movies now that were past the death in the family thing,2022-11-14 05:44:53
there were standout performances but it was not a strong plot and the third act fell apart very quickly also the repeated calling of ross a colonizer and giving him an unusual female boss without context made the movie veer into wokeanda forever territory,2022-11-20 00:54:30
angela bassett should be nominated for best supporting actress for this film could be the first mcu movie with an acting nomination,2022-11-12 03:05:44
"i liked the movie and had a great time at the theater

a few thoughts

 amazing to see a mostly female look and feel so natural on the big screen let’s be honest we’re not used to this and when this happens it tends to feel forced they really nailed having a bunch of incredible characters who all happened to be women hats of

 also very cool how the message through riri and shuri was essentially “work and study hard and you can achieve amazing things” now that’s quite the message to send to kids

 they really put the forever in wakanda forever nearly three hours it felt like it could have been about two hours long and packed a stronger punch throughout

i look forward to ironheart for sure and the quantumania trailer on the big screen was also something",2022-11-14 09:25:15
"movie really need 45 minutes trimmed up way too long and got boring first time movie actually felt long

x200b

something was off on the cgi with namorwrong light or something it started looking cartoonish

x200b

movie was 4 out of 10 for mesub average if it didnt have the marvel name no reason to go just content nothing offensive just getting boring and shlocky

x200b

weakest mcu of the yearjust content",2022-11-13 20:31:18
"when namor called himself a mutant i gasped 

so so ready to have the xmen in the mcu",2022-11-14 07:14:21
shuri actress did great props to her and the queen for carrying the film as main characters namor was great but the whole conflict was so contrived riri and elaine from seinfeld were both lame characters and those blue suits at the end were disgusting overall 8 out of 10 really enjoyed it much more emotionalserious than most marvel slop,2022-11-15 07:15:31
"i liked it but it could’ve been better i thought letitia wright and angela basset did a great job dominique thorne as ironheart was great as well and now i’m totally invested in her upcoming disney show

i do think it’s one of the better entries in the mcu’s phase four as a whole but as a sequel to black panther it’s not as good as the first

the choice to not make nakia the new black panther was very strange to me this movie being overly long having a weak side plot and a weak villain in namor in my opinion hold it back from being as good as the first i do appreciate what ryan coogler did here even if all of it didn’t completely click with me

i think if nakia was made the new black panther instead and michael b jordan was brought back as an anti hero going forward this movie was lacking a strong male character like with loki this would’ve been a stronger film overall",2022-11-14 13:11:36
never cared for the first black panther found it dull over hyped and had some of the worst cgi i had seen in a recent blockbuster movie i actually loved wakanda forever i have always found the women of wakanda to be much more interesting than t’challa and i loved namor i went in with zero expectations and walked away extremely entertained top ten mcu movie for me,2022-11-12 01:15:35
i really enjoyed the movie and it got a lot more emotional then i expected but mam the fight choreograph and editing were not up to where the rest of the movie was same with the cgi,2022-11-11 05:40:10
the killmonger swerve was so effective thematically maybe my favorite mcu cameo in a good long while,2022-11-11 08:01:41
the cgi was atrocious but the movie was pretty good overall,2022-11-11 16:16:34
"so what was the point of being stabbed when she is alright right after that never ever mentioned again

btw when she first appearead in the suit in front of the mbaku was that mustache shadow accidental or on purpose due to what she was saying

the scientist lady tony starkish did she just killed many cops on the bridge felt kinda off

i really liked the actor of namor tho very good but if felt so random that they just gave a random guess that maybe without water  lose powers and then when fighting by the water he could fly and didnt just in case dived for a sec to regain some strenght

but i felt like i enjoy it more than the first one",2022-11-11 21:53:31
wow they had poison ivywhat if black widow in the mcu for 5 minutes and offed her,2022-11-12 03:11:01
"do you guys think that shuri is an atheist she didnt believe that the ancestral plane existed and when okoye talked about how the bast stories were ingrained in her mind shuri talked about how that would sound very painful seems to me that shuri doesnt believe in  and is likely an atheistagnosticdeist

overall pretty good movie ill put it behind no way home and shang chi for phase 4 movies the main part i didnt like was the slow dialogue scenes with the underwater people and nakia i also think that ironheart shouldve been one of those child prodigies that got into mit at the age of 15 or something she could pretty much one up shuri and say something like wakanda  i found a mountain full of vibranium with a box of scraps and then have a technological rivalry between the two over the years",2022-11-13 21:14:08
everyones talking about lupita but did anyone notice that they also gave the ironheart suit an absolute dump truck of an ,2022-11-24 04:19:57
why wouldnt the mother tell shuri about the his son ,2023-02-01 12:04:42
im too busy crying over chadwick to unbiasedly view the movie i was entertained but the movie was lacking without his charisma ans personality visually amazing and super cool protagonist but im not sure i liked the direction they took,2022-11-11 03:09:03
thought it was a fantastic sequel and easily best film of phase 4,2022-11-13 17:44:58
it feels a little weird having this after what black panther was for black people  its like they took that same concept applied it to mexicans but made them all killmongers  heres hoping sin amor gets his revenge on the conquistadores,2022-11-12 23:28:43
"separating riri from the iron man succession was a good decision another check on the adaption changes controversial recent comic book character list

although her armor was a bit too medabotish the midnight angel armor was also kinda weird looking they did all of the jokes about how bad it looked and thennever changed it",2022-11-13 02:41:52
"the first 25 of the plot is awfully choppy but once you get past that its a fantastic movie 

the vfx is shockingly bad to the point where i didnt realize that the ironheart suit was practical",2022-11-14 04:36:37
"kind of failed to see how namor was the bad guy here
his parents were driven of their land because of slaverymoneyresources 

they go to live in the ocean to live in peace and stay hidden knowing if they are found their resources will get stole and they will be killed

they ask wakanda to help stay hidden and  one person to feel safe 

wakanda says no and starts a war killing a lot more

most heroes actually most everyone in the movie is female except bad guy one of his main soldiers and a few wakandans

the movie looked great visually but the story and message seemed forced and ",2023-02-03 19:32:53
i had a boomer in my theater say oh wow is that her brother when they revealed killmonger in the ancestral plain,2022-11-13 22:00:05
at least shuri had a proper heros journey unlike trinity from the last matrix people whining about mbaku not doing alot they basically showed that he will be the new leader of wakanda tribes while shuri is the black panther protector namor is the first mutant to be seen and called as such quicksilver is dead and they dont explain wandas powers giving namor some kind of kryptonite is just dumb hes supposed to be one of the strongest earthling people in marvel and a member of the illuminati,2022-11-11 10:43:57
namor one of my favorite characters from the comics was done such justice in this film they made him charismatic noble and sympathetic in ways but also narcissistic and straight up cruel in others he was the highlight of the film and stole every scene he was in in my opinion i was worried at a few points in the film they’d  him off and make him a oneoff villain but am so happy that wasn’t the case namor actor killed it and i can’t wait to see more of him,2022-11-11 14:12:25
why did the queen declare all her family is taken  if she knew she had a grandson,2022-11-11 23:23:58
knew from the jump that shuri was going to be the next black panther simply because the movie opened with her and still they took their time getting her to that point black panther finally showed up in the black panther movie two hours in this movie had a  whole lot of plot and i wish we got more of every character,2022-11-12 02:11:48
i hope shuri gets a cape like in the comics,2022-11-12 19:26:53

" the movie had unfortunate circumstances that affected it but it still prevailed and turned out a great watch  

 the soundtrack is something to listen to at the theater especially the final fight the effects and cinematography are all amazing to see come to life

 the final fight and the action scenes are all done spectacularly along with being engaging
 
 the performances from angela tenoch and letitia help give heart to this movie

 my only cons are the following

 the opening scene was done way too quickly we shouldve had more time spent on it before tchalla was actually revealed to have died something like shuri finding out about the disease and trying everything to cure it for months

 the rossval plot was a bit unnecessary and felt like something that would fit a post credits scene more

 doctor doom potentially having been cut from the movie as a post credits scene is insane as this is the final movie in this phase of the mcu lake bells character meaning isnt ever explained because of this",2022-11-14 04:44:03
did anyone notice the scene where she’s making the ironheart suit had the camera angles and framing as the scene in the original iron man  great little detail,2022-11-15 03:44:54
i went from liking the film on first viewing to really loving it on second viewing everything about it works so well i’m surprised to see so many people say they disliked it it’s just as entertaining as the first but it’s even more emotional and personally the shurinamor conflict works soooo much better than the t’challakillmonger conflict though i did like it in that movie i just never felt it was that strong i think us as the audience seeing shuri and namor connect when he’s showing her talokan gives us a reason to kinda care about whether she’s gonna  him or not at the end whereas killmonger i just got no sympathy for him even though i did see where he was coming from he was just angry the whole movie and i didn’t get the same kind of layers to his character the way you do with namor,2022-11-16 16:55:44
"i liked this more than the original it resonated with me because ive felt tragic loss too and namor was so sick one of my favorite mcu villains yet 

some things i continue to not like though like a black guy making monkey sound and beating his chest like a gorilla how is that supposed to be empowering to black people you dont have africans acting like monkeys in africa why do they insist on making that a wakamda thing and calling white people colonizers when they had nothing to do with those events from hundreds of years ago and just living their lives is  

and how is wakanda supposed to be the most powerful nation on earth based off what you see of them in this movie like how could they even defeat one branch of the us military whatever i hope to see more of namor",2022-11-18 22:39:21
"some of y’all in here really need to get a life and it shows downvoting people because they enjoyed a movie you didn’t 

the antimcu is even more annoying and shallow then mcu fans but y’all are far too pretentious to wrap your heads around it

hating marvel isn’t a personality trait believe it or not",2022-11-11 18:07:50
"shuri had a great character arc 

action scenes were really cool the attack on wakanda and the final fight namor is a cool new addition 

interesting to see the black panther recast",2022-11-11 03:27:42
that was okay namor was cool this ironheart character was hit and miss shuri being the next bp was too predictable shocked by the queens death tbh mixed overall,2022-11-11 03:40:45
was there a post credit scene idk if i consider the kid scene post credit nothing after that,2022-11-11 03:52:30
"film had some narrative issues its about 20 minutes too long and has less interesting stuff to say than the first but its not bad especially when given the context of bosemans death after the script was written difficult part is his absence is very noticeable its fine not good not bad

costumes besides black panther were mega  comic relief was kind of annoying and i think the film would have been better without her villain wasnt a throwaway but also wasnt incredibly interesting

performances were strong but i dont think wright has enough charisma to take on the roll of black panther should have been lupita but shes too good of an actor to be wrapped up in a bunch of marvel projects 

i thought the thing that started the second actthe killing of the guards while rescuing shuriwas actually a really lazy way to get the conflict rolling

the conflict was kind of my main gripe with the film it retouches on themes from the first regarding colonialism and imperialism but they present namor as a sympathetic villain but kind of just make him bloodthirsty the entire conflict of him wanting to  the scientists girl could have been dealt with if he just talked to her when he captured her the conflict was super lazy 

its fine",2022-11-11 03:54:25
the movie did a lot great things tying atlantis and namor to wakanda was very smart making their stories similar hard to imagine a better way to introduce namor but i don’t feel like we moved forward with this movie at all and there wasn’t like a big hook that would have me talking about it for a week it was idk meh a decent marvel movie amongst 30 decent marvel movies,2022-11-11 03:59:46

i liked it hope it does well with the audience,2022-11-11 05:23:39
i was genuinely scared of namor and his soldiers i really felt that they could have won and probably would have if shuri hadn’t had a change of heart it’s been a while since i’ve felt that threat in an mcu movie,2022-11-11 06:15:09
lot of  green screen scenes than i would have loved mcu is now taking the audience for granted,2022-11-11 08:22:02
"i’m happy the made it a more serious movie unlike the parody love and thunder however it dragged forever and… for nothing in the end it’s a good movie all around but quite indifferent imo

i’ll be skipping the next ones ",2022-11-11 08:27:46
"they handled the story of losing chadwick well while also balancing namor him and his civilization were amazing to see his fight scenes were badass too the final act fight on the ship was kinda stupidbland especially compared to earlier although the showdown between shuri and namor was great

agree with others in that the cia subplot was unnecessary and ruined the pacinglength of the film it could’ve ended after shuri and riri were captured",2022-11-11 08:50:23

"i really enjoyed it namor rocks 

i keep seeing that the talokans were way easier to root for but i disagree think both the talokans and wakandans had reasons for their actions sure the wakandans could’ve done a better job helping them but killing a 19 year old college student and letting namor start a war with the suface world doesn’t exactly sound like the best course of action not to mention namor killed the queen too the talokans were desperate to remain hidden at all costs but i think they could’ve talked it out more they were making it way more complicated than it needed to be",2022-11-11 14:26:04
man this movie was so much more emotionally driven than the first i was legitimately tearing up at points haha my whole theater was silent during the opening marvel title sequence it was actually really cool to witness the city of talokan was absolutely amazing angela bassett played the  out of her roll and was the star for me even though she technically wasnt the main character,2022-11-11 14:38:21

what was with the bizarre mid credits scene unless ive missed something did they just do a big reveal that tchalka had a secret son only for son to sit down and repeat the exact same thing like it was a dramabomb,2022-11-11 21:51:52
"just finished it 

loved it

my only hope is we don’t have to wait too long before seeing namor again",2022-11-11 23:19:17
"the opening is great and the movie offers a thoughtful and respectful tribute to chadwick that works inuniverse too i think some things could have been trimmed or made to flow better though in the end it felt like some things took too long some things lacked momentum or gravitas others felt bloated i dont think the cia offered that much and her becoming the bp felt rushed and more like an obligation than a natural flow of events to me 

the action was really nice in some parts the choreography and camera work of okoyes fight w the water people was really well done felt like it was actually shot on location and had real weight to all the strikes so much better than a lot of comparable mcu action

there were still some weird sets and obvious sky replacement things something looked wrong about the crash site when he gets the beads but a lot was shot outside on location and looked great especially when there was real water another thing that was refreshing against a lot of recent mcu",2022-11-12 02:40:20

"it was solid better part of phase 5 the handling of the death i was not a fan of i understand not recasting immediately but tchalla having to die along with the actor is just plain depressing to me i enjoy marvel for the escapist element and having to be reminded of chadwick’s death in universe was really heart wrenching

i think they could’ve set this movie in the 5 year gap of the snap and then be ready to have a new tchalla for bp3 further down the road when it’s more tenable to recast

that being said i liked shuri as bp how they handled namors powers and the settings of wakanda and tenochilanalthough it was very dark in those scenes do feel the conflict could’ve been avoided and was more a symptom of miscommunication which makes ramondas death more tragic imowasn’t a fan of that at all",2022-11-12 20:51:38

shame we didnt get the final fight in a more interesting locale the first 23rds were so visually great and the panther namor fight was decent but a big cgi punchup on a boat felt lackluster when the rest looked so good


still a fun romp like a lot of phase 4 and im glad we are getting some silly ness in it again like namors whole design wouldnt have ever been greenlit a decade ago",2022-11-13 01:00:18

1 on the bridge what did shuri say to namor to save the life of ironheart riri williams i know shuri agreed to be taken hostage by namor but i think she also said something else to convince namor to spare ironhearts life i missed what she said

2 namor said to shuri that wakanda can only be an ally or an enemy and he said that if wakanda did not become an ally then he would attack wakanda  but was there another reason that namor insisted to shuri that he would attack wakanda was it because wakanda held vibranium or was it some other reason",2022-11-22 14:54:43

"probably the best mcu movie of the year

 cold opening was sudden and intense followed by the funeral scene with tchalla presence felt throughout the movie 
 angela bassett gives the best performance of the film wouldnt be surprised if she got a few acting nominations for it
 first half of the movie is honestly great second half really drags
 tenoch huerta as namor was perfect exploration of the talokans history and culture was my favourite part of the movie shoutout to namora who did the most damage to wakandans throughout the movie
 lupita nyongo steals the movie as nakia with the few scenes she had
 okoye and mbaku had interesting character arcs in the movie
 last act was really poor the fight in the middle of the ocean felt like a midmovie battle rather than an endmovie battle and it felt really short too 
 a lot of night scenes were too dark especially namors introduction scene
 vfx was an improvement over the previous mcu movies but still not polished in some scenes
 riri williams was a poor character with no real arc she was just a plot point and felt like 2hour backdoor pilot for her disney series
 ludwig göransson with another great musical score but the soundtrack felt flat
 no one from wakanda or talokan offering a marriage proposal to unite the kingdoms felt off maybe its the house of the dragon fan in me but thats where my mind went to first when namor gave shuri his moms necklace 
 lake bells character just disappeared there were leaks that she would appear in the postcredits scene but maybe it was scrapped or shifted to ironheart b


a very touching and respectful goodbye to chadwick boseman the movie itself was just good but it could have been better",2022-11-11 16:34:41
yeah this movie wasn’t great but it was really good a 7510 if they were going for a black panther movie without black panther in it then they  nailed it because black panthers absence was felt i think the worst thing about this movie is riri williams and the best thing about the movie is the emotional scenes when it’s serious it’s  amazing but when it strays away from the seriousness the very few times that it does the jokes rarely land that whole side plot with agent ross was clearly meant to set up thunderbolts and i honestly don’t think it was needed,2022-11-11 03:13:26

"i know this subreddit hates everything marvel but im so surprised of all the mediocre reviews here

i thought this was easily their best film since endgame you could maybe argue nwh but that movie relies on so much nostalgia bait and the plot was ridiculous

this movie was so nuanced and mature and dark at times it felt like the best of past phases when marvel was more grounded and trying to appeal to more than just popcorn fodder

also the world building of talokan and naymor was a great addition to the mcu loved all the parallels to wakanda and how that tied into the themes and plot overall",2022-11-11 04:24:39

"was it perfect no 

did i love it yes 

this feels like a return to form for marvel in my eyes here’s some things i loved 

 i felt the weight of t’challachadwick’s death the entire film it was tasteful heartbreaking and critical to the story as well i can’t imagine how difficult it was for coogler and co to make this film after losing a close friend like that but so much respect to them 

 shuri was incredible a character i have never enjoyed on screen until this film she absolutely enthralled me from the opening moment as someone who has grieved a lost one i finally was able to relate to her on a deep level and i felt everything she felt 

 it looked beautiful i could not think of a single moment where i thought to myself “that looks rough” and i’ve felt that many a time in stage 4 finally a marvel movie was of the quality i expect from a huge studio like this 

 it took itself seriously finally a marvel movie that took itself seriously and didn’t use jokes to undercut every single emotional moment the fact we got to sit in the grief and anger of the characters was such a breathe of fresh air after thor and doctor strange was the movie slow at points sure but i actually got to sit in these moments with the characters rather then be rushed through 20 min episodes on disney or have a scene cut short from a joke the comedy here was on point i laughed at moments but it didn’t take away from the emotion at all 

i loved it and cannot wait for ant man 3 in a few months",2022-11-13 05:47:39

"heres how i wouldve rewritten black panther wakanda forever


tchalla dies and shuri ramonda and wakanda mourn

ramonda speaks to the un in regard to the illegal obtainment of vibranium 

dora milaje protects the vibration lab from pirates

one year later passes

a vibranium excavation project by nato causes an explosion in the atlantic causing an underneath earthquake that destroys a talokanil city

namor and the talokanil retaliate by destroying a nato warship thats guarding the excavation

namor is furious and decides to blame wakanda for opening its borders and telling the world about vibranium which they also have 

namor visits ramonda and shuri at the camping site tells wakanda to punish nato for the explosion and destroy their military base in brussels and close
wakanda again from the outside world 

ramonda tells namor that the vibranium fell outside the borders of wakanda therefore they arent accountable

namor tells ramonda that if they do not attack then namor will sink wakanda underwater

shuri returns to her base but realizes that there is something wrong

the talokanil  kidnap shuri and the dora milaje comes to rescue but okoye is beaten by attuma 

ramonda stips okoye of her rank as leader of the dora milaje 

ramonda travels to haiti and asks nakia to retrieve shuri from namor  

namor shows shuri his home of talocan city and his origins hoping that he can manipulate shuri to usurp the queen and close wakanda since the opening was the reason why tchalla died they never stated how he died but is hinted

namor gives shuri the bracelet with talokanil  vibranium asks for her hand in becoming the rulers of both wakanda and talokan and eventually the outside world 

shuri begins to see namors perspective but is rescued by nakia by killing talokanil  guards 

this angers namor and they attack wakanda

namor and mbaku fight one on one namor is about to  him but is saved by the dora milaje

namor drowns ragonda in front of shuri

funeral of queen ragonda shuri reinstates okoye as the leader of the dora milaje again

shuri nakia okoye set defenses of wakanda needs to fight in wakanda without civilians mbaku suggests evacuating the citizens into his mountains

shuri nakia okoye figure out who designed the vibranium magnets that caused the earthquake turns out it was riri williams attending mit

they recruit riri williams to wakanda to design a submarine that launches rockets that extracts and magnetize vibranium

riri williams does it in exchange for vibranium and wakandan technology for a personal project

wakanda launches its underground rockets that take all of talocan citys vibranium cultural artifacts

namor and the talokanil follow them to wakanda

riri williams and shuri figure out the formula to create the heart shaped herb riris vibranium detectors find out that the bracelet had the right vibranium in it

shuri drinks it and turns into the astral plane meets with killmonger and tells her to handle her business

shuri awakens and creates a new black panther suit

ensuing battle commences riri williams unleashes iron heart and battles with namor

namor eventually gets the upper hand

the wakandans and talokanil end up fighting in the location wakandan ritual combat

namor tells everyone that the fate of the two realms will be decided in a 1v1 wakandans and talokanil surround them chanting for their leader

shuri wins namor yields and the talokanil leave the wakandans decide to give back their artifacts

shuri goes to haiti and burns the funeral clothing which symbolizes the end of her griefing of tchalla  

end

"since this post is already being brigaded by trolls who are going to downvote everyone anyway i’ll just come out and say it

this was an excellent film for black girls in particular watching all the main characters with their diverse personalities was really enjoyable i loved the banter between okoye and shuri the burgeoning sisterhood between shuri and riri the way shuri rejects her mother’s traditions in the beginning and revists them at the end a changed woman the bridging of the gap between shuri and nakia and the fresh challenge of becoming to your nephew what his father was to you

all were incredibly relatable themes and experiences and i loved watching all of these beautiful actresses interact on screen it so incredibly rare to see a movie that lets black women steer the story and gives them the most screentime and before you you say hurr durrgh you just got the woman king1 i don’t like historical fiction i like urban fantasyscifi and this was an excellent urban fantasyscifi

there were definitely some weak writing choices but i can easily overlook them the costumes were gorgeous not talking about the midnight angel one obv  the acting was off the charts i thankfully didn’t get spoiled so i gasped when killmonger appeared and thought that was a great writing choice i loved the immersion as well really feeling the comfort of wakanda as well as the recognizable yet unfamiliar world of talokan

the story is arguably the most mature and best we’ve seen in a marvel film since the raimi days the themes of grief acceptance and forgiveness were masterfully done shuuri sparing namor reminded me of the whole “hate only begets more hate” spill you see in shonen anime but it was well done 

riri williams and namor stole the show for me loved how their characters were done tenoch huerta has an incredibly bright future amazing actor was nice seeing killmonger back on screen too

also loved how well the mayan language was handled in the film as a linguistpolyglot that’s always a plus 

introducing prince t’chala in the mid credits scene was great that was one of the biggest theories coming into the film but since they went so long without doing it in the movie i was thinking maybe they wouldn’t do it

this one was unfortunately pretty much the polar opposite for me emotionally it was strong i’m glad that there was sufficient commemoration of t’challa which of course includes chadwick seeing the tears of the characters felt very organic and i’m sure that’s because they really were at the same time though it felt very slowpaced there were times where i fell asleep i wasn’t fully awake until shuri got the suit compared to killmonger this antagonist wasn’t all that perhaps i just admired seeing the stark contrast between two estranged relatives clashing — a wakandan and an american while that wasn’t repeated which is good for avoiding redundancy it also made it amiss 

the actionpacked scenes were just as great as the 2018 movie’s excellent choreography effects gymnastics and all that good stuff i also appreciated the unapologetic factor of there being another demise on top of an already saddening one the twist at the end was another emotionally powerful one out of everything that got to me the most 

i won’t give it a numerical rating just to be respectful of the commemoration so i’ll leave this off on a positive note and say that this really hit me in the feels  bless chadwick",2022-11-18 07:41:21
"it was entertaining to imagine all the handwringing behind the scenes on how woke to make this movie just enough antiwhite punchlines to satisfy twitter but not enough to cause mass walkouts then the lesbian stuff we have to show some  action but just a little bit so we can cut it out for china and the middle east so they just settle for a kiss on the head i miss the days when studios just made movies without constant agonizing about possible backlash and service to the lunatic fringe julia louisdreyfus character was superfluous and awkward martin freemans return was almost totally unnecessary

overall about 3045 minutes too long hurt the pacing entertaining action sequences for the most part felt almost like an avatar 2 teaser at times whose idea was it to make a movie with a bunch of blue guys when theres 93 sequels on the way with blue guys angela bassett death was a bit too much imo people are already emotional felt a little cheap decent setup for the next one   710",2022-11-13 21:55:43
"to paraphrase captain america

this is what the mcu is supposed to be",2022-11-11 03:23:41
" one of my favorite standalone marvel films ever

what i liked
the visuals wakanda looks great but so does all the underwater stuff 

the action very easy to comprehend what’s going on and some badass set pieces

the acting amazing performances by angela bassett leticia wright… honestly everyone was dope 

the tributes to chadwick this movie is a love letter to him beautiful

the emotional stakes i love that in the end battle you don’t quite know who to root for because they both are fighting for the wrong reasons different than any of the usual marvel stuff we see added an extra layer that i enjoyed 

what i didn’t like
the way shuri learns her lesson is a bit clunky and kind of comes out of nowhere 

they kind of stuffed ironheart down our throat although it is what it is 

all in all a great movie also lol at the fact that marvel basically did avatar 2 right before they drop the real avatar 2 rip james cameron",2022-11-11 04:06:34
"i enjoyed the movie but dont like the new level of wokeness i mean 5 female main characters and one male anatgonist

x200b

in the past there were just male main characters now they do the opposite 

x200b

but overall a beautiful movie nice story and they successfully could do a completely new story i hope for more and im sure they worked with the avatar producers together since the under water elements of the movie",2022-11-14 09:59:27
 disney for sticking with leitia wright what a  insult to chadwick who died of cancer,2022-11-11 12:29:00
"it was a moving entertaining ride i have a few gripes but ultimately loved i have nothing against leticia wright and she ended up doing an incredible job i really liked just seeing a female led story where they all dealt with grief but also joy and also did some fantastic  kicking 

also tenoch huerta is the real sexist man alive chris evans who 

nah but namor was easily one of the best parts of the movie menacing yet charming loved him",2022-11-11 03:52:47
lowkey better than the first one,2022-11-11 06:04:04
kinda surprised to see so much criticism in this thread i liked the movie a lot and left the theater very impressed namor is an amazing antagonist the whole film is so much more characterfocused than any mcu content as of late and i felt more emotional involvement here than most of what marvel has put out in years loved the action scenes they had huge scope  especially the battle in the city yeah there’s definitely flaws here and there but i was never bored i think this was the best phase 4 film by a landslide and a huge return to form for the mcu it feels like it takes itself seriously the way the best marvel films have i’ve been missing that feeling with the last several movies and most of the disposable disney shows,2022-11-11 06:19:33
"let’s be honest if you didn’t like this movie it’s because

1 you’re racist and can’t handle anything other than a white male protagonist
2 you’ve convinced yourself that shuri doesn’t deserve to become the black panther because you’re racist see point 1",2022-11-15 02:29:46
best phase 4 edition by a long shot namor was done very well and the atlantis equivalent was an entertaining storyline really relieved as my expectations were low as i have not been fond of phase 4 biggest complaints were the suits for the angels and iron heart weird and bulky looking also would have thought with the wakanda tech iron heart could have built something less clunky,2022-11-11 04:12:24
"i personally loved it music and sound design were really good fight scenes and cgi were well done and that killmonger scene was surprising 910 

they are 2 different movies but i would say it is just as good as black panther 1 if not a bit better",2022-11-11 04:54:44
"that amazing synth music when shuri suit is revealed is right here

",2022-11-11 05:20:02
the mother did a great job acting wise but that accent was atrocious,2022-11-11 06:08:55
"i liked it great tribute to chadwick and overall it’s a solid marvel flick it had some drawbacks like most marvel movies do cia plotline only existing as setup for a future film weird cgi in some places marvelesque tension defusing jokes nitpicks that i’ll forget in a week but it’s still an entertaining experience

angela bassett is good i wouldn’t say it’s an oscar worthy performance she’s had many better performances but she’s definitely the highlight in the whole scheme of things",2022-11-11 06:49:33
"doing this movie without chadwick boseman was going to be hard and i respect the cast and crew for finishing this
when the first scene hit i was very shocked that they addressed the death right off the bat and i think with that scene and the silent marvel logo roll was as perfect a way you can handle an extremely delicate situation
angela basset absolutely stole the show with her performance
i do not trust wright with the future of this ip because of her views which i will not be arguing about here i actually thought they were going to  off her character in the last fight against namor which would have been a very interesting decision
some of the fight scenes were remarkably brutal for a marvel film and emotions were very raw
a potential threeperson brawl for the throne would be very interesting
namor was done very well seeing parts of my heritage shown in a respectful was awesome
shoutout to the son and father duo who decided that the bathroom sink area was the best time to start talking about the film and risk spoiling the movie",2022-11-11 08:19:20
anyone else feel this to be a love letter to chadwick as much as fast 7 was to paul walker,2022-11-11 20:45:16
if you’ve ever lost any loved one or someone close to you there are moments in this movie that would love you to tears i enjoyed this a lot better than the weird dr strange 2 and the generic thor 4,2022-11-12 02:54:56
my only complaint of the movie surprisinglyi had really negative expectations due to chadwicks passing and them not recasting was the cheesy  super suits they put okoye and the other girl in it was a cheesy move and the only extra bit i didnt care for like okoye was badass enough to not ever need a suit like that she fought thanos armies twice without that idk its a minor complaint movie made me cry like 3 times,2022-11-12 07:13:48
shocked at how good the movie was overall mcu has been very mediocre otherwise for a few years,2022-11-13 05:02:20

"in this thread i noticed any great reviews for the movie are downvoted and any this movie sucks comments are being up voted just take look i seen enough of this evidence and this should be brought to attention

yeah this thread isnt hijacked by deplorables reviewbombing the movie on reddit movies sub making it seem like this movie is not really good sigh

mods can you do something or not about terrible people coming here to ruin the truth",2022-11-12 03:46:14
"i know there are almost no black men on this board since majority of this board is over 30 yo white dudes with beards but i’m curious as black men how did you feel seeing wakanda do nothing to elevate black men and instead showed them as squabbling bickerers who need to be controlled by women there was 1 male character from wakanda of note in this whole movie 

it’s interesting to see how little ryan coolger spent amplifying black male voices this happens when you get weak men to write they always underwrite the men and write women strong as a fanfic

what are your thoughts black men only respond i don’t want older white guys calling me “crazy” for this",2022-11-13 21:34:43

is it great or perfect perhaps not but bad nah

cuz no oscarslevel acting movies is actually really bad you just dont that much appreciate acting like some of us doif to you its bad thats all",2022-11-11 06:45:29
"namor was the best part 

martin freeman was good too although his storyline was convoluted 

it should have focused more on namor and martin freemancia 

black panther‘s sister constantly whining is so boring who cares",2022-11-11 12:10:52
"shuri’s black panther outfit and entrance was 1010

edit fixed an autocorrect",2022-11-13 05:22:47
"welp ryan coogler has once again delivered yet another nuanced believable villain in namor his backstory was heart breaking and you totally understand why hes doing what hes doing and then he brought back killmonger for a great cameo 

i went in with low expectations and was blown away that was a respectful send off there was decent action the acting was pretty great cultural aspects paid homage to and the character development was good as a member of the audience i didnt find much to critique which is great

whatever disney is paying coogler for the script hes totally worth it",2022-11-14 00:30:55
top 5 mcu easily blown away by how well they handled this storyline absolutely loved the set pieces,2022-11-11 05:11:40
ryan coogler really looked at the state of the world and said “let’s write a script where the anti vaxxer actor is the hero”,2022-11-13 21:04:00
"shuri stole almost every scene she was in

is literally one of the most upvoted comment in the thread for bp from 4 years ago as well as her charisma was leaking out of the screen

yet now everyone here says shes uncharismatic and dull hilarious how thats all of a sudden different now with this film

",2022-11-11 14:09:17
loved this movie i wasn’t a fan of anything since endgame really either but this felt a lot different in tone there are obvious reasons for that but i thought the way they played it off was emotional action scenes were a bit lackluster i will say namor was great and that introduction of their people was fantastic overall i left very satisfied especially with the circumstances this turned out great,2022-11-11 03:37:06
it was perfect i was hit really hard by chadwick’s death and i felt closure for the first time,2022-11-11 06:19:43
"when shuri woke up and they thought the new heart didnt work but she punched the mannequin in our theater a kid audibly said nevermind and everyone just laughed

a little bit disappointed she was able to take a spear to the gut and still win

also hot  is jonathan majors on a roll he was in three of the trailers before the movie started",2022-11-13 22:43:57
"in terms of unexpected returns the killmonger return scene tops the red skull return scene from infinity war i love the cooglermbjordan collabs continue

also that scene right after where shuri punches that  truly made that killmonger scene hit even harder

also upset we didn’t get a true waterfall ceremony return scene at the end instead we earlier got a “wakandan over the top scene”",2022-11-11 05:20:42
i want to be clear about something if you teared up knowing t’challa son will be bp in the future but you don’t support the same kind of lineage for white characters you have a colonizing preset you need to change,2022-11-13 20:20:25
heard this movie was racist towards mexicans,2022-11-11 08:29:59
angela bassett was phenomenal,2022-11-11 04:22:18
"i thought the film was great barring a few minor issues

pacing was really good it dragged a few times but never for long before a big set piece ramped things back up there were no tedious subplots and only one long exposition scene which was so beautifully shot and edited i didnt mind it a bit the namor origin story

namor was sensational he lacked a little bit of the smarminess that makes him so great in the comics but it wouldnt really have fit this interpretation of the character so i wont knock them for it the change to the origin story was also handled really well as was the connection to wakanda via vibranium

the best thing about the story was how well it handled the death of chadwick boseman starting with an unseen tchalla dying from some unknown issue while shuri struggles to synthesize a new herb was a deft move as it made the unintended death of the main character work in the context of the previous movie with the herbs destroyed then having the atlanteans or whatever they are in the movie possess an herb of their own leading to shuri finishing the synthetic version brought everything together in a neat and tidy way everything leading up to the release of this movie focused on the unenviable task coogler had to make this story work without his main star to say he pulled it off would be an understatement he nailed it",2022-11-11 04:23:55
mbaku was pushing too many pencils,2022-11-11 04:30:30
i liked the postcredits scene after prince t’challa was adorable,2022-11-11 04:37:27
might edit in thoughts about the actual movie later but i think its kinda  for marvel to train a generation of moviegoers to sit through the credits and then not put anything at the end,2022-11-11 04:43:50
"a few comments

angela bassett ate this movie up her acting was on point also she’s 64 she looks amazing stella still has her groove 

i love the social commentary in this film we find that people of color often go against each other because of the limited powerresources whatever it is in actuality though they need to go against the broken system i think we sorta see that here the two groups recognize that an alliance is more worthwhile but only after first fighting with one another the true enemy colonizerswestern civilization  

since iron heart’s jarvis is tony i thought there’d be a connection to tony with her character disappointed that there wasn’t one yet 

i thought winston duke did a great job with his mentor role 

julia louis dreyfus and martin freeman’s past was a fun detail valentina is becoming a real entertaining big bad 

i appreciate a feminist movie that just exists as a quality film captain marvel clearly had that aim this one just showed awesome women thriving have we had a marvel film with probably 85 of the spoken lines be by women pretty cool 

there’s a novel by an african author called transcendent kingdom in it the protagonist is a scientist who struggles with her mother’s faith and her belief in science they’re also both grieving the loss of the protagonist’s brother the themes of that novel were very relevant to this movie i enjoyed watching shuri come to terms with her family’s beliefs 

i really enjoyed the film was pleasantly surprised by the michael b jordan cameo figures since coogler directed my only criticism was that we saw the secret don at the end of shehulk so that ending felt redundant here it was still sweet though",2022-11-11 04:47:14
"think despite how depressing everything is in the story it makes for an all the more true definition of heroism not one where characters do the right thing in every scenario but where they grapple with grief loss and even survivors guilt but still see the battle through to its conclusion thats the reason shuris arc works for me and why shes more than earned the mantle in my eyes  
also ending probably the biggest marvel movie of the year with a shot of your main character crying is a ballsy move and im glad a mainstream blockbuster ends so intimately",2022-11-11 04:50:16
solid considering the circumstances but outside of namor and co all the suit designs were atrocious the cia plot felt tacked on and pointless and the ending was a cgi slugfest that was about as messy as the first movies also why did they sideline okoye for the middle of the movie,2022-11-11 04:53:13
4 of the 7 phase 4 movies have had a plot point about either the death of a little girl or trying to  a little girl,2022-11-11 05:12:12

also the city wasnt destroyed it got a little wet",2022-11-11 05:27:13
"so the water people
can regenerate and heal from mortal wounds early in the movie but didn’t have any relevance later on to this  hmmm",2022-11-11 05:32:54
what was the phrase namor said at the end when he was fighting shuri,2022-11-11 05:33:17
was anyone else disappointed with the scale namor said he had more warriors than blades of grass and we kept hearing about war against the entire surface but the most we ever saw was a hundred people fighting it never felt like anything more than tiny skirmishes same with the attack on the city they said it was in ruins but it was just like a couple buildings with minor damage and a few flooded streets nothing really major,2022-11-11 05:35:56
"it was fine i enjoyed it overall but it’s going to live on as rather forgettable to me the best parts were honestly the chadwick bozeman flashbacksnostalgiamourning 

did anyone else think the cgi looked a bit unfinished",2022-11-11 05:37:31
"some initial thoughts

1 interesting that ross and valentina were previously married

2 looking forward to the wakanda disney show lots of good angles from what ross is up to to okoye’s redemption to other members of the dore milaj standing out maybe learn more about danial kaluya’s character in prison

3 the scene i was most looking forward to was the waterfall coronation scene but i didn’t understand if shuri had forsaken tradition m’baku was claiming to be black panther or if he was “gatekeeping” and standing in shuri’s place to make sure no one challenges or something else 

4 i’m excited that toussant t’challa’s son may get to meet his father when it is his turn he visits the ancestral astral plane   

5 angela basset killed it and deserves an oscar nomination

6 the mercenaries being marched into the un floor was an awesome mic drop moment

7 i really liked riri i find it kinda funny that she’s in mit would’ve been cool to see her interact with ned or mj on campus

8 i respect how marvel busts out the montage of appearances for chadwick and stan lee during the opening credits wonder if this is the new direction

9 i was upset at how they had pronounced namor when revealing the origin of the name n’amour but like how they properly pronounced it naymore as it was used",2022-11-11 05:38:47
i loved shuri having killmonger’s hair style but nakia still being respectful enough to ask who she really saw ,2022-11-11 05:47:09

"the stakes didnt feel very high for the first half of the movie with the whole protect the scientist mission and what not the scenes involving ironheart and martin freeman seemed like they should have been episodes in their own separate shows rather than a black panther movie

cant help but feel like the attack on wakanda should have been the first plot point rather than the midpoint

overall it was an ok movie namor was dope",2022-11-11 06:35:07
"first one was better 
needed more mbaku and namor

it was fine though",2022-11-11 06:41:16
"there was one scene where shuri was going down a walkway wearing a black top and a necklace that reminded me a lot of tchallas walk

tenoch huerta was great as namor",2022-11-11 06:41:50
"first half was great great mix of chadwick tribute wakanda’s fallout with un tension between talokan and wakanda and i didn’t mind the cia stuff since ross was feeding wakanda intel

after nokia saves shuri the pacing goes down the drain rest of it felt overstuffed and all the plot points were fighting each other for screen time

the other nations looking for vibranium and riri got totally lost in the thick of it",2022-11-11 06:43:52
overall  i was solidly impressed after a string of mcu films that i didn’t particularly enjoy the acting was topnotch across the board and i appreciated that the whole cast got their moment to shine and each felt fully developed especially namor while the cgi was a lot better than the first bp it was very noticeable that they had to keep cutting the shots very rapidly and without flow in a lot of the major fight scenes,2022-11-11 06:44:54

"overall i had a good time and there are many beautiful touching moments but the script was messy and i just didnt care for shuri i dont blame the actress though i mean having to fill chadiwcks shoes is tough

the whole cia part with martin freeman was unnecessary riri completely out of nowhere becomes iron heart really quick didnt care for her either

killmonger showing up was super nice though

this was a tough movie to make so i cant blame ryan and the cast it is what it is and they tried their best",2022-11-11 07:10:16
"to me it felt like the whole cia plot point was leading to ross revealing that it was the cia pushing towards a wakanda war with namor and his people since that is the kind of a precedent with the us government thing…destabilizing countries when they have resources we want but really it was just to set up thunderbolts which is fine just feels forced given all the other stuff going on

but special shout out to ryan coogler whenever they need to introduce a new part of the mcu realm he does in such a unique and natural fashion between the world building of wakanda and now talokan just phenomenal",2022-11-11 07:24:31

i enjoyed it and will see it at least one more time in theaters suffers from a 3rd act problem again but this time for editing the cgi was actually pretty good i really appreciate that it felt like shuri earned the mantle she went through some pain some loss some disillusionment namor was awesome and i’m so glad they didn’t  him off coogler was able to deliver a legit blockbuster anchored by black women and it felt natural not forced or shoehorned excited to see where the characters go from here i miss chadwick and expand m’baku’s role even more are my only real gripes,2022-11-12 01:00:04

"this movie was good honestly expected worse this is definitely a lot of movie also the audio and sfx esp music was incredible for a marvel movie

this movie could honestly be its own film and good without the mcu  which too bad hurts it a lot 1520 min of cia  was really annoying and couldve been cut entirely",2022-11-14 05:47:45
"first half was pretty good lots of build up and decent action also nice to see a villain army who are actually a threat theyre strong agile bulletproof and can heal from fatal wounds

the editing seemed janky lots of quick cuts and awkward slomo wish we saw more talocan

namor is awesome i love this change in his character form the comics my enemies call me namor and the reason why is pretty awesome why

the movie shows that he heroes can look strong even while losing they lost a lot of battles in this movie which is surprising

riri was cool and a nice change in pace but she gets lost in the shuffle halfway into the movie she just becomes another face in the roster",2022-11-14 10:25:43
i get everyone’s criticism of the involvement of sword and ross but it’s logical with the way this story goes because shield is gone naturally anything that involves superheroes and supernatural forces would fall under the jurisdiction of sword and because ross is the only outsider they could trust they would naturally go to him for answers and all of their paths would have to cross yea all this is to help with the build up for thunderbolts but the movie  should definitely make it a bit more apparent perhaps there could’ve been a post credits scene where they summon fontaine before a counsel of world leaders and ask her to spearhead their decision to destabilize wakanda since they believe it is becoming a threat then she could be like “i happen to be putting together a team for stuff like this” and then that would cement her involvement in this film rather than just being in the background like “what is going on”,2022-11-14 16:06:15
is it just me or did the final fight scene have similar movement  cinematography as the siren episode in love death robots,2022-11-16 04:38:21
anyone noticed that when shuri asked namor if he wants a cup of water in the evaporation chamber its exactly like her character does in asking the museum dude from black mirrors black museum not sure if that was intentional or not but i thought that was pretty neat,2022-11-17 07:46:59
was anyone else’s sound weird not sure if it was because where i sat or an issue with the theater or sound mixing in the actual movie but it sounded like there was a big cut in the mid frequencies  a lot of the sound felt pretty hollow  empty felt like many scenes especially the chadwick tributes lost some of the impact because you couldn’t feel the sound,2022-11-17 19:05:34
"question for the comic fans

what did you think about the movie
how does it compare to the comics
with namor and shuri as black panther",2022-11-17 22:32:24
it was a bummer watching a mans fake funeral and then i dont understand why they gave him a secret son why couldnt the son have been living in wakanda all this time is it because he wasnt mentioned in endgame so they thought they had to make him a secret he could have been there even if he wasnt a part of endgame or better yet dont give a son to tchalla just bring on a variant from space or something it makes me feel weird that they added this surprise son because the death is based on chadwick bosemans life and as far as i understand chadwick boseman didnt have children,2022-11-18 22:00:04
"wasnt entirely perfect but it was completely solid and a great attempt at story telling a lot to enjoy  including all the key actors score especially i cant expect every film to carry the weight that this has and while it was a bit long i couldnt help but think how i much prefer this style of film in comparison to the  thor ended up turning into the last couple outings

id probably watch this again certainly one of the more memorable entries but still doesnt top shang chi for me",2022-11-20 12:49:59

this film just really tugged on my heartstrings in all the possible ways the talokan scene along with the ethereal soundtrack con la brisa was absolutely breathtaking i cried like three times throughout this film too the storyline was so good it did feel rushed but obviously thats what happens when you introduce a whole new nation to the timeline well to someone who has never read the comics anyway,2022-11-28 03:29:21

why not just put the scene as the ending to the movie then acknowledge him no one saw it",2022-12-12 05:36:52

"my other thoughts

i’ve only walked out of one movie in a theatre cause it was so bad the hellboy remake and i never felt like doing that for this movie so by that measure it wasn’t horrible but my only thing the mermaid dude just murdered your mom and thousands of other civilians presumably but you’re gonna come flying back on your spaceship like best friends happily ever after ending

okay so then what the  was the point of the movie lol why even make that entire storyline if literally none of it matters at the end",2022-12-13 14:11:18

from black panther to pink panther disappointing,2023-01-31 21:07:06
my favorite parts were the chadwick tribute in the beginning the namor intro and first act break and the killmonger appearance pretty decent nothing horrible but nothing exceptional either,2023-02-11 09:03:04
"i haven’t read any of the comics so am only sharing what i thought based on the movie itself

i really liked namor but the movie as a whole was slow paced and the fighting seemed pointless—would’ve been more interesting seeing wakanda and talokan learning to trust each other learning from each other and then to see talokan defend their borders from the invading us government who were more clearly cast as the villain figure in the movie with help from the wakandans 

the movie overall was only okay and didn’t live up to the hype imo",2023-02-11 18:25:33
"i came into this movie with very low expectations because i just havent been all that into marvels recent showings dr strange and thor specifically

still i feel like this movie surprised me it was a nice change of pace to watch a marvel movie that didnt start cracking jokesquips repeatedly and had a somber tone throughout a big chunk of it there were a few jokes but it never felt excessive 

im a bit iffy on the inclusion of ironheart because it just felt like america chavez all over again with having a random new character serve as a plot device but it didnt hurt the movie too much for me what did hurt was the constant meanwhile in america scenes i kept thinking this would lead to ross doing something substantial but nope just boring scenes really

but even with all that it was an enjoyable watch namor was a great villain and the movie threw some unexpected scenes in like killmongers appearance all the scenes memorializing chadwick boseman definitely caught me in the feels too ",2023-02-19 16:37:41
"i just finished this i enjoyed it i’d say it’s an above average phase 4 film i didn’t love it but it wasn’t bad there were things i really liked namor riri i mean the entire cast really…the world building the film is epic maybe more so than any other mcu film so far and then things that were underwhelming the story some of the action sequences it was a bit anticlimactic 

the mcu has a bit of a tonal problem in my opinion it’s gotten extremely ridiculous and over the top but still treats everything with complete seriousness which makes some of these films a slog to get through this was one of the reasons i think shehulk was one of the best things to come out of phase 4 i know sue me lol it knew exactly what it was and kept to it’s comedic tone and embraced the ridiculousness of it’s premise all the way through this film didn’t steer into the ridiculousness like say aquaman as a similar comparison 

moving forward i’d say the mcu either needs to dial it back and focus on more grounded stories for a little while and then build back up to a thanos level problem…or they need to go really over the top crazy…or go the zach snyder route and make them darker and tone down the jokes…i don’t know the entire mcu has gotten so huge it’s hard to say what to do to fix it at this point all i can say is this film was impressive visually the world building was inspired and the acting and character work was great all around but these films are having a problem being “fun” and exciting while still having sufficient stakes for a thrilling story if that makes sense that’s been a significant problem postendgame imo 

the mcu is still going strong it’s still worth watching but it’s definitely shifted from must see opening weekend entertainment to a solid “wait for streaming” franchise i hope marvel takes all of the phase 4 criticism to heart and actually addresses these issues moving forward and doesn’t just turn this franchise into soulless cash grabs i’m still a huge marvelmcu fan and yes while it’s inevitable something this huge will crash and burn one day i think there’s still enough people behind the scenes that care about the content that we still have many great stories ahead of us

edit forgot to mention it was also a wonderfully moving and respectful love letter to chadwick boseman that ending ",2023-02-19 22:05:36

she mentioned it was a sonic weapon not sure how it works but they seemed susceptible to sonic stuff throughout,2022-11-13 00:03:09
my wife and i were literally having that same discussion on the way home hoping for some insight,2022-11-12 07:32:47
"tldr talokan ancestors consumed a heartshaped herb that differed from wakandans in environmental properties the most notable and obvious being that it grew in water this led them to develop strengths and weaknesses based around sound waves as sound travels nearly five times faster in water than it does in air they have a regenerative factor that is disrupted by sonar weapons  the regenerative powers of the talolan herb are proven when shuri survives her stab wound 

this is a bit of a longwinded response that entirely rides on speculation so bear with me here for a moment

throughout the entirety of black panther 2 there are many recurring themes that are unwritten and rely on the viewers memory to piece together the unspoken events that are unfolding

for instance someone above me mentioned the suit that namor provided to shuri and specifically how its likely that its the same suit used by the two st6 operatives at the start of the film when namor defends his vibranium

even the driving force of xenophobia due to fear of being subjugated to the powerhungry western world via namor and the talokans is a near 1for1 parallel to the fear of outsiders that we see in the first black panther when wakanda suffers inner conflict when debating how to defend their home and resources due to being exposed to outsiders shuri effectively plays the same role that ross did in the first movie when she acts as the inside woman in talokan

keeping all this in mind the reason talokan powers arent explained is because theyve primarily been explained before but in the first movie each talokan had originally consumed the heartshaped herb which provided them with supersoldier qualities at a bare minimum we see this as the baseline even with the descendants of the herbconsumers when okoye fights the soldiers on the bridge  though her combat skill and technique is far better one swing from attuma was enough to propel her across a bridge while her spear was driven into the concrete to provide resistance so far the only talokan we know to possess longevity is namor himself and since hes seen as a literal  amongst his people we can safely assume hes the only one amongst them who is immortal

throughout the movie we see evidence that talokans are immune to basic forms of physical offense such as when conventional bullets were fired at them even though okoyes spear is made of vibranium vibranium itself doesnt possess any inherent magical abilities unless you count caps shield defying the laws of physics but thats probably just writerinduced heroism we also see frequency as a prominent theme in not only this movie but the first as well  vibranium is an excellent conduit for channeling frequencies which is why some tech in wakanda is soundbased nakias weapon doesnt fire live rounds  its a blast of channeled frequency

think of it like a video game where certain weapons are effective against certain opponents  there might be a juggernaut or a knight with thousands of pounds of armor on them to deflect any physical blow that glances them but a single fireball could ruin their day because magic bypasses armor

relating this to the heartshaped herb of wakanda its obviously not an exact fit as griot attested to the fact that the replica of the talokan herb was only roughly a 98 match im willing to bet the missing 2 is a regenerative factor against conventional weapons edit this is further explained when shuri is stabbed by namors vibranium spear and walks it off we never see her require aid and she seems completely fine following the fight

going even further the talokan powers and weaknesses are also explained to function primarily on frequency as well this makes sense as  the sirens use song to lure their enemies into the water on two separate occasions and the wakandans use a sonar weapon at the end to disrupt the foot soldiers that cant just use their ankle wings to yeet themselves outta the water

so using context clues my best closing argument is this

the talokans possess a regenerative factor against conventional weapons but due to their genealogy theyre reliant on and susceptible to sonarbased attacks nakias weapon firing sound waves most likely disrupts or even eliminates their healing factor",2022-11-13 20:47:18
i think nakia said she shot her with a sonar gun or something and at the range she shot her it was a lethal shot  it wasnt a regular bullet,2022-11-12 23:49:42
i’m not understanding why the talokan soldiers on the street survived the mortal wounds but then the ones in the third act battle seemingly just die left and right do only the important soldiers have the “can’t  them easily“ power,2022-11-14 08:21:51
bad writing,2022-11-19 08:45:50
i would love an answer to this too couldn’t figure it out,2022-11-12 18:17:08
"watched the movie twice its not very clearly addressed but it seems namors people are sensitive to sonic type weapons thats why their ship at the end had the big sonic generator

but then why didnt they arm most of their soldiers with sonic rifles or spears from the first movie as opposed to regular spears dont know i feel a lot of fight scenes and choreography isnt exactly top notch

still enjoyed it though",2022-11-16 17:26:08
"my partner and i had the same argument our theory is that stabpuncture wounds are within the limits of talokan healing abilities but sonic weapons probably mangle a wound something bad and is beyond their ability to heal the area that needs healing is really different too like a couple punctures vs puncture the width of 15 baseball bats 

but the fact that we need to theorize this is bad storytelling in a way",2022-11-13 04:47:57
yeah i was extremely confused by that too why even showing they can resurrect if it wont ever matter in the slightest,2022-11-15 00:54:14
this entire movie was shoddily written,2022-12-13 15:18:42
i believe as long as they are wet they can heal from physical wounds similar to how namor needed to get to water in the end to regenerate the sonic attack seemed to be something they couldn’t quite regenerate from though,2022-11-13 22:07:55
the healing was never brought up or explained at any point after that it was annoying,2023-01-12 23:13:56
my theory is that namor chose not to save the soldier in order to justify attack on wakanda,2022-11-13 05:54:23
nakia was using an energy weapon,2022-11-13 16:33:49
or they should’ve shown that if they stab them in the head then it’s lethal and they can’t heal from it,2022-12-31 14:32:10
i think those were civilians,2022-11-12 15:41:15

not a single other character for the funeral was so weird to me i get wakanda is segregated but a quick bucky would have been awesome it would have made sense for the character he rehabilitated there,2022-11-12 22:41:53
"i have no clue what marvel was thinking with iron hearts suit design it looks awful which is weird because the comic book suits look great 

my only guess is marvel wants riri to eventually design the real suit herself and this was nothing more than a wakandan tech prototypeoneoff design even so it could have been better lookingthe suit just looked really out of place and awkward",2022-11-15 04:41:02
ironheart suit looks like walle’s girlfriend eve what are you talking about,2022-11-15 22:27:43
pepper of all people,2022-11-15 06:27:36
i gathered that the funeral was more of a private matter for them its plausible bucky did pay his respects in private or before the ritual,2022-11-15 10:01:07
it wasn’t the time and place for a cameo regardless of it making sense in universe,2022-11-16 04:52:40
"yeah for a bp film there is very little bp

she just shows up at the end and be like k im ready to fight the big bad",2022-11-16 11:08:51
the only other avenger that shouldve been there is bucky his absence is definitely felt and i hope they explain it later,2022-11-13 03:44:10
" and minor gripe but it did feel kinda weird that none of the other avengers were there for tchallas funeral

i imagine they all turned up for the public memorialsecular ceremonywhatever that would have been held for a public figurehead of state while this was the religious ceremony that wasnt open to everyone",2022-11-27 04:40:06
i didn’t think about the absence of the avengers at the time but it’s spot on i only noted nakia’s i would’ve liked to see bucky at least i don’t rmbr infinity wars well but i don’t think the other avengers have been to wakanda have they,2022-11-20 00:12:53
"the midnight angel suits made me think of rowlet

i mean they looked like owls intentionally",2022-11-19 09:37:13
i get why both suits looked goofy it’s ironshesrts mark 2 and shuris mark one it makes sense in my head cannon they would not be streamlined as good as tony’s final versions we saw,2022-11-14 21:26:36
"yeah we were really missing a black panther hero moment to show off the new suit like i know she has her arm cannons but we’ve seen that last movie and they actually had a better moment

i wanted to see some new crazy tech that made everyone go oooh but that didn’t happen",2022-11-13 16:49:41
it’s almost like “loki brother of thor”,2022-11-14 04:11:23
maybe they didnt want yo reveal tchalla death that soon considering how secretive they are,2022-11-17 00:39:27
i thought it was a metroid suit,2022-11-20 11:11:28
"the problem now that avengers are out as a whole is that there always needs to be a reason why we cant just call the avengers when people need help  


its like theyre all on speed dial why cant wakanda just hit up all the other avengers gondor calls for aid",2023-02-20 05:58:57
ri jumped from 0 to 100 hate that we didnt get to see her build up,2022-11-19 08:52:21
my guess was the queen closed the borders her husband was killed outside of wakanda her son opens up about wakanda then dies she doesnt trust anyone including tchalas allies,2023-02-28 10:55:38
rowletlike suit for okoye really izz the deal,2023-02-11 14:26:53
hahaha pokemon thats where ive seen it before thank you,2023-02-16 22:57:37
just finished the movie and was more reminded of the predators from alien vs predators but not in a good way what’s with the tassles,2023-07-06 00:43:13
namor even says when hes talking to shuri that its not about riri anymore because conflict is inevitable its so contrived,2022-11-15 04:21:45
yeah like america chavez before her riri williams was just a plot device which i think is a really lazy habit of mcu in phase 4 they just throw in a young new character with some barely explained super power or talent to build up some interest in the character before their more extended appearance in a disney show both of them didn’t really get much of a chance to do anything other than be some sort of deus ex machina in their respective movies,2022-11-19 12:49:37
" also why is she still just in school when shes basically made the most important invention in modern history

that whole character felt so annoyingly ridiculously out of place it was terrible even for a marvel movie the character itself was also exceedingly annoying

edit also considering how intelligent she supposedly was she appeared very dumb in the movie especially during the first encounter in the dorm this character just doesnt make any sense whatsoever",2022-11-27 00:18:39
didnt martin freeman say that she was the only person on the planet who knows how to build one and it seemed to me like the cia didnt know how to reverse engineer it so her just simply being alive was enough to make her a danger in namors eyes idk that was how i interpreted it i didnt really take issue with namors motivation for going after her,2022-11-15 23:42:54
yeah like if access to vibranium is basically the biggest geopolitical issue why did the cia swipe her machine and leave her alone rather than recruiting her and giving her a big pile of money to make more stuff for them or at least have a guard on her,2022-11-20 17:35:06
"riri didnt know that the cia was using her machine at all its implied it was taken by mitthe cia even if she did know she assumes like the rest of the world that vibranium was only in wakanda

namor destroyed their machine the first time and wanted to  riri to send a message  i assume he would keep destroying machines until the message was recieved",2022-11-14 22:03:39
most useless character in the movie she really added nothing to the movie other than being an early plot device i doubt many people would buy that shes a genius scientist,2022-11-19 14:59:09
that all made no sense to me her character didn’t seem to serve any logical purpose,2022-11-22 04:10:29
"don’t forget the ending where it seems that cia completely forgot about her and gave up all of their intentions to do so… and how did the writers explain that shuri says “i got it covered fam”
brainless writing",2022-11-29 01:12:35
agree i didnt care for the riri character at all and thought it was just so we had an american character,2022-11-17 06:42:48
"my brother mentioned this when we walked out of the main exit for the theatre why did they need to  her they obviously built another machine

it would have made sense that she was close to building a machine and if kept alive only her genius would eventually lead to them building a machine and finding talocan",2022-11-26 09:07:12
im confused what makes her a plot device instead of a proper character,2022-11-21 15:15:04
"when she says i have a differential equation class i lold she could probably teach the class why is she even in school shes definitely not learning anything new

also when namor captured why didnt she just  the riri i mean his henchmen were about to  her in cold blood on the bridge and now all of a sudden shes safe i dont get it",2023-02-11 06:22:32
i agree with the part where shes still in school lmaooo like girlie u gotta drop out man,2022-11-28 03:31:15
i would much rather they had ironheart introduced in iron man 4 with pepper  happy as a continuance of tonys legacy and used amadeus cho or someone else as the genius inventor,2023-02-02 18:54:53
they made it seem like the government takes the ideas from school kids and riri is not even upset about it,2023-02-08 11:58:04
yeah riri kinda ,2022-11-30 08:03:41
that kind of detail makes this sort of movie impossible  its an exercise in suspension of disbelief,2023-03-16 01:08:41

"1 yet somehow he could defeat the spanish with 4 villagers on his side and no weapons of powers to speak off besides water breathing and ankle wings

2 and he didn’t think to completely  off all the spanish invaders and liberate mexico",2022-11-29 01:35:55
lol dude why a starbucks,2022-12-29 19:21:52
both the countries look like total joke in the way they were fighting,2022-11-11 16:20:57
the idea of going out into the ocean to fight a numerically superior force that thrives in that environment was pretty  also namors army kind of forgot that they could make people commit suicide through song they also chose to bring like 300 people to a fight even though they apparently had more soldiers than all the blades of grass in wakanda,2022-11-14 04:51:51
that entire fight makes very little sense to me they got a massive boat with no defenses that they just stand on and resort to punching people,2022-11-11 15:22:33
fr lol i told my friend that 3 ac130s could probably finish the battle in a minute they never get the scale right for this stuff,2022-11-11 17:23:21
they spent all of their budget on war rhinos,2022-11-12 18:54:33
they even said something like well bring them away from the water and the next scene is all of them in a freaking boat lol,2022-11-13 07:04:46
they needed it on the water surface to draw namor out the purpose of that entire encounter was to capture namor and  him still they sacrificed easily 100200 of there soldiers in the process stark contrast to namor going to war with wakanda over 2 of his citizens being killed,2022-11-11 21:06:37
yeah i was thinking geez let’s bring a boat in water where the enemy obviously has superiority,2022-11-13 06:17:30
i couldnt believe they brought a friggin boat to fight a waterbased people lol,2022-11-14 19:12:09
attacking a water nation on the ocean when your own country is landlocked is also a questionable strategic decision to say the least,2022-11-16 08:56:24
"thank you this annoyed the wife and i a great deal one boat with one sonic emitter ffs the wakandans got worfed so hard michael dorn should have got a royalty check

and dont get me started with all the wakandan aircraft that cant hit stationary targets with explosive weaponry",2022-11-17 16:46:27
the plan wasn’t to destroy talokan it was to draw out namor to capture him in that ship with the heater they had to take not too many people as to ruin their surprise attack but just enough to put up a resistance to his band he would take with him,2022-11-13 00:00:49
yea that had me scratching my head too,2022-11-13 05:29:15
"no naval tradition

wakanda may be the technological apex of earth but theyve never had to mount a naval campaign or cross the choppy seas with 300000 people

so it makes sense theyd only bring one boat",2022-11-14 23:47:48
the comics do this way better tchalla infiltrates giants badass warships into the the hudson river to show them whos boss and when the us threatens him he crashes the stock market,2022-11-16 16:57:21
that was an absolutely horrid battle plan like yea sure lets attack these super mermaid people in their own turf we dont need backup only a single boat will do if they were to sink our boat then we all die immediately,2022-11-15 03:49:39
aquaman’s atlantis was so much better,2022-11-20 11:14:21
i was too i was fully team namor and was rooting for him not that i disliked the wakandans or anything i just felt that he made some good points,2022-11-12 04:05:42
right okay these enemies are dominant in water lets fight them on a big boat thatll work,2022-11-19 09:06:26
i’ve got an idea let’s fight the water people in the middle of the ocean  this film  let’s all stop trying to pretend it was great,2022-11-21 07:38:23
lol me too wakandans became so annoying my wife fell asleep on this snooze fest later i told her i wanted that namor dude to win so bad gotta love the continuing hollywood trope of making men disappear from the world,2022-12-24 16:21:41
you’d think they prepare some kind of suits for underwater battle suited with a breathing machine or propeller feet,2022-11-21 01:19:49
for a super advanced civilization they have awful battle tactics in every film theyre in all they ever do is throw up energy shields and use spears,2022-12-05 05:28:07
namor was arrogant and wakanda knew he would personally come after one boat it provided a distraction,2023-03-01 07:14:57
"i still dont understand why the wakandans have the  boat thing in the first place why do you have or need a boat

its big and bulky and they had to have moved it to the middle of the ocean if namors whale army support system or any of his citizens dont notice that im extremely confused i get the stealth tech but was nobody else paying attention

if the enemy can get in wakanda anyway i get that theyll wait one week to attack but why wouldnt they spy nobody is worried about them coming back while all the other  went on

makes no sense to me",2022-11-20 23:19:39
"me too with namor

about the ship i thought they wanted to simulate the underwater signal from a vibranium detector to lure the talokans out",2022-11-23 05:25:00

why the  did the entirety of wakandas air forces like 10 aircraft they literally had an entire week to prepare too no wonder they got destroyed even in the second battle they chose to fight the ocean people in the ocean and bring only about 50 people onboard at that what the ,2023-06-14 12:37:57
hes a fishman drying him out is kind of the obvious solution and shuri is a smarty pants,2022-11-16 17:17:40
i feel like the  france thing was a commentary on france’s realworld history of colonialism and modern day military presence in african countries,2022-11-14 16:28:13
" but nah black panther 2 is like  that  humans  france for some reason and  the world we’re just gonna forget that ever happened and share nothing with y’all 

the conflict with france started cause they had outreach centers they were trying to rob

nobody forgot wakanda is helping or there would be nothing for france to try to steal in mali or wherever 

theyre just not bending over and giving miracle materials to other nations which is why its the major nations that are mad",2022-11-15 23:33:43
i saw it more as were going to help the world but were going to do it on our own terms our own way  giving colonial governments vibranium technology aint it,2022-11-21 22:37:23
"they didnt bring it up much but they showed that wakanda was much more involved with the outside world than before

that attack by france was on a wakanda facility outside their borders",2022-11-14 21:46:14
 france lol they were trying to steal tons of vibranium hahahah they got tired of not having any and said  the treaty were running a covert mission it makes sense they had to scale it back and focus on wakanda vs talokan who was actively trying to take them out,2022-11-21 14:50:07
it was nice seeing some other country besides the us be the bad guys even though the us was still involved with the  smh,2022-11-16 06:09:37
"and now wakanda has promised to guard atlantic vibranium veins from the rest of the world yeah it will surely work fine that they claim resources in mexicos territorial waters  

and they hope that the honor 400year old guy who is praised as a  by his people will keep them from another fishmen retaliation because they have no means of defeating him again without microwave trick",2022-11-22 19:35:37
"personally i think it made sense for wakanda to backpedal with ramonda on the throne shes from the older generation she and her late husband were very much isolationists its one thing to quietly support your sons radical ideas while hes ruling the nation its quite another to enact them when youre handed the reins after his untimely death

i half joked with my sister that it was a good thing that she was killed off as she might have gradually dragged wakanda back their old ways",2022-12-12 00:51:15
how could it help in a way that matters giving its technology it was stated why that isnt an option not using vibranium for evil is already unrealistic and wakanda is risking its tech to help which i think is fair,2022-11-27 21:37:21
well she mentioned that once t’challa died the other nations thought they were weak and wanted to steal from them could have been a little better explained but it seems like the reason for the change was bc other nations wanted to take advantage once black panther was gone,2022-12-28 01:18:21
"“ france for some reason” when western nations conveniently forget their history of colonialism 

i think the movie was extremely accurate to what nations would look to exploit a resource rich nation",2022-12-04 19:47:57
there was no way to predict how other countries would react looks like they reacted in the worst way possible so wakanda reacted to how they reacted,2023-01-12 21:26:23
i just want an entire documentary on talokan namor and his people lol universal will never give us more than what we got,2023-01-11 17:01:58
"i thought wakanda tried sharing its resources with the world and the world proved to be hostile and greedy so they had to isolate themselves again

id love to see a movie about wakanda going to war with the united states which seemed to be where everything was headed just straight up make valentina de fontaine the villain who orchestrates a war with wakanda and have a jingoistic and colonialist us be all for it too bad it wont happen though theres no way disney would allow that if they did they would probably have to show that it was really aliens or dr doom pulling the strings so we dont look too much like the bad guys",2023-02-07 16:41:55
yeah i was definitely rooting for brown beret over black panther,2022-12-27 01:02:04
t’challa stood for helping out the oppressed across the world not giving his  to government powers,2023-02-05 14:52:56
" but nah black panther 2 is like  that  humans  france for some reason and  the world we’re just gonna forget that ever happened and share nothing with y’all what an awesome way to honor t’challas passing by just forgetting what he stood for just ignoring it entirely actually in the first 10 minutes of the movie

movie made zero  sense worst thing is that it had all the elements to actually be an engaging story that focused on dramaloss

heres how i would have fixed it 

originally tchalla is sick just like the movie he like many other regular people didnt realize it was the case til it was very advanced he uses a new treatment but tries to live a peaceful life with his secret sonwife

1 this would have been a very interesting plot point both in humanizing the hero something very interesting we also saw in superman allstars for example and also as a plot point on to how he was defeated this is an unknown fact to shuri and the spectator more on 2

2 just like we saw at the start countriesgroupsoutsiders are actively trying to steal vibranium and tchalla is fighting those attempts unfortunately due to the graveness and advancements of his sickness he is mortally wounded by some nationextremist group all we know at this point is that he is killed

3 wakanda obviously feels attacked by this and rethinks their contributions to the world but does not entirely withdraw from the un due to tchallas desires and the queens ruledesire for peace

4 shuris hate for the world and desire to burn the world makes much more sense since his brother was literally killed by outsiders due to greed

5 shuri fixes the flower  warmonger and vengeance is a major plot point from the get go she turns into bp and goes into a quest to find his brothers killer against his mothers wishes

6 while investigating a group that has found vibranium in the ocean so does namor they clash but ultimately she gets invited to namors hometown and gets tempted into this idea of an alliance to keep the peace while namor is actively trying to sell her on the idea of enacting revenge into the world

7 namor gets brought into wakanda which lowers their defenses and eventually the queen is given an ultimatum which she reject   this is like halfway down the movie battle ensues queen dies wakanda submits and shuri flees helped by her sister in law unknown to her 

most if not all up to this point is told is back and forths between present time and flashbacks where little by little we get to piece the facts together while at the same time getting some actions without having to wait 2  hours make the powerful scene between the queen mother and shuri make the conflict about them and make her feel guilty over  revenge

8 she reveals that tchala was sick he had cancer found out late he treated himself which gave him precious years with his son reveal but to no avail 

9 shuri comes to accept that she was wrong vengeance is not the way

10 movie progresses and ends up pretty much in the same way showing that most of what happened was namors plan anyway

is that a masterpiece  no but at the very least serviceable and makes sense

 with bilbo and iron heart  that served literally zero purpose and only distracted from the plot",2023-02-07 00:01:45
"marvel has become very sloppy with narrative continuity

thor love and thunder introduced two things eternity and thors ability to empower asgardians that invalidate past movies’ moments or break their logic",2022-11-12 18:46:22
"yeah that struck me too lol
no mention of ultron the killer robot that almost destroyed the world a few years ago",2022-11-11 14:34:13
yeah that line seemed incredibly ignorant she literally worked with vision in infinity war,2022-11-11 20:30:42
wakanda just kinda forgot about ultron,2022-11-11 18:52:11
i think it is supposed to be my ai is not like the movies mother it is subbedtranslated like that in my country so it is not ai in general just her ai wont rebel like jarvis never betray tony,2022-11-12 00:51:45
yeah i noticed that too,2022-11-11 14:46:36
i feel like it was supposed to be a joke i laughed anyways,2022-11-12 04:36:01
i thought she said my ai,2022-11-14 01:12:39
marvel writing these days has really gone to  i mean we went from thors mighty hammer to thors jealous sentient hammer with no explanation    weird  phase 4,2022-11-11 19:06:30
she also lives in a world where a norse  showed up in her country to battle alien invaders but somehow her people’s gods are too much so  i guess that’s two things where the movie is hindered by it’s setting i don’t mind it too much however,2022-11-12 07:21:27
dear  so many of these comments you are taking a joke line so  seriously,2022-11-12 18:23:31
idk if it was ever established to the public what ultron was and the true nature of it i feel like if most people knew there would way more disdain for tony than there ever was but sokovia is always referred to as an avengers  as opposed to a villain’s,2022-11-13 01:52:09
thats just how forgettable ultron was which is shame,2022-11-14 17:50:30
i figured that was part of the joke and that she just never learned of what happened with ultron the reasoning for her not knowing is less clear though,2022-12-21 00:41:35
would have been funnier if she saiditd be pretty arrogant to build an ai without any safeguards in place,2022-11-15 03:31:02
they literally live in a universe where an ai created them for movies and tv,2022-11-12 08:22:26
ai  the mind stone people forget tony even said he didnt do  the only thing they did was leave the scepter in a room with an unfinished ai,2022-11-13 10:52:48
right i hoped in that movement she would have at least referenced ultron,2022-11-12 20:33:51
that’s some inexcusable continuity sloppiness  there,2022-11-16 07:42:16
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm… poor ultron,2022-11-12 04:18:48
in my screening there was a scene where it showed age of ultron was retconned as a movie within the mcu,2022-11-12 10:03:39
that was little tech industry propaganda,2022-11-13 03:53:46
i thought she was just implying that her own ai is better than ultron in that it wouldnt go rogue because she is smarter and etc,2022-11-14 16:18:35
the i see there is no man in charge ultron gif would be perfect here,2022-11-15 07:40:21
they really arent making the best out of this new phase at all,2022-11-15 17:21:55
i was waiting for the ultron reference and it never came  i was like how the  do you not mention that,2022-11-16 06:12:04
tbf ultron was far beyond anything in the known universe because stark and banner plagiarized stuff from an infinity stone to make him,2022-11-26 11:10:01
that has got to be the dumbest line in the series  ultron and everything about him was directly tied to wakanda events that shaped the entire world they live in  have these writers seen any of the other movies,2022-11-28 22:07:03

i wonder if she will bulk up for upcoming movies,2022-11-12 15:21:41

if it makes you feel any better the suits are pulled directly from the comics and look almost identical probably why it didn’t translate too well live action,2022-11-15 05:26:49
my friend had a fish halloween mask and it weirdly looked like her the helmet section of her suit so every time i was seeing her my mind instantly was going to that and i was thinking shes an overgrown fish or something fighting for namor,2022-11-12 02:38:08
made me think of sammael from the 1st hellboy movie,2022-11-11 18:12:10
loved the movie but that suit and the scientist girls suit looked ridiculous to me they should’ve came up with better designs  looked like some power rangers ,2022-11-13 22:25:38
 sonic,2022-11-11 22:42:32
a mix of sonic and the predator in a bad way,2022-11-13 05:09:56

i literally turned to my friend i was watching the movie with and just said predator and he understood instantly,2022-11-14 05:49:56
looked like a terrible take on predator to me but i see the sonic too  man the color and suit were just awful,2022-11-14 19:07:38
looked like a blue kit fisto,2022-11-16 18:57:28
predator vibes too,2022-11-12 03:03:49
i thought more of the predator lol,2022-11-12 09:34:06

kit fisto,2022-11-20 08:07:24
i though blue predator,2022-11-21 05:43:22
looked like a mix between megaman and a predator,2022-11-27 13:30:27
the prince reveal was somewhat expected as soon aa i heard that nakia had disappeared at some point but it doesn’t make a lot of sense why wouldn’t they tell shuri especially around the time t’challa dies and how would anyone think it was a better idea to leave them alone in haiti rather than in wakanda didn’t work out so well for killmonger to be alienated from his people,2022-11-13 10:43:01
i dont think queen mother knew she had a grandson nakia said they met because he was the first kid to spot queen mother and asked if she was looking for the headmistress they met but there wasnt acknowledgement of who he is more apparent when she asked nakia why she didnt come to the funeral and nakia said it was too difficult and final instead of being like i was taking care of your grandchild to the queen shuri is the future and only heir and her safety and retrieval is far too important for wakanda,2022-11-13 10:54:36
felt like they wrote the movie then just threw that in there,2022-11-17 03:52:47
i think the reasoning there was that it was so deep in the ocean and only able to track once the cia got a one of a kind vibranium tracking machine,2022-11-11 04:25:54
its kinda  that it never occurred to them to look for vibranium around the area where the biggest asteroid in history crashed,2022-11-13 07:02:57
i get that theres vibranium but how did they mine and forge it that deep underwater to start their technology has to start somewhere,2022-11-20 19:51:30
bigger issue is that both the civilizations dont give off trust with vibranium any more than all the other nations they literally go to war with each other over smaller things again with all the free energy and denying it to people its really not believable at all they had little to no conflicts and werent just as  as everyone else,2022-11-13 07:19:27
"im willing to give that a pass 

how many newly industrialised countries in real life bothered looking for and mining for minerals underwater im guessing practically none logistically its a nightmare compared to on land and youd expect most of the sea bed to be sedimentary compared to on land where you have a lot more igneous rocks and thus mineral formation youd be searching for a needle in a haystack on the off chance you find an asteroid 

for oil it only became worth it after it already became instrumental for modern life and wed almost perfected tools for detecting it through looking for it on land and even then we had good reason to posit that thered be wells of oil underground under the sea 

i think a good parallel is how nobody is looking for rare earth minerals used in smart phones and the like out at sea now  anyone would say its not worth it even on land we only recently discovered that africa is host to a wealth of rare earth metals despite their importance in modern electronics and china largely having a stranglehold on the market",2023-02-17 01:28:43
nunchucks aren’t range weapons…,2022-11-15 06:35:03
she encrypted her designs but lost the key and locked herself out so had to build a quantum computer to break her own encryption it holds up from a computing perspective but if a kid can make a functional quantum computer in a garage then its not going to hold up to the ciashield in the mcu for more than a few minutes,2022-11-13 15:32:41
she just casually smarter than everyone else in the entire mcu,2022-11-13 07:32:42
my favorite is she’s a world class computer scientist radiologist and mechanical engineer………and she’s taking differential equations a freshman level math course,2022-12-21 04:11:03
that’s actually a thing with modern encryption it doesn’t matter if you know the encryption method if you’ve lost or don’t have the key then you’re stuck just guessing combinations over and over which can take billions of years but quantum computers can theoretically brute force the key much faster,2022-11-12 09:36:02
i mean thats literally the most practical use for quantum computing because of the number of computations it can do per second,2022-11-16 05:30:42

big word sound smart,2022-11-29 01:41:39
sounds like bs but a quantum computer would be what you would need to crack complex encryption codes,2022-11-17 05:28:53

i was legit scared of her in that scene like  scared of a parent as a child when being scolded to be honest she was fantastic in every scene she was in doing serious work weve all known bassett as one of the best living actresses since whats love got to do with it but  she was a tour de force in this movie im not with marvel but i dont know i might throw a little scratch into an oscar nom campaign if i were them,2022-11-12 04:29:52
i thought the acting in general was pretty good and raw especially for a marvel movie,2022-11-12 06:44:57
when it cut to okoye the incredible badass warrior general cowering like a frightened child under ramonda’s fury i was like holy  this is oscarlevel work from angela basset,2022-11-12 00:09:43
ngl im kinda mad we wont have her in the next movie she was pretty much acting rings around everyone,2022-11-14 00:23:36
which makes the death scene even more painful  okoye screaming “mama” at her when she won’t wake up…,2022-11-14 04:34:14
she should be nominated for best supporting actress and i’m not exaggerating she was that  good in this film literally felt like i was watching royalty but let’s face it bassett is hollywood royalty could be the first acting nomination for an mcu film too,2022-11-12 03:14:05
"her wigs were so distracting though
  
youre marveldisney do better hairline blending",2022-11-14 18:53:08
angela went hard i hope she finally gets her oscar,2022-11-12 06:34:59
best scene in the movie imo believable too within the story,2022-11-15 12:20:13
she needs an oscar for that that was the one scene i got emotional at,2022-11-13 23:12:14
shes a great actress and delivers that heartbroken figure very well,2022-11-14 00:17:48
" angela bassett killed it as ramonda the scene where she yells at okoye felt so raw

that scene and killmongershuri were the best for me

i also liked namor when he wasnt actively trying to genocide nations",2022-11-21 23:58:51
yes shes a great actress my problem with this scene however was the writing her character has been created as a stoic honorable compassionate yet pragmatic woman and she would have never fired okoye in that situation,2022-11-16 01:20:07
i was just thinking i hope she didn’t have to project her voice like that for multiple takes the damage to her vocal cords would be irreversible,2022-11-20 00:34:26
it was very very sad that she died before the 2 of them could “make up” again basically their last words spoken to eachother was a fight ,2022-12-12 05:42:19
right i was impressed with her arms she is ripped as  and those arms were super impressive,2022-11-20 04:54:46
right babysit me,2022-11-16 16:20:49
shes a millionaire so she has access to the best skin care products and has an expensive make up team working on her everyday shes on set most people in hollywood look younger than they actually are when they are on screen,2022-11-12 17:38:15
there are a lot of senior actresses who are still fine as  sharon stone selma hayek,2023-02-01 23:56:13
based on cooglers interviews i believe it would have been somewhat similar in terms of namor being the antagonist i think it was always planned that he would have a son and would have been mourning the 5 years lost of his early life,2022-11-11 17:05:21
namor probably kills his mom,2022-11-12 06:22:51
all of the black panther fighting scenes were 100 meant for him shuri just went from a nerd to a super skilled fighter over night he spent his entire life preparing to be one,2022-11-28 19:01:48
commented this below but at the screening i went to the writers said it was gonna be a movie about tchallas son spending a summer vacation with him in wakanda kind of a coparenting type deal,2022-11-15 06:12:57
maybe the black panther would have been in more than 10 minutes of the 2hr40min runtime,2022-11-14 13:58:25
similar side and villain plots tchalla would have an existential crisis because of the snap,2022-11-15 00:15:31
can these guys even write this film was so bad i have had more fun  myself,2022-11-15 15:50:22
"same  chadwick wouldve been sidelined again and they were gonna introduce shuri as bp anyways chadwick was actually annoyed marvel has a habit of disrespecting the black superheroes in the mcu by downplaying their characters

they did it war machine falcon panther heard they doing it to masherala ali in blade he is thinking of quitting",2022-11-15 17:10:12
i still wish nakia was the new black panther but i guess it makes sense why she wouldnt be by the end of the film,2022-11-14 19:16:38
 took extra time crafting lupita shes gorgeous,2022-11-15 12:44:48
datasswasfatjpeg,2022-11-14 21:32:52
 my goodness,2022-11-12 22:17:01
first words after the movie for me were “do i have a lupita crush now”,2022-11-18 18:51:45
"i thought it was just me

she has phatty

t h i i c",2022-11-13 00:16:08
she looks so good in this movie,2022-11-13 01:47:48
bruh you aint lying every time she was on screen i was distracted,2022-11-13 03:39:24
shes so  beautiful,2022-11-20 05:45:12
 lord have merthy,2022-11-13 03:42:58
her walk tho… ,2022-11-14 07:38:05
glad to see i’m not the only one who was distracted by lupita ,2022-11-13 03:45:15
i couldn’t get over angela bassett myself,2022-11-22 04:14:05
i wanted to see so much of her  she is kenyanmexican so she definitely has the best of both worlds there and is absolutely beautiful  i knew she was of mexican origin but when she busted out spanish when she went undercover in that village she surpassed even my greatest expectations for her,2022-11-29 06:18:51
"sweet caroline

good times never seemed so good",2022-11-17 07:21:33
,2022-11-12 21:26:13
i felt that they were trying to hide that thing most the time,2022-11-13 20:08:20
in my theater the cleaning crew came out and told everyone there’s no post credits scene and was trying to get everyone out and nobody wanted to leave lol,2022-11-11 04:17:50
and if you are dumb like me mid credits means after the first titlecard credits end not halfway through the scrolling credits,2022-11-11 03:37:48
" there is no end credits scene only a midcredits scene

i wouldnt even call it that its basically the last scene of the film cut in half 

someone is sure to correct me but i think this is the only mcu film besides endgame that does not have a true end credit scene leading to another film 

i think it was because when they had to rewrite the script they had no idea if the film would actually get made so they couldnt have other filmsshows dependent on a set up in this one",2022-11-12 07:48:59
i went with a group that doesn’t typically see marvel movies they were all tired and itching to go when the credits rolled i convinced everyone to wait and told them it’s always 2 endcredits scenes ended up just looking like an idiot and  everyone off haha,2022-11-12 06:43:32
my friend held her  for the full credits thinking there was going to be a post credits scene,2022-11-12 15:20:03
"theres a postcredits scene if you see it at an alamo drafthouse

chadwick is still watching",2022-11-11 23:03:19
whats the difference,2022-11-11 06:46:57
good to know since my theater cut off video immediately after the mid credit scene for some idiotic reason,2022-11-11 04:26:06
imo they need to stop doing the end end creditsits really annoying,2022-11-19 18:34:33
the good news is that it doesn’t try to force in a cameo or appetizer either,2022-11-13 06:13:07
good i hate the end credit scenes let the theater employees get in there and clean before the next showing,2022-11-11 13:44:01
good end credits are dumb,2022-11-12 01:34:14
i have always stayed through all of a movie’s credits long before marvel started putting scenes there it’s my way of giving respect to the other workers on the movie i can’t read all the names but i give them my 3 minutes,2022-11-30 19:41:56
any chance of a spoiler im prob not gonna go see it,2022-11-12 18:59:17
what a disappointment too since the midcredit scene was barely anything  it was clear that woman had a 6year old in hiding  they didnt have to make it this big reveal,2022-11-12 23:30:12
probably just stunned them like they did those french soldiers earlier in the film,2022-11-13 11:26:56
"like when batman learns hes been killing people all this time

 hes asleep  when criminals fight me its exhausting because im good  they often have to nap after  poor little guy hes all tuckered out",2022-11-16 17:04:02
riri also blew up all those cops at the bridge,2022-11-21 03:01:57
riri definitely killed like 10 cops  now the government wants her for different reasons,2023-01-11 17:04:57
kod like the french sof operatives,2022-11-13 17:00:57
does it matter hahaahhah they are in the movie for less than a min,2022-11-21 14:43:35
reminded me of a predator,2022-11-11 03:21:01
"nobody in the film liked those suits except shuri every time they came up someone mocked them

i thought it was lampshadehanging so they could get redesigned i cant believe the madlads actually used that ",2022-11-12 20:39:06
that  still looked better than whatever riri was using,2022-11-11 06:14:32
looked like a wakandan sonic the hedgehog cosplay,2022-11-12 15:07:59
i find it funny that half the movie was so dark you could hardly see anything especially underwater like some of the fights then at the end when they finally have a fight in the day those ironheart and midnight angel suits looked like straight ,2022-11-11 12:32:00
as hideous as they were unfortunately it was pretty comic accurate they shouldve take some artistic liberties with the design,2022-11-15 03:34:44
like why dont they just make more panther suits,2022-11-12 20:35:07
"im starting to wonder if the ugliness was intended like some inside joke no one thought that suit looked badass even when she was wearing it

also when okoye asked shuri how many suits she made i was expecting the entire malage outfitted with them she had only made two",2022-11-14 15:21:36
was hoping we would get a scene where she tells shuri that the suit was cool but make it in her style  she has a specific aesthetic and it would be cool to see a suit that fits her fashion sense that black blazer with the red bodysuit underneath was breathtaking and would be cool as  if it were actually armor or a nano spidermanesque suit,2022-11-15 03:52:29
that shade of blue doesnt work outside of comics it shouldve been darker and actually that headpiece although it seems cool from a design perspective would be a hindrance and disadvantage in combat more black panther like suits wouldve fit thematically and straight up look better,2022-11-15 04:43:42
homelander instantly came to mind,2022-11-15 05:49:11
"in that first fight i was absolutely blown away his fighting style and leaping through the sky was amazing to see

i just wish that the final fight was better it felt like a huge step down",2022-11-11 16:59:35
absolute new fave villainanti hero character  so glad they didnt one off  him like other villians,2022-11-11 20:32:36
"maaan remember when people were all like aquaman is so lame a guy that speaks to fish and is stronger underwater

now it is yoooooooo this guy is like aquaman but he has wings on his feet this is so  badass

it goes to show how flimsy things can be",2022-11-11 05:52:38
my mind went to sanji,2022-11-11 18:48:45
im just glad they acknowledged his strength levels id put him up there with the big boys,2022-11-13 06:04:55
putting ships on mf’in skates up there,2022-11-12 06:54:52
namor in black panther was easily my favorite scene he is clearly powerful as  if he didnt have that weakness even tchalla black panther wouldnt have stood a chance,2022-11-15 04:25:57
"as badass as it was i wish they gave him something else other than tiny hermes sandals they looked so out of proportion and silly with the speed hes moving

it was my favorite fight scene in the whole movie tho",2022-11-13 12:42:09
namor ginobiliiiiii,2023-01-31 19:55:46
"nothing made sense 

edit this is just from namor’s perspective 

the scientist built a machine for the government surely they would have provided the schematics and formulas 

plus they skip over explaining how a college student was able to get a vibranium sample in the first place",2022-11-13 15:03:12
nah dude won he somehow gambitted wakanda into not going to war with his people hiding their secret and effectively leaving them isolated against a world which thinks wakanda is killing people trying to get vibranium outside wakanda,2022-11-30 07:15:53
watching him dart around and fight was really thrilling top tier mcu villian imo,2022-11-11 06:03:57
im glad they didnt just  him off hes an interesting character and has good back story,2022-11-11 23:28:34
reminded me of a hummingbird,2022-11-12 13:04:06
i can imagine those kamataj people can portal him to bad terrain and hes doneso,2022-11-11 19:53:12
in one version of the comics namor is as strong as the hulk and can cast spells almost as powerful as dr strange i havent seen the movie yet but by your reaction it looks like they did him justice so im glad to hear it,2022-11-12 03:22:53
he is strong as  i feel like he could take on thor physically until thor released lightning which would obviously be very bad for namor,2022-11-15 04:32:36
yeah namor in the comics is supposed to be in par with the likes of thor and the hulk if i remember correctly i dont think he beats either but can definitely hold his own for quite some time with them so yeah full strength namor is a  problem for just the black panther it would be like thor fighting captain america,2022-11-16 16:12:57
reminded me of the black adam flight scenes only good parts of that movie,2022-11-13 18:47:30
there will be a million aquaman comparisons but that justice league russia battle where aquaman is able to float and basically fly against the laws of physics always felt so weightless and bad this looked so much better,2022-11-14 19:01:42
"namor was ridiculously fast and powerful theres no way a 19yearold scientist just jumped in an ironman type suit and trapped him so  she then proceeded to basically defeat namora  also theres no way that shuri should have beat him after he crashed the plane he saw the water why didnt he jump in the water first to regain strength before fighting her again how did shuri not die after being impaled lol

 i liked her story but shes a terrible black panther imo it gave me hope seeing tchallas son at the end such a great end scene all in all i thought it was a fantastic film and definitely will be watching it again",2022-11-13 00:25:39
i’m kinda late but you’re so right honestly it kinda freaked me out how he moved like he almost teleported around great villain or antihero and i’m glad he seems like  be back,2022-11-15 16:04:00
his strength is what i want to see in marvel the way they portray his strength is stronger than thorhulkthanos etc,2022-11-26 07:57:57
i love seeing flying characters actually use energy not just floating invincible did this really well too as you can see characters pushing off the air which is explained to be how their flight works,2022-11-29 23:19:17
,2023-02-12 10:03:45
i don’t think it’s that they didn’t they were just way more powerful,2022-11-12 16:35:46
"i had sort of the same reaction to talokan as i did pandora in avatar

oooohhhhh i wanna go",2022-11-11 04:24:06
movie needed wayyy more namor and notatlantis talokan less cia bs,2022-11-11 04:26:40
the mesoamerican take on the atlantians was very cool and absolutely beautiful that was the most impressive throne i can ever recall seeing i really hope we get to see more of them in the future they did a great job making namor a compelling character and not some simple bad guy,2022-11-11 08:02:51
carried the film for me they did a great job with it,2022-11-11 13:27:22
im confused on how he got his name hes a native mexican but understood the conquistador speaking spanish,2022-11-13 19:32:19
the child actor in the namor origin story did an incredible job with no lines,2022-11-18 06:18:08
"namor

does he control the police",2022-11-11 08:29:43
i thought it was cool how what they did with the name even if it was a bit on the nose i did want to see him fighting nazis like in the comics though haha,2022-11-17 03:50:49
i watched it in dolby but the scenes were too dark i feel like we were supposed to be in awe at seeing talokan  kinda like seeing wakanda for the first time but the water was so dark and murky that you couldnt really see most of it,2022-11-15 23:42:36
"except for the explanation for his name im a native spanish speaker and that was one of the dumbest things ive ever seen in a marvel movie i literally groaned out loud at the movie theater it was worse than the han solo name explanation completely unnecessary really dumb and totally took me out of the movie

i think namor was one of the highlights in an otherwise pretty meh movie though",2022-11-26 15:11:10
felt like they needed to ditch the narration there could’ve been an excellent visual set piece…but then they had to make him explain the whole thing if i had to guess that was a studio decision,2022-11-11 04:26:41
they showed trailer for avatar before the movie for a while i felt like im watching a totally different movie,2022-11-16 05:08:26
hard agree,2022-11-13 04:41:29
i felt his origin story was the weakest point him complaining about spaniards violence in the present time is kind of  when you see how bloody violent mesosouth american cultures were before the conquerors,2022-11-13 14:25:41
he has the same orgin story as rapunzel,2022-11-13 07:37:01
this movie had so much visual merit,2022-11-16 04:54:08
the killmonger addition was really powerful i think if the movie is about grief specifically about death by violence or caused by the cruelty of others it would make sense that an embodiment of anger would appear like him plus hes family,2022-11-11 14:16:21
" angela bassett is still amazing in this she acts her  off

have i not given everything",2022-11-11 18:57:17
no way are we done with him he is the best frememy of every marvel team need a character to fill the hes an  but hes completely right niche better call namor,2022-11-11 05:09:40
"angela bassett is still amazing in this  she acts her  off

her speech about losing her family was te best moment of the film by far",2022-11-11 23:29:15
question for the more versed peeps here was kilmonger in some kind of  version of the bast afterlife his father was lost in the bast afterlife but still there the purple skies  ramonda was there but kilmonger was in a fiery place moon knight confirmed that there is a bast afterworld so i was just wondering if he was some place else,2022-11-13 05:51:56
i kinda wished he would show up at the waterfall to challenge for throne again,2022-11-11 19:11:11
"sup cuz

fangasm",2022-11-15 21:42:56
im hoping he comes back in secret wars as a black panther of a different reality,2022-12-06 18:05:14
killmonger cameo was my favorite scene in the movie i was feeling overall meh about the movie until that scene,2022-11-12 22:14:38
agree on all points,2022-11-14 00:15:11
these were the best parts of the movie i think angela bassett was fantastic,2022-11-17 03:50:05
coogler’s michael b jordan in his movies streak continues 4 for 4,2022-11-17 23:06:21
hard agree i had to remind myself i watched a superhero movie and not some scp foundation  that ship scene was so creepy,2022-11-11 16:20:22
"i really loved the tone of that scene the singing assisted suicide was incredibly dark for a marvel movie 

this movie in general felt more mature and not as ‘cartoony’ as most marvel films loved it",2022-11-13 16:44:51
i also found the scene where the little kid version of namor lifts up in the air in front of the spanish scary that kid had intense energy,2022-11-11 21:30:35
i thought that was badass and loved how it got me thinking of mermaid folklore singing and luring sailors to their deaths,2022-11-13 18:42:27
yeah that was deeply unnerving and really well done probably my favorite part of the movie which i greatly enjoyed overall,2022-11-12 00:22:28
yep  the song was haunting enough but the visuals of them killing themselves was top tier horror love that mcu is embracing this a bit more between this and multiverse of madness,2022-11-15 04:38:05
the first 40 minutes where super high tech aliens were hard at work stopping some low tech 21st century humans from discovering them was the best part of the film ive never seen that trope from the high tech aliens perspective except in like star trek and there it rarely plays out as well as it did here,2022-11-15 02:11:53
here’s the soundtrack for everyone who wants it absolutely chilling my anxiety was spiking throughout the scene ,2022-11-11 14:28:08
"easily the best scene in the film

the moment where they said whats that music and you realise its not just cool background music but the characters are hearing it to loved that",2022-12-03 22:10:53
that was by far my favorite part the tone was great i’d love a full superhero horror movie,2022-11-16 02:51:54
i wish they focused a bit more on the siren song aspect it was hard to tell which singing was the soundtrack and which was diagetic,2022-11-13 07:13:06
she looked like one of those weird upright pokemon,2022-11-11 03:07:22
biiig baaaad beetleborgs,2022-11-11 03:32:05
right i thought they had her joke about it so they could have a moment where she sees the final suit and has a change of mind but no they followed through with the ugliness,2022-11-11 04:37:29
bionicle stylies,2022-11-11 03:58:03
"i’m glad i’m not the only one who thought this good 

she has such a great body language she is a great fighting style why would a filmmaker want to put her in a  knock off hideous iron man suit",2022-11-11 03:14:31
i kept thinking of a blue beetle predator whenever it popped up on screen,2022-11-11 03:09:08
the suit reminds me of something i would see out of a tokusatsu show like super sentai or kamen rider ,2022-11-11 03:24:55
does anyone know if that suit was in the comics or they just designed that  thing for no reason,2022-11-11 03:41:26
i figured at any moment she was gonna start hunting metroids,2022-11-11 03:36:16
it looked like the fish man from the shape of water,2022-11-11 04:21:08
"it’s like the rocketeer and the predator had a baby

the entire last battle was navi riding shamu to war against the rocketeers… which to be far was kind of awesome",2022-11-11 03:33:46
hers and iron heart didnt look great,2022-11-11 12:37:34
its actually similar to a design in the comics so probably one of the few instances a redesign wouldve helped,2022-11-11 04:31:06
amazing how they can have such amazing costume design for namor and the other talokan warriors but have such a cheap looking comic con suit for okoye it was like predator meets power rangers,2022-11-12 04:25:04
she looked too much like the enemy should have at least been red like her former outfit,2022-11-11 13:12:15
irons man first suit was pretty bad lol let’s wait for mark 2 ,2022-11-13 04:18:28
"ceruledge

looks like the diva from 5th element",2022-11-11 04:15:13
michonne got her braids back tho so that was cool,2022-11-11 04:51:49
why did the suit try to make bald women look like they have weird hair,2022-11-13 14:15:36
is that a marvel hero or was it just a one off suit,2022-11-13 21:54:19
is okoye suited like this in the comics because why did they make such a fugly  suit,2022-11-14 08:24:42
i had to google what they looked like in the comics and its pretty close they look kinda weird in the comics too its one of those things where something from the comics doesnt translate well in live action,2022-11-15 23:37:33
the suits design of the iron heart and that midnight angel was awful it looked like a cartoon and not in a good way,2022-11-16 12:50:07
i thought it looked like something the predator would wear,2022-11-26 18:37:29
looked like kabal from mortal kombat,2022-11-11 07:48:53
"it reminded me of a zone of enders mech

anyone else remember that game",2022-11-11 07:17:34
i know it was supposed to be a joke it looked bad i guess but jfc that looked awful,2022-11-11 08:05:39
she looked like the predator,2022-11-11 08:08:04
black panther went full anime again for its third act,2022-11-12 02:12:50
i’m sure it’s a comic thing but having a blue hero fighting off blue enemies was unnecessarily confusing,2022-11-12 05:09:52
i get what they were going for like the tribal masks just terrible colorway and the eyes and hair were the worst part,2022-11-12 07:06:47
she looked like the other blue thing from hellboy,2022-11-12 17:59:43
it looked like sonic with knuckles hair,2022-11-16 04:04:37
i was just surprised to learn that star kid happened in the mcu,2022-11-21 00:12:10
nah that was sonic the  hedgehog,2022-11-25 02:50:06
tbh this whole vibranium detector plot line literally made me cringe was one of the weakest parts of the movie,2022-11-19 11:45:45
namor destroyed the machine and had it sent to wakanda the cia dont have it anymore,2022-11-13 10:39:26
it also wasn’t super important to  her to namie what was super important was allying with wakanda the kid scientist was just a test to see which side the wakandans would choose namie even says later on that it’s too late because the existence of this machine is proof that the time for them to isolate has ended,2022-11-26 06:37:45
was the machine destroyed wasn’t she the only one who knows how to build them,2022-11-13 06:31:28
disney plus show,2022-11-27 02:21:01
"for now its their only lead they didnt know who it was at all nor could get it

so they threaten someone who could with a slight show of power where they had the advantage

they dont seem so technology advanced after all probably why they attacked them on the bridge too as they didnt trust wakanda at all cant walk into a school looking all blue

its easier to just go after the first person that found a way and later go after machines",2022-11-13 13:56:38
he stole the one detector they had,2023-01-16 21:16:40
wakanda couldnt even win a fight against itself,2022-11-12 21:12:20

"i feel the stripping scene was completely undercut by the next scene being the queen trying to find her daughter

like priorities lol",2022-11-18 08:56:45
"riri was actually really good wish we got a bit more of her

my main problems with the movie is that it was very long but felt light on plot",2022-12-03 22:15:37
riri is the character she was played by dominique thorne america chavez was in the strange sequel,2022-11-13 00:39:00
in my theater it was quiet for 3 seconds then one guy started quick applauding loudly then like 12 more peeps joined him the theatre was packed so it was pretty awkward 90 percent of us understanding this was supposed to be a moment of silence and stayed quiet out of reverence and the others simply clapping because one person started it,2022-11-11 16:26:36
"in my theatre everyone was silent at first but a child suddenly shouted excitedly hey thats black panther which made some people chuckle

i dont think they knew about chadwicks passing so that made me feel kinda sad just reminded you of how much happiness his bp brought to people ",2022-11-12 15:16:43
yeah i was in a packed theater and people were respectfully quiet during any tribute scenes to chadwick then the final scene and people were crying throughout the theater but then applauding when the midcredits scene happened,2022-11-12 03:27:12
"try a quiet place 1 and 2 lol not a single person in my theater ate popcorn haha

i could literally hear people breathing during both films",2022-11-11 04:29:07
i had an itch on my leg but i just suffered through because i didnt want to make noise,2022-11-11 08:39:03
same in our theater absolute dead silence it just felt different than the usual quiet,2022-11-12 08:03:12
what theatres do you go to where people are openly talking during the start of a movie,2022-11-12 00:33:50
i’m jealous there were a couple of  parents sitting in front of me who brought their three toddler children all definitely under the age of four to the theater the kids obviously weren’t interested in the movie and couldn’t handle being in the theater for 3 hours but their parents insisted on staying and shushing them every 5 seconds,2022-11-14 16:43:16
it was a very clear moment of silence for the fallen my theater was small luckily and the people here in general dont cheer at stuff,2022-11-15 10:05:39
thank  ours was too it was heavy with grief because and the tribute at the end where all was silent there was a lady coughing next to me through the movie and i was relieved she held it during the end tribute,2022-11-12 09:24:44
bout to cry again,2022-11-12 20:50:47
sadly my theater included 3 babies who cried throughout,2022-11-17 16:02:07
is it a part of the movie or like a separate tributeonly standalone kinda thing and then the movie starts,2022-11-11 12:08:43
i was like “hey that was great” and loved the choice to have the opening credits play later in the film with no music too,2022-11-13 06:29:14
"i mean its a cinema so it should be quiet all the time mcu moviegoers are the worst for whooping and hollering

finally got around to seeing this movie last night",2023-02-27 15:20:38
same here,2022-11-13 18:10:01
 did you expect them to say,2022-11-29 01:43:00
we also literally saw an ai go crazy in this universe,2022-11-11 15:38:00
"i found it ironic that her character is desperately looking for a cure to save her brother even if its untested with a 20 odd


but irl posting anti vaxx nonsense lol",2022-11-15 21:49:37
maybe in that universe their movies have even worse depictions of ais than in ours,2022-11-13 17:27:53
t’challa’s dad ruled while his son was black panther the roles can be separate they just usually aren’t,2022-11-11 04:16:35
when they showed the leftover purple liquid still in the bowl i was hoping the midcredits scene was m’baku drinking it i want that dude to be a bp so bad he’d look badass with how huge he is,2022-11-11 05:04:43
part of me thought we were going to see m’baku fight an unenhanced teenage girl,2022-11-11 08:19:23
honestly im not mad about this the guy isnt just all brawn he showed a lot of wisdom in counseling others and has always done the right thing he would be a good king,2022-11-14 00:26:13
the doesn’t doesn’t necessarily have to be bp in the comics t’challa let shuri be queen of wakanda while he ran around as bp even in the mcu when we meet t’challa he is already the bp even though his father is king,2022-11-11 12:25:11
king does not automatically get black panther powers t’chaka was still monarch when t’challa was running around as black panther he didn’t become king until after,2022-11-13 01:27:51
"im not sure because in the first movie people were telling tchalla that it was just ceremonial and he didnt have to fight mbaku

since shuri didnt show up was it just mbaku making a jokereference since its not like she met his challenge

we also dont know if shuri still has her panther powers

mbaku also cant be the black panther he does not follow bast he is jabari and follows hanuman  the gorilla  the jabari and mbaku are shown to be staunch traditionalists and follow the wakandan traditions  it was made clear in bp1 that mbakus problem with the goldenpanther tribe the tribe of tchalla and shuris family was their increasing reliance on technology and treating tradition as ceremonial

it was shown that shuri was using her technology to avoid grief and became even more detached from cultural traditions because she saw faith as inferior to her technology and she couldnt even save her brother using it so how could traditions help thats why mbaku was more prominent in the film because his tribe are traditionalists and strong believers in their faith he was shuris guide a physical compass since shuri was opposed to the spiritual kind",2022-11-11 07:35:50
"yeah i see it that way
shuri recovers herself
mbaku is king

i noticed the huuuge character reveal of mbaku as the voice of reason to the council guide to shuri and more diplomatic than brute in this 2nd filmall qualities of a leader",2022-11-13 05:47:36
its unclear whether shuri gave up her powers before leaving but it seems pretty clear that mbaku is now the king,2022-11-14 18:19:20
" are they gonna let two people run around with black panther powers

perhaps i missed it but who is the second person who took the synthetic heartshaped herbs",2022-11-11 12:32:07
im so confused why he came out of the ship and said he wants to challenge i was like challenge who though lol,2022-11-12 15:11:56
i found it a bit disrespectful for shurri not to be at the ceremony even if she didnt want to be queen the movie was about her learning to respect the traditions she could have told the community to wait since she had something personal to do first,2022-12-13 13:00:56
"all of these people are terrible leaders of insanely powerful nation states well powerful if not for their crippling stupidity

namor has always been like that though hes king of the ocean not because hes a good leader or wise or anythying 

namor is an arrogant  vain overly emotional  the reason hes leader is he can kick everybodys elses heads in with no effort half the comics stories are about everyone else under the sea trying to get rid of him and put someone actually competent on the throne and the other half are him causing  for absolutely no good reason when hes in a mood

this is the guy who flooded manhattan because he was having a nap and a passing ocean liner woke him up

as for the wakandans the first movie made it plain that monarchy is a truly  system of government its a total dice roll  great when you get a tchalla on the throne but a  when a killmonger arrives or tchallas dad who was also a bit of a 

i enjoyed the movie a lot but i know the source material the fim itself needed more time to flesh the characters out which is kinda crazy to say given its running time marvel has had this run of late of making movies that should have been tv shows and vice versa",2022-11-15 08:25:49
" all of these people are terrible leaders of insanely powerful nation states

really this was all about how terrible absolutist monarchies are for a country they all make impulsive emotional decisions based on their personal relationships not the overall good of the country",2022-11-20 18:17:20
"the car chase was good and i felt like it was setting up an international conflict  but no then the movie went  the namor stuff

i dont think i cared about namor or any of that plot id rather the movie kept the focus on the other countries trying to get vibranium or at least kept it as a strong b plot while the namor stuff was going on

also imo shuri should have become black panther much sooner",2022-12-03 22:19:46
more like “we got no budget to show this suit in a tv show”,2022-11-12 09:12:25
and it gives them a chance to redesign it hopefully,2022-11-12 02:11:37
disney “this suit is  …try again on disney plus”,2022-11-12 09:58:26
it most probably contains vibranium and they dont want it taken by the us govt,2022-11-13 10:43:43
i felt tge whole introduction of ironheart was half assed  checkovs gun got quietly unloaded and put in a draw  didnt really add anything other than some action scenes nothing material,2022-11-14 10:04:20
i’m absolutely sick of every mcu thing taking the entire runtime just for the hero to don their iconic suit falcon wandavision ms marvel she hulk and now black panther all did this very recently and i feel like it’s a trope that we should be past by now i know i’m watching a black panther movie so just make her black panther it’s not a surprise,2022-11-14 17:13:08
"“you made an amazing suit but i can’t allow you to take it”

no problem i made more  would have shut her up lol",2022-11-12 18:02:51

i love that she spent hours and hours during a critical time crunch smithing the iron shell by hand in the most advanced automated manufacturing facility on the planet",2022-11-16 16:51:55
the design is too  i dont want people to make fun of wakanda,2022-11-13 15:31:51
they made that suit in less than a week they are going to come back in the future with a  tom of upgrades,2022-11-12 05:29:07
"my money is on it reappears in kang dynasty much like the iron spider suit did for infinity war

something goes crazy riri calls shuri i need the suit i need the suit",2022-11-14 13:20:53
way late to the game but i wonder if shuri did let riri  leave with a suit  i mean nanotechnology does exist and that car of hers was similar color to her suit since the car is getting sent back to riri  it would be a nice twist in the new series for her to need help call shuri to ask for the suit and have shuri tell her she already has one activates cal the ai wasnt sure its name and he pops on in the car and yada yada it forms a suit around her and off she goes  just a nerd thought from an old guy,2023-02-07 22:52:05
i thought the design was really cool but i wish the lighting had been a little better,2022-11-11 08:09:36
"i agree kinda jaw dropping for me honestly

i really liked how they delved deep into their culture as well their race in general was really well handled",2022-11-11 07:40:33
i wept tears during that scene not only was it beautiful but it represents the dream of an indigenous civilization that was thought to be destroyed by colonization actually living on and thriving,2022-11-11 11:13:15
"i was hoping they’d dig into some of the implications the first time you see the city i thought “oh dang maybe the vibranium comet was actually a crashed space ship and it’s actually wakanda who got a break off piece  this is the main ship” then i thought “maybe that’s already a thing and i just forgot because there’s so much mcu to remember”

also shuri zooming around in a suit with no clear method of movement or oxygen was amusing maybe i’m wrong but i thought it was one of the suits that got salvaged from killing the peeps at the beginning",2022-11-11 12:42:33
"it was cool contrast to aqumans underwater vegas with giant squid playing drums

i like how natural everything was designed and lit the city was really mossy i really liked it",2022-11-24 08:57:44
the outofwater sections for the city could have been done better they only showed sections the size of small coffee shops,2022-11-12 04:36:35
saving that for the namor movie i hope,2022-11-12 06:50:27
i though it looked really bad specially compared to the city atlantis in the dc movies i would love to live in wakanda but theres no way i would like to live in talukan,2022-11-13 13:42:55
the awkward movement of people killed that scene for me like thats exactly how i would swim you would think theyd master a far more fluid way of underwater movement,2022-11-12 22:42:09
i wish it was brighter though maybe a bit more sun from the light source for the sake of our visibility ,2022-11-14 15:45:02
"it was good probably the best visuals in the movie

i couldnt help but compare it to atlantis in aquaman though and it didnt feel nearly as vibrant as that imo",2022-11-12 03:27:01
the cgi this movie was so good its hard not to compare it to the bp1 mineshaft fight or aquamans atlantis and it blows them both out of the water,2022-11-13 12:56:11
watch aqua man,2022-11-11 09:59:52
just watch aquaman honestly,2022-11-11 08:41:30

i agree or even just a rando merc metahuman,2022-11-11 06:00:31
theres a lot of this in the mcu right now they simultaneously want us to believe the world is exactly how it is currently but just has super heroes and insane advanced tech in it and like to ignore all of the possible cultural repercussions of those facts,2022-11-11 18:17:32
the french mercenaries were ridiculous,2022-11-13 18:25:01
it also had the problem of making wakanda seems like giant hypocrites the scene was over the top and had me rolling my eyes a bit but at least it set up for the vibranium detector then they decide to sneak into the us kidnap a citizen attack the police and completely ignore the law as reinforced at the ending of the movie you cant shame a country for doing that then half an hour latter be doing the exact same thing yourself,2022-11-20 21:27:04

while still using like standard m4 carbines

i think they have been trying hence all the super serum related issues that have come up in the mcu so far i just feel like they haven’t been able to get it down right without some crazy issue like people blowing up and turning into hot lava,2022-11-13 06:30:15
i think this is really the reason why they actually have to go into the lab and steal all this  because they realize there is a means for them to be more technologically advanced like wakanda guns and  are really all they have right now and because they know wakanda wasnt giving them any they had to take it with whatever means they have if they dont they look like cavemen compared to wakanda,2022-11-14 16:29:28
what are they some kind of suicide squad,2022-11-14 19:57:35
also why am i suppose to be okay with wakanda hoarding all vibranium while people are suffering and dying in the world,2022-11-11 19:20:00

i felt like the purpose of all that was to kind of highlight the stupidity of westernization and more specifically usa,2022-11-20 05:35:06
ngl i was expecting the french to be a side antagonist in the movie with the french person at the un meeting being so shifty,2022-11-20 17:23:04
there are only so many metahumans there are a lot more just humans,2022-11-20 20:22:55
"month late to the party here but confirmation bias

not every super super is bullet proof with lightning speed and has an intelligence agency like wakanda has behind them

im sure it still works just fine unless you are literally bullet proof 556 still gets the job done

good thing most people don’t agree with you letitia’s performance was one of the best in the movie,2022-11-16 01:30:52
i thought the whole mayan aspect was really interesting don’t often see that sort of mythology,2022-11-11 05:13:52
i loved the flashback great villain story and the changes worked to fit the movie,2022-11-11 05:58:43

didn’t get why after him saying that they all just mispronounced it for the rest of the film,2022-11-11 23:12:46
same i  loved it,2022-11-11 23:42:14
so and i know marvel comics started back in the day when shang chi was a mystic insult to chinese culture is that not the pronunciation of namor ive never heard it spoken and thought it was naymor for some reason,2022-11-11 23:22:04
what would be really cool is if part of namors plan is reclaiming tenochtitlan mexico city  apparently it was built on a very flooded area and because mexico city is now so large its essentially sinking  so he could do something to actually sink it completely and make it their new capital,2022-11-12 23:41:42

it’s just roman backwards  not very creative,2023-01-07 12:47:01
why did he know spanish at that point in the film though,2022-11-13 19:40:53
nah as a spanish speaker is cringy af el niño sin amor is just ridiculous,2022-11-11 07:51:28
yea i wish they taught more mayan in history class such a very interesting and important historical culture that more people should understand,2022-11-20 05:33:56
i think after bp1 infinity war and when namor attacks in this movie wakanda is tired of being destroyed,2022-11-11 15:17:11
statistically it was very probable that it would be over water,2022-11-11 08:15:03
"it was a small wakandan strike force staging an attack in order to draw namor out theres even a line the princess better hurry before we join our ancestors or something like that

they used the underwater vibranium detector as bait so of course the fight would take place over water 

and sure the line yield and your people will live line followed by the strike force being surrounded by talokans made it look a bit cheesy

but at no point did i think that wakanda only had that one attack boat or that the soldiers on it constituted the entire wakandan armed forces in a conflict with a fully mobilized wakanda i cant see the talokans raw power defeat the wakandas technology",2022-11-11 12:52:17
every wakandans on that ship pretty much died except the surviving 10 at the end right,2022-11-11 23:40:35
definitely reminds me of this,2022-11-12 17:15:45
it makes sense a little if you wanted to catch someone off guard you go to their element and since namor thought it was america again i don’t think he took his whole army so it was a good element of surprise but also still on the water should have had the ship all the way on the bottom of the ocean and rose up into the sky like a heli carrier,2022-11-11 06:22:50
nah it was absolute the right move catch them off guard cause otherwise they’d just have to avoid water forever…,2022-11-11 06:53:08
did you even watched the movie they literally explained why they did it,2022-11-12 01:29:41
fair point but we saw them bring the ocean to wakanda and shuri wasnt thinking logically,2022-11-13 21:26:01
it makes sense it would be the water that’s the only place the talokans have appeared they appeared in the waters of wakanda and destroyed their city wakanda is trying to make sure that doesn’t happen again,2022-11-16 01:36:04
they literally showed they can bring the water where ever they go bruh did you miss that part,2022-11-23 10:40:11
if it was on desert they would know its a trap,2023-02-06 12:24:48

i appreciated the subtle character work they did with him advising shuri against going to war before the final big set piece i think it’s implied nicely and sold in his performance that he has a growing belief in the ancestral planepanther   which sets up the ending this movie was 100 shuri’s as a way to dedicate it to boseman but the next one is all his,2022-11-11 04:49:22
m’bakuand winstonare awesome,2022-11-11 05:00:30
mbaku is the yamcha of wakanda and we all need to accept that,2022-11-11 04:54:16
i thought it was hilarious that after he took that hard punch in the chest from namor he said that he is possibly stronger than the hulk,2022-11-11 11:08:08
i mean now he’s king right should have a way bigger role going forward,2022-11-11 06:13:16
i felt he played a key role in almost every scene he was in had good lines good action and evolved from bp1 to be almost a wise advisor to shuri,2022-11-11 12:53:44
"mbaku is definitely one of the best characters in the black panther series

im curious how did you interpret the ending with mbaku challenging for leadershipking when he knew that shuri wasnt there  do you think that shuri is giving up the black panther titlepowers and mbaku will be the next black panther

i was really hoping that they would throw us a twist and rather than shuri taking the magic herb herself that shed give it to mbaku or okoye",2022-11-11 09:15:05
especially because every scene he was in he killed it excited to see king m baku for the 3rd one tho,2022-11-11 13:43:00
"next time baby  be king

omggg i need scenes with him and the un",2022-11-11 16:52:49
hes a big strong human fighting grunts with super human strength and durability id say he did well for himself he also provided some sage council while shuri was full of blood ,2022-11-11 17:05:03
how about my dude kamaru usman who is probably the best p4p welterweight champion the ufc has ever had and you only give him one line and no action scenes,2022-11-11 21:28:52
i hope he gets a buff in the next movie his character in the comics has a similar body enhancement ritual like black panther does at the very least maybe theyll give him his white gorilla outfit to enhance him,2022-11-12 06:05:12
looks like theyre setting him up to be the kinghead ruler with shuri as black panther which i like m baku has definitely helped wakanda a  of a lot and deserves the throne,2022-11-12 06:22:36
"probably the best mcu movie of the year

 cold opening was sudden and intense followed by the funeral scene with tchalla presence felt throughout the movie 
 angela bassett gives the best performance of the film wouldnt be surprised if she got a few acting nominations for it
 first half of the movie is honestly great second half really drags
 tenoch huerta as namor was perfect exploration of the talokans history and culture was my favourite part of the movie shoutout to namora who did the most damage to wakandans throughout the movie
 lupita nyongo steals the movie as nakia with the few scenes she had
 okoye and mbaku had interesting character arcs in the movie
 last act was really poor the fight in the middle of the ocean felt like a midmovie battle rather than an endmovie battle and it felt really short too 
 a lot of night scenes were too dark especially namors introduction scene
 vfx was an improvement over the previous mcu movies but still not polished in some scenes
 riri williams was a poor character with no real arc she was just a plot point and felt like 2hour backdoor pilot for her disney series
 ludwig göransson with another great musical score but the soundtrack felt flat
 no one from wakanda or talokan offering a marriage proposal to unite the kingdoms felt off maybe its the house of the dragon fan in me but thats where my mind went to first when namor gave shuri his moms necklace 
 lake bells character just disappeared there were leaks that she would appear in the postcredits scene but maybe it was scrapped or shifted to ironheart b


a very touching and respectful goodbye to chadwick boseman the movie itself was just good but it could have been better",2022-11-11 04:58:44
since nobody appeared to challenge him hes king now wakanda becomes the first nation to ban meat,2022-11-14 08:38:02
what was with the i challenge for the throne or whatever  was he just taking over since she wasnt around to defend it,2022-11-12 23:38:34
reduced to the resident jobber role absolute travesty,2022-11-13 02:22:57
think they sidelined him on purpose but black panther 3or avengers endgame again whichever comes first well see more,2022-11-13 21:18:03
seems pretty clear hes the new king of wakanda so i imagine  be more of a player in future movies,2022-11-14 17:56:20
was he chomping on a carrot in that first scene like bugs bunny i honestly couldnt tell what he was eating he was great though very funny,2022-11-19 05:55:50
he was sidelined because this was a black female empowerment film,2022-11-11 15:44:00
yes,2022-11-11 16:11:09
"i was really hoping to see more from my dude m’baku  i thought he’d definitely have a bigger role in this one but felt like he was on the sidelines for a lot of the movie

i said from the first he should have been slowly built up to be man ape he would have a bigger role by now mayb even villian for part 3 if they had done it right maybe he takes the fake heart shaped flower before shuri even tried it and it gave him the man ape persona",2022-11-12 18:06:55
i would say they couldve done with the additional dora milage side character that suddenly got more screen time and give it to mbaku i really didnt care for her and the movie trying to give another dora milage more screen time just felt force oh i like daggers oh i dont want to fight anymore oh i have new suit and i keep daggers also kayo and i are a thing ok,2022-11-14 16:23:11
he also felt like the guy bringing a knife to a gun fight unfortunately  it was kinda strange,2022-11-14 19:18:45
well we will see more of him considering he is king now,2022-11-18 10:10:00
while i was disappointed that he didnt have a bigger role i was also relieved he didnt turn into the bumbling comic relief of the sequel a la gimli in lotr,2022-11-19 06:10:22
it also doesn’t make sense that the water guys would even show up like they asked the wakandans to find her and call them when they did then they just know where they are and meet them,2022-11-11 04:59:06
i just wanna know how they were able to bug the beads like theyre this super advanced piece of technology the cia had at most a few hours with didnt make sense to me,2022-11-11 05:29:02
ya martin freeman and elaine from seinfeld’s plot just… didn’t matter,2022-11-11 04:07:29
i think that the cia thing was mostly to build up the julia louisdreyfus character whose name i cant even remember did they even say it in this movie for her role in the upcoming movies,2022-11-11 09:22:29
no way that was 30 minutes it was maybe 10 total with all of both of their scenes,2022-11-11 06:21:53
the entire first half felt directionless and misshaped once they stopped it with the mcu prep and the vibranium and just got to wakanda vs talokan the entire movie started working,2022-11-11 04:42:02
the inclusion of the cia plot had me 100 convinced the kidnapping plot in the middle would resolve the wakanda v water guys plot and then the final battle would be a kong v godzilla style team up against a mutual threat as it was the scale of the final conflict seemed pretty small like it was a few super powerful guys with personal beef and 1500 others on a ship and the conclusion they reached is what most of the audience would have seen at the midpoint,2022-11-11 20:10:31
they keep trying to make val happen but im not sure anyone cares,2022-11-11 16:37:51
and ironheart honestly…,2022-11-12 01:55:07
they’re setting up allegra and the united states as antagonists for black panther 3 remember how her last line is how she thinks what america could do with all that vibranium,2022-11-12 03:19:29
martin freeman is just there so that white people have someone to relate to,2022-11-13 15:27:54
gotta show them “owning the colonizers”,2022-11-17 06:55:13
spot on film was too long and boring,2022-11-11 16:08:06
you mean you dont think wakanda forever 161 minutes needed more time to say profound things than ikiru 143 minutes 2001 149 minutes and apocalypse now 153 minutes,2022-11-11 04:46:22
"if it were a standalone movie or its own franchise sure but whens the next time any of these wakandan or talocan characters are going to be seen again probably not until avengers kang dynasty in more than 3 years

ross and val are like coulson and fury they can show up anywhere likely secret invasion and ironheart then canwo and thunderbolts",2022-11-11 14:52:08
thunderbolts setup the price paid for a film within a cinematic universe,2022-11-11 16:51:13
the cia plot was like 10 minutes of the movie,2022-11-12 00:33:47
i liked it kinda scary allegra is director of ciashield and with no avengers these days kinda sets up thunderbolts well,2022-11-12 01:35:37
they needed another male hero other than mbaku,2022-11-12 06:39:33
we gotta include our favorite quirked up white boy,2022-11-12 07:35:00
100 agree,2022-11-12 07:38:47
that would have been nice this movie was wayyy too stretched there’s a good plot and character moments there but it needed some heavy trimming,2022-11-12 19:43:26
yeah but how else could they have set up the next movie,2022-11-13 14:05:37
the cia plot was not needed at all,2022-11-14 00:14:43
i think its a build for bp3 maybe its gonna be wakanda vs the us,2022-11-11 13:48:15
long and boring movie,2022-11-11 13:22:20
your olive oil is about to go bad,2022-11-11 17:32:08
it’s getting to the point where i only buy mcu blu rays for movies i’ll watch again  this and thor are ones i won’t be buying this was just too sad of a film and thor was just atrocious,2022-11-11 12:52:12
man what happened to 90 min action movies,2022-11-11 11:48:03
feel like it was all set up for thunderbolts,2022-11-11 15:59:24
yeahdidnt really fit with the rest of the film kind of a smudge on what otherwise was perfect,2022-11-11 21:20:43
im hoping it means there will be more tieins with future movies  wakanda dealing with increased tension between america and talocan  but i doubt theyll actually follow through,2022-11-12 01:04:33
yeah for real i thought what was going to happen was ross was gonna convince them to help the wakandans defend against talokan and then julie louis dreyfus comes in and is like “yeah i’m gonna end this side plot very abruptly with the only pay off being that you’re seeing me”,2022-11-13 03:38:58
they could have done away with anything not water and wakanda us scenes and that un scene seemed unnecessary,2022-11-13 08:03:18
also the science montage theyre kinda overdone in marvel movies now,2022-11-13 14:16:02
yeah but it’s setting up thunderbolts,2022-11-13 18:12:11
felt that way about the kidironheart inclusion partly because im sick of ironman suits and partly because the plot barely warranted her character,2022-11-14 00:42:21
we needed some white people and martin freeman has a contract,2022-11-15 02:09:47
most of the subplots could have been cut down by a lot and it would keep the same effect on the movie cia and iron heart needed much less screen time,2022-11-16 08:53:54
and all of the super suits were utterly inconsequential  if you had deleted them nobody would have even noticed their absense  they didnt even make a difference in the big battle and that was the only scene where they were used,2022-11-16 16:46:11
literally couldve cut that entire subplot it was completely pointless,2022-11-16 22:18:53
maybe jlds character should have been morevillainous like maybe she already knew about the talokans and somehow set up the conflict herself,2022-11-16 22:46:27
it was a bit of a mess martin freeman kept showing up and i dont know why,2022-12-03 22:12:52
"movie was supposed to be about powers intervening in wakanda but that all happened n the first 15 minutes

oh and the americans thinking about destabilizing wakanda for 20 seconds",2022-12-06 17:33:22
"and then they stopfor downed a tree six year old who watch cartoons know thats a trap

funny thing is theres no need for this  we know wakandans can literally  up people like stereotypical aliens they even have a flying saucer

btw i expected there to be a joke about how wakanda inspired those stories because that  was identical",2022-11-12 21:54:46
now that i think about it maybe this is what val wanted and could be a way for her to track the location of wakanda if that’s where they’re taking the prisoner,2022-11-14 04:44:36
maybe it was a bone the contessa threw him like he has to be punished but oops he got away oh well,2022-11-14 05:00:28
namora and val both,2022-11-11 22:53:42
one of the more annoying movie tropes for sure,2022-11-11 20:19:02
my favorite part was the dude stepping out of the armored car and walking up to investigate while holding his machine gun like do you need to confirm that this is a tree and is your plan to shoot it away,2023-02-05 19:44:02
better how do they build or mine stuff underwater like the whole thing has to be underwater they can’t even do air bubbles like aquaman,2022-11-15 00:15:16
asking the real question,2022-11-13 00:11:28
how do they cook or is it just sushi all day,2022-12-12 01:49:39
i didnt like the movie but they eat fish,2023-02-02 05:07:51
i’m sure she felt dirty having to wear that  thing,2022-11-11 03:58:49
"having them constantly show their face just for some catch phrases was so dumb

 go back to the gods or something like that to the big fish guy

kicks fish guy into the ocean",2022-11-11 04:09:57
for me it’s less the suit and more why does everybody in this universe have an iron man suit now it makes the concept of iron man was less cool when anyone can make one riri doing it was fine but giving okoye one feels wrong,2022-11-11 05:08:08
"the 3 mech suits okoye anyeka riri all looked so out of place compared to shurri’s bp outfit

like danai gurira is one of the most expressive and charismatic actors in marvel films and they stick her in this weird predator lookin thing",2022-11-12 21:16:28
it reminded me of the creature in the shape of water 2017 i didnt have that much problem with it what felt out of place for me was riris final suit it gave me 80s japanimation vibes,2022-11-11 12:37:53
dirty yes comic accurate yes,2022-11-12 22:36:22
its from the comics tbf,2022-11-12 20:23:59
"okoyes suit was ridiculous  

she really challenged the gigachad talokan with a shark skull helmet to a rematch wearing some walmart halloween costume",2022-11-14 07:48:33
unpopular opinion i actually liked the suit lol idk but the torquiouise color seemed bright and contrary to the norm in wakanda,2022-11-14 02:31:19
yea okoye shouldve been the one to do the whole rescueredemption mission with or without nakia,2022-11-14 16:24:25
i thought so too but its actually pretty close to the comics so,2022-11-15 09:59:08
shuris black panther suit was equally godawful,2022-11-30 06:03:09
from multiple threads it seems i am the only person to think that suit looked cool as hel,2023-05-24 17:44:56
so thats why she kept taking the mask off,2022-11-11 14:52:09
and have her character believe so hard in science that she cant believe in traditions of mourning the dead or the spirit world,2022-11-11 09:58:22
and a major character moment was her deciding not to give someone the jab flawless,2022-11-12 06:35:53
the beginning scene shouldve been about blaming herself for not being able to create a vaccine for whatever tchalla died from,2022-11-13 14:34:20
i was like “ she’ll drink some potion that may give her cardiac arrest but won’t take an overwhelmingly statistically safe vaccine during a global pandemic interesting”,2022-11-12 07:44:43
i’m routoftheloop please explain,2022-11-13 08:48:17
she was so triggered i bet,2022-11-15 15:54:31
i choked on my soup ,2022-11-15 14:28:12
that irony was also not lost on me,2022-11-11 06:06:58
ha i thought she was kathryn hahn at first and was like wait a minute…,2022-11-12 05:45:19
no she is gonna be back in tv shows we didnt see the body either namor still has her or she managed to escape,2022-11-11 16:18:11
i was waiting for her to go full poison ivy and show those talokans whos the real villain,2022-11-11 15:04:56
i ain’t see no body,2022-11-15 01:30:55
she was badass too,2022-11-12 04:04:55
i know i was like okay lake bell just got killed in 5 seconds ,2022-11-12 06:44:17
they were trying for all sorts of water bodyrelated name celebs but only lake bell picked up,2023-01-31 09:09:11
"namor is only loyal to three things

1 the seas
2 stealing other dudes wives
3 namor",2022-11-11 13:15:47
i can’t wait to see him hit on sue storm in front of reed richards and she’s thinking about risking it all,2022-11-11 14:00:32
i dont quite understand his plan though he is worried about getting attacked so he wants to attack literally the entire world instead,2022-11-13 04:11:36
he was right about everything but his violent ultimatums exacerbated problems that did not need to be exacerbated his choice for violence over diplomacy is a compelling character flaw,2022-11-15 08:54:34
true at the start i was worried… i was like he’s a bit too nice but then they really did him justice in the next few acts,2022-11-11 14:09:09
namor was the best part of the movie,2022-11-12 05:10:28
i disagree with him being an  i think he did it all out of fear and therefore turned to extremes,2022-11-14 16:26:58
i didnt find him noble at all and talokan looks like a slump to be honest i was expecting something grander maybe had him has his big lion helmet all the time or something,2022-11-14 17:22:28
he literally wanted to  a child for what was basically no reason,2022-11-11 04:12:04
you probably never read the comics,2022-11-11 13:43:11
imagine if his first appearance was identical to nimbus from rick and morty,2023-03-10 03:32:52
dude was 40 in civil war wow,2022-11-11 16:23:26
good catch,2022-11-11 21:30:59
aww,2022-11-12 01:47:56
i just think they can take more damage than us they live with all that pressure on them and they are warriors so what we would describe as fatal to them is just a flesh wound that’s what i gathered,2022-11-11 08:35:18
because the first talokans all drank the life herb water plant so every talokans has some in their blood,2022-11-11 11:21:35
"the whole bridge scene made no sense

the scientist could reveal us to the world so bring her to us or well destroy you

so they attack the wacandans in the middle of a huge  city whole theyre in the process of fetching the scientist

like  is the logic",2022-11-14 08:16:48
angela bassett also had amazing arms when she played tina turner in the 1990s,2022-11-15 04:56:55
scheduling conflicts he was filming nope,2022-11-11 22:19:26
am i wrong or did they say his character had died,2022-11-14 23:10:26
i honestly thought that was one of the most creative character retellings ive seen in the mcu,2022-11-14 20:23:55
every day i wake up,2022-11-12 21:31:18

i thought that was an el tri reference,2022-11-16 01:22:18
sinamor,2022-11-12 19:58:11
i like how namor fought like he was underwater even when flying looked great,2022-11-11 05:12:26
namor was badass,2022-11-11 03:53:05
yeah honestly if it wasn’t for namor and huerta’s portrayal of him this movie would’ve fallen completely flat for me,2022-11-12 00:50:39
"i liked it though i found it funny when namor and shuri came back after their fight and he shouted its over were going home dont remember the exact line the wakandas being almost defeated with bodies all over everyone just went oh ok and that was that 

id like to think that itd be pretty hard to stay friendly in the immediate aftermath of a battle with your slain friends all around you",2022-11-11 11:04:34
thats me and most of marvel movies tbh im just there to enjoy them and not mind some of the things that dont make sense,2022-11-12 21:39:11
fr i really thought namor is a great villian much cooler than killmonger who was just a copy of the first bp dude legit seemed like a threat hats off to the actor on that,2022-11-14 02:33:45
"i actually googled it after because i was convinced i had missed some vital reveal about her character i’ve the last couple years 

i had not",2022-11-11 06:09:30

" i have not seen the last couple of shows but julia louis dreyfus character needs to be explained already she first showed up almost 2 years ago and it is getting exhausting

what do you mean this movie is the one that actually explained her shes the director of the cia her whole shtick so far seems to be a government version of nick fury and shield recruiting supers to be tools for us policy rather than world saving",2022-11-11 06:52:21
egregious,2022-11-11 12:20:29
her character is really boring shes just a ,2023-01-12 21:35:28

not even once did i get any kind of romantic vibe from mbaku and shuris exchanges felt 100 like a platonic teacher and student relationship if anything i got more vibes from shuri and riri than i did from her and mbaku,2022-11-11 14:39:30
i was for sure worried that okoye was done for in the 1v3 for a minute she had the best fight scene in the movie,2022-11-11 05:07:20
i thought when sheri when to talokan they were gonna propose she marry namor to ally their peoples that would’ve been cool to see,2022-11-11 13:23:04
i was more worried about namor hitting on shuri did anyone else get that vibe,2022-11-11 08:18:40
" i was concerned that they were about to pull some shurimbaku mess and was trying to calculate the age gap but fortunately that didn’t happen

it was the size difference that worried me seeing winston duke talking to letitia wright in some scenes was like an oldschool disney movie where a cartoon dog talks to a cartoon mouse",2022-11-11 21:24:39
eh personally i feel a bit conflicted about okoye getting fired but i do understand why she did it,2022-11-14 00:43:39
"overall i wish we had more time in wakanda and not so much in the us

wakanda forever more like wakanda for a bit",2022-11-13 21:22:18
"it was weird how much time they spent in the us considering they weren’t actually involved in the final act they set up this new director lady and… nothing 

i expected a wakanda vs usa final act with namor as a chaotic third party",2022-11-11 04:50:47
"i noticed early on that angela bassett had a lot of screen time and immediately thought “uh oh”
  
i didnt think anything of it cuz i knew it was going to be a long movie and she was the biggest name star left not counting the cia subplot i guess",2022-11-14 20:21:52
"  was trying to calculate the age gap

neither character has any identifiable age reference in the mcu aside from shuris being younger than tchalla it is sometimes claimed that shuris is meant to be a teenager in the first film but the actress even then did not look like a teenager and the way the character is presented would suggest much of the amazing cool scifi stuff in that film has not existed for very long at all were she a teenager so i dismiss that claim as dumb

i would argue that shuri was meant to be the same age as letitia wright which was 25 at bps release to tchallas presumably early 40s this also makes more sense with the age presentation of her parents and their actors ages 

with mbaku i really dont think theres any guide to his age whatsoever and even the mcu wiki doesnt list any reference for his age and it has extremely dubious evidentiary standards thus i will default to the actors age which would pit shurs 1993 to mbakus 1986 which is seven years

that being said like everyone else i did not get that vibe and honestly cant think of what youre thinking of however with namor who is several hundred years old there were at least two moments but at the very least the second one of those was informed by the comics honestly he shouldve put the moves on both shuri and ramonda and this was a very divergent take",2022-11-17 12:17:34
i do agree but personally i thought it was jarring to see the queen turn on okoye immediately and theres never any reconciliation between them,2022-11-14 19:25:06
" i was concerned that they were about to pull some shurimbaku mess and was trying to calculate the age gap but fortunately that didn’t happen 

i thought they were going for shurinamor as a part of their alliance",2022-11-20 17:48:09
" i was concerned that they were about to pull some shurimbaku mess 

am i the only person who thought that shuri is a lesbian",2022-11-11 14:04:49
" okoye deserved to be fired

but someone should replace her no but the queen instead fired her and then did all the military decisions by herself that was odd",2022-11-11 22:11:23
"you were concerned about a 29 year old and a 35 year old being too big of an age gap to be romantic

why",2022-11-11 04:53:25
i never expected an “uh oh” all things considered i’m assuming it was in the original plans,2022-11-11 03:18:25
the typical fanfare not being played and it being in regal purple really set the tone of what the film will be,2022-11-11 03:27:19
i saw it at alamo drafthouse and their premovie dont talk message made me tear up it was from the clip that him and letitia wright filmed in 2018 i wasnt sure how they would transition it gracefully but they did with a tribute message and it felt like a gut punch even before the movie started,2022-11-11 05:21:24
it’s on the digital version of black panther 1 as well,2022-11-11 04:22:45
the ending too and the fact that they respected the moment and the tribute by not doing an additional post credits scene,2022-11-11 13:13:25
it was amazingly well done when the montage started with the marvel logo the theater was completely silent,2022-11-11 04:52:42
admittedly this might have been my favorite part of the film just a perfect tribute with only chadwick across the screen set the tone for the entire film,2022-11-11 04:38:33
them leaving out the music was a great choice,2022-11-11 03:09:41
heard lots of sniffles in my screening room  the lady seated next to me was weeping pretty much nonstop throughout the movie,2022-11-11 03:09:10
you could hear a pin drop in mine the emotions were felt not clapping or anything just respect,2022-11-11 05:15:06
there was a guy behind me that wouldnt shut the  even during this had to shush him at the beginning of the film,2022-11-11 05:31:18
saw it tonight same here  happened and during the ending too first marvel movie that made me shed a tear at the end not necessarily for the movie but for chadwick real emotions involving real people,2022-11-12 04:18:03
i was happy that no one in my theater cheered or made noise after it finished,2022-11-11 03:55:03
easily the best part of the movie,2022-11-11 03:36:30
the air in the theater suddenly got a bit dusty there,2022-11-11 04:19:02
same completely silent in my screening chills,2022-11-11 11:02:39
"i get goosebumps every time i see the marvel studios flip as new moments from the movies are added 

this one took my breath away",2022-11-11 15:30:14
it was supposed to be a moment of silence and even my theater read the room correctly,2022-11-11 13:02:17
legit teared up it was really a moving tribute and am glad they did something so memorable,2022-12-07 06:53:14
someone in my theater was playing on their phone so the og pokémon battle music went off during the marvel studios logo…,2022-11-11 04:05:44
same in mine which featured lots of otherwise loud teens,2022-11-11 06:01:55
i choked up,2022-11-11 21:36:19
i think this is the new thing marvel will do when people die play a compilation of their appearances in the opening logo they did that for stan lee in into the spiderverse,2022-11-11 05:18:49
shame i had the opposite experience great movie but the theater would not shut up the entire time only time i had a worse experience with a loud audience was the first black panther movie ,2022-11-11 18:04:44
99 of my theater was quiet during it and then 3 assholes decided to  and play music on their phones halfway through it,2022-11-11 22:55:04
someone spoke for a second and three people told them to shut the ,2022-11-11 23:33:53
shouldnt they be quiet at all times lol,2022-11-12 22:57:25
shouldnt they have been quiet for the whole movie,2022-12-15 06:35:57
i could hear people crying during it including myself very powerful moment the sort of thing i go to movies for processing shared grief that i didnt even fully know i had,2022-11-11 11:18:39
there were a few moments that were dead silent and it was so cool,2022-11-12 14:49:58
so were they talking during the movie before,2022-11-14 00:53:10
definitely heard some sniffles after that at my showing,2022-11-11 03:10:00
i shed some manly tears,2022-11-11 03:13:12
my theatre wasnt quiet i could hear everyone snuffling and crying including myself,2022-11-11 07:29:08
we all started clapping it was a moment,2022-11-11 19:05:11
they also used it on the first black panther i noticed it when i rewatched it on disney,2022-11-15 23:45:07
my gf and i watched the first black panther earlier this week on disney and they did it there too,2022-11-19 01:53:06
mine tried but i seem to always find myself in that one screening where theres a group of giggling high friends or someone who cant respect the silence and struggles to rip open a bag of candy for way too  long,2022-11-20 05:28:12
i feel like the namor plot should have been shifted a movie back and that the focus of this movie should have been shuri and wakanda dealing with the loss of t’challa while dealing the fallout of choosing to open their borders and becoming a player on the world stage,2022-11-12 21:31:28
i think that whole america vibranium martin short thing is a set up for another marvel movie,2022-11-12 11:12:13
"i thought it worked well enough namor clearly had trauma he was working through so seeing the parallels between him and shuri’s grieving was great plus we got the queen’s absolutely stellar scene with okoye which was one of the best scenes of the film it could feel a bit odd going from the political issues to grieving but the tone was consistent and they still nailed the important moments 

it’s nowhere near as tonally dissonant as thor love and thunder where they’d jump between a father grieving the loss of his child and raging against the gods and ten minute long scenes taking about ",2022-11-21 23:00:22
local redditor discovers what a b plot is,2022-11-13 06:06:04
almost literally felt like two movies stacked on top of each other with that three hour runtime jfc,2022-11-12 21:04:13
yep the first half had the international conferences and the scene where the american ship got sunk so it felt like an action epic and then the second half it was like they realized they wanted a main character and quickly made shuri a main character,2022-11-26 05:33:27
i dont think either would have worked separate from each other though grieving does not make a full story but it added a much more dynamic layer to the geopolitics,2022-11-15 09:28:22
and more namor less shuri,2022-11-16 06:07:25
every movie needs more mbaku,2022-11-13 17:24:17
no room for mbaku,2023-11-18 16:47:46
what’s the reference,2022-11-11 05:33:03
yeah i have no idea what happened there he just says that and then suddenly burns and the fight is over,2022-11-11 08:19:08
why would a mayan tribesman invaded by the spanish have a latin catchphrase,2022-11-21 19:28:29
geeked tf out when he said that,2022-11-12 00:59:55
i was struggling to understand that one can you help explain,2022-11-11 05:39:39
solid reference,2022-11-11 03:44:12
my favorite part,2022-11-11 04:46:50
i was the only one in my theater who understood that reference,2022-11-12 06:49:01
the quality of marvel has dropped significantly since endgame there’s always been issues with their projects in previous phases but phase 4 in particular just feels so messy in a way that’s hard to ignore they spend so much unnecessary screen time setting up future projects nowadays instead of creating a story that can just stand on its own,2022-11-12 11:38:56
shangchi to me is the only thing that stands out about phase 4 and even then the movie suffers from the cliche marvel act 3,2022-11-12 06:39:55
shang chi was  awesome i can rewatch that movie just by itself cause it’s so much fun,2022-11-14 07:29:29
100 agree everything outside of spiderman and loki has been utter  ive skipped some of it and from the stuff that i have actually seen theres no substance feige sold out dude lost whatever spark he had that took us from iron man through to endgame its sad to see what the mcu has become,2022-11-12 05:06:09
i agree phase 4 hasn’t been great at all but i genuinely believe this to be the best one,2022-11-12 17:46:27
they wrote black widow in 13 days and doctor strange 2 as they were filming it they were going to give the reins to james gunn but then let him go temporarily so they’ve been stumbling ever since it’s such a mess multiverse tva shehulk altering all of existence they’ve broken space time and reality itself,2022-11-15 00:22:26
"seeing freemans charecter just reminded me of civil war

and how  grand that movie felt

good times",2022-11-15 22:18:26
the only phase 4 stuff ive truly enjoyed is no way home and the gotg holiday special the rest has been pretty weak,2022-12-03 22:20:40
for real the mcu pretty much died after endgame all of this is just fanfic nonsense there’s literally no hype for kang at all i feel nothing when i see him in the ant man 3 trailer,2022-11-16 06:06:48
this sums it up perfectly for me i think they could have chopped 30 min off i also loved all of the languages everyone just sounds so cool,2022-11-11 04:31:59
plus if they had shortened tightened up the movie before they  bunch of unnecessary and way too expositional stuff they could have put that money towards making the movie look good i know covid probably played a role but jesus some of that looked like tv quality special effects eternals was boring too but at least it looked like they were actually outside,2022-11-11 05:16:52
seeing how they handled the chadwick tributes in the movie makes me even angrier at how rise of skywalker handled carrie fishers death,2022-11-12 05:13:00
yup entirely agree with this,2022-11-11 04:30:50
the final act felt so rushed like they forgot everything they built for the characters the greatness of wakanda’s fighters,2022-11-13 06:30:08
fully agreed with this comment overall the editing really stuck out to me as choppy as well  many scene transitions seemed so abrupt,2022-11-13 11:28:20
"it felt like when the movie was good it was so good that every bad part of the movie dragged me back to the reality of oh yeah this is a marvel movie i cant expect that much

i dont know if thats high praise or not",2022-11-14 09:02:33
"i agree with everything you said except for letitia being phenomenal i thought she was especially lackluster her crying scenes for chadwick seemed authentic because they most likely were but her character had no charisma and seemed to get swallowed by other characters in every scene 

a shame really because the black panther character is amazing but i feel she’s not the one to keep it alive",2022-11-16 06:00:39
"agreed on the editing lots of scenes cut at what felt like was the middle of a line like the dialogue continued but they just removed it 

i thought the movie started really great but it lost me when they went to namors city from then on there was the occasional interesting scene but i was mostly bored",2022-12-03 22:17:24
your critiques are valid but youre  if you think this movie was anywhere near disappointing,2022-11-13 03:41:20
i didnt see it as too dark but i noticed they blurred everything not in the the center of the screen in most shots like if someones face was the focus their hand or shirt would be almost as blurred as the background maybe this is the way it is in most movies but its the first time ive ever noticed it,2022-11-11 14:40:42
i feel like most movies are shot too dark lately,2022-11-11 20:01:51
the underwater city shots were rad when i could make out what was on the screen,2022-11-13 06:59:14
yes it was very hard to see a lot of the time it was annoying,2022-11-11 17:15:50
saw it standard then imax and it was literally night and day,2022-11-11 18:47:05
watched it in 3d and couldnt see  literal black excellence,2022-11-11 23:07:59
"thats really my only complaint honestly there was scenes that were way too dark it was near impossible to see what was going on clearly

id probably had given it a 9 instead of an 8 if that wasnt the case",2022-11-11 13:33:21
yep i saw it in 3d and the first 20ish minutes were near impossible to make out at times i kept taking the glasses off to try and see what was even happening it was a bummer to have all the presumably cool looking underwater footage basically indistinguishable,2022-11-12 04:26:45
i didnt have any issues in my theater,2022-11-11 19:18:38
saw it in imax nope did not feel the same way,2022-11-12 11:12:45
i did but i think that was more my theaters crappy old projectors,2022-11-13 11:12:52
not at all but i saw it in imax imax 3d actually which darkens the image further but i felt like everything was totally clear must have been your screen,2022-11-15 09:25:56
some of the night shots were definitely kind of hard to see nothing as bad as that one episode of game of thrones but still aggressively dark,2022-11-17 16:54:38
apparently this depended on how good your theater is but i agree i couldn’t see a thing during some early scenes,2022-11-13 18:59:02
"yes i thought it was dark as  couldn’t see 

i went to a premium screen in canada but i wish we had laser projectors here our imax is the only one that has dual laser projection",2022-11-13 23:28:50
okay good to know it wasn’t just my theater,2022-11-17 10:35:49
yes i kept thinking this,2023-02-01 01:32:20
riri did that  i thought “welp she’s gonna need to move to wakanda permanently now”,2022-11-11 03:10:04
i really liked namora and attuma yeah they were really minor characters but it was great seeing namor surrounded by really competent and threatening lieutenants i know well get more namor in something else but i hope we get those two back too,2022-11-11 03:07:58
that intro for the talokan was some  out of a horror movie lol loved how it ended with this dark figure in the skies,2022-11-11 04:21:09
"i loved the blue people loved their introduction loved the whales loved their little water masks and combat skills

think were gonna get a lot more of that in a month or so

also…when shuri i think sets the cop cars on fire…did she just  several cops 

i think they showed them running away just a moment before the drone crashed",2022-11-11 03:08:24
right when she took out the drone i was like ooothats gonna cause some damage in old beantown wait maybe it just lands in the charles nope killed a bunch of cops,2022-11-11 05:04:01
diplomatic immunity baby,2022-11-11 14:37:16
you’re  right she did lol,2022-11-11 04:11:12
i dont know why i didnt have 100 faith in coogler after black panther just everything world building was amazing,2022-11-11 03:53:14
"you really had to look but i think they were running off to the side just as the explosion happened

edit and if she did… i promise you val will bring that  up in thunderbolts",2022-11-11 03:14:36
"so how do they control the whales again 

i really enjoyed the way they fight but aside from namor i don’t really understand the extent of their powers",2022-11-11 04:02:32
yeah they killed some cops who were just following orders and i was like  thats not hero behavior,2022-11-11 06:48:22
both the wakandans and talokans have this were better than everyone else so we must protect the vibrantium thing but then theyre murking people left and right to protect other people from having life saving tech and basically free energy in many ways its just as bad,2022-11-13 07:22:15
just wait until december there’s a whole movie coming out about the blue people,2022-11-11 04:43:08
did anyone else laugh at the orca swimming in the battle march or just me,2022-11-11 05:05:33
honestly wakandians come off as real assholes in this,2022-11-11 03:09:57
i dont get how some healed after okoye stabbed them but the ones nakia shot just died did i miss something,2022-11-11 18:22:15
" this feels like yet another marvel movie where nameless government foil in the beginning is actually pretty correct 

yeah the queens speech at the un sounded very badass but from an international politics pov she was basically being kim jong un boasting about having nukes and nobody being able to stop them",2022-11-20 17:52:13
"the difference between good guys and bad guys can often hinge on a single decision  sure the governments might be right had namor won and brought his war to the surface but being a hero means you dont throw a kid to an executioner you risk everything to save innocent people when there still is a chance to have a peaceful outcome  and it worked shuri saved both riri and namor  

even if the government was right about namor had they known about him they wouldnt simply be defending themselves theyd do what shuri almost did and go on the offensive probably dropping nukes into the ocean and make everything worse  being right doesnt give them the wisdom or moral high ground to act correctly it takes someone whos willing to risk themselves to achieve peace  

it also recalls the first movie where killmonger is essentially right but his actions were not  taking wakandas weapons and going to war with the whole world would likely lead to much more casualties than even he wanted  as shuri pointed out he wanted revenge for himself and not to save the world  his change would have destroyed wakanda as much as an invasion would  in the end the good guys win by convincing everyone theres another way not by cowardly killing anyone who might present a threat",2022-11-11 22:50:19
"  they  everyone on the surface right  

i still don’t see how this happens like that city of thousands could reasonably expect to take over the world governments would start dropping all kinds of  on them from 30000 ft after building as many of those vibranium detectors as possible",2022-11-12 01:21:51
" ike they’re about to  off ironheart and the wakandans on that ship

which is weird because the whole vibe of this one and the first is that these places are supposed to be better than western civilization theyre literally not",2022-11-13 07:25:24
yeah i wasnt a fan of the literal translation of namur with the winged feet being his ability to fly incredibly fast and nimbly like the mcu has been rooted in semirealism since the beginning yes its introduced magic and gods which still have their explanations to how they work in the universe namor being able to fly that well just because he has wings on his feet makes no sense lol yes they explained he was a mutant but i wish they had added more to that explanation or just a slightly different interpretation of the character design because it just looked incredibly silly and yes his people were they part lizard as well i was struggling to understand how they were climbing the sides of the boat and fighting on them too can his people just walk on walls like spiderman,2022-11-11 16:31:35
i ended up seeing wakanda forever after avatar 2 and it was pure navi nightmare fuel to me especially the siren song scenes,2022-12-31 15:59:34
having the wakandans refuse to divulge details to show theyre respecting talakans secrecy,2022-11-11 04:23:15
no that’s a problem i have with the movie too it makes no sense why he’s in it,2022-11-11 04:03:41
sets up the us would be willing to go with wakanda for vibranium especially with val in a position of power and now that ross is most likely in wakanda val and the us can use that as an excuse to attackinvade wakanda to take back rosstake vibranium,2022-11-11 07:59:40
secret invasion i think since ross is gonna be in that but why the  was val here she contributed nothing,2022-11-11 05:21:05
the last scene with him being rescued by okoye was worth it something like ‘colonizer in chains… now i have seen everything”,2022-11-11 21:27:07
the us was a major influence to the conflict of the story and the wakandans need some form of contact to what america has ie ririthe scientist enter the only white dude from the previous movie lol he was the connective tissue the rest of the plot with val was really dull though and only exists to be an mcu teaser,2022-11-12 06:04:25
"he was involved in pushing the story forward as in a story telling perspective his interests and actions progressed the story and had consequences for other characters in a way that is logical and doesnt come off as deus ex machina that being said while technically correct the movie grinds to a halt during that subplot visually boring the acting is freeman looking off to the distance while on his phone or having cliche banter with val its not engaging and could have been slimmed down in the script writing process or the editing room

i loved the movie but there could have been 10 min trimmed here and it could have been punched up stylistically",2022-11-11 06:06:38
 is thunderbolts,2022-11-13 22:11:55
the setting up of future films is one of the reasons i quit the mcu after endgame until that film i repeatedly felt robbed of the satisfaction that comes with a properly concluded story,2022-11-11 15:11:11
"was hoping that at least coogler would get to free himself from setting up the larger mcu 

it will be great if they do some more stand alone feature shangchi to an extent was",2022-11-11 08:18:39
the truth is i think marvel needed to insert some plot points for the bigger story and decided to jam it into this movie i doubt it was done for no reason but it does make the movie a little bit clunky for it,2022-11-11 08:13:17
i thought although it doesnt amount to anything in terms of payoff it was there to add pressure that the other superpowers were actively working towards their own agendas thus justifying namor’s perspective of the surface world including in the end when he says they will eventually attack wakanda and they’ll need us,2022-11-11 09:42:25
you would think after 4 phases and a decade of movies people would understand that yes marvel movies have portions that exist only to setup future stories like or not it happens it will happen again its how they operate pointing it out doesnt make you smart we all know its there for that sole purpose,2022-11-13 01:34:44
yes the whole point was to show that namor wasnt wrong,2022-11-15 09:28:57
"for real his first scene telling them about riri was a cool little cameotype scene and a reminder he exists 

then he kept showing up for no reason by the time theyre hijacking his truck at the end i was like why the  is he still here in this movie",2022-12-03 22:21:43
you know the guys in the comics division are coming up with ways to retcon namor to be similar to his movie counterpart,2022-11-12 06:38:43
it might just be me but its kinda weird that ethiopias never been mentioned given how influential the nation is amongst panafrican culture as the only realworld example of an african power evading the scramble for africa by participating in it idk,2022-11-12 08:09:32
and his name originating from the spanish for without love just so  creative and impressed the  out of me one of the most brilliant reinventions of a comic book character on the big screen that ive seen,2022-11-15 23:54:48
we all want a namor movie now lol,2022-11-12 05:49:46
"only problem i had with that is that they somehow made a whole underwater multicity civilization in under 400ish years and they started with only 10ish people

thats an absurd amount of kids each generation",2022-11-16 08:43:28
preach,2022-11-11 05:12:55
that place from shang chi,2022-11-12 11:14:25
and yet you claim wakanda had no reason to help out this similar tribe,2022-11-11 16:09:46
ironheart suit felt crazy cg for some reason midnight angel was just ,2022-11-11 03:11:51
"which makes no sense

nearly every iron man armor looked so sick

these are just ehhh",2022-11-11 03:10:34
my friend told me after that the ironheart suit looked like megascizor from pokémon and i can’t unsee it now,2022-11-11 06:38:44
looks like a pokémon and samus metroid prime what were they smoking,2022-11-11 03:12:25
like a big hero 6 suit just poorly executed,2022-11-11 03:56:27
ironheart looked pretty good a bit clunky but i’m glad it’s not a clone of one of tony’s main suits,2022-11-11 03:13:17
ironheart suit looked really generic and i feel like they knew it and hedged by telling her she couldn’t keep it,2022-11-11 08:42:47
ironheart looked fine imo  im sure theyll revise the design a bit and make it better  but yeah first off midnight angel is a horrible name for those suits and i understand they were going for the african mask vibe but wow they did not nail it  it does look hideous,2022-11-11 03:17:48
"i saw ironhearts suit and immediately thought of samus from the metroid games

surprised nintendo hasnt knocked on their doors yet for character infringement",2022-11-12 09:46:32
"ironheart was made in less than a week pretty sure thats what they spend on in reality too

totally looked like a samus suit or something which is exactly what a 19 year old would make tho

midnight angle tho no saving that and they all knew how  it was

it was so out of place compared to all the other stuff they wear in wakanda its not funny id expect talokan to wear it as it looks morelikr something youd see with them",2022-11-13 13:30:13
the iron heart helmet looked like a baby rio off of regular ironman,2022-11-11 10:57:19
cg team is overworked,2022-11-11 11:48:57
its strongly based off the comics which does not translate to the mcu well at all,2022-11-11 17:59:50
literally looked like toys,2022-11-12 21:15:17
i know they wanted to separate riris origins away from tony but man the suit is so tonally weird,2022-11-13 02:26:04
the ironheat suit was serviceable it did what it needed to do the midnighr angel suits were awful though nix that  now,2022-11-13 03:38:57
i loved the iron heart suit looked very visually distinct from tonys suits also i loved that it looked more bulky and mechanical than his most recent ones theres just something so much more badass about it when its a big clunky light mech vs a streamlined nanobot leotard,2022-11-11 14:50:45
yeah im glad they explicitly said shes not taking the suit with her as jesus like the comic suit looks fantastic i loved her prototype and the final thing looks like a bad 2000s digimon,2022-11-13 00:55:52
suits have been wack this phase the new captain america suit from the finale of falcon and winter soldier was also terrible,2022-11-13 04:54:46
"its so strange the comic version of the midnight angel suits looks like something id expect a wakanda soldier to wear 

the movie versions look more egyptian themed",2022-11-14 00:06:18
"i loved the ironheart suit personally  why did you dislike it

to me it looks cool and sleek  you may say a kid who lacks experience shouldnt be able to make something it took tony stark a lifetime to perfect but she was in wakanda and they likely took her jerryrigged suit and spruced it up with their nanobots  if you dont like it you can blame a 19 year olds fantasy of what a cool suit would look like over starks more practical version  i think it looks  awesome with the wings and the gun arm",2022-11-11 22:53:54
"i thought the ironheart suit was fine its only mark ii for her so im honestly glad it wasnt as refined or cool as the iron man armors id like the character to earn those advancements in future filmsshows

midnight angel is a case where being accurate to the comics wasnt great",2022-11-12 05:34:18
i thought her mk1 was pretty good,2022-11-12 09:58:47
the suits design is adapted from the comics not an original design,2022-11-16 07:07:16
the ship was really weird its huge but apparently all it does is carry the sonic emitter and all the fighters just stand on top where there arent even really any defenses or anything its just a flat surface also once again even though its a war between two technologically advanced nations the whole final battle comes down to almost entirely just hand to hand weapons,2022-11-11 04:27:29
the third act is underwhelming not to mention there is a good 2030 minutes that could’ve been cut from this film,2022-11-11 04:33:15
"this was one of the first times the third act formula really bothered me and stood out i know it’s gotten old to complain about it and i should know what to expect but i was really hoping there would be a little bit more depth to this movie or something different given the unique circumstances around it 

i don’t know why but for a brief moment when namor stabbed shuri i actually got my hopes up that she would diebe critically wounded he would go back to the water and the film would resolve itself in a different way",2022-11-11 13:41:41
"honestly the third act felt like the weakest part of the movie for me tonally the bulk of the movie felt closer to a drama in terms of trying to prevent a war breaking out

then you just have the obligatory marvel big battle set piece that felt incredibly tacked on to hit the marvel movie quota",2022-11-12 00:59:11
eh them fighting on the side of the ship was different enough,2022-11-11 04:13:35
funny enough i found shehulks ending formulaic itself in how hard it patted itself on the back for breaking the fourth wall in a way that so many other shows and films have already done,2022-11-11 05:20:13
"totally agree i think there shouldnt have been a break after namor attacked wakanda it should have led directly into the final conflict that break and montage sequence dragged for me and the momentum of the queens death was lost

i dont think it would be hard to do shuri tried to print the heart shaped herb in the opening sequence she could have made the change on the fly taken it as wakanda is being attacked confirmed her mothers death in the spirit realm and then led straight into the final fight",2022-11-12 21:38:09
yep you can’t  on your own work and then make no changes like if bond kept being campy after austin powers,2022-11-13 07:28:03
it felt much like the first bp’s third act a bunch of grunts fight it out then peace gets declared and everyone just takes their ball and go home how many died blown up by sónics or bombas real lack of risk or weight,2022-11-12 05:13:08
i dont know if its covid or what but this was a truly terrible third act climax possibly their worst ever,2022-12-03 22:23:06
can you please share the ending of shehulk i didnt watch but i dont mind spoilers,2023-02-01 13:59:07
it’s just like james gunn said about superhero movie 3rd acts they’re very underwritten in order to fit production time tables you can see it very well here as the 3rd act is much rougher and fails to tie things together,2023-02-11 09:07:32
look i’m just glad we didn’t have some huge sky pillar or cgi monster to ruin the climax this time shang chi is like 23 of a great movie and then pulls that  wakanda forever actually followed through on the emotional climax,2022-11-21 23:13:37
unfortunately the films have to follow a set plot and dont have the ability to freestyle like the tv shows,2022-11-11 03:30:26
 the third act was my fav of the movie lol the final fights were epic i enjoyed the  out of that battle sequence,2022-11-13 04:19:52
with rayquaza fighting alongside kyogre after all rayquaza is based on quetzalcoatl the flying serpent ,2022-11-14 10:19:42
,2022-11-11 21:35:08
black panther and terrible final battle name a better duo,2022-11-11 21:12:46
not only did they cut every 2 seconds they cut to a different fight,2022-11-11 15:11:35
"so same deal as the first one 

decent 1st and 2nd act  3rd act with a horrible final boss fight",2022-11-11 15:59:23
the fight on the ship wasnt as cool as the shuri vs namor fight still better cg than the first ones 3rd act even if the conflict wasnt as compelling,2022-11-11 18:35:59
on point with the d marvel series,2022-11-11 20:46:43
pepsi did michael worse than shuri did namor,2022-11-11 21:27:31
after seeing avatar 2 first before bp 2 it felt like navi nightmare fuel,2022-12-31 16:04:41
he told his mom about the kid,2022-11-12 07:26:21
the queen couldnt be black panther because the heart shaped herbs were all burned shuri didnt replicate it until after she had passed,2022-11-12 23:25:51
"	if i had to spend a bajillion movies looking at scarjo’s  in leather i deserve a namor that’s wearing booty shorts those were not booty shorts


hollywood and especially disney are such  when it comes to sexualizing men honestly one of my biggest issues with the movie",2022-12-04 23:59:04
yea that’s all aquaman,2022-11-11 10:27:28
i can say with confidence that aquaman did the whole underwater kingdom shtick far far better,2022-11-11 10:20:51
"i was stupidly happy seeing orcas joining in the mix

source watched too much free  as a kid attributed to love of orcas",2022-11-14 04:55:35
avatar trailer before it showed me more imagination in this realm than this movie did,2022-11-11 18:29:22
exactly aquaman completely  on this movie i expected more from ryan coogler,2022-11-11 13:41:59
killmonger tells her that t’challa was weak for forgiving zemo  behavior after coming back from the ancestral plane indicates that part of her believes killmonger is right the arc helped shuri to understand t’challa’s action in civil war thus connecting her to t’challa just like in the first movie t’challa rejects his father’s position shuri rejects killmonger’s,2022-11-11 03:28:59
they pretty much mirrored shuris arc in this movie with tchallas in civil war felt like a great way to honor tchalla,2022-11-11 03:09:38
also basset’s “show them who you are” which she says to t’challa on his first challenge day,2022-11-13 04:13:39
in the ultimates 1610 universe mankind did create mutants,2022-11-11 06:06:59
"the talokani arent all mutants theyre more like genetically modified humans basically inhumans but without kree experimentation

namor is a mutant by blood",2022-11-11 12:13:44
curetreatment  a vaccine,2022-11-11 19:29:27
disney is trying to tell us something,2022-11-11 04:03:42
" if the plan was to  her anyway why even involve wakanda
 
 

my assumption was they couldnt track her  

 shuri full on gets stabbed and kind of just walks it off like i know that flower is supposed to make you strong but didnt killmonger die in a similar way

killmonger could have been saved according to tchalla he more chose to die that way",2022-11-11 17:16:13
i must have missed something but how did shuri even get stabbed when her suit is vibranium isn’t the final fight in the first film all about trying to get the sonic waves to disrupt the suit long enough for black panther to be able to stab killmonger and in this one namor is just casually slashing through vibranium ships and armour throughout even thanos struggled to break cap’s shield,2022-11-13 08:45:09
"i love the first half of the movie it feels the stakes are just higher when all the good guys are just human

i actually wish they could beat the villain with science only no superpowers",2022-11-11 23:38:52
"i feel like they got stabbed in different places though i vaguely recall discourse about the effects of being stabbed in the heart in response to the ending of the first black panther implying killmonger was got right in the heart i thought shuri was stabbed in the stomachgeneral tummy area   


that said shed still suffer the effects of taking that wound and likely be unable to move much if at all the idea that she is still able to walk around and even fight is beyond absurd like just have her not be stabbed   


this is all overlooking the fact that i dont recall any mentions of her knowing how to fight whereas tchalla had trained to become the black panther for most of his life no",2022-11-12 00:51:08
namor was using them to locate riri he didn’t trust they would hand her over his plan was to intercept and  her once they located her it’s a fairly common trope for villains to get heroes to lead a target out into the open,2022-11-13 05:01:25
yeah wakanda is canonically a landlocked country in the mcu i guess hes just bringing the ocean with him upstream,2022-11-12 04:35:27
"im kinda dissapointed they didnt stay with the killmonger angle for atleast a while longer

having a bp with conflicted emotions would have been interesting  after the noble tchalla

instead its dealt with like 30 mins later",2022-11-17 08:46:41
it just bugs me how much this movie suffers from the classic trope of  as many foot soldiers and generals as you want but the second you get to the boss who you are after suddenly killing is not the way like tell that to the dozens of dead atlantians you already killed ,2022-11-26 20:24:20
"i dont think so i think she was never strongly pro vengeance but grieving guilty and not in touch with any sort of spiritual balance regardless of belief system a fundamentally good person who admires her noble predecessors being brought to the brink when given power at the same time as dealing with a huge amount of anger and grief makes sense to me she didnt embrace killmongers advice on the plane shes horrified that her subconscious or whatever took her there in the first place 

when first offered an alliance with namor to burn the world with him she declines she gets counselled against going to war just for the sake of vengeance by mbaku her decision to stay merciful made a lot of sense

i do think its cheating that she gets to have good advice from a passed ancestor without trying anything at all to follow her traditions or religions though i thought shed start to pray or try make a connection when impaled by the spear but no the queen was like excuse me from beyond anyway",2023-02-21 21:28:13
motion picture score is out now title of the track is “wakanda forever” very very good stuff,2022-11-11 05:40:57
soundtrack in general may have been the highlight for me that stormzy intro in the burna boy song was incredible,2022-11-12 07:48:45
"wakanda forever track 19 on the score maybe skip to 108

to me this is already as recognizable as the avengers theme the synth theme being used after the resurrection of the black panther with synthetic heartshaped herbs 

chills this hero entry is on par with thors bringmethanos scene in infinity war",2022-11-11 13:03:37
this was one of the better marvel scores in a long time that synth in the scene you mentioned hit so hard namor ‘s theme was perfectly ominous as well,2022-11-13 15:57:25
the siren chant from the first boat scene at night was great but holy  those synths during the suit reveal were wicked can’t wait to relisten  the whole thing has major 80s horror synth vibes or maybe even it follows more recently,2022-11-15 04:59:30
"theres a soundtrack album out

ludwig göransson is a flipping genius",2022-11-13 23:39:14
thats ludwig for you,2022-11-13 06:22:01
the amount of synth played in the setpieces was awesome,2022-11-14 06:20:24
bro same,2022-11-11 04:50:57
the problem is disney probably specifically needed those scenes to set up some future project,2022-11-11 03:43:39
i thought they were going to play a role in the end of the movie but they really did have no impact although julia and martin are really really charismatic,2022-11-11 05:09:51
it makes ross an outlaw now i guess,2022-11-11 05:55:40
it’s so frustrating this movie was so  good everywhere else that plotline virtually had no effect on the film,2022-11-11 04:46:18
only plot relevancy that i could see was to aide shuri and okoye to find riri and set up a future storyline for the thunderbolts to infiltrate wakanda to get ross and start a war with wakanda that leads to the wakandans requesting help from namor but yeah that subplot could’ve been cut down with a few other scenes,2022-11-11 05:18:12
"this is important with connecting to the overall story arcs of phase 5

big issues with thor is it was first off far to joking and second didn’t connect to anything",2022-11-11 04:54:45
hard disagree their clearly building towards something probably the thunderbolds invading wakanda,2022-11-13 03:42:08
i absolutely loathe dreyfuss character shes so selfaware and its just like marvel snark personification cringe as ,2022-11-13 06:58:47
there was also that terrible scene when val pulls handcuffs out of the kitchen drawer and literally end the scene right then and there it was so abrupt and horrible lol,2022-11-14 06:51:24
it did contribute to the greater mcu it’s all set up for thunderbolts val is gonna be the creator of the team like fury for the avengers,2022-11-12 06:17:53
it only existed to give jld more introduction into the universe and give her character more emotional context before her show is released,2022-11-12 00:49:46
completely agree,2022-11-12 04:37:53
i’m wondering if it’s some kind of set up for later films,2022-11-12 13:39:01
it contributes a lot to the greater mcu because it’s setting up the thunderbolts which has character tie ins from this movie fatws and a few other things from this phase,2022-11-12 17:09:18
definitely felt age of ultron where they forced whedon to put in a bunch of ads for future movies one of the things i liked about the first bp was it felt self contained,2022-11-14 05:24:47
bald headed demon,2022-11-11 03:12:37
she was definitely just here so she could get a show but truth be told i am willing to watch a whole show with her now she was a fun character with a lot of potential,2022-11-11 05:19:02
she stole a lot of moments looking forward to her show i wasnt sure about her going in but now i love her,2022-11-12 06:37:13
out of the entire movie that line got the loudest laugh from the audience,2022-11-13 01:45:29
"she was funny but a bit too mary sue for me 
obviously waiting for her show to give her characterization but shoehorning another iron man when we already have war machinearmor wars coming up the midnight angels suits… if everyone has an iron man suit they aren’t special anymore",2022-11-11 08:58:54
not only was the violence super sanitized but it was a  tactical decision to fight sea people…on the sea what was gonna be their plan if namor decided to call up a few blue whales to overturn their boat,2022-11-17 13:38:04
is he getting his own movie,2022-11-11 21:36:52
avatar has some of the best vfx of all time so it’s a little unfair to compare them but i do agree mcu effects pale in comparison,2022-11-11 08:08:41
and way of the water looks great in 2 d too i will be watching both versions when it hits the theatre,2022-11-11 08:28:04
because cameron actually cares about the artistic integrity of his product while the mouse wants to knock out 10 of these things a year and would pay its vfx team sweatshop wages if it legally could,2022-11-11 05:51:16
"wakanda forever actually felt better made to me than thor 4 shang chi black panther or the antman trailer that played before the beaches felt like they actually shot on them the bridge fight also felt real and onlocation under water looked pretty good in most spots but there were definitely still a share of rough scenes that the mcu shouldnt have with its budget i agree there

the antman trailer that plays against avatar now that is embarrassing looks like spy kids 3d by comparison",2022-11-12 02:43:23
"i meanway of water took 13 years to make
it would be surprising if it looks cheap",2022-11-11 07:28:44
honestly comparing anything to a cameron flick is borderline unfair the only movie of his that has aged poorly in visuals is the abyss,2022-11-11 23:41:30
"in my case the theater showed the 3d avatar trailer before a non3d showing of black panther

lets say avatar is stunning in a very different way when its all red and green",2022-11-12 15:27:21
someone correct me if im wrong but with avater 2 a good chunk of it i believe was filmed on  location they filmed it underwater and everything probably why it looks much better,2022-11-12 03:12:45
"the way of water trailer rolled right after the little mermaid trailer in my theatre and it immediately struck me as brutal antimarketing for disney

the difference in visual quality was enormous",2022-11-14 08:14:08
thats comparing like 5 years of cg work to this which likely had less than a year of cg work  a bit of an unfair comparison,2022-11-13 11:37:03
way of the water looked terrible what are you on about,2022-11-20 04:00:31
the first avatar had better cgi than most marvel films,2022-11-11 22:58:17
i actually thought avatar looked way too cartoonish and more like a pixar film than real life and black panther to me looked way better,2022-11-12 20:04:55
it’s a lot easier to make cgi look good when everything onscreen is cgi,2022-11-11 13:18:38
"well avatar is essentially made to be a tech demo showcasing the absolute top notch cgi people didn’t go to the first avatar for the story that being a pretty generic “people overcoming outsiders trying to exploit their land and resources” plot line they went to see cgi and animation way beyond anything that was out at the time 

meanwhile this movie one of multiple cgiladen mcu projects pumped out per year where there’s less time for due diligence in the cgi with the tight deadlines with a little more reliance on the story as you have to make it connect to like five different moviesshows",2022-11-11 07:05:41
i started calling it way of wakanda,2022-11-21 03:13:33
"i think the way they did the effects in aquaman were a lot better

the talokan were clearly holding their breath in these scenes and it shows so much lol",2022-11-26 08:41:38
"they need to hire the guy who created all the armors from iron man 3

each one of those was so unique but also so sick

whereas these felt like weird metroid ripoffs with too much cg",2022-11-11 03:39:47
i think more so than the design the cgi was just horrible looked like plastic,2022-11-11 10:23:35
riri was out there looking like she got suit design advice from the power rangers,2022-11-11 06:58:16
"i mean if we go by the done in less than a week by a 19 years old look a samus like suit inspired by ironman is exactly what youd expect

like year it  but i feel like it was meant to sucksimilar to her previous suit made of scraps which actually looked cool and closer to ivans first suit",2022-11-13 13:44:29
"i can excuse the design simply because of the individual who built it

she’s not tony stark she’s a 19 year old mit student who was given the opportunity to build an iron man suit in the most technologically advanced nation on earth yeah her design choices are probably going to be over the top",2022-11-13 18:58:20
hopefully they kept that suit in wakanda so a better one can be made later it was bad but nowhere near midnight angel level,2022-11-12 21:42:32
one a scale of one to ten how would you rate your pain,2022-11-14 16:34:22
yea looked like metroid armor cool for samus  not for riri,2022-11-18 07:33:46
beetleborg ,2022-11-12 07:30:14
 omggg,2022-11-13 08:09:01
honestly the skrulls are going to tip over the marvel boat people are already iffy about phase 4 and once they learn that a  ton of the people they thought were humans are actually skrulls i can see people being like “ok i’m done” and bailing on the mcu,2022-11-16 06:11:26
in the comics she works for doom secretly,2022-11-14 06:59:17
possibly or shes legitimately just that shady and dickish curious what her deal will be in thunderbolts and if shell pop up more before then,2022-11-13 22:03:59
kimoyo beads baby,2022-11-27 14:00:16
"the film could have shown this a bit better but essentially

we see with the fight between okoyo and atuma on the bridge that the talokan have regenerative capabilities what would have been a lethal blow is healed on the spot ballistic style impacts don’t appear to be lethal unless accompanied by a sonic force hence the use of sonic waves in the ocean and why the point blank sonic rounds proved to be lethal it’s also in part why for the most part it appeared the talokan had the wakandan’s dead tk rights aboard the raft

this innate physiological advantage comes as a part of the blue vibranium plant injected by their ancestors and said plant was used as a component within the synthetic heart shaped herb so i’d presume some of that carried over 

although thinking about bp1 wasnt t’challa able to heal life threatening wounds by injecting the herb while in the care of the j’bari",2022-11-17 17:47:01
almost felt like he knew she wouldnt join him in the attack and just wanted to be dramatic af lol,2022-11-23 19:12:34
the son was a nice addition but naming the son exactly like the decesed father seems very out of place for me i mean i understand that they want to honor him but i would have wanted the son to be namen tchaka son of black panther tchalla,2022-11-12 17:34:44
i knew there was a kid the second they were cagey about where she had been,2022-11-11 23:16:10
"ok when the kid was talking about his name i was 90 sure i heard him say “my asian name is” and i was like huh

he said “agent name” right",2022-11-11 06:44:26

phase 15 is going to be tchalla jr claiming his rightful thrown from mbaku jr,2022-11-12 04:38:24
what marriage,2022-11-11 08:15:25
"so the way i think it plays out is mbaku is on the throne shuri is black panther and prince tchalla is still out there

if my math is right prince tchalla is about 68 years old  presumably nakia got pregnant with him after the events of bp iw happens king tchalla gets snapped comes back five years later and then dies shortly thereafter the film jumps ahead a year after the opening credits and here we are

so unless they do another time jump were at least a decade out from prince tchalla challenging for the throne or being bp more likely longer as theyd probably want him to be in his mid20s before he assumes the mantle",2022-11-13 00:42:28
i want to see tchalla jr challenging mbaku,2022-11-11 05:18:27
jr will play the kendall roy type figure always trying to impress his aunt but l,2022-11-12 09:53:19
the mcu is actually pretty bad when it comes to scale regarding supposedly “advanced” civilizations i mean wakanda and their vibranium spears or war rhinos are an obvious one but like thanos’ army was comprised largely of animals that ran straight at the enemy and died to gunfire not exactly what you’d think a spacefaring warlord who had conquered countless planets would be using,2022-11-11 09:13:04
the worst example of this for me was wanda attacking the temple in dr strange 2 you could switch the wizards with regular soldiers scifi soldiers with lasers or even prehistoric soldiers w bows and arrows and the scene would play out exactly the same generic projectiles going into the air shot generically edited generically at least we got the cool music note battle at the end,2022-11-12 02:47:44
"to be fair those beads are like the ultimate multitool they can heal people work as communication take readings etc  


but yeah i guess they figured fighting with sticks is just cooler on screen than fighting with guns",2022-11-11 21:09:24
it would be nice if they ever showed scientists and inventors besides the princess it seems kind of silly that she is the only brainiac in wakanda until they find another teenage girl,2022-11-13 05:40:35
the problem is that disney hates guns there has been a very notable trend in the mcu proper for characters to use melee weapons or generic energy blasts instead of actual guns over time its just better optics for the family friendly branding they want to maintain for the setting,2022-11-14 09:07:36
shhhhhhhhh,2022-11-11 08:37:58
wakanda has spears with sonicenergy blasts and energy shields that can be triggered from their clothing i think the issue is that they don’t consistently show off this technology,2022-11-12 23:42:13
theyre the most technologically advanced but since theyve been hiding from the rest of the world forever makes sense that their military strategies would be a little lacking theyve never been at war with anyone before,2022-11-12 02:46:31
"the wakandans havent fought anyone for probably 3000 years or more not sure how old wakanda postmeteorite is supposed to be theyve never had to worry about strategy or tactics or anything else 

i also didnt get the sense the talokanatlanteans or whatever were even technologically advanced except for their water grenades they just were stronger physically and could brainwash people",2022-11-12 08:28:10
stand alone movies are always like this though they nerf their power significantly for plot,2022-11-12 03:11:31
and the spears can shoot lasers we were told that in black panther and shown it in infinity war but then glorious melee combat wins out at the end,2022-11-14 01:00:03
lol ours had some people having a conversation during the queens funeral when the movie was quiet very distracting,2022-11-11 08:19:40
the guy sitting next to me was on discord on his phone the entire time and he and his wifegf whispered a bunch during the last hour or so i hate people,2022-11-11 08:11:54
some guy decided that final chadwick scene was a great time to shake his chocolate pack to try get the last of the chocolates out the rest of the cinema was quiet it was so annoying lol,2022-11-12 16:08:36

the coffin being way too light really was obvious human bodies are heavy,2022-11-13 05:14:17
"i thought the ship beaming up the coffin clashed with the overall aesthetic of the funeral 

agreed i was tearing up for this scene and then i quietly went wot as his coffin went up 

i think it wouldnt have looked as goofy if they had loaded the coffin into the docked ship and then the ship took off",2022-11-14 04:49:59

actually its going to be super easybarely an inconvenience",2022-11-13 21:48:42

theres an article saying the us was supposed to be more involved in the wakandan talokan final battle but they rolled that back,2022-11-13 06:23:03
"it was kind of the catalyst to the wakanda x talocan conflict if the cia isnt searching for vibranium then namor has no reason to reveal himself it also connects when val says they fully intend to destabilize wakanda to get their resources and tech and namor says the world is going to attack wakanda and theyll be their only ally

its a setup for the future",2022-11-14 16:43:39
top 10 anime one liners for sure,2022-11-15 22:34:59
"this movie and drstrange mom emphasis too much on introducing new element that they just makes the movie tasteless this one at least not that much unlike drstrange focusing more into american chavez and scarlet witch more than strange himself 

i really dislike that lady  alot and the more they show her the more i dispise her this  of a character just wanna watch the world burn unlike thanos who thought his genocide is noble or fury who thought he is the greatest spybkeeping the world at wrap against unnatural elements or ",2022-11-15 10:52:32
" despite a solid performance from tenoch huerta namor and the talokan still feel a bit underdeveloped and his 180 from wanting to be secret to going to war with the surface feels a bit out of left field

this actually made sense to me once  hit the fan he gave them a chance to ally and work with him he wasnt fully unreasonable but wakanda just had like zero diplomacy skills as a whole i feel like tchalla could have absolutely negotiated for riri but shuri and ramonda were way over their heads once they straight up snuck in and killed that attendant in talokan i think thats what made  hit the fan and realize nah surface people aint it  em all 

they just never expected to be attacked like that in their own homes or really imagined it in the previous 400ish years 

i do wish they delved deeper into their whole deal talokan was by far the most interesting part of the film i was all in on everything with them and would love to explore more straight up did not give one  about wakanda by the end namor and the talokan were just much more compelling and interesting to me",2022-11-12 20:24:01
this everything you said is in point,2022-11-13 06:19:19
you mean jeremy jhans yeah,2022-11-11 20:29:11
more like sleeping,2022-11-11 16:19:51
you might want to check yourself for a pulse,2022-11-12 20:16:13
yeah those plot lines felt like they were forced in to set up future mcu stuff,2022-11-12 20:20:12
why were they trying so hard to protect iron heart wakanda has killed so many people to now stop at 1 smart kid felt really forced to risk their nation for just 1 irrelevant person,2022-11-12 21:19:50
the extra cia scenes yes but ironheart was needed to be the reason for conflict between namor and wakanda,2022-11-11 20:49:08
the scene in wakanda where mbaku and the boys were chatting before namor attacked really stood out as a cheaplooking green screen,2022-11-12 22:56:55
the scene of ross and val in rosss home was so obviously filmed separately and pieced together theres no two shot of them in the room together just alternate closeups of them each only speaking their lines dont know why but that really stuck out to me,2022-11-11 16:08:11
this movie actually had a different cinematographer than the first black panther movie maybe that’s why the cinematography felt different to you,2022-11-11 16:15:30
"same i was confused by some of the choices they made

",2022-11-13 05:13:21
"i mean this with utmost sincerity i dont think this is a mcu movie i can rewatch ive gone back and rewatched most mcu movies on disney at least more than twice because i thought some were enjoyable and great or i havent watched it in a long time after seeing it in theaters 

theres a handful of mcu movies that i havent rewatched iron man 2 black widow thor the dark world and avengers age of ultron and now black panther wakanda forever joins that list but for a different reason

its not a bad movie im aware the movie ended on a hopeful note about the legacy and future of black panther moving forward in the mcu to me i think the parallel of addressing both tchalla and chadwicks passing was a tremendously emotional experience in the initial viewing and its not something that warrants a rewatch",2022-11-14 05:34:32
i thought this one has the right amount of serious tone and little comedic moments that created a nice balance it wasn’t 75 hijinks like most of the mcu now,2022-11-13 05:27:32
they had some ill fitting jokes i think to fill the superhero movie vibe but they just cheapened the movie like the riri actress is excellent but some of her jokes were lame and the scene where okoye and shuri argue in front of riri about okoyes makeup felt ooc to me okoye as general on a mission joking in front of a target didnt seem in character even if the target was a black kid,2022-11-13 06:14:41
"i think your first point is a plot hole unless i also missed something

but for your second point he wasn’t waging war immediately after the 2 guards got killed by nakia but because wakanda took back ririironheart “the scientist” with them and that was all he really wanted remember he still wanted to  her as she created the tech for the vibranium detector 

so ultimately he started the war and attacked wakanda in order an attempt to  riri queen ramonda just happened to be there protecting riri and died because of that too 

then we have more war again cause of the bait with the fake vibranium detector and the weirdass wakandan warship",2022-11-11 21:33:28
"he has no idea what they are going to do with her for insurance he sends his people if their objective was to hand her over they could have done it right there either way by having his people go he is able to prevent possible backstabbing

i think he’s suppose to be a little unhinged or that’s how i interpreted it lol,2022-11-12 15:27:55
also both these nations are being portrayed as morally superior to the west,2022-11-13 07:55:45

yessssssss i wanna see a movie where he gets that throne just a whole movie dedicated to the talokan people and the climax is him killing that shark,2022-11-20 04:38:39
ludwig does it again,2022-11-11 11:06:05
namors theme spoke like an ancient creature amazing,2022-11-11 12:23:23
expect no less from another collab between coogler and ludwig,2022-11-11 20:27:02
the score was good but every time they used pop music or took me out of the movie,2022-11-11 12:23:35
i agree and those i assume throat singing vocals were just stunning,2022-11-12 00:12:26
i know this sub dont like her but i thought she did great angela basset and namor killed it though,2022-11-11 03:11:43
i would have liked to see nakia be the new black panther until the end when you see why she left,2022-11-11 03:18:54
i rooted for king m’baku as well,2022-11-11 06:20:25
i thought shuri was fine but i was totally rooting for namor the entire time,2022-11-11 08:53:23
thats odd i thought basset and wright were obvious standouts that kind of carried the movie to an extent,2022-11-11 16:02:05
i legit spent the entire last third of the movie thinking how much better the film would’ve been with chadwick namor was just way too good of an antagonist,2022-11-11 04:15:49
i dont know about you guys but my theatre was full on cheering for her,2022-11-11 14:25:34
i liked shuri in the movie but im not sold on her being black panther there were points in this movie where having tchalla around wouldve made it a lot better the final fight being the perfect example hopefully marvel decides to recast tchalla i think the best scenario would be to have a variant tchalla join the mcu,2022-11-12 06:29:28
 she is much better here than the first movie,2022-11-11 17:30:19
"the entire wakanda side was so odd 

they just came off so unlikeable

you would think they would have more understanding to the situation of namors people

but nope they side with someone they never met over another group trying to protects its people from the outside world",2022-11-11 03:11:13
"is my mothers death not worth eternal war
 eternal war ehm no",2022-11-11 09:48:53
at the very end i was so worried they would  such a cool character and im glad they didnt,2022-11-11 23:53:57
yep the lack of charisma and her not being an actor on the same level as a lot of the cast really hurt this movie,2022-11-11 19:25:09
"its because shes good at everything and has no flaws or shortcomings


thats a really hard character to pull off  makes it hard for the audience to pull for you",2022-11-11 04:03:53
"true 

namor had way more charisma the queen had way more even elaine from seinfeld",2022-11-11 04:00:01
tbh i wasn’t expecting much from the anti vaxxer,2022-11-11 18:32:35
she was and she was dragging the movie down a lot but by the end of it i liked the character arc she had to go through the world did throw a lot at her,2022-11-12 19:57:34
"i couldnt connect with her character in the movie it didnt help that i didnt see the movie in great conditions but between her acting and her reallife positions i couldnt really get into the movie

its like she was acting well but i couldnt see it",2022-11-13 05:47:17
agreed from a character stand point her instantly being a warrior also made no sense  don’t even get me started on being impaled with zero repercussions  gotta say this was another miss for phase 4,2022-11-14 06:20:06
haha i agree but at the same time i kinda get it as well shes someone that is going through stages of grief the movie isnt supposed to be about her rising to the position of being the next ruler though it is implied it really just fell on her lap when her mom died from the attack but that helmet big though,2022-11-14 16:32:43
gotta disagree don’t really like her personal decisions but she definitely did extremely well in this not perfect but it’s a big role to fill and she did pretty  good,2022-11-11 06:58:09
cant blame them too much boseman would have continued to be black panther if he didnt tragically pass during all this they did what they could with what they had and honestly i enjoyed watching shuri become the black panther i felt it was earned enough and by the end of it i was on board,2022-11-11 10:25:33
nag  im not gonna trust this sub opinion on her since you have been trashing her for years at this point  bias af,2022-11-11 09:16:19
shuri arc was amazing loved how it was like her brothers,2022-11-11 10:46:55
"namors actor had so much more charisma than shuris that it wasnt even close even the small cameo from mbj had more gravitas than her character the entire time i could not get over how snobby and bratty she was just a very unlikable character overall i had a lot of doubts leading in but this just confirmed to me that she cannot carry this franchise as the lead 

give me like 23 namor  talokan films before we get another bp if wright is going to be the lead moving forward they were easily the best part of this very mediocre film",2022-11-12 20:26:33
she was fine it was just noticeable with tenoch and angela acting circles around her,2022-11-11 23:43:42
 wonder why this is upvoted,2022-11-11 04:48:33
tenoch huerta was really great the entire film felt the absence of boseman i kept expecting one of the actors to have the same level of scene presence that boseman had in black panther it just doesn’t happen although the crew did wonderfully considering boseman’s death,2022-11-26 18:43:46
"interesting

i thought this was leaps better than thor 4",2022-11-11 07:45:40
i wonder if that was intentional with armor wars around the corner,2022-11-11 18:19:16
this cgi is what you get when you overwork and underpay the people who make it despite making hundreds of millions in profit on every movie it’s so bad,2022-11-15 19:58:38
gave me mega man vibes lol,2022-11-15 22:05:25
did you watch the falcon and the winter soldier ,2022-11-16 01:50:52
you must have forgotten what happens in the first movie nakia took some of the heart shaped herb before it was burned and gave it to t’challa the elders opposed to burning the herb but he threatened to  then all,2022-11-17 15:38:00
mcu as a whole is going to miss the gravity and gravitas that boseman brought to it,2022-11-12 22:10:38
they should have had killmonger down in atlantis thinking he had a kindred soul in his rescuer namor only to have him have a change of heart during the attack on wakanda this would have brought back a character with a little fire in them and cut through a lot of the mopeyness of the movie,2022-11-11 23:18:35
well i mean…the main character did die,2022-11-12 03:13:41
maybe import construction workers like qatar did for the world cup stadiums,2022-11-18 05:05:12
i dont even know what they do there all day with all that tech its not like they are involved in the international community other than textiles and live produce,2022-11-19 11:44:10
it was worse than i expected it to be by quite a lot i expected bad but youre right it was weirdly bad no better word to describe it,2022-11-23 16:58:38
its ryan cooglers first legitimately bad movie,2022-11-26 07:02:50
i agree story feels really backandforth it doesnt have a good flow like there are certain places they have to visit and characters they have to introduce but the story is just not there,2022-11-11 23:11:52
yes,2022-11-20 16:25:49
did you fall asleep during the final fight,2022-11-16 06:20:23
i thought that whole part was so weirdly staged like the coffin is laying down but then gets turned upright when being beamed up and stays that way when it enters the hovercraft so when the craft flies off i couldnt help but picture the coffin violently slamming face first to the floor,2022-11-15 15:22:43
probably sending it to some sort of ancestral burial ground or tomb,2022-11-15 23:19:53
i mean the capital is floodeddestroyed and the queen died that’s pretty drastic i’d say definite consequences there,2022-11-20 09:16:21
"shuri imo could potentially be great she inherits all the burdens given from the untimely death of her brother and mother she is set upon a path of destruction filled with vengeance anger and wrath the world pressuring her country to release precious resources to them risking war and the lives of her people she is inexperienced and still very young with very little in the way of mentorship and what feels like abandomentment of her own kilmonger appears to her in vision instead of her ancestors the potential is definetly there

i did hope for a continuation of the story of vengeance and destruction etc without the sappy i now see the error of my ways etc",2022-11-21 00:38:12
"there was no real character growth

how sway",2022-11-22 18:54:45
challenge day is for the throne not for the bp mantle  tchalla was bp while his dad was king,2022-11-12 01:51:34
" wanted more of mbaku and was hoping he would become bp but that probably wouldnt make much sense

i prefer the idea of mbaku being black panther than shuri honestly he just genuinely feels like he cares more about the country and its people than shuri does

mbaku dove down into the river without a second thought to save some of his people from drowning shuri basically went for a joy ride in a vague effort to help that felt more like her just wanting to do something funwildrebellious than actually useful 

plus shuri feels way more of an iron man styled hero with gadgets and all sorts of tech things rather than an up close and personal black panthercaptain america style hero",2022-11-12 02:18:49
everyone and their neighbors cat showed up for tony lol,2022-11-12 03:08:56
thays the biggest problem with mcu atleast get the body doubles to show up or show their backside or something,2022-11-12 04:12:31
i’m thinking with how much the wakandans adhere to keeping tradition and culture at their core they would have a countryonly ceremony for t’challa the rest of the world might’ve done something all over to mourn his loss and the avengers maybe we’re part of  some public ceremony for t’challa,2022-11-13 05:22:23
yeah i figured that at least bucky would have gone,2022-11-12 09:31:11
"i get that getting all thr big names would be a huge ask

but would have made sense if the likes of bucky sam  rhodey were there could have even filmed something during ftws",2022-11-15 22:33:30
" scenes just began and ended with no real flow between them linking them 

this is what really frustrated me when you expect the story to zig but instead it zags i was off balance for a lot of the movie just because i was like wait were doing this now i thought we were doing that",2022-11-11 20:16:19
too much like a checklist of plot points so they can shut up future series and characters not enough time to really flesh out the stuff they needed to in the film itself,2022-11-11 03:38:38
i actually like that there’s big stakes in a movie about processing grief they foil each other in a way also namor and his people mirror some of the same themes of colonization in the first film not having that would have been a missed opportunity to connect the films thematically,2022-11-12 16:30:29
like going on a few dates with someone where all the values line up and youre both good people but just total lack of charisma and excitment needed more fun less expositionplot dumping,2022-11-11 04:13:20
youve summed up my thoughts almost perfectly,2022-11-11 06:16:14
i’m pretty much entirely with you here thanks for summing it up so i don’t have to lol,2022-11-11 08:03:16
bro fun wise black adam is better movie,2022-11-12 09:45:31
" i felt like i wasnt allowed to have any fun the guy died and it was tragic but i dunno maybe after an hour we get to have some fun right

i dont want this to sound cold its just my honest opinion but i didnt really feel any which way about his passing like yeah i have condolences for his family and friends and etc death sucks i know but like im just a guy he was in like 4 movies ive seen and thats it again im not trying to be mean but disney and other marvel fans keep pushing his death on the public but i just wanted to watch a movie you know 

my experience for the first hour was like yeah he died thanks for reminding me he passed away now im sad because you reminded me he died again just my opinion and i dont want to come across as heartless it just felt hamfisted to me to me its not like he was some iconic character of all time or something this movie would have been much better if they just recasted the role like his own family wanted",2022-11-11 05:27:05
i kind of feel the same way…i expected to have a cathartic cry about chadwick and while i shed some tears at the end i still kind of feel empty about it i recognize this movie had to do a lot of heavy lifting though,2022-11-11 05:19:17
that character will show up eventually no need to shove that character here honestly this movie was filled to the brim,2022-11-11 05:18:48
kinda crazy leakers spent like 6 months jerking that scene off just to be like oh lol no its not there im still right subscribe to my patreon,2022-11-11 06:24:18

i didn’t hate it at all but i’m just sitting here sort of disappointed with namor not the actors fault it just felt like so much of the reasoning we were supposed to care about him came from forced exposition i never really believed his motivations… there seemed to be more efficienteasier solutions to his problems 

also the final battle didn’t really feel that grand it was supposed to be the two most technically advanced armies fighting each other and ended up mimicking a pirate being pushed off a plank 

just kinda hard to go from killmonger who made compelling ethical arguments to justify his hatred for wakanda to go to this",2022-11-11 03:40:03
the imax 3d during the night scenes are some of the worst projection ive ever seen it was like the long night episode of game of thrones the black levels were completely  it was genuinely awful the daytime scenes looked great thankfully,2022-11-11 04:31:47
agreed  total disappointment,2022-11-14 06:32:35
very hard disagree yo i thought that was a top tier mcu movie i agree with you that some things were too drawn out like the cia subplot couldve been dropped and some of the design choices were questionable midnight angels but despite that i wouldnt walk away from the movie thinking its a dissapointment i think it was a bit messy at times because it shows a country lost without its leader i think it was a great tribute to chadwick and really showed the path forward with shuri i would give it a solid 75810,2022-11-13 03:52:46
get out of here with the zack snyder jl  that movie  and it seemed like it took a week to finish,2022-11-11 04:10:41
we watch the same movie movie  was expertly done and one of the mcu best films,2022-11-11 03:57:32
yup they shouldn’t have introduced a whole new world with atlantis when wakanda is still not really explored,2022-11-15 05:43:51
riri along w the cia plot felt so unnecessary,2022-11-11 19:19:14
she worked way better as an object for the plot than as a character,2022-11-11 15:52:57
a lot of it was wasted time though all the ross stuff amounted to nothing but setting up thunderbolts which is the last thing this movie should be doing,2022-11-11 06:39:31
i still think they were underdeveloped tbh there was so much going on that we didn’t get very much time with nakia or m’baku and i don’t feel like i know riri particularly well yet either,2022-11-11 08:05:51
it amounted to a lot of nothing we spent more time seeing characters stare off into the distance,2022-11-12 04:19:11
agreed having two new different main characters who demonstrated depth and complexity was refreshing especially after several noncharacters shang chi captain marvel and the endless parade of male scientists iron man spiderman hulk antman strange etc,2022-11-11 05:07:24
what are ya gonna do about arizona ,2022-11-13 01:27:01
he was going to flood all the land,2022-11-13 05:14:56
i think his attack on the surface world would be covert since the world doesn’t know his people exist the people on the surface wouldn’t know who was attacking them the talokanil are near superhuman and are able to induce a trance with their siren song and direct people to  themselves he also mentions that he has more warriors than wakanda has blades of grass so we likely haven’t seen the full force of his people i don’t think they showcased all their weaponry and technology against the wakandans because they didn’t really need to and as someone mentioned here i think they’re capable of flooding the land to a degree not shown in the film,2022-11-13 11:12:23
they even had her pick the armor with gold accents just as killmonger did,2022-11-11 03:16:47
plus she never said its panthering time,2022-11-11 03:41:30
killing namor would be a horrific idea,2022-11-11 04:17:01
if shuri killed him the ending would be very similar to loki tv shows it wouldnt be original at all,2022-11-11 03:34:00
why did you have to make this a dc vs marvel thing these two movies are so different,2022-11-11 04:25:40
i dont think that type of direction would give the movie that boost because shuri cant carry as the main character to have that much depth thats asking too much of an actress to be equal or better than chadwick which she simply cant fill the shoes marvel just went the simple route,2022-11-11 04:00:53
i’m so  happy redditors don’t write movies  this would’ve been absolutely horrendous,2022-11-11 09:33:01
"i think that’s still possible she was right on the line between good and bad but with this movie addressing chadwick’s death would’ve been to dark to go that way they made it clear that her time as panther is finite atleast that’s how i interpreted that mid credit scene

she made the right choice sparing namor this time maybe in the future she won’t atleast with a villain that will be more expendable next time",2022-11-11 19:16:58
bro action wise black adam  black panther,2022-11-12 09:41:42
i like this but i’m tired of seeing antagonists just end up dead rather than keeping them alive to where they have to live with the consequences of their actions eternals also i like namor and can’t wait to see his solo movie,2022-11-12 16:17:35
i guess tony isn’t the unparalleled genius we were led to believe everyone’s cranking out powered suits like they’re hotcakes,2022-11-11 06:10:32
it’s bad,2022-11-11 05:32:31
that scene on the beach was so cringe and totally pollutes the wakanda forever chant lol,2022-11-12 01:03:55
tbf they did say multiple times riri was an absolute  genius making tech that was surprising freaking wakanda,2022-11-11 06:44:10
a ‘7273 plymouth ‘cuda,2022-11-11 10:16:46
same,2022-11-15 22:18:57
probably better than shuri and her bs,2022-11-12 09:40:08
i think more to do with aquaman than avatar,2022-11-11 08:56:03
must be cause the entire time i was just thinking of how much better avatar 2s underwater effects and design look and i didnt even like avatar back then,2022-11-11 12:36:10
"completely agree the problem with this scene and the final fight is that we know shuri is filled with hate and vengeance so we can’t root for her or wakanda to win i think coogler  it up trying to balance both sides as “they have their reasons” that it kinda  up who the heroes were i’m fine with both sides badgood stories but then you can’t have a big blockbuster climax fight it just didn’t gel well imo

the same thing works much better in civil war because tchalla is a spectator to it and chooses to not pursue his revenge because of it and cap vs tony is done with a lot of tragedy and not shot to be this awesome showdown which we had already gotten by then in that airport scene",2022-11-11 22:15:19
my friend and i said the same thing im glad its not just me it was dead silent in the theater during a moment which shouldve been massive,2022-11-11 14:05:16
the way i understood it was the talokan wanted to stay hidden but now that technology is out there to help nations find vibranium in the oceans they knew their time was running out namor makes the decision that because of this their only choice is to make the first move and attack the only true threat they see is wakanda given their similarities in technology and power so they offer wakanda the chance to work as allies instead,2022-11-11 04:35:57
the beginning hinted they could treat wakanda and by extension the taloken as terrorist statesweapons of mass destruction if shield would nuke nyc to stop the chitauri they wouldnt hesitate to nuke an ocean to mine resources the taloken clearly care for all underwater life,2022-11-11 04:33:50
now that people found vibranium they knew they would be discoveredattacked by man so namor decided to strike first,2022-11-11 04:45:04
 they didnt want people disturbing them just like wakanda didnt want people to know about who they really were in the first movie namor asked them to bring him riri because blue people walking around with oxygen masks kind of stand out he could have flew to mit and dealt with her himself but that would bring attention to him also pandora is a fictional planet with a fictional ecosystem where as our oceans are dark so they did a fantastic job with the underwater,2022-11-11 05:45:22
the capital city of taloken was made of vibranium a vibranium detector would lead there eventually,2022-11-11 14:23:00
vibranium is basically oil and the taloken basically trying to hoard it thats not the analogy the movie is trying to give but that is what is happening,2022-11-13 08:06:54
because the goal is to protect themselves which considering they are direct descendant and some with clear memories of a  genocide,2022-11-11 23:59:59
because they’ve been a secret up until now and the world would go after them to get vibranium,2022-11-12 16:22:10
that whole character was incredibly ridiculous zero believability just badly written,2022-11-15 04:32:21
i loled at her using an oxyacetylene torch and angle grinder on some steel plate like she’s in a metal fabricator shop then she has a full blown perfect iron man suit like what,2022-11-17 04:44:24
"she was building the ironheart suit that included wakanda tech for the final battle

she wasnt allowed to take it home  apparently the disney version will be quite different",2022-11-14 21:33:13
can’t believe they’re making an entire show on her character because she was by far the worst part of the movie,2022-12-04 16:07:15
i dont dislike the character i jsut think she wasnt given the time she deserved she was more of a macguffin for most the movie rather than a full character who got to be fleshed out,2022-12-06 10:18:23
keep going back and forth on whether it was the character or the actress,2022-12-04 20:35:10
i felt like they tried to have her step into shuris shoes as the wisecracking stem genius it didnt really work for me,2022-12-17 10:37:18
the movie itself didnt even feel excited about it imo it felt forced like all these interesting things happened and now we have to show bp because thats the franchise like jedi popping up by obligation in some star wars media,2022-11-12 02:52:33
"i mean my theatre had some screams but im not surprised

if its not chadwick dropping down why would anyone be excited it just reinforces in your head once again that hes gone",2022-11-11 16:45:12
opposite did my theater my theatre cheered when shuri first appeared in the suit,2022-11-11 19:18:05
exact same feelings here,2022-11-11 08:04:38
yup,2022-11-11 21:33:32
it connects to thunderbolts since val is over the team,2022-11-12 13:16:31
"that’s why i like avoiding opening weekends especially with marvel movies luckily my theater was chill but marvel movies almost always attract these types of people whether it be mega fans who are way too into it or people who don’t go to movie theaters often and don’t know common sense


edit i’ll add that marvel definitely knows their audience and tailors some of these “reaction” moments into their movies but people will always find a way to be weird in these showings",2022-11-11 07:17:43
"i am so glad i got to go as a prescreening for work for this very reason 

i like seeing people excited but there’s a line",2022-11-11 06:25:48
"because the plot needed it 

hard shrug",2022-11-11 03:29:03
even if all the ice etc melted i think at least one third of the worlds landmass would remain above sea level theres just some parts that are too high to flood ill take my real world science and go away now,2022-11-11 03:36:05
the ones who got shot did get up i think in the wide shot before namor threw the helicopter you can see there’s no bodies in the deck the shooting stopped them but they just got up not sure if they’re immortal or just have a really strong healing factor like wolverine,2022-11-11 04:14:17
"first off it’s not a documentary it’s a superhero flick

second no only the main guy is immortal the rest have black panther level of healing and abilities due to them all consuming flowers grown in virbiam

not sure he is dead 

flooding the world was his plan but he understood the point of getting an ally nation help

shuri was black panther because of bloodlines and she is the heir to the throne the ruler gets the power of black panther  

going forward it seems that mbaku might be king of wakanda and shuri is the panther 

career scientist drank the black panther juice which transports you to the your elders it’s believe you inherited their skills as well",2022-11-11 04:50:30
i dont know what happened usually the franchise gets it correct with the costume design at least the film was selfaware about the midnight angels,2022-11-11 21:21:28
it happened in most theaters according to comments i think it was just a poorly shot movie and probably also intentionally dark because that helps mask  cgi,2022-11-14 20:36:55
she calculated euler’s formula so they’re all fine,2022-11-27 19:31:24
i couldnt stand that rude arrogant brat from the get go,2022-11-30 21:48:30
completely agree you could tell the actress just didn’t want to be there they should have replaced her or not done the movie altogether,2022-12-04 01:29:43
first thing i thought when i saw it haha,2023-02-01 20:39:28
looked like baymax on weight watchers,2023-02-04 15:20:24
this is generally my gripe with marvel movies as well theyre selfcontained when they need to be and allinclusive when its convenient it ruins the immersion for me and i agree with the points you brought up,2022-11-16 06:56:55
tbh its a problem with the universe becoming so big at this point,2022-11-16 10:39:10
having the world blame wakanda for riris death since namor’s people is a secret doesn’t seem all that diplomatic tbh,2022-11-12 16:32:54
one of the things i liked about this movie is all the characters’ motivations seemed real  i understand why they did what they did,2022-11-12 04:52:05
yep and i like the how the design of the final suit sets itself apart enough to be her own thing,2022-11-11 03:10:56
"she wasn’t supposed to be strong  

she’s reeling from being a young kid and losing her whole family lol 

how would you act at 1819 if you lost your whole family and suddenly had to become your country’s protector like let’s think about this",2022-11-12 01:37:37
just you i love how it was good cus of killmonger,2022-11-11 06:21:14
spiderman and shangchi are still better imo,2022-11-11 10:05:13
"wow this link to aquaman movie really seals the deal on how pathetic third act is i never though ill put aquaman as an example to anything but its final battle really looked enormous both in scale and technology

also i totally agree that shuri shouldnt have won in handtohand battle she didnt use her wits in the battle at all for  sake just give a million dollars to araki and  come up with tons of twists for your final battle dont leave it to choreographers it should be writers job winning in the fight should have meaning",2022-11-12 14:57:12
they couldn’t have used a double,2022-11-11 15:27:00
she had an accident what happened,2022-11-11 13:37:20
she used as a plot device as much as america is in ds 2 but america was ultizied better and had a more unique powerset,2022-11-12 20:55:12
couldnt agree more i felt the same way most of bp2 did not work for me,2022-11-12 16:14:34
needed more winston duke for sure,2022-11-11 03:44:40
definetly needed a bit more okoye,2022-11-13 17:54:25
its pretty much implied that its cancer just like real life,2022-11-11 11:08:41
britney spears gave him a lap dance,2022-11-11 09:58:34
this is a very good question,2022-11-12 16:42:48
yeah that scene was bizarre the music and vibe is clearly meant to say “look at this vibrant amazing underwater culture” but it looked  miserable just floating around with nothing to do hahaha,2022-11-13 19:31:20
"that is just comic book logic if you punish the one ultimately responsible it stops all others kind of like  the head vampire to turn the others back 

the protection of his people was a way better motivation",2022-11-13 22:57:22
he wanted to go to war it wasnt really about her he explained it,2022-11-14 05:57:41
thank you i thought it was just me mishearing it xd,2022-11-15 18:02:18
i swear she said byte instead of bit as well,2022-11-22 05:31:04
i agree about having other heroes in the show i would have liked to see some avengers or other marvel characters show up,2023-01-05 06:48:35
i walked out before the final fight but if what youre saying is true then i made the right call,2022-12-12 05:31:37
"yeah it’s like they setup that whole first part for
nothing and just focused on the water people",2023-02-02 12:50:42
bodies would drop to the ground “dead” and then disappear in the next shot,2023-02-06 06:44:24
it’s pretty far up there as the worst mcu movie,2022-11-11 05:29:37
"okoye would have been the ultimate beast as black panther shuri might still be black panther for the upcoming avengers films nevertheless the next black panther film will probably have the title pass towards the son

the action sucks because the fx were rushed and the editing was choppy the chase scene for example is almost impossible to visualize with how dark the cinematography was 

i agree on riri the character was written to be charismatic and witty yet dominique thorne came off as wooden and lacking in comic timing someone like marsai martin or a younger keke palmer might have made the difference",2022-11-12 09:05:45
" the suit looked like  too…just too clean…it had like zero texture to it and just just looked terrible

i agree with respect to the suit she created in wakanda but the suit she had in her garage was great

also putting the female warriors of wakanda forgot their names in suits of armor defeats what makes them cool to me

i mean considering how technologically advanced the wakandans are it makes sense to give them advanced tech when fighting an enemy that has already decisively beaten their top soldiers namors people basically all had superhuman strength and greatly outnumbered the wakandans",2022-11-12 15:12:51
the basketball had to be an intentional reference to the ball court at chichen itza i liked it just as much as the pyramid tbh it really makes you feel connected to the past to imagine people just hanging out watching sports,2022-11-11 21:36:30
i know its comic book logic and all but the concept of living in an all water environment at anything other than a base animalistic level is just so hard to portray like theres an open air market but whats stopping all their groceries from just floating away seems like a huge pain in the  to even do basic things like going to the bathroom wheres the plumbing how does that work,2022-11-12 03:00:42
"riri was pretty much wasted fodder here

i was thinking maybe her and shuri would be bouncing ideas discussing matters like tony and bruce did in avengers 

but nah she just goes to her own corner and creates megaman armour all on her own lol did she have any challenges making this all she made was a crude model in the states now she has to make her own high kevek ironman suit even tony needed serval tests and models before he got it working 

but riri

super easy barely an inconvenience",2022-11-19 10:13:35
they didnt try making the underwater city talocan look nice at all legit a murky flea market ,2022-11-23 19:21:09
"it felt more like an introduction project than a proper film

ok we have to introduce a new black panther namor and iron heart 

it had more of a feel to set up future things instead of focusing on the plots at hand",2022-11-11 03:27:55
what did you expect this what happens when you make a movie for no reason,2022-11-11 03:45:53
honestly i cant stand that podcast they have the dumbest hot takes,2022-11-12 00:45:53
wierd since okoya was in endgame so was wankandans,2022-11-12 10:21:26
" kukulkan

my enemies call me cukacucukekecucacucon and i have tiny wings on my ankles that somehow allow me to fly",2022-11-14 20:40:50
 i’m playing shadow of the tomb raider right now so it was fun hearing that,2022-11-14 15:31:38
it was the movie not your theater,2022-11-21 05:41:31
yep same here in the uk,2022-11-21 20:02:29
"talokan felt underutilized all we really got was a quick swim through the city if coogler wanted to create a parallel to wakanda then more was needed

i think the point was to leave us wanting more and based on the final scene with namor im sure we will i cant wait to see it",2022-11-22 18:56:15
aquaman did it well imo,2022-11-24 05:38:09
the underwater scenes were too dark says a snyderverse fan and messy the cgi itself was embarrassing,2022-11-23 18:49:45
to add onto your iron man analysis i kind of thought that his suit basically became an anime mech in infinity war with it having stuff like those jet wings you sometimes see on girls in scifi anime and the swordhammer hands he had built in,2023-02-04 17:54:43
bro you need to learn suspension of disbelief the answer to your questions is movie science,2023-02-02 15:52:19
i mean the movie telegraphs that moment pretty hard i cant find myself disappointed when it just seems like way too bold of a move for marvel to wanna take bp1 made it apparent that the wakandans dont want to be like killmonger so for shuri to commit to choosing violence would be pretty shocking,2023-02-19 16:48:54
sanitary pads ,2023-03-25 10:14:05
"it’s been more hit or miss for me 

loki werewolf by night shangchi and spiderman no way home have been the only things i’ve enjoyed not sure how i feel about wakanda forever yet",2022-11-14 13:18:36
yeah i think im done with the mcu the only one i enjoyed was no way home,2022-11-14 19:17:03
a   choice indeed it was a bold movie cotten but it did not pay off,2022-11-14 20:39:17
"i’ll go a bit further and say i don’t think letitia has the acting chops to be a lead a lot of her scenes fell flat to me because of her 

it was especially noticeable when next to angela basset winston duke the actors for namor and okeye who all brought their a game 

there were multiple scenes where the movie wanted me to feel something grief anger but letitia just couldn’t sell it",2022-11-11 19:21:16
same it actually hurt my eyes watching which ive never said or experienced before,2022-11-11 18:05:22
but that would go against all the canon established in the previous movie it has to be someone with royal bloodline buddy,2022-11-11 13:40:06
did you take a  during the car chase scene  she was in her homemade suit the whole time,2022-11-11 23:34:33
and who would you have play him everyone says this but never brings up a name because theres nobody who could,2022-11-11 04:31:24
the kamehameha makes sense when you realize how much latin america loves dragon ball i assume somehow they got it broadcasted underwater as well lol,2022-11-13 00:31:06
" the french launch a secret attack to steal vibranium from the strongest nation on earth with literally just some guys with regular  guns

they looked like special forces type mercs and their intel probably told them it was just a ship full of scientists 

 same thing with the boat the us finds the rarest strongest metal on earth in the ocean and they defend it with just some guys with guns not even a hero

i dont think there are any american heroes like the avengers who would be onboard with helping the government to swipe some vibranium this is something the government is doing covertly 

 whats preventing the us from just making more vibraniumfinders unless they were  enough to make a oneoff

it looks like they only had the 1 from riri and the us didnt know how to reverseengineer it 

 wakanda essentially proves the world right that they shouldnt be the sole holders of vibranium when in the span of one week their princess gets kidnapped and their queen assassinated by water people when they got interrupted in the process of trying to kidnap a us citizen with a team of 2 people

this is true of any hero heroes like iron man dont want to share their tech with the worlds government because they know it will only lead to greater killing and more dangerous wars

 wakanda straight up loses the war like their capital got destroyed their queen assassinated and their army was about to be exterminated before shuri shows up also why wouldnt they use the  fishpeoplekilling guns instead of spears

shrugs",2022-11-23 18:53:02
oh  i got there late and didn’t see that what did he spoil,2022-11-12 03:01:40
yeah that definitely seemed fatal,2022-11-13 05:35:25
for real like how come killmonger died that way but shuri didn’t ,2022-11-13 18:53:39
plot armor you cant  all of them,2022-11-13 05:10:50
his character was fine outside of the absurdity of assuming killing the scientist would somehow cause the detector technology to stop to existing,2022-11-14 18:14:58
thought it was supposed to be the giant shark mouth that his throne sits in but hadouken is way better lol,2022-11-15 22:12:45
i think that it wasnt some ancient reverent salute  rather it was both a newish thing and a popculture reference in universe  the whole kingdom saw the film morbius recently and were imitating when michael morbius made a hadoukenball out of bats,2022-11-16 00:26:50
i cant wait for the meme of namors actor tired of doing that  clam just like that wakanda sometimes meme of chadwick,2022-11-15 23:14:30
"evacuate the city engage all defencesand someone

drain that  pool",2022-11-17 08:52:55
apparently they took that angle specifically because of aquaman otherwise the creative team worried it would be too similar,2022-11-17 17:48:24
this is the inuniverse content i want not cia scenes that stop the plots momentum dead in its tracks,2022-11-23 00:52:40
yup that’s what i thought,2022-12-03 02:20:02
75 seems pretty high for what you listed i think i agree with all you wrote but that would not be a 75 maybe a 5,2023-02-04 06:23:30
wasnt namors hate for the surface world brought on by how the spaniards invaded his land and brought disease i assumed that was just a grudge he held for a long time and was trying to build up enough forces to finally get what he percieved as revenge,2023-02-19 16:51:40
agreed,2023-02-07 16:37:57
its not you the characters gave no reason to connect with them,2023-02-07 16:36:59
my head would explode this movie was flat out bad,2022-11-11 08:22:19
"it wont

top gun maverick  will get the most nominations

a couple of them may go to the batman as well",2022-11-11 05:37:56
what if it gets nominated for best score and make up,2022-11-12 01:57:28
i thought it might before i saw it but now i can’t imagine that happening,2022-11-11 08:14:54
definitely not getting a best picture nomination this time around still had a few categories it can get a nomination for or even win best original song best supporting actress and costume design all have chances i think,2022-11-11 17:59:13
why would you ever think that lol its an mcu movie they dont make oscar worthy movies this is coming from a superhero fanboy,2022-11-11 21:40:00
her plan was to get namor out in the open so she could get him in the ship to depower him they had to go out to the ocean to do that,2022-11-11 14:07:08
agree horrible movie,2022-11-11 04:09:56
"are you joking 

great soundtrack 
great tribute to chadwick

good arc for shuri 
great acting with the queen and death 

good use of villian and build reasoning behind them

good call back to black panther villian 

setup story lines for next two mcu movies",2022-11-11 04:53:29
" i thought this was good but not great

100 my take  id quote your entire post but that line is the most relevant one  i think that there are certain scenes that could have been cut others shouldve been extended but overall it was good  my biggest gripe is that the underwater stuff was underwhelming in terms of cinematography and how awkward it was to watch humans doggie paddle underwater and im still not a fan of shuri as the bp though she apparently isnt going to be queen",2022-11-11 03:20:19
definitely wasnt as tightly made as the first but felt more well put together than thor and dsmom i enjoyed namor as the villain too,2022-11-11 03:07:00
" they were even willing to  her in the street but for some reason once shes captured with shuri even though namor has made up his mind that she has to die and its nonnegotiable they just dont  her so that she can get rescued

shuri said she would go with him if he didnt  riri right there in the street namor agreed because he wanted wakanda to help him  he wanted riri dead but was willing to wait till he could convince shuri it was necessary if he killed her too soon it would kibosh a potential alliance",2022-11-11 03:37:21
i kept hoping that once nakiya was introduced itd be her moving forward now shes just on the sideline as raising the next black panther to take up the mantle for the next 15 years or so,2022-11-12 22:26:42
i too was unfortunately very disappointed but am being downvoted to oblivion i didnt go into this movie wanting to dislike it guys,2022-11-11 05:19:55
as someone who knows neither of those men it was entirely unnoticeable and incredibly subtle,2022-11-11 19:48:58
i swear i saw usman  i knew i wasn’t crazy to ppl who don’t watch ufc it probably wasn’t noticeable at all,2022-11-11 21:01:09
im a ufc fan and didnt even notice lol but if that was at the end of the movie i was pretty checked out at that point,2022-11-12 07:41:51
"my biggest gripe has always been that namor left ramonda with a means of communication days prior

when okoye told her that talokan took her why not set up a meeting with namor before sending nakia in


the war starts bc nakia kills a talokanil other wise namor is just being conversationally dramatic

like i really felt no sympathy for wakanda at the end of this",2022-11-15 00:58:41
they thought wakanda did it but no hard proof the us isnt the major military power like in real life wakanda is if they attack it could start a war which us is out gunned and they are not even sure they did it it makes sense,2022-11-15 03:06:58
because 95 of audiences liked the movie,2022-11-16 13:53:42
people who loved it arent going to flock to reddit and youtube to leave feedback,2022-11-16 20:54:12
wasnt she tracking her precise location through the earrings,2022-11-11 04:46:16
"my eye roll part was when shuri “blended in” as a student at mit she walks through the dorm as no one recognizes her and then riri immediately recognizes her at her door as the popular public figure that she is inuniverse like… no one recognized her except for riri

i thought it was that bit that marvel has done before where shades andor a hat  incognito mode for all the heroes when they showed shuri and okoye spying from afar with shades on while also wearing unique outfits in front of a fancy car but then shuri being able to walk through a crowded dorm building without being recognized confused me",2022-11-11 07:12:15
going through caves is tight,2022-11-11 07:51:09
"wouldnt the hidden underwater society guard the one entrance to their city thats accessible from land

hey shut up so nakia ends up killing two guards so she can help shuri and riri escape

she kills two guards despite an entire action sequence earlier in the movie establishing that the dora milaje use nonlethal weapons

yup

oh ok",2022-11-11 20:24:56
thats a wee bit harsh,2022-11-11 14:06:04
"no  way there were things weighing this movie down like the unneeded thunderbolts setup but eternals was easily the worst film of the phase by the end of eternals i did not care about their characters and couldnt even name any of them besides ikaris aka the one who died  i was more interested in the side character black knight than them

i mean bp automatically wins points just for not having an unnecessary  scene in a marvel movie",2022-11-11 06:45:49
you really think so eternal was way more messy than this film also less engaging,2022-11-11 22:30:22
how did nothing make sense lol,2022-11-11 04:19:03
awarded dumbest take of 2022,2022-11-11 05:06:17
idk man i saw eternals twice and i gotta say it kinda grew on me the first time in theaters and it   the 2nd time like idk a year later when it was on didney plus i uh was bored most of the time but i realized that i loved the characters individually but  i wish they were in a better movie,2022-11-14 07:31:26
this is easily the best mcu movie since spiderman,2022-11-11 04:00:58
yep and everyone thought this was gonna get an oscar i laugh in the face of marvel fans,2022-11-11 03:46:39
"how much  we talking you know some people love  others not so much lol

jokes aside how would you rate this on a 110 scale",2022-11-11 22:21:20
"i went in not really caring for shuri and i still don’t really feel anything for her character i think that’s the biggest issue for me that going from tchallachadwick to shurileticia is a hard follow up for lots of reasons 

i just wish they had recasted so we could have had more adventures with tchalla and him trying to be a king for his nation while being the black panther this movie had major iron man 2 problems",2022-11-11 22:32:26
agreed,2022-11-12 23:40:55
"lastly and ill give this its own paragraph i hate namor i have always hated namor so the movie is in an interesting place for me in that it adapts him extremely well and is very true to his character in the comicswhich means i hate his guts and not in the fun way you can hate villains but in that way you silently groan whenever they appear on screen

for some reason marvel fans really get angry when you say anything bad about the  version of aquaman",2022-11-11 04:38:35
music was flawless the pop music took me right out of the movie,2022-11-11 04:39:50
i honestly could have watched another hour nice change of pace after thor love and thunder,2022-11-11 05:01:33
yeah the bridge fight showed that they were immortal or super healing or whatever they are and that never entered into things ever again and the one talukan was killed pretty easily,2022-11-11 23:24:33
i got the sense it was probably some world building for thunderbolts but agree i’m not sure if this was the place i guess they figured ross’ connection to the wakandans was their in,2022-11-12 22:03:38
yeah im like  going  calling it a demon language when its what most latinos actually speak right now guess they should speak accented english but english speakers arent the evil colonizers no were focusing on haiti instead of the dozens of options weve had in the english speaking world,2022-11-29 00:58:13
it’s kind of mind boggling that nakia easily kills 2 soldiers with a sonic gun and later on the boat they don’t bother to arm anyone including nakia herself with those,2023-02-05 01:07:02
he died before filming they didnt cut the movie around his death,2022-11-11 19:03:10
"disagree this showed the growth of the new black panther and how going forward they will need each other for the coming war with other nations   

this movie did more to advance the overall story than the last 4 mcu movies combined

on top of that a great tribute to chadwick and a villain they didn’t turn and burn in one movie  also great use of black panther villain to flesh out suri",2022-11-11 04:45:37
they make it darker so that terrible cgi is less visibly terrible,2022-11-11 18:17:42
no kamala kahn was already established as the first in ms marvel earlier this year,2022-11-11 18:29:56
yes,2022-11-11 18:11:01
kamala was introduced first namor is currently the oldest so far,2022-11-13 00:40:32
because namor wouldn’t have accepted that shuri offered to have riri stay in wakanda and he said no to that to,2022-11-13 00:38:55
i think they were only blue when they were above water,2022-11-12 05:14:53
yeah i feel like they needed to explain that but didn’t  they had a whole group get “killed” and then wake back up  meanwhile there were others that died,2022-11-12 05:02:31
"my guess is the vibranium based herb that gave them the ability to breath also gave them much denser and durable skin they are living at the bottom of the ocean after all under immense pressure and cold namor made it a point when he said that shuri had to be in a suit or shed be frozen and crushed instantly

after all weve already seen what a vibranium rich plant can do to a person with the heart shaped herb",2022-11-12 06:11:13
if was a really nice change maybe thats why i liked the movie so much i was sick of the mcu humor,2022-11-13 05:22:32
shang chi was pretty decent imo,2022-11-13 22:05:16
taika needs to take notes,2022-11-13 05:06:33
he just wanted to protect his people the easiest way to do that is to hide but he understands that eventually he will be found he understands what is inevitable but keeping himself hidden can buy him some time to align with wakanda who has a similar history of hiding in isolation to deal with colonizers i think his motives remained consistent throughout the movie though his strategy was fairly nuanced in a way that the movie didnt really bother to explain in great detail,2022-11-13 04:39:26
someone pointed out somewhere that the hand gesture they’re doing is on a ton of aztec art but yes…dbz for sure ha,2022-11-13 06:26:02
cia flying a drone over us soil would go over well in the courts lol,2022-11-14 01:36:53
there’s a podcast with ryan discussing it he had a whole completed draft ready before chadwick passed,2022-11-14 04:06:14
"honestly i thought about this but i assumed that mbaku was partially joking but also just leading interimly until shuri finished mourning

also namor respect is for the bp not shuri as queen specifically as long as shes still bp and everyone follows through with the alliance  just keep his  down there",2022-11-15 01:02:38
smallpox that led his ancestors to drink basically poison and were then doomed to live off land theres baggage in that,2022-11-23 19:18:53
fear mostly  hence hes whole lets attack them so they know not to ever  with us thing he fears his people being discovered and subsequently enslaved,2022-11-19 11:42:27
"also terrible decision making at the end fighting the talokan on the water not really having a plan b seemed like the bp powers gave her brain fog

i think this is intentional from the storytellers she is consumed by anger and a desire for revenge so much so that shes willing to risk her people for the chance to take out namor she basically uses them as bait and is only thinking about getting vengeance mbaku tries to warn her about what comes next after killing namor but she doesnt care

x200b

her superpower is her brain and seeing her in fight scenes felt so awkward 

remember that even in the first film she went to go fight killmonger using her custom battle guantlets she also participated in the battle against thanos in endgame theres no reason to assume she hasnt had combat training given her place in the line of succession and the fact that she designed her own energy gauntlets we see her kicking  of the regular talocan mooks but thats because she has the boost in all her of senses and attributes from the heart shaped herb against a more skilled combatant like namor she still gets her  handed to her and he was severely weakened she only wins by using her brain

 choosing to be diplomatic on the bridge fight which allowed her to learn about namor as well as receive the key to recreating the heart shaped herb
 actually recreating the heart shaped herb
 the weakening effect of the dehydration chamber she trapped him in
 the technology within her suit that was able to stabilize her after being impaled 
 detonating the ship on him to finally bring him down

her greatest superpower was definitely her brain and her heart her biggest weakness was her desire for revenge that blinded her almost to the point of leading her people to destruction",2022-11-22 18:37:24
great review mostly agreed  and yeah the iron heart inclusion  everett ross side story seems to be a common complaint of those who had issues with the films pacing  while valid  i felt the film handled its b plots well but a more stripped down version of the film mightve played better for audiences,2022-11-28 14:59:14
i find it hard to believe that scientists like tony stark hank pym and bruce banner were unable to build a vibranium detector even with all the resources of stark industries and pym industries at their disposal but some random student working with scraps in a dorm room can,2022-11-30 21:47:26
lol aos its it own thing and hardly mcu anymore,2022-11-29 07:51:08
tlj barely qualifies as a movie,2023-02-07 16:41:22
dont watch avatar if this was not enjoyable avatar was way too  long for me and some parts get boring in between not a bad movie but holy fk is it long,2023-01-21 23:35:21
a lot of this movie made no sense i just stopped trying such bad writing,2023-02-02 05:41:07
"from what i understand from bp1 any ranking member in any of the tribes can battle for the throne during the passing of the previous royalty or maybe it happens once a year no idea but the gist is that the panther has always won because none of the other tribes wanted to compete for it or were beaten 

it does appear that m’baku becomes king at the end bc no one challenges him

with t’challa’s son what he says makes sense because that’s what he knows he doesn’t know that the royal mantle has been passed down and he was a prince when he was born also again i have no idea maybe each tribe has a royal lineage and he is still a prince in his tribe 

all conjectures",2023-02-04 05:58:06
riri for me wasnt awful i just hated how every sentence felt like a twitter convo,2022-11-15 00:44:59
"her whole story makes zero sense in this movie you mean to tell me that after everything thats transpired none of the top minds in the world or even stark industries has been able to create a machine that detects vibranium until now this college student working out of a garage can do it becauseshes a smart cookie girl power no other context or explanation needed

100 puregrade  textbook mary sue the suit i can almost believe but not that",2022-11-15 13:36:39
yeah for me that was the only real letdown in the movie,2022-11-14 22:24:49
the cia stuff probably got too much screen time but its likely to mostly further setup the thunderbolts movie and to show that war with wakanda is inevitable its also possible that it could somehow be tied into secret war though i think thats less likely,2022-11-14 23:30:01
sure did,2022-11-11 05:01:27
yeah,2022-11-11 04:02:09
i think the box office will prove this comment wrong,2022-11-11 04:20:33
i wouldnt call is feministic but mens being buffoons and womens being badasses is so cliche now that writers dont even think about it twice while using the same tropes over and over im honestly tired of that,2022-11-13 10:30:50
idk if i would say marvel would never do that civil war was technically a capt america movie this could have been similar,2022-11-11 03:40:04
i liked black swan more,2022-11-12 00:32:20
"at this point given how identical wakanda and talokans origins are  and how equally unrealistic their success at exploiting  vibranium is  im writing the whole thing off as an experiment by some rogue celestials or something 

it explains why  seems to go right for them",2022-11-15 23:11:47
either this is a troll post or someone that just absolutely does not have appreciation for good emotional acting in movies,2022-11-11 20:19:07
im really starting to question some of you alls oponions,2022-11-12 19:24:08
who would you have casted you make it sound like its an extremely easy task replacing a star that played the role to iconic levels,2022-11-11 18:27:15
i said the same thing as we left the cinema her presence on screen is lacking,2022-11-11 16:50:36
"35mph for a whale

but it does appear there are passages for them to cut through we see shuri get jetted through one on her first time to the city",2022-11-11 20:25:12
queenmother trumps princess unless no others,2022-11-12 19:25:43
because wakanda for being the most technical strongest nation in the world make zero  sense they make zero sense in how they govern they make zero sense in how they interact with the world they make zeros sense in how they use their technology they make zeros sense in what they wear looking at you guy with a plate in his mouth or guys showing up to the un with their hair like wildebeest horns zero zero zero  sense  this movie hey you know the shields that protect the city guess what use we use drum beats to bring those up and down ,2022-11-12 15:48:32
" i kinda wish this was two movies one where foreign powers try to exploit wakanda after t’challa’s death and another focused solely on talocan vs wakanda

good point",2022-11-13 10:49:30
yeah that choice to fight sea people on a boat in the middle of the sea is the worst tactical choice since the battle of winterfell good thing the wakandans had plot on their side,2022-11-12 21:49:01
i was really expecting after shuri’s little tour of the kingdom she’d come back and find riri had been executed,2022-11-13 23:22:55
he always wanted to burn the world but then land is occupied by wakandans if they attack the surface wakandan will help the surface even tho they are considered sister country by the connection of vibranium and if war happens both side would suffer tremendous loss also a raw and a refined vibranium when clashed together causes destabilization and makes it feels like fighting with papersmetaphorically just like wakanda he has spies around the seas and his information gathering is just as good predicting soon the world will goes against wakanda no thanks to  and wakanda will come to talokan to ask help and that will be the checkmate ie vibraniums versus the world,2022-11-15 11:15:01
"he doesnt surrender he dies the war with wakanda continues and they tell everyone he killed those americans his people likely have to fight both wakanda and the rest of the world which wont end well 

he does surrender he and wakanda can work to stop more detectors and maybe manage talokans relationship with the world",2022-11-15 23:29:47
his justification for taking the surface world was never the vibranium he was always planning on doing it because he saw it as an inevitability he even says it he says that he’s been training his people preparing them for that moment,2022-11-15 07:18:38
hes no zemo for sure,2022-11-14 22:25:48
his character did not make sense actor tried but the writing really failed him in pivotal ways,2022-11-15 04:36:25
aggressively boring thats a great description,2023-02-07 16:35:55
100 felt like anti blackmale propaganda t’challa was the only competent black man in the country i guess,2022-11-13 15:37:14
" chadwick boseman passing was tragic but then you should either recast or have film take place 10 years later when son is of age this wasn’

100 agree but marvel wanted it to be a female empowerment movie like every single other project theyve released in the past 2 years and so this was the route they chose it was a miserable route and i hated it but its what they chose  me now",2022-11-13 20:36:19
"i honestly dont know how you arrived at any of these questions or conclusions

killmonger was being killmonger

mbaku had a few jokes but even he realized that they couldnt let namor threaten wakanda at the cost of just one girls life he later defended wakanda like any wakandan would

ross risked his lifefreedom to do what he thought was right

doesnt seem like men were made to be jokes",2022-11-13 21:34:03
 woke criticism for a  marvel movie classic guess we cant just enjoy fun fight scenes anymore,2022-11-25 10:32:26
how would you even interpret it this way this sounds way more racist then the movie,2022-11-13 16:35:59
there was a mutant drop during ms marvel as well,2022-11-11 17:22:32
black adam was slow mo cgi for 1 hr 40 minute get a grip that movie was hot ,2022-11-12 19:04:36
just say that you have comprehension issues and go off like… if you didn’t understand the very simple plot of a superhero flick i can’t imagine you watching a nolan film,2022-11-14 01:43:18
sorry but on what planet does tenoch huerta look like someone of european descent,2022-11-14 02:16:06
"shuri referred to everett ross as a colonizer in the first film

tenoch huerta is mexican

this is an interesting one the mcus wakanda is posited as a place from which multiple african civilizations sprung so everyone has a slightly different accent most wakandans slip into xhosa because thats what john kani who played tchaka speaks and coogler was inspired on a trip to south africa but the jabari speak a yoruba dialect a way of conveying their distance from the rest of wakandas people

they wanted to  her but also saw her as a bargaining chip with the wakandans

unexplained they may have hypnotized the guards",2022-11-14 18:14:01
"why is an african calling an american a colonizer



its a carry over joke from the first movie",2022-11-14 03:31:42
really bad,2022-11-11 04:11:23
"it has really great moments but also some bad moments  thats why most are coming out with a mediocre feeling 

personally i thought it was a great tribute to chadwick bozeman and wasnt as funny in a good way for me its the best mcu movie this year by far",2022-11-11 22:26:42
because she becomes the bp in the comics after tchalla goes into a coma  forbid they follow the source material without it being called woke,2022-12-08 00:49:52
yah she was awful i think they realized it too hence the midcredit scene no chance in  she can carry the bp movies going forward,2022-11-24 05:40:41
it’s obvious she’s just a stopgap black panther lol…,2022-11-16 21:30:17
when will you realize shuri became black panther in the comics and it has nothing to do with this woke agenda virtue signaling  you are spouting,2022-11-13 23:11:45
"go woke

by acknowledging women exist",2022-11-11 04:56:16
it literally makes the most sense to have shuri be the black panther it’s his sister i mean are you serious,2022-11-11 05:25:19
you give it a perfect score but everything fell flat to you,2022-11-11 16:27:14
"problem is one deadmans switch would have stopped the whole movie girl had all the power threaten to upload the plans to the internet if anyone kills you dont get to upload password daily then plans are automatically uploaded to multiple websites

use your brain this is old trick",2022-11-13 20:41:04
i counted seven people in my screening sleeping,2022-11-11 15:07:45
i couldn’t stop looking,2022-11-13 17:48:51
yeah the princess is kind of built like a teenage boy but lupita nyongo is all woman,2022-11-13 21:43:50
very succinct very accurate,2022-11-14 02:00:26
way too long if 3040 minutes were trimmed it would have made for such a better movie i enjoyed it though,2022-11-13 21:40:34
no need for any of the cia stuff,2022-11-13 22:57:43
i liked dr strange but yah this phase was pretty bad,2022-11-13 05:11:16
"especially as she wont  with her right wing conspiracy theories

she seems desperate to take the gina carano career path",2022-11-12 21:47:18
"not unresolved

mbaku is king shuri doesnt want it",2022-11-13 11:55:14
guessing she doesnt want the responsibility,2022-11-13 05:37:40
i have to assume that shuri did not want to be the black panther and that her role as black panther in this movie was just a placeholder for the time being,2022-11-13 22:11:43
haha i thought that too i rewatched all the phase 4 movies recently and the only ones that are fine and don’t have major issues is shang chi and no way home even though that’s just nostalgia bait thor love and thunder is atrocious,2022-11-13 06:30:28
lol i feel so different like love and thunder was dumb but fun  this movie was just bad and boring,2022-11-14 07:19:15
lol i actually thought it was better,2022-11-13 05:08:08

i think it really sets up some interesting stuff between young t’challa and mbakus kids assuming he becomes king which is what it looked like to me down the line but overall i’m not into the whole kid super hero stuff,2022-11-11 15:46:21
i think its different because in the movies you mentioned theyre fictional deaths so they had a lot of artistic freedom to make it as emotional as they wanted chadwick boseman actually died so going out of their way to make it emotional could come across as really tacky and disrespectful i thought the fact they treated it more like a eulogy to boseman and let those flashback scenes stand for themselves had a very strong impact,2022-11-13 14:19:59
i honestly wouldn’t have minded if there wasn’t a black panther it felt like they just shoehorned it in,2022-11-11 10:07:02

"i respectfully disagree with the idea that shuri isn’t a compelling main character i find her character arc fascinating 

she always seemed to prefer being on the sidelines crafting technological advancements for wakanda suddenly she gets  into political situations and expectations to step into her brother’s shoes that she never asked for all while navigating shocking grief that we the audience can relate to 

she sees things much more rationally and wants to distance herself from relics of the past including the very mantle of the black panther i admire this trait of her as a potential world leader but at the same time it leaves her cynical and angry as she she struggles to deal with her grief and connect to her ancestry

eventually she has to freakin’ scientifically engineer the lost herb to take the mantle of black panther out of necessity for wakanda in doing so she has a unique connection to the ancestral plane that opens her eye spiritually but not in a sunshine’s and daisys way i didn’t see the vision with killmonger as a teased heel turn i saw it as nuance to her character that she was legitimately battling with",2022-11-11 08:46:28

there was no reason for him to think this “scientist” kept the formula to themselves  why wouldn’t they sell it to the government for billions",2022-11-12 22:45:51
didnt like in the 1st very interesting,2022-11-12 19:19:07
great analysis agree with all your points,2022-11-11 16:59:28
i thought the title wakanda forever implied something similar too bad they didnt go that way also namor being defeated by multiple wakandans would be more fitting,2022-11-12 20:58:24
this should be higher up  seriously so much better than the dog  plot they rolled with,2022-11-14 07:26:36
 lol,2022-11-11 22:24:11
"i disagree with you on shuri the black panther title is hereditary who else was supposed to take it raimunda 

shuris lack of experience as a fighter shows and its purposeful she just became black panther out of necessity and it wasnt a longterm process we might see her improve in the future",2022-11-12 09:08:41
" the new cultural spin is interesting but this is kind of erasure of the atlantian mythos ill take what i can get i suppose

maybe if this movie came out before aquaman theyd have stuck with a more traditional adaptation of atlantis but i get the desire to set it apart and make something more distinct",2022-11-12 15:15:30
theres no trials and tribulations that t’challa went though all you have to is eat the herb and reach the ancestral plane  are you even on about,2022-11-12 19:06:38
ms marvel did it first a few months ago,2022-11-13 16:40:12

the last 2 mcu movies were under 2 hours without credits,2022-11-14 00:17:11
are you talking about the suit they gave her when they went to mit because i think that was intentionally bad to make it look like the wakandans were trying very hard to blend in,2022-11-13 21:19:32

dialogues were ridiculously amateurish one royalty coming to other royalty alone and saying hi im namor  some scientist for me is something straight out of bad fanfiction,2022-11-13 10:33:39
agreed shuris depiction of anger and vengeance fell flat for me throughout the film,2022-11-12 10:50:35
it was definitely awkward at parts kinda like they shot it with one tone in mind and edited it trying to achieve another the calm music was mostly welcome from me but it did weirdly never get as triumphant as i would have expected at parts,2022-11-14 05:17:56
"just saw it couldn’t tell you what any of it meant i get the general sweeps of namor wants to protect his people or something…man what a mess of a film

i’m scrolling through comments and nobody wants to just outright say it the tributes to boseman are sweet yes but what if i told you it’s 3 hours long and 20 seconds maybe are devoted to him

i know there’s an “air” of sadness but the general plot is so labyrinthine trying to get us to namor and his quest to  riri for some reason",2022-11-14 01:14:30

"being comic accurate doesn’t make the midnight angel suits less  i thought they were  designs on the page too 

as for riri my complaint is actually that they didn’t lean into the iron man influence enough in the comics she’s directly and openly inspired by iron man so i wished they played that up more i think it would’ve made sense if they did what the comics did and have her suit be a direct iron man copy then as she progresses she makes a more unique suit i guess they already did the hero worship stuff with spiderman and iron man though so i get why they wouldn’t wanna retread that here",2022-11-12 09:46:12

"talokan did give it to a number of their people its why they can regenerate and are stronger than expected 

your observation on riri is interesting i think you are right that it may be foreshadowing for the black panther to not be just one person or at least for more wakandas to experience it",2022-11-28 09:30:59
you think an african making a joke about colonizers is out of place didnt pay much attention in history class huh,2022-11-26 22:23:00
that will only work ifwhen the writers need it to until then nope cuz thats marvel logic these days,2022-11-30 20:57:33
"all of namors elders including his mother are from the surface and mayan i dont see why he would feel no connection to the enslaved mayans on the surface when the entire reason he came back was because of how pained his mother was at not being able to return to her home because if the violence brought by colonization 

i also dont see how he was spineless i wouldnt call raiding the wakandan capital and killing ramonda as a show of force spineless he showed force shuri showed it back and demonstrated that wakanda is a better ally than enemy if namor only wanted bloodshed and warmongering hed be no different than killmonger unlike killmonger namor is motivated by the desire to protect his people from discovery rather than desiring vengeance from his own admission only decided to wage war then because he feared he could no longer keep talokan secret the offer of an alliance serves namor and his people far more than dying for pride or continuing conflict with wakanda then the entire surface",2022-12-06 10:46:22
they were being held in an underwater cave and not at the city less pressure,2023-02-04 06:20:47

otherwise what a  movie the entire plot is based off of this half assed new character",2022-11-13 15:13:59
the college student was probably more interested in the technological side of building that machine than the problem that the government could have for it its not like the united states tells their citizens it is illegal to track down vibranium,2022-11-13 21:49:28
by the end of the movie  i forgot the entire plot line of a scientist who discovered vibranium    there were so many different throw away scenes,2023-02-12 12:59:58

remember when kevin feige said this is the most important phase 4 filmlike how  happened  wakanda got its  kicked thats it,2022-11-12 03:11:06
you make good points the only answer i have is to your bucky comment bucky was banned from wakanda for getting zemo out of prison or at least they told him to stay away for awhile because they werent cool with that granted i feel like they could have made an exception to let him attend the funeral but i get that wakanda is a pretty exclusionary country when it comes to outsiders i hope one day bucky gets tight with them again i liked when he was living there he as actually at peace,2022-11-12 18:30:13
youre telling me you sat there and let them talk for the whole thing and never said a word never tried to move seats nothing cmon man you gotta assert yourself in life to get what you want,2022-11-12 05:04:57

x200b

namor being taken down by dehydration and a newbie panther was also pretty laughable they said hes on the same level as thor but even iron man circa civil war wouldshould be able to beat the  out of a super soldier can you imagine thor losing to cap he should oneshot him

iron man got beaten down by just two super soldiers also i think youre mistaken in your understanding of the power hierarchy of the mcu the black panther is more powerful than captain america and bucky that might upset you to hear but its only logical cap has a vibranium shield and bucky has a metal arm now its vibranium but black panthers entire suit is vibranium i think were finally starting to see how much of a cheat code that stuff is shuri got impaled and survived because of that suit so first off you have to put more respect on the black panther and the black panther suit second namor was essentially attacked by a biological weapon and heavily nerfed and still beat shuris  the only reason she won is because of the cheat code that is the black panther suit giving her an extra life it stabilized her wound and then she was able to surprise him with the explosion to take him out",2022-11-22 18:54:00

did you fall asleep okoye i think recognised the language as mayan or similar which pointed nakia to an area in south america there she finds a woman who purported to have encountered namor which leds her to the beach from there she can track shuris beads to the cave and the underwater cavern,2022-11-13 10:44:45
final fight shouldve been on a beach,2022-11-13 05:42:32
yeah ironheart suit cgi was definitely a weak spot for me,2022-11-13 05:28:04
different ocean different motion i guess,2022-11-13 11:08:15
i was about to say that the resources inside tiamuts head is probably worth more than vibranium but then i realize that tiamut is made of snow ,2022-11-13 21:38:39
nobody talk about that giant hand nothing to see here,2022-11-14 14:21:36
"i didnt like this film  i wanted to get that out of the way first

now that i have said that my man jeeves tells me its most likely theme from pink panthress  or love and loyalty",2022-11-16 00:40:37
from what i understood namor was   tchalla exposed vibraniums existence to the world which resulted in everyone trying to find it for themselves  if wakanda wasnt going to help by handing riri over and come together as an ally namor wasnt waging war against wakanda his people survive on virbanium and their existence is being threatened,2022-11-23 19:00:18
"what the  is wrong with this   sub man anybody that says anything positive just gets downvoted to 

youre not allowed to enjoy this movie here apparently",2022-11-11 18:31:23
idk how you got so many downvotes man this is a perfectly reasonable review,2022-11-16 05:02:34
they’re in this very comment section actually,2022-11-12 11:47:51
they still left the door open to kick her out of the franchise,2022-11-15 14:50:30
they should have recast tchalla,2022-11-11 18:13:05
youre not lying marvel releases  movies all the time and theyre so pretentious here they cant even acknowledge when they release a great one finally,2022-11-11 04:35:27
not even close this is a 610 great tribute but lacking story namor literally caused the very issues he didn’t want to happen why did he go to the queen he could have let the confusion grown between wakanda and the feds smh,2022-11-11 05:23:07
"i liked it overall but i really felt what critics were saying about the mcu tieins and setups weighing it down the inclusion of ironheart and valentinaross just felt so forced just so they could set up future projects you could cut the majority of their time in the movie and nothing would really change

plus shuri is just not it as bp i saw other critics mention that there was definitely a bosemansized hole that shuri wasnt able to properly fill and i have to agree especially as just physically her shot in the bp suit just looked lame the bp suits head looked oversized on her lanky form and was just not intimidating or cool as they clearly expected it to be same goes for the ironheart and midnight angels suits that looked super out of place really does feel like anime mecha suits in comparison to everything else",2022-11-11 06:39:26
nothing more grounded than seamexicans that fly with little wings on their feet,2022-11-11 04:26:41
i prefer shang chi to this,2022-11-11 15:58:16
they don’t want to acknowledge greatness,2022-11-11 04:32:50
yh she was more more interesting than shuri,2022-11-15 22:00:30
wakanda royalty isnt truly inherited the heir apparent accepts challengers to the throne in 1v1 combat in the waterfall ceremony  ramonda probably didnt have any challengers or ruled as a regent while tchallas mourning period was in effect  notice her title amongst foreigners was queen but amongst wakandians was queen mother,2022-11-17 09:37:58
absolutely not lol namor is getting everyone wet,2022-11-13 06:25:14

"there are very valid critiques

the movie has issues as well some good moments and is boring at points too for me

everyone is allowed their own opinions",2022-11-13 11:52:45
the movie was bad and that has nothing to do with the very obvious reasons youd like to blame the critiques on the cgi was  the death of chadwick was weak the movie was too long there were some unlikeable character riri williams cough cough etc none of that has to do with very obvious reasons cope harder,2022-11-13 20:58:04
i went in expecting to hate it like i have the other recent mcu movies but i loved it,2022-11-13 05:07:47
marvel fans are very opressed,2022-11-11 05:01:48
i wont downvote you and i dont hate shuri becoming the black panther for a little bit i hate the direction the whole movie took by basically rushing shuri into the black panther at the end these directors get so cunning around trying to build a better story that they miss most of the audience which was when i went yesterday mostly comprised of 612 year olds and parents every kid including my own walked out saying where was the black panther that was long why did it show up at the end,2022-11-14 21:05:16
i wont hate and in fact ill agree with you this was another female empowerment move despite the fact that marvel has made every   project recently a female empowerment one its not only exhausting but its straight up ruining the mcu they have let woke agenda trump actual storytelling and narrative and i hate to see it,2022-11-14 20:36:14
shuri briefly takes on the mantle of black panther in the comics when tchalla gets sick the ending of the movie doesnt make it clear whether it not shuri intends to move forward as the black panther and they could either go with mbaku or toussaint in the future to take on the mantle of black panther plus letitia wrightshuri has not signed on to do more marvel movies and has even said herself that she doesnt want to return to the franchise while winston dukembaku has signed on for more movies,2022-11-14 23:40:41
no,2022-11-11 04:09:11
coogler actually said in an interview that one of the biggest influences for this film was 1980s soviet cinema so it makes sense there could be a reference to come and see 1985,2022-11-11 04:59:22
heavily led 30 year old white conservative leaning males are here for the most part so its expected tbh,2022-11-11 11:30:21
as someone who would give the first movie a 9510 this movie is indeed a 510 not sure why you think everyone has to like it,2022-11-11 14:04:40
" cope harder

you say after referencing rt to prove the movie is good",2022-11-11 15:30:39

what were the racist remarks,2022-11-12 12:13:53
there’s no racist remarks in the film,2022-11-12 12:16:54

aquaman should try to  more children for no reason to become as wellwritten as namor,2022-11-11 05:38:32
yeah they should have thought ahead and done a stopmotion action scene with bosemans corpse before it started to decompose,2022-11-11 04:45:58
glad i wasn’t the only one that noticed this one of the best pieces from a movie i’ve heard this year,2022-11-11 07:47:36
"shuri isnt a fighter she solely knows how to use blasters in infinity war for example she got beat with ease she was helpless without any of her guns 

the potion she drank just grants her enhanced strength and agility however fighting skills are separate which is why raimunda wanted nakia to be the black panther because she was the sole fighter in the surviving group in the first film when tchalla was assumed to be dead",2022-11-11 21:25:14
do people really watch movies like this ,2022-11-13 22:49:54

it’s going to make bank,2022-11-11 04:21:14
the main male character died so this take is nonsense,2022-11-14 11:32:26
i’m not sure i follow what is “woke” about a movie with women we literally can’t have an action movie with women as the focus without it being “woke” or pushing an agenda but you don’t see any motives behind a movie with all men other than tradition… is that right,2022-11-14 15:30:43
" finally lol idk how it took me this long to find the praise this was easily their best film since endgame

i would count nwh but the plot starter in that movie was nonsense and it was all nostalgia bait",2022-11-11 04:30:03
best mcu movie in phase 4 by a long shot,2022-11-11 06:07:41
they were great friends calm down there bozo,2022-11-11 15:05:49
its so funny because this sub absolutely  on the first black panther all the time and i think this is a clear improvement over that one yet anybody saying so is getting downvoted lol this sub man i really just feel is so lowkey racist between this  and the woman king reaction thread,2022-11-11 11:27:19
"we’re gonna be in the minority but i too think this is the best phase 4 movie by a landslide

the writing character work worldbuilding  visuals are all better in this movie then the others of this phase imo",2022-11-11 07:51:32
"nah this ain’ bruh i got dark skin and all the actors carried the movie 

there were just so many problems with the movie 

the cia side plot was inconsequential 
shuris character development for the end choice was so contrived and rushed they should have had a future movie to explore the development she came to would’ve been better for her to seek the path of vengeance and realize her mistake later 
shuri also is just a mid character letitia did her best with it but the writing is so 2dimensional for her 
also there was too much overexposition and filler dialogue 

the beginning and end tribute were the best parts of the movie 

some of the character motivations are so generic or incoherent namors whole transformation made no sense he wanted to protect his people from imperialism by killing wakandans through imperialism 

the biggest problem with the movie is it’s like star wars episode 7 they were just rehashing what worked in black panther 1 just like how episode 7 paralleled episode 4 and didn’t bring anything new to the game 

also nakia should’ve just been the new black panther honestly she’s a bit more interesting than shuri 

shuri would’ve been good if she actually didn’t turn out to be like her brother and we saw the vengeance consume her 

also they kinda just went against tchallas wishes and aspirations for wakanda with the events of black panther 2

just a disappointing movie overall was expecting them to flesh out the other characters more since tchalla is dead but they really only did that for the queen 

race got nun to do with it just bad writing and mid pacing made this a boring  movie even though love and thunder is definitely worse that was still more enjoyable because of some brainless good time moments 

the first one blows this  outta the water even though this was about shuri she still felt like a side character 

there’s just a lotta seeming plot holes like since that lord requested to fight for the throne since shuri didn’t want it why was the queen uncontestedno one chose to challenge her

also there were like three action set pieces 
the car chase car chase just like in bp1 when namor kills the queen and when they fight in the shipwhen shuri becomes the black panther 

the final act was so anticlimactic they force fed the viewer with that montage of the similarities between namors people and the wakandas to the point where it felt cringe and as if they hadn’t already exhibited the similarities when shuri was seeing the underwater city and talking to namor 

it’s a shame was hoping for something fun to happen but it never came the closest was seeing namor jump around in the air but he was underutilized af 

the movie was a good sendoff to chadwick but not a good sequel to black panther or a good marvel movie",2022-11-15 05:21:11
"nah for sure its oscarslevel acting

the problem is within a year only 5 people if i am not wrong best of the best are nominated but that doesnt exclude angelas acting are in the same league as oscarlevel

you cant say someone isnt at the best performances just because they werent the top 5

for me  could be like 30 actors that have oscarlevel type of acting but issue is you must narrow it down to  only 5 and let go unfortunately of other 25 really really good af performances you know


in retrospect there are over thousands of performances every year i wouldnt be surprised if actually 50 are  actors that cant act 25 are average who the  knows

anyway very good performance are many many like hundreds oscarslevel acting you can say 3050 is even fair to say

oscars narrows it down to just 5 which is totally a crazy if you think about it out of 100010000s of performances thats the actors give that honor and 1 that wins is much less than 01 goodness",2022-11-11 06:53:05

look where you are my guy its like all conservative white 30 year old males here theyre actively trying to brigade any genuine positive and negative discussion on here with just troll parroted talking points from select critics that didnt like the film,2022-11-11 15:16:27
she is insufferable as a side character as a lead just abysmal,2022-11-11 19:07:11
i liked the suit but when she dropped down to announce herself as the new black panther was an absolute disaster of a scene garnered no reaction from the theater,2022-11-13 12:34:45

bunch of pathetic losers here who cant let anyone enjoy a  film i agree with you 100 and a lot of the casual audience does too

its only pretentious mfers with their heads up their  here i swear oh and dont get me started on some of these borderline discriminatory and racist comments im seeing through out",2022-11-14 13:39:27

"it was a complete pile of  as a comic book fan it didnt compare  but as it wasnt as bad as many people here say if its not taken as being related to the comics in any way  it was a badly written film but not the worst way to spend three hours at least  compared to whats available in theaters now  and the plot holes and bad writing werent immediately obvious in the time spent watching it  


just keep in mind that namor mackenzie isnt anything like quezlcottal or whatever his name is  and that black panther is somewhat accurate to the last few runs of the character  not the entire run of the characters history

oh and the version of ironheart was was off  in the original she was ann suda adult woman of japanese descent not riri williams 18yearzold of africanamerican descent and everything except the name ironheart was much different

genuine question how was he a narcissistic  he was a benevolent king and was protecting his people and culture,2022-11-13 06:33:15
i dont really consider him a villian more an antagonist wakanda was pretty much the same thing with tchallas father,2022-11-13 00:04:11

except for namora apparently she just tanked that  to the face in order to destroy it,2022-11-18 10:29:35
i actually really liked how they handled the warriors getting back up without fanfare and the reaction by okoye and the operatives from the beginning but it left me confused that the girls injured by nakia just straight up died they didnt handle that part very well,2022-11-15 04:39:20
and from that moment on they forgot those weapons existed ,2023-02-16 22:55:10
just like the vibranium armor black panther armor that is weak through sonic sounds as in the last scene of the first black panther movie the trains run because of the sonic barriere with the atlentiens being vibranium based in blood a sonic weapon would do the most damage,2023-02-22 00:25:43
why would the infiltrator have strong weapons than the warrior,2022-11-13 13:39:12
i don’t know anything about the physics involved but i was thinking that it has to do with the different level of pressure being so deep underwater vs on the surface kinda like how the same person can jump super high in low grav but not much at all in high gravity,2022-11-13 10:14:05
i appreciate the indepth take but if the movie and narrative is failing to deliver that thats a problem  and like you said a lot of this is speculation  i was also completely confused as to why shuri was seemingly fine being stabbed and saying it was the heartshaped fruit feels bad imo  like yeah maybe they were given regenerative healing powers but its never explained or shown well nor was their weakness,2022-11-14 19:10:43
this was an excellent explanation thank you,2022-11-13 21:41:01
wow this is a great response and gonna be my go to until we get more official info to confirm or deny,2022-11-13 22:35:58
your response was so thoughtful but then you implied that you think all talokans have winged feet when its just namor cus hes a mutant,2022-11-16 22:47:00
perfect response would also explain the talokans usage of whales throughout the film,2022-11-14 02:14:18
thats not much of an answer imo cause im pretty sure being stabbed through with a vibranium spear at close range should be generally lethal as well,2022-11-13 19:49:51
nakia explicitely said she used a sonic gun and thats its definitely lethal not sure what that means but i take it its more dangerous than a blade,2022-11-13 07:45:49
why would they guard their hostages with civilians ,2022-11-12 22:29:06
"yea that doesnt make sense to me tchalla was a big deal he was well respected by the avengers sam bucky rhodey and clint would have all wanted to pay respects for sure 

but i figure ramonda was grieving hard so he didnt gaf at the moment",2022-11-15 04:30:18
we don’t know how soon the funeral was after his death also wakanda is normally pretty closed off to visitors and with the queen and shuri mourning i don’t know who would have coordinated that,2022-11-13 20:52:29
i was expecting sam shortly after ftws when he was asked about his future cap movie he commented something like everyone is super busy with the bp2 prep so i dont have time to think about it,2022-11-14 13:17:38
if i recall as of captain america and the winter soldier bucky coming back to wakanda is illadvised,2022-12-02 03:29:18
im not fully brushed up but i dont recall tchalla ever hanging out like all the other avengers did i cant picture him in the tower or helicarrier around a table with the others,2022-12-06 03:33:33
this is admittedly always my problem with the separate mcu titles after the avengers they all exist in one universe yet none of them around around when something earthshaking happens in a singlehero movie,2023-02-03 02:17:07
we don’t use that word here,2022-11-18 02:42:05
i agree they could have at least had stand ins for the other avengers and only show them in from behind during the funeral scene,2023-02-03 15:02:45
agree it looked like i was watching a different film anytime riri came in,2022-11-17 06:33:23
shuri did make her leave the suit behind so you may be right,2023-02-06 14:24:09

it was never about riri it was about seeing if wakanda would be on talokans side,2022-11-16 21:46:04
namoi wants wakanda as an ally its contrived to achieve that result,2023-02-08 10:17:46
"they at least gave america chavez a semblance of backstory and character development 

riri was literally “hey i’m secretly one of the smartest people on the planet isn’t that cool” without giving her any character 

i’m still confused what her character is besides that",2022-11-27 18:18:51
it was so dumb plus i’m not interested in riri her character wasn’t compelling and none of her jokes landed i found her inclusion and annoying the good with about bp1 was that it was an actual movie without the  marvel teasing of in universe characters and events well too much teasing,2022-12-03 04:21:40
and both of them seem like really good actors who are a lot of fun on screen her takedown of the drone was some top tier low stakes superheroing and thats what im really here for,2023-02-17 21:24:02
"agreed with the edit

so she recognizes shuri hears that she is in trouble acts calm and like shell be alright and then suddenly tried to attack them put 2 and 2 together holy  oh it was a school project bro you made a vibramium detector do you think its just plastic or smt like surely shed be aware of how important that is",2022-11-27 21:13:54
he did say that but my problem is 1 if thats true why wouldnt they recruit her 2 it doesnt make any sense at all that they were somehow able to use it without her knowledge but not reverseengineer it thats just completely absurd and even if it is truei just refer back to 1 3 why would namor assume the cia didnt reverseengineer it realistically he would just assume the knowledge is already out there idek how he knew only one scientist made it anyways like how do you know that but not who did it lol,2022-11-16 01:32:42
"riri didnt know that the cia was using her machine at all its implied it was taken by mitthe cia

im aware of that it doesnt really address what i was actually getting at why wouldnt the cia recruit someone who invented the most important thing on the planet because surely she cant possibly be useful for anything else

beyond that like i mentioned before it doesnt really matter if he kills her or not because the technology is already out there unless theyre generally implying the cia somehow figured out how to utilize the technology without her knowledge but not reverseengineer it that would make even less sense",2022-11-14 23:03:52
youre getting downvoted but i totally agree she didnt seem to add anything to the back at the lab before the big fight scene either she only hung around echoing shuri when she worked out the diffusion bit she made an iron man suit in less than 7 days when her previous box of scraps version took her months even if you had access to shuris lab she would have needed so much more time she just felt like a shoehorned character that really didnt add any jokes charisma stakes other than for her own life which the audience only cared about because shuri felt a need to protect another young black female genius that i guess she saw some of herself in sans any bonding moments frustrated to see this happening more and more i get theyve got to build up new characters but they just feel so weak as far as any big screen action goes america chavez kate bishop kamala khan riri im just starting to dread mcu projects because theyve been so weak lately because of forced drama that doesnt feel organic or rewarding,2022-11-21 03:10:37

"i mean isnt it pretty evident she was included in the story in the same vein of a lot of the mcus infinity stone macguffin plots there is no actual reason for her to be includedoutside of promoting her for a future show because in doing sothey leave a hole in the script and make the cia seem extremely incompetent 

they then center the story around one side protecting her another trying to capture her and another wanting to  herwhile she gets dragged along essentially every action and conflict present here is because of her existence however she has little to no agency character serves no thematic purpose and she has no character arc she was a tool to move the script forwardone that was inserted because like usualmarvel was half thinking about the future while making the movie",2022-11-28 03:59:21
"people not understanding what a plot device is 

her inclusion and more accurately namors motives make sense he doesnt know shes a student at mit he had no idea she was a child for all he knows she worked for the government its also strongly implied that the talokani dont get out much so in his old warrior mind we  the person who made the machine then the surface dwellers have no way to make more the way hes written i dont think hed assume theyd just make more he seems like a pretty strict from point a to point b kind of thinker",2022-11-22 03:41:34

likewise namor did not bring his entire army to the battle he was led to believe that the us government had activated another vibranium detector so he brought just enough people to wipe that outonly to discover it was the same one and that it was a trap",2022-11-14 15:24:13

it definitely was but it felt a little odd in light of wakanda having a very different power dynamic with the rest of the world than any of the places france colonized i would have liked to see a more indepth exploration of colonialism than “france did it and that’s bad” if they’re going to bring it into the movie,2022-11-14 19:55:53

correct,2023-02-03 22:36:13
okay what is wakanda doing outreach centers you mean that throwaway line lol that’s all i don’t think wakanda is doing anything and that’s the point the mcu has come up with like 20 or so different secret societies on earth and none of them are actually doing  lol it’s like the laser beam to the sky third act effect that everyone got tired of when are people going to get tired of the “secret society” plot device that adds nothing to the subsequent movies or overall story,2022-11-15 23:49:44
of course 90 of the heroes are also american and 100 of the french portrayed in the mcu are villains so thats some hardcore ,2022-11-28 23:49:33
"yeah i get more critical of wakandas foreign policy every movie so far lol

in the meeting at the start of the movie they explicitly told the other nations they can look for vibranium outside of wakanda no nation has a right to all strategic resources on the planet and claimed they were going to be a partner with the rest of the world

 now theyre covering up the  of dozens of people on that science vessel 

 hiding the existence of a major threat to literally the whole world that literally just prepared themselves to conquer the whole world

 partnered with that warmongering state to deny a valuable resource to the whole world regardless of where its found this material that is the source of advanced wakanda technology and is literally a miracle cure medicine which could save millions

 violated a sovereign nations borders to extraordinary rendition a citizen of that nation

 turned a us cia agent into a mole then assaulted the guards transporting him to jail to smuggle him out the intel he gave them did in fact put a target on a us citizen and compromised us security 

thats not including their actions in the first movie where they regularly violate sovereignty in military black ops planted intelligence agents in foreign nations who they lost control of when they tried to instigate a rebellion willingly allowed  monger to seize control of the country and supported him in his attempt to instigate terrorism in the rest of the world before his planned invasion

france was wrong to have a black ops team attack the outreach post although i dont think its unreasonable for a host nation to be concerned about a secret lab under whats essentially an embassy but i get the us and other nations concern about wakanda and their suspicion from the science team attack",2022-11-27 17:19:24
"black panther world war wakanda
its wakanda vs the world nations scramble to assemble teams of superheroes to assist in military operations against wakanda 

the thunderbolts get outsourced to france before the usa discovers that none of the avengers are around because plot hole usa loudly backs out of a war they started due to the somewhat diverse antiheroes of the thunderbolts russia and the newly formed southern united states militia join because propaganda deadpool thinking he has snuck into the thunderbolt team reveals he stole a fob from aim that reboots the white vision to factory settings and provides a convienent way into wakandas defenses as well as 4th wall quips that none of the other team understand 

during the battle namor realizes that if they allow wakanda to fall the world get the resources to defend his own planned assault on the world he steps in to assist wakanda revealing his nation to the world the nations retreat because wakanda was already kicking their  before namor showed up the fob which was destroyed by the white vision due to a repeated awareness moment at the spot of visions death in infinity war because continuity call backs was deadpools ticket to ninja dust while yelling dammit brolin a temporary treaty ends the war 

the first after credit is kang convienently watching but staying out of it 

the second credit is krakoa opening to xmen 97 live action characters this is the real reason deadpool stole the fob and tried to sneak into wakanda

the record third credit is arisham deciding whether or not to wait the full fifty years before destroying earth",2023-02-28 12:07:56

that film was so very nearly a great film it had a really good serious plot line with a dark but sympathetic villain who suffered a great loss it also had wacky slapstick off the wall comedy and didn’t take itself seriously at all i personally found the screaming goats hilarious and the jealous jonathan was exquisitely silly 

the two things just don’t belong together in the same movie though",2022-11-12 20:48:42
to slightly defend the movie on that front she might view thor and others as “advanced aliens” along the lines of the explanation the first thor movie gave for asgard and co while bast and the ancestral plane are blatantly supernatural and seemingly transcendent and she has apparently not seen enough evidence to convince her of their existence and probably views “there are psychoactive ingredients in the heartshaped herb” as a perfectly plausible explanation for what black panthers experience while taking it,2022-12-12 06:22:06

seeing the suit in action i totally agreed with her",2022-11-14 03:36:25

"if they had removed the whole supersuit plotline from the movie what other script changes would they have to make  honestly what a waste of script  they foreshadow the  things 3 or 4 times and the only thing theyre good for is getting two or three good punches in during the final battle before getting overwhelmed by mostly  people with spears  

same thing for ironheart  oooooh what an amazing super suit  full of amazing microcircuitry and rockets although she apparently had time to do the metal work by hand with a hammer and torch  in the most advanced automated manufacturing facility on the planet  i wonder if it will make a single lick of difference in any of the events  nope  it just lets her briefly slow down several of the merpeople in one scene",2022-11-16 15:57:59

yep that was the joke,2022-11-15 14:01:11
that’s what i thought too  predator in the avatar world,2022-11-13 02:55:28
i feel like they even acknowledged that tongue in cheek by saying it looked uglier every time she saw it,2022-11-19 12:54:06
except he was dope,2022-11-12 00:57:20
"killmonger didn’t really know and his daddy was going against wakanda policies and wanted to stay under the radar 

nakia is a trusted operator who left before t’challa passed with his blessings she could raise the prince right while showing him the struggles and triumphs the outside world could offer 

if he stayed in wakanda the pressure and training for him to become king of that nation would have been overwhelming he probably wanted his son to have choices in life",2022-11-13 17:02:01
"i think the queen was going to tell her when they were out in the bush before namor showed up she said something like i have to tell you something and then dude showed up


because in my mind that was never addressed again until the mid credits scene",2022-11-14 21:48:35
i think near the beginning of the movie its said that shuri keeps ignoring calls from nakia,2022-11-14 18:47:56
i don’t understand why the heir to a kingdom would be raised away from that kingdom i’d resent that as a citizen of the kingdom who’s this dang haitian kid they’re bringing to rule over us  also why haiti it’s a hot mess,2022-11-13 18:56:58
ramona was about to tell shuri when namor first appeared,2022-11-19 09:38:31
"
why wouldn’t they tell shuri


the queen tried to tell her something at the fire ritual but namor interrupted everyone tried to get shuri to go to her brothers side as he was dying but she refused she was ignoring nakias calls everyone tried to tell her but couldnt for one reason or another",2022-11-28 04:00:06
nothing bad ever happens in haiti,2022-12-27 01:03:51
shuri asks if her mother knew and nakia says yes so for whatever reason they kept it from shuri,2022-11-13 13:41:36
i dont mean the vibranium from that scene i mean the one in namors origin story where a mayan swims to pick up the plant that was growing on the vibranium,2022-11-11 09:49:00
oh  is that why that part of mexico is shaped like that,2022-11-14 21:19:40
i didnt even think of that thats so neato that they put it in chixilub plus the central americans is a cool  cukture to get ideas from,2022-11-16 14:38:25
tbh the usefulness of vibranium was not as widely known till the debut of the black panther it wasn’t a substance to that was widely known,2022-12-03 04:14:26
to be fair even if you did have an idea of where it fell youd still have to go through namor and talocan in their territory to get it,2022-11-13 20:54:36
true  dont take my word for it because im pretty  but i remember reading conjecture about how sea life being unable to harness fire as a tool could be a major barrier to intelligent sea life octopuses dolphins evolving in the way humans have fire is so instrumental for using resources to make certain tools fending off predators making foods edible and making inhospitable locations habitable that without it life might be sat in an evolutionary well where it might not be worth evolving for higher consciousness,2023-02-17 01:44:35
"talocan and wakanda never had any conflicts because the status quo never changed for centuries wakanda was ruled by a line of benevolent dictators that were content with their self isolation and talocan was ruled by a  who just wanted to stay hidden

of course there werent conflicts they had everything they wanted already this was made clear in bp1",2022-11-13 14:01:32
they cant do that the entire ludicrous premise of wakanda is that everyone else is a coloniser except them its pure happenstance that they only ever call white europeans and americans colonisers and not the 15 nations around them doing the same,2022-11-19 22:59:04
ciashield in the mcu could not even build a vibranium detector,2023-02-01 11:11:02
i cant fault a marvel film for this as silly as it is the great man theory is the literal bedrock on which superhero stories were created the idea that certain individuals are so far ahead of the curve that they themselves uphold society and drive it forwards it was a little more ridiculous that such a person would be worried about missing a class on differential calculus or whatever it was or that were meant to be impressed that she knows what diffusion is,2023-02-17 02:04:31
pretty sure she said she found one not built one,2022-11-14 01:15:59
nothing is earned anymore every new hero is granted incredible power without effort or sacrifice its a universe of mary sues with doc strange trying to pretend they arent in his way,2022-11-19 23:05:06
"diffeq is definitely not freshman level and is often considered calc 3 or 4

the better question is if she is truly that smart then why is she still in college at 19",2023-02-02 03:46:39
"yeah this was the part that annoyed me the most obviously a writer falling to write a character smarter than them it would be impossible for someone to understand vibrations enough to create a device like that detector but also be concerned about a  diffeq class real life prodigy terence tao was beyond college math by age 10 and even if she wasnt nurtured like him its a lot easier to get ahold of textbooks than iron man suit parts or quantum computers  

also she had access to wakandan tech had been working on suit designs for years and had some knowledge of tonys suits and ended up making a worse version of his 1st or 2nd gen suit did shuri just say no nano tech for you when they were about to go to war just seems like intentional sandbagging so she doesnt hit the peak of the power curve too fast even then though the suit was taken away from her anyway",2023-02-05 14:37:43
oh so it wasn’t an antman reference,2022-11-12 12:12:50
yup,2022-11-13 18:11:06
quantum computers actually exist tho… lol,2022-11-16 01:31:31
not 256 bit “2065 byte encryption” in the movie,2023-02-04 06:06:25
that might be the best acting ive seen from her,2022-11-12 06:35:30
yes totally thought nakia should have been it we even thought they were going there when it appeared shuri had failed when she met killmonger,2022-11-16 01:23:38
i was convinced okoye would be the panther after that scene,2022-11-20 23:41:15
"i thought no one could beat cate blanchett for tar but man this was one of bassetts best performances bar none

but still cate has it in the bag

edit on second thought shed be in best supporting actress so yeah go angela",2022-11-13 10:58:05
the oscars are  they would never nominate or include any kind of superhero movie on any level for any category,2022-12-12 05:43:43
and no 15 jokes per minute pacing best mcu movie since end game for me,2022-11-13 04:19:41
same everyone was great but she was on another level,2022-11-15 00:45:42
 bassett is great but for this nah,2022-11-13 00:34:30
she was even more ripped in what’s love got to do with it and that movie was a long time ago so she looks amazing now,2022-12-12 05:41:17
you forgot the most important factor which is that black dont crack,2022-11-14 09:09:40
idk i have plenty of aunts on their 60s that dont she much either,2022-11-16 22:43:51
i think the queen character was always supposed to die too his mother being of an advanced age now and not getting spend that precious time with her when shes 5 years closer to the end would have been powerful,2022-11-11 23:01:09
that actually makes a lot of sense,2022-11-11 18:00:14
my screening had a qa with ryan coogler and joel robert cole afterwards and they said the plot was supposed to be a fatherson movie where tchallas son spends a summer vacation in wakanda with him after chadwick passed they turned it into more of a movie about moms,2022-11-15 06:11:58
honestly i could totally picture a lot of this movie being basically the same at least in the broad strokes if chadwick hadnt died instead of mourning tchallas death it would be tchallas missing five years and having to rebuild postthanos but otherwise you still get the americans searching for vibranium setting talokan and wakanda on a path for war namor probably still kills ramonda etc,2022-11-17 05:17:30
5 years can you explain this,2022-11-14 05:32:57
would it have been the only mcu project to deal with the personal consequences of the blip,2022-11-11 21:28:12
namor vs the black panther would be a bigger rivalry,2022-11-22 23:13:16
this feels more real the movie would have been about tchalla talking about how his father was on one side and his uncle was another but since the conflict between them both was not resolved the conflict was passed down to tchala and njadaka he would teach his son about the conflict of war the good and bad of being isolated and the movie would be a fatherson bonding moment,2023-02-03 04:56:29
why would 5 years have been lost,2023-01-08 17:35:41
"mourning the 5 years lost of his early life

what 5 years lost",2022-11-12 06:43:31
wakanda civil war,2022-11-21 11:42:38
they made falcon the new captain america instead of bucky,2023-02-11 12:44:05
both her and okoye are honestly so much cooler than shuri i found myself a little bummed that she ultimately took up the mantle,2023-02-17 22:32:16
literally perfect,2022-11-30 03:58:41
she looked just incredible this movie,2022-11-19 05:54:43
late to the party but welcome friend,2022-11-24 17:16:32
i see why she made tchalla freeze,2022-11-15 04:35:52
i must be late because i never noticed it was like that before this movie whew,2022-11-17 03:42:30
girthy,2022-11-14 20:43:26
had the coolest outfits in the movie  solid set of arms and shoulders too haha,2022-12-01 07:17:57
"she is kenyanmexican so she definitely has the best of both worlds there

she is kenyanmexican only to the extent that she was born in mexico to kenyan parents her dad was a diplomat and also taught at a university there her genetics are 100 kenyan though",2023-03-04 22:59:08
"good thing they didnt scrub it out with cg like they did with tenochs junk 

",2022-11-18 10:23:19
in my theatre they kept the lights off during the credits so we all stayed put thinking it wasnt over yet then it really was over and the lights came up and it felt like wed gotten punked,2022-11-11 13:58:31
some girl was filming it in front of me there not being one when he was that prepped made it for me,2022-11-11 04:44:04
same in mine i still stayed i regret not staying in endgame because people said the same thing but there was an audio callback that isnt on the home version for some reason,2022-11-11 04:36:37
what kind of cleaning crew kicks people out like that ive stayed many times during the entire credits for non marvel movies and havent gotten an experience like that,2022-11-11 06:36:28
its standard in my city that if theres a credits scene the house lights stay down if there isnt they go up,2022-11-13 14:17:19
when i watched age of ultron after the initial extra scene me and my friend waited for anotherback then almost nobody knew of these nobody else was waiting and the staff said that there arent any more there were 2 more f that guyit wasnt even that late that they would be closing soon it was hours away,2022-11-28 19:00:22
,2022-11-13 03:10:02
"in my theater the cleaning crew came out and told everyone there’s no post credits scene and was trying to get everyone out and nobody wanted to leave lol

this is the next step in evolution of post credits scenes live theater cleaning scenes",2022-11-18 03:18:37
i stay till the end of the credits anyway,2022-11-11 16:49:32
 them  i wanna watch the entire movie i paid for,2022-11-11 08:09:11
we literally asked the cleaning crew ourselves they were like i wish other people would ask because the theater was still about half full when we walked out,2022-11-14 14:15:10
my friends refused to leave the theatre even after several of my friends and i told them there was only one they did not believe us lol,2022-11-26 04:19:53
thanks for the heads up,2022-11-11 04:29:16
also wouldve felt slightly off and in bad taste it felt right to leave the cinema thinking about chadwick not whatever new villain was joining the mcu,2022-11-13 20:50:32
whichever movie that came out before dr strange mom had the trailer for mom instead of an actual end credits scene,2022-11-14 04:05:53
 that wouldve ended me ,2022-11-13 04:57:56
"that was played premovie in my alamo there was no postcredit scene

the full alamo chadwick message was about no texting during the movie so im not sure what exactly  you saw",2022-11-13 05:13:13
"the mid credits scene is one that plays after the end title sequence usually stylized and credits the main cast and crew

the end credits scene is one that plays after the traditional end credits scrolling white text against a black screen",2022-11-11 13:37:20
found the theater worker,2022-11-11 17:44:53
"female black panther gets introduced to the nephew she did not know she had his father was the black panther who died so i guess that makes him the heir to the wakanda throne

sorry nobody found this question before me",2023-02-02 13:42:15
lol remember batman arkham knight ram them with the batmobile at 120 kmph but they are just unconscious because the batmobile has tasers at the front,2023-02-03 04:53:12
i overfed these men,2023-02-17 22:29:09
seriously just murdered so many people and its never addressed,2023-02-12 01:58:20
he’s pointing out they  people,2022-11-23 10:26:47
it reminded me of the  human predator iron man suit from the recent the predator movie,2022-11-11 05:50:13
that’s funny bc it reminded me of fish man from  boy n his land suit,2022-11-11 05:53:24
not avatar the way of water ,2022-11-11 06:47:12
all i could think of was the cyborgs from mortal kombat,2022-11-12 00:45:32
and shuri was so offended by her comments,2022-11-11 03:26:07
i thought of stargate,2022-11-11 12:51:25
should have got rid of the bubble eyes and made it more menacing,2022-11-11 21:20:03
the face made it look like a hightech dragon priest from skyrim,2022-11-12 15:16:13
"you need to rewatch predator 

looked more like a samus suit",2022-11-11 03:24:38
it reminded me of that hydra mutant in agents of shield,2022-11-13 18:52:14
i thought it looked like an overwatch skin,2022-11-18 08:02:10
honestly it was like a mix of sonic and predator,2022-11-20 03:41:35
felt like coogler was definitely making a point of saying how terrible they looked out of protest at having to include them in the film for presumably marketing  toysales purposes theyre the only element that doesnt really fit okoye never needed a suit to fight and their use in the big battle at the end could have been replaced with more from riri in her ironheart suit instead,2022-11-13 20:25:27
absolutely the blue suits were still kinda cool looking but ironhearts final suit looked like pure powerranger garbage,2022-11-13 11:01:42
i loved her original home made one and then hated her second mega man looking one i was happy they kept it from her at the end so she can have to rig together something heavy and  in that show shes in,2022-11-14 13:53:33
best fight scene of the film was between okoye and the big talocan guy on the bridge 1v1 with great choreography with minimal special effects,2022-11-12 22:39:57
"yeah same the early fights him were intoxicating

the final fight was similar to the first movie didn’t hit a sense of scale that would be fitting",2022-11-11 18:38:41
did we not establish in the first black panther movie that even those who comsume the heartshaped herb die when they are impaled shuri must have better plot armor than killmonger,2022-11-13 18:33:39
i mean i thought the dracarys was pretty neat,2022-11-13 14:18:44
that final fight was a crazy mess sloppy cgi and badly designed robot suits everywhere and narratively it just barely made sense really discounted the rest of the movie for me sadly because i was super enjoying it before that,2022-11-15 05:50:44
honestly when it was shuri vs namor it felt pretty good and appropriately brutal but then whenever it cut back to the stuff at sea it was just kind of your standard weightless cgi slopfest kind of wish the movie had just followed them to the desert and stayed there until he yields instead of cutting back and forth,2022-11-17 05:20:13
my jaw was dropped the whole time when he was kicking so much   he looked incredible,2022-11-14 06:39:05
have to remember that he was weakened in the ship as well,2022-11-15 06:56:07
final fight scenes cutting between both fights was a terrible mistake terrible viewing experience,2022-12-06 08:03:23
especially after eternals failed to make the flying guy rely on his flying advantage,2022-11-13 18:27:35
he was getting bodied and cut up,2022-11-21 14:41:51
people can now respect both namor and aqua man by making jokes about the deep,2022-11-11 18:21:44
except namor has a completely different aesthetic dude is a mayan warrior,2022-11-12 03:31:07
i always felt like aqua man was superman level when he was in the water,2022-11-11 20:08:06
or how well marvel executed instead of turning him into a  symbol they turned him into a badass with a cool  story behind him,2022-11-11 21:17:25
does namor talk to fish like aquaman  i know for the longest time that was aquamans defining traits and thats why he got clowned on so much,2022-11-11 22:24:11
nah aquaman talks to fish and swims fast namor is godlevel strong in water on land and in the air he beats about 75 of the marvel roster alone on those abilities but him being compared to hulk strength is unreal and shows how he doesnt compare to aquaman at all the deep on the other hand,2022-11-17 01:34:32
the wings are still lame to me lol,2022-11-11 16:00:22
honestly this has been a big issue for me between aquaman and namor basically the same yet aquaman is supposedly lame the earth is mostly water so aquaman and namor have a big advantage,2022-11-14 00:17:19
the wings broke me out of it completely like just make him fly not only does it look silly but theres no way in  those tiny  wings will lift an entire human body with like 5 body ,2022-11-12 20:37:13
diable jambe,2022-11-12 17:35:23
sky walk,2023-02-05 12:48:32
from his movie showings he can box with iron man and possibly hulk but i dont think he’s got a chance against the top tiers like scarlett witch and captain marvel,2022-11-13 06:28:16
she built it for mit cia took it without her knowing she never got a sample she had to figure out the properties of it or something  she explained it her dorm room,2022-11-14 09:30:35

if i was her why not threaten to up the plans to internet if you try to  me

end of movie makes a deadmans switch if you dont upload your password everday the plans go everywhere she had all the power

it was a dumb plot tbh",2022-11-13 20:36:04
" the scientist built a machine for the government

i could be wrong but i dont think they intended to do that they probably built it for a science project but then when the government found out that it worked they came in and confiscated it and classified it as a weapon of mass destruction",2022-11-13 21:27:20
how the  did namor even know a  thing about the machine other than that it existed are they tapping into the internet do the talokans have surface spies,2022-11-16 23:08:43
from the way i understood it she built it for a class project abd the professor gave it to the cia without her knowledge,2022-11-14 14:17:20
"what the  are you talking about riri made the machine for one of her college courses final project specifically because her professor said she couldnt and when she did successfully the government seized it

why does everyone on here lie to try and prove their false narratives",2022-11-13 16:34:50
can he do that now that his wing got ripped off,2022-12-01 04:11:16
i thought he was in the worst villian in the franchise i had to hide my eyes when he was on screen,2022-11-13 07:25:37
they cant  him hes marvel fans favorite  of an antihero that and hes literally one of marvels oldest comic book characters itd be like killing off marvel royalty,2022-11-12 06:57:00
namor predates the marvel universe no way they would treat him like a clist villain,2022-11-15 17:03:12
exactly my thought deadly hummingbird in all the good ways,2022-11-12 17:58:09
yeah we’re finally at a point where there’s enough heroes and villains to effectively rock paper scissors each other he was a real problem for the wakandansagainst a black panther type hero who is earthbound and only moderately super strong but someone like thorcaptain marvelstrange wouldn’t have a problem with him that being said his real power is his also super strong and durable army and their devotion to him we saw that even if he had been killed by shuri they would’ve overpowered the remaining wakandans,2022-11-13 01:50:19
iirc he gets a black suit in the comics that keeps him hydrated at all times he’d probably get one in future projects if they want to use namor more in other conflicts outside of coastal cities like the upcoming kang and secret wars movies,2022-11-13 20:33:53
"i like how you casually read potential spoilers

 in this thread without seeing the movie first  lol",2022-11-12 05:55:41
in the same fight in the comics namor beats bpshuri to nearly an inch of her life,2023-02-06 16:57:06
that would be a cool pizzle solving moment namir needs water but thor can lightning the water but would the light ing be strengthened by the water and fry namor or juice up the water which juices him up in a surprise buff,2022-11-16 15:29:16
eh comics gets weird he used to have electricity powers like the electric eel etc might have since been removed though since comics,2022-11-18 03:59:12
"riri is stark level genius and was given zealand a tech to build her suit i don’t see why her suit couldn’t go toe to toe here namor wasn’t a thanos level threat or anything here 

shuri’s suit sealed up and i imagine staunched the bleeding at the very least or included some sort of stabilizing or healing tech it’s not unbelievable to me at all 

i think shuri was great i have my beef with letitia and her antiscience issues during the pandemic but she did an admirable job i really enjoyed the movie and look forward to more of shuri in mcu",2022-11-13 05:27:12
yeah i called  on that too namor is all you cant win this fight and im like how do you know  they fought thanos army where the  were you guys lol,2022-11-12 17:55:26
and you can with the talokan virtual roller coaster coming to avengers campus at walt disneyland resort in 2026,2022-11-11 05:16:15
though i couldnt help but laugh at their kamehameha greeting,2022-11-11 04:43:09
all i thought were avatars especially in the beginning scene with the preview before was the new avatar movie,2022-11-19 05:45:38
he was captivating in every way and i walked out feeling like we only got a tiny understanding of his character and motivations,2022-11-11 05:02:29
this movie would have been improved by simply removing the cia subplot,2022-11-12 09:09:40
"you mean way more black panther yeah because you know i like seeing the main character of the movie in the movie is named after

bp only in 1 scene for about 15 minutes of a 25 hour movie",2022-11-13 16:50:40
cut out all the ironheart  cia stuff for more atlantistalokan and this is a much better movie imo,2022-11-13 00:46:57
i think the cia parts were fine it validates namors opinionshate on the outside world i think they couldve completely took ironhearts storyline out of this film,2022-11-14 16:43:11
i hated the  cia miniplot ross was nice to see again but them talking about destabilising wakanda was the dumbest  ive heard they wanna attempt to destabilise the most powerful nation on earth that also contributed the most to fighting off thanos good  luck,2022-11-15 10:03:36
it’s bp but when it announced they’re coming for the surface world i would have liked to have seen an avenger the winter soldier and rhodes pitch in it was almost like they were fighting on another dimension no one knew about,2022-11-11 21:17:47
the cia  never even mattered at all  i was hoping at the very least while the mexicans and wakandans were busy fighting each other wed find out that elaine stole a bunch of vibranium,2022-11-12 23:35:33
i thought the opposite the ciageopolitics was a more interesting conflict then namor who was just a generic take over the world villain,2022-11-26 15:12:28
100 he doesnt even feel like a villain imo he defended his country with violence the same way wakanda did killed civilians the same way wakanda did lol its a very good topic to discuss,2022-11-11 16:19:53

maybe it could be that he heard it and had it translated afterwards idk,2022-11-13 22:41:49
"his people mustve had contact with the spanish as we see them in the grips of a smallpox outbreak perhaps theyd had trade or diplomatic relations at the outset if he was curious about the language of the enemy outsiders perhaps he chose to learn it from an atlantean whod formerly acted as a spanish interpreter he wouldve had decades to learn this is pure speculation but its also possible there were a number of bilingual mestizo children who ended up taking the magic plant with their mayan mothers and ended up in takolan namor may have even grown up with them as his friends or mentors that would certainly make for an interesting ya spinoff

its also very possible that in the early years that homesick atlanteans made scouting trips on land and came to learn basic spanish  perhaps by taking spanish prisoners to get information or coming into sporadic contact with sympathetic surfacedwelling mayans who by that point had picked up spanish we do see nakia talking to a spanishspeaking mayan villager who clearly knows more than she lets on in the present day

or one of the freed slaves from the hacienda also witnessed everything and explained it to him later",2022-11-29 06:48:48
but theres never an explanation for why mutants have certain powers theres no explanation for why magneto can control metal or why cyclops has lasers shooting out of his eyes they are just born with it,2022-11-16 11:41:55

something about the kid taking off when he sees the spanish colonists just screamed scp foundation to me and i have no clue why,2022-12-14 13:23:31
they definitely cast kidnamor well for just a kid you could feel the anger as he ordered the destruction of that hacienda,2022-11-12 07:01:28
someone else in this thread mentioned the scp foundation and man  that shot of him suddenly taking off was uncanny in how it instantly made me think of scp stuff no idea why,2022-12-14 13:22:44
yep very reminiscent of sirens,2022-11-15 04:38:58
i think that was the bait and switch because for a second i thought they were going meta by referencing the score,2022-11-22 04:58:21

such a weird surprise i thought same that the comment would mean its getting changed or never used in the first place,2022-11-11 19:15:15
when she paused to ask something i think it was about another suit for the other warrior i thought she was at least going to ask if they could make it red or something,2022-11-19 03:55:41

right danai gurira is one of the best performers in the cast and her  expressions are always on point its a shame to hide her face,2022-11-11 03:56:44
" why would a filmmaker want to put her in a knock off hideous iron man suit

to please the people financing the movie and sell toys",2022-11-11 20:35:03
didnt she get pregnant during filming might have been a way to put a stunt woman in her place and use face capture,2022-11-11 13:21:51
i’m willing to bet it helped sell toys and that’s the only logic behind it,2022-11-11 20:13:55
the movie is based on a comicbook to which the suit derives,2022-11-12 20:22:08
so she could fight underwater and fly i didnt find it more effective than her normal fighting but this gives her a bit more of a superhero effect i think theyre leaning into the ensemble cast more since shuriletitia wright cant carry a film the same way tchallachadwick boseman could,2022-11-14 14:08:27
had the same thought ,2022-11-11 03:34:05
i think thats why i thought the suits were  awesome,2022-11-11 12:08:36
"yep power rangers came to mind it was comically bad 

the movie had a somber tone that i think worked for it in isolation it was good but not in my top 5 marvel movies by a long shot it felt like filler if i’m honest but quite a bit of it felt a slog and agreed with other redditors that the water battle scene was a headscratcher they made me think “with avatar way of water coming out in a month this was a choice”",2022-11-11 06:03:18

not to mention he told wakanda to get the scientist and then call him but when they actually get her he just attacks them without warning and didnt even let them try and do what he asked and then is surprised that their princess disappearing without explanation other then his statement makes them treat him like an enemy who the  wrote this namor was awesome but the entire plot was  it felt like they had a script chadwick boseman died and they went  well guess well just take him out and replace all his scenes with shuri i struggle to think of a single choice a character makes in the movie that actually made sense talokan and wakanda were antagonistic about everything for literally no reason as well,2022-11-28 06:52:53
right but ironheart made it as a class project or something at mit its a bit unbelievable that cia wouldnt bother to reverseengineer and save the build plans of that machine thats the whole point of the cia confiscating it,2022-11-13 19:45:11
"then why did he introduce himself by threatening the queen and princess youd think a 500 year old super human would know that thats a  move not to mention he doesnt even let them try to fulfill his demands he just attacks them this movies plot was basically just people making the most idiotic decision thats available constantly shuris decision to not  namor also had no reason really it basically was her mum telling her not to be an  and her suddenly remember her brief tour of talokan and somehow that made her pursue peace with a person who she intended to basically torture and suffocate to death sure that makes sense 

there were some fun moments in the movie and most of shuris emotional journey was pretty good but holy  was the plot a horrific mess",2022-11-28 07:02:58
an entity like the cia wouldnt just deploy the machine without knowing how to recreate it,2022-11-13 19:48:23
i think its funny and ironic he said she didnt fall flat as and names the wrong character because  all the ironheart and other suits and the character really fell flat for me,2022-11-17 05:33:37
idiot at my theater yelled wakanda during it,2022-11-11 20:03:29
"i don’t get the clapping in any context people clapped in my theater for every other scene in no way home and i kept missing what everyone was saying i straight up could not hear the dialogue between matt murdock and peter parker because idiots were cheering like i’m all for some excitement but the actors can’t hear you when you clap 

it’s honestly gotten to the point where i try not to go to marvel movies on weekends especially opening weekend i much prefer to see weekday matinees or wait for them to drop on disney",2022-11-14 16:40:23
 that is bittersweet reminds me of when nba honored terrence clarke at the draft after his death and his little brother was happily pointing at the screen saying thats terrence,2022-11-17 12:54:22

mbaku bailed wakanda out like three times he’s the better king seeing as wakanda is going to go back to isolation plus cuban guerrillas,2022-11-11 06:05:53
yea but that just adds to the confusion mbaku came to battle for the throne not for the black panther suit sodoesnt this mean tchallas dad should have fought too what about the queen did she have to beat someone up too,2022-11-14 04:10:46
this kind of makes me wish okoye became the black panther,2022-11-14 06:45:24
"he cant be bp he doesnt follow bast his  is hanuman the wakandans are made up of 6 tribes 4 of them were allied to the panther tribe while the jabari mbakus tribe refused to and lived in the mountains it looks like in bp2 that the jabari now have a semi allegiance to the panther tribe but all the tribes follow different gods  bast is even in thor love and thunder so each tribe is monotheistic  they dont believe in each others  they have their own singular  its not like the roman pantheon bast was the one who gave the vision to tchallas ancestor so they worship her as their  and since thor 4 its more than likely that bast wasnt just a vision but actually showed them where the herb was

but yea hed be a gorilla not a panther",2022-11-11 07:50:33
"the leftover purple liquid still in the bowl

can i have some of that stuff",2022-11-11 22:06:55
mbakus tribe has their own similar tradition they eat the flesh and bathe in the blood of a sacred white gorilla he gains super strength and all that,2022-11-12 06:22:17
black panthers  the next bp movie needs to be called black panthers,2022-11-11 06:58:14
my only concern is he wont have the star power to carry the franchise neither does leticia wright either especially without angela bassett if he takes over theyll probably be ensemble pieces or teamup movies from here on out,2022-11-14 19:56:15
hed be a black gorilla which unfortunately would be hella racist so wed be unlikely to see it,2022-11-12 23:39:47
a black panther suit with the fur ,2022-11-13 13:45:15
a big plot hole is that they can just print more not sure why they bother planting it other than for tradition,2022-11-11 06:31:58
or at least get an ape themed suit so hed stand more of a shot,2022-11-13 06:19:37
he’s supposed to eat a wakandan white gorilla and become manape,2022-11-19 05:02:56
the last few mcu movies were huge misses for me  black widow dr strange and thor especially  i know theyre planning on doing a young avengers so every tv show or movie has to have a super kid come out of it but theyre so obvious with it and its starting to annoy me  especially the end of the shehulk series where  hulk comes to the family reunion and is like oh by the way heres my son scar  bp2 was the first mcu movie in a while that i really enjoyed and the way they introduced this kid felt a little more organic because of the storyline with everyone being disappointed that nakia hasnt been around especially at tchallas funeral  she had a really good reason and it was a pretty nice reveal but damnit i have a feeling hes going to grow to be young avengers bp,2022-11-12 05:09:42
heir to the clan not the throne,2022-11-14 18:24:23
"that felt kind of cheap to me they made such a big deal about respecting chadwick too much to recast the character of tchalla and then in the first thing chadwick wouldve appeared in if he were still with us they just create a new tchalla to be king and black panther as a last second deus ex machina

reminds me of the scene in beerfest where a character dies and then his long lost twin brother shows up the next day and insists everyone treat him exactly like and call him the name of the guy who died",2022-11-14 12:43:33
no second person they are questioning if m’baku would take the herbs since he is king and people are clarifying that the bp and the ruler can be separate people ie m’baku would be king without taking the herbs,2022-11-11 12:58:36
"i think the point of the scene is to imply that the throne of wakanda is going to be left empty if shuri showed up shell have to take the throne too the throne and role of panther are separate ones and the warrior falls challenge is for the throne not who gets to be black panther shuri has decided to become the black panther for now but not claim the throne and she doesnt want to for good reasons too shes seen now that there is a part of her thats more like killmonger than her mother and brother she knows thats not good for her country also imagine how painful it is to step into her moms shoes so soon plus namor tried to make her queen its probably also a big fu to him to continue being a princess wakanda is ultimately ruled by its traditions without tech and the herb shuri wouldnt be able to hold her own anyways but it wouldnt do for the new panther icon tying everyone together to show weakness so soon 

so mbaku is covering for her mbaku is one of the strongest warriors but none of the elders will let a jabari winhave the throne thus the stalemate will actually give shuri time to figure things outor at least protect the throne for her nephew not like mbaku wants to rule wakanda either maybe if wakanda stayed closed off sure but after tchalla opened it up frankly no one wants to deal with this political nightmare",2022-11-13 05:11:16
nah disney is rolling in cash it’s because they want to have their cake and eat it too with riri’s origin story she has to be relatable and build the suit in a warehouse with a bunch of scraps during the ironheart show but also needs to be able to compete on bp and namor’s level for this movie,2022-11-26 00:12:44
disney has money  more like they’re lazy,2022-11-20 15:23:25
fr that suit looked like a power rangers suit and not in a good way,2022-11-12 03:39:15
i was waiting for them to mention vibranium at some point seemed like an easy explanation but it could just be that the wakandans dont want to help create a powerful weapon and send it out into the world,2022-12-30 14:23:00
"thank you i agree 100 no narrative arc whatsoever we dont even know who she is or what makes her tick the most we get is  
i got your car from the river  
cool that was apparently important to me i guess",2022-11-19 02:49:12
this a lot of narrative threads without real closure ironheart okoye’s banishment everett ross and it came at the cost of rushing main threads like shuri and namor you could tell this movie was written in difficult circumstances it didn’t really have focus,2022-11-22 02:29:35
"back in the day if u did a tv show called surf dracula youd see that fool surfing every week in new adventures but in the streaming era the entire 1st season gotta be a long  flashback to how he got the surfboard until you finally get to see him surf for 5 min in the finale

character growth is a costume change,2022-11-15 08:52:58
tbh it kinda make sense that underwater would be dark its also a nice touch when namor said he brought sun to his people,2022-11-11 15:59:28
dude the movie was so dark the worlds were so dull and uncolorful,2022-11-11 14:13:44
yeah it wasnt just me that thought the nightdeep sea scenes were too dark was it i kept wondering if there was something wrong with my cinemas screen or something,2022-11-11 12:07:21
my main thought watching that scene was the little mermaid is gonna look just as dark as this isnt it,2022-11-12 03:44:49
i actually thought the lighting was realistic and interesting i kept comparing it to the avatar the way of water trailer in my head avatars water looks very bright and sloshes all over the place namor looked deep and murky and oppressive,2022-11-15 06:04:28
the entire first half of the movie was really dark generally speaking when a cgi movie is dark like that it means theyre trying to save on the budget for this one its clear that theyre saving the cgi budget for the invasion and the final battle which were in day light,2022-11-12 06:27:39
he gave them the sun  what more do you want,2022-11-12 23:36:13
yeah its like they watched aquaman and said lets do the opposite of that,2022-11-12 02:06:35
the long night,2022-11-13 03:04:51

yeah i  cried too these were my people like you could see the smallpox on his mom,2022-11-11 23:50:41

there was also no structure just full 3d mass beautiful confusion",2022-11-12 04:04:25
this underwater civilization scene stuck w me more and felt more intimate and fleshed out than aquaman’s which just felt like a generic cgi underwater city this is coming from someone that liked aquaman a lot actually,2022-11-11 12:21:16
honestly it was better than aquaman for me in terms of the underwater people representation i love that the film kept a murky blurry look for the underwater scenes  it made it seem so otherworldly,2022-11-11 12:22:48
you cant make me,2022-11-11 09:14:06
im not remotely an aquaman fan but that movie made me feel the scale of that world in this it felt like tolakan had the population of an apartment building i expected something on par with wakanda this wasnt it,2022-11-16 22:31:20
"fair but it does seem like folks were late to the party 

its been ten years the wright brothers first flew in 1903 and eleven years later planes were dropping bombs on trenches all across europe 

the idea that the military would sleep on supers for a decade and then just send dudes with guns on critical missions is wild",2022-11-11 06:25:43
definitely a missed opportunity for them to throw in a wild card character who would do this sort of mission for hire but these are the small ways i hope super hero movies in general can evolve,2022-11-12 19:14:13
good they’re replacing “guys with guns” with “guys and girls with guns and ghost”,2022-11-14 17:24:02

"reminds me of this scene in infinity war bucky probably did more damage with one magazine than the wakandans managed via a volley

there’s great books about mayan stories this story was obviously changed to fit mcu but nice nonetheless,2022-11-11 06:06:12
it hasn’t aged the greatest but i recommend the film apocalypto,2022-11-11 18:46:14
as someone with a mayan name and mayan roots i was so pleasantly surprised to see this,2022-11-12 14:24:38
as a person with mayan blood i almost cried seeing him on screen,2022-11-11 06:15:04
yeah but whats with his spanishmexican accent and the songs in spanish they never lived amongst the spanish conquerors so would never have learned it they speak yucatan why would dongs sung in the language of the conquerors they hated be playing in their city,2022-12-10 07:44:02
same i cried seeing talokan,2022-11-11 23:43:06
atlantis as a concept has a lot of ties to white supremacy i loved bp1 for taking the atlantis concept and turning it on its head by placing it in africa full of africans then they did it again with making atlantis 2 a mayan city it was full of navi tho which is maybe problematic but they also made it quite clear they were once native mayans that whole part is beyond my pay grade,2022-11-15 01:16:39
i thought they killed it with how they switched dit up is this meso american origin comic based at all really impressive,2022-11-19 07:34:56

“my girlfriends call me ramon”,2022-11-11 05:58:52
anybody else notice how namor always pronounces it nahmor but the wakandans all called him naymor seems a little disrespectful it’s not that complicated of a name to get right,2022-11-11 06:19:48
"if namor had kids he would have added

but my enemies arent alive namor",2022-11-21 22:49:30
except the character is not supposed to be latino you know cause they left before the spanish came it was a really bad stretch to call him that i thought it was really bad,2022-11-13 13:15:59
same because the way he inflects it namór makes it rhyme with amór love i get why everybody else just calls him as naymor so it was nice to get this version spoken at least once in the movie,2022-11-24 06:48:37
hes the first mutant in the comics so that was pretty much a given he even stood besides the xmen during the avengers vs xmen standoff when the phoenix was approaching earth,2022-11-11 21:50:10
they also drop the m word in the final episode of ms marvel so the speculation is that yes now that they’re finally able to do some xmen material they’re incorporating that nomenclature more liberally,2022-11-15 03:45:29
this bothered me too these people have never heard of him he tells them his name is “nahmor” and they spend the rest of the movie calling him “naymor” in universe it just doesn’t make sense,2022-11-12 20:50:48
majority of the comic world before this movie said naymor with a few saying nahmor but thats also easily explainable in that different people and languages will pronounce the name differently the reason this movie has nahmor from namor himself is because he got the name from spanish conquistadors and the a in the name would definitely be pronounced ah instead of ay,2022-11-12 06:32:00
except namor is mayan tenochitlan is aztec and while the high points of each empire were different they were not exactly friendly to each other so a revival of tenochitlan underwater would not make sense,2022-11-13 17:57:33

i think its implied he learned about the meaning later,2022-11-13 21:13:00
"idk man i thought it was a clever way to still utilize the original name without altering it to fit a more mayanmesoamerican scheme 

plus it plays off the irony of a catholic priest believing only the other is evil and without love while being ignorantly blind to the same actions they did and were doing to the indigenous people i mean immediately in that scene they were whipping the indigenous who they used for  labor",2022-11-11 09:23:32

i like the scene when the camera panned out to wakandans being surrounded by talokans the talokans must feel so bad that theyre close to winning only for their king to lose cant wait to see more of it,2022-11-11 16:07:07
" in a conflict with a fully mobilized wakanda i cant see the talokans raw power defeat the wakandas technology

 besides the fact we literally saw that happen during the talokans attack on wakanda where they killed the queen and caused tons of damage

like we saw that namor made an underwater sun its not out of the realm of possibility that talokan has the potential to make some wmds as well",2022-11-11 16:00:32
"but at no point did i think that wakanda only had that one attack boat or that the soldiers on it constituted the entire wakandan armed forces in a conflict with a fully mobilized wakanda i cant see the talokans raw power defeat the wakandas technology

weve seen wakanda fight in what 4 movies now

its not particularly impressive even though we  keep hearing thats not their full power

that said the talokans arent that impressive either for being another hidden superkingdom so they probably would have lost if there were more wakandans",2022-11-12 21:08:48
"i think that was the plan but namora broke the thrusters

i get his motivations and namor literally killed the queen of wakanda in their home term but he really does look weak overall which makes sense since it wasn’t his movie like his people are strong they were winning but he lost and made them surrender because he was going to lose but his people were going to win he’s lucky his people call him a  and not a king because if it wasn’t for that i feel like they would’ve overthrown him for not being worthy",2022-11-11 18:51:44

he was great in this loved his line delivery also enjoyed him getting 1 shot by namor lol,2022-11-21 14:46:29
can you explain what him challenging for the throne in that last scene meant i just took it as a joke,2022-11-11 07:42:47
maybe but doesn’t he worship the ape ,2022-11-11 14:54:06
he should be the piccolo,2022-11-11 09:06:21

did he bring another wooden stick to the final fight on the wakandan ship it was like he never learned his lesson with the fight against namor,2022-11-12 04:27:10

should have stayed a villian from the first movie not been in this movie and show up as manape in final credit scene setting up bp 3",2022-11-12 18:09:21
agreed i thought he was excellent and i especially enjoyed his scenes with shuri that was the character elevation and evolution i wanted to see from him,2022-11-11 19:26:59
i’m pretty sure it means the m’baku will be king and shuri black panther as a member of the jabari sp tribe they don’t worship the panther  bast but they can still lead wakanda,2022-11-11 16:04:05
being the black panther and being the sovereign of wakanda are 2 different titles you can be both at the same time or only one tchalla was black panther when tchaka was king,2022-11-11 21:36:15
"namor as the major highlight and way too little m’baku were my major takeaways for the movie

" no one from wakanda or talokan offering a marriage proposal to unite the kingdoms felt off maybe its the house of the dragon fan in me but thats where my mind went to first when namor gave shuri his moms necklace

i felt this too i think maybe coogler didnt want to lean into it too hard for fear of backlash but there were definitely some tangible courting vibes during the time shuri spent in talokan",2022-11-11 13:55:29
that i can forgive with cinematic liberty and what not but to explicitly write that whole subplot about martin freeman finding shuri’s bracelet and all that back and forth with dreyfus was so unnecessary,2022-11-11 07:49:10
i genuinely thought they showed up because namor specifically warned them dont say my name to anyone outside wakanda and then they literally did exactly that,2022-11-11 11:38:41
why dont wakandans put some water barriers or keep scanning water to see if someone is coming when they know they come from water but then they are just above it and dont do much else and are surprised when invaded by water,2022-11-11 22:02:09
"marvel movies have to push the cinematic universe somehow this gave us more info on jld’s character her motivations and will now ready us for whatever is next with her

thats the biggest problem with marvel movies they don’t just tell stories they’re setups for 12 other projects that we won’t know about  for years and a lot of the time the additional story pieces hurt the main story or constrict the plot to just fit these certain ideas they need to get across to the audience",2022-11-12 00:44:03
didnt trust them so they followed the wakandans in case they found her,2022-11-14 18:22:33
"theyve had little to no actual contact with wakanda in the past and had pretty much every reason to expect them to demand something in exchange for the scientist once they found her so it makes sense to follow them until they reveal the scientists location and then use shock and awe to capture her yourself

that way there is no risk of the wakandans having the scientist develop the tech for them and further expose your home",2022-11-15 04:54:28
they showed up because they followetracked them to riri as a contingency in case they didnt  her since they didnt  her they attacked directly once everyone was out of the city and there were no witnesses around this is also why one of them goes to  the police that show up,2022-11-11 13:34:24
nah that part makes sense they were already almost caught by police making them even more ouf of reach from namor so its actually smart of them to try so swoop in and grab her while they had a good chance,2022-11-21 14:52:48
well it was clear that shuri and okoye were going to take her to wakanda and possibly protect her made more sense for them to grab her before they had to invade wakanda to do get her back,2022-11-12 07:30:57
for me the conch was definitely an unused checkovs gun,2022-11-13 05:58:52
i had no problem with it i assumed it was just namor going back on his word rather than working with the wakandans he was using them as bait to lure riri somewhere closer to his domain,2022-11-11 15:16:11

youre asking how the cia in a marvel movie bugged beads after all the tech  weve seen,2022-11-14 12:27:31
couldn’t the cia have had access to some tech like this before so they would already the hack ready just to implement in a new one,2022-11-12 04:20:42
all setup for the thunderbolts movie,2022-11-11 04:15:39
they put 30 minutes of a show about nothing in a feature film,2022-11-11 04:16:16
was literally only there to show the wakandans be willing to keep talakan secret,2022-11-11 04:38:29
yeah they kinda just stopped caring about riri being kidnapped lol,2022-11-12 02:14:34
nah she’s gonna use the thunderbolts to attack wakanda for vibranium and bucky will end up switching sides calling it now,2022-11-11 19:43:04
"if they werent there people would be talking about the plot holes in the movie instead of how out of place the cia plot felt

hard to not see them as watson and selena,2022-11-13 06:03:59
yeah i vaguely remember julias cameos from all the other shows but honestly have no idea who even,2022-11-11 06:28:47
correct their presence added nothing to the plot if there was one,2022-11-11 16:09:44

2001 was 141 minutes and it had a  intermission honestly just bring back intermissions if every movie is going over 2 hours now,2022-11-11 04:54:01
that’s a bug not a feature,2022-11-14 19:29:39
i don’t see how they couldn’t figure out the location of wakanda based on the battles in infinity war i’m sure some satalite would have monitored that space travel,2022-11-14 09:34:39
and if they adapted to the pressure and the depth of the sea then they would not need any kind of light at talokan and if shuris bones can get crushed underwater then their bones must be doing something at the surface as well this does not make as much sense as aquaman,2023-02-03 05:02:11

why didnt tony build armour for all the humans on the avengers to begin with,2022-11-11 07:48:56
yeah at the very least i wouldve liked if they found a way to differentiate it from iron man like maybe dont give it perfect flight abilities or something its literally just a wakanda themed iron man suit,2022-11-11 14:32:10
"why does everybody in this universe have an iron man suit now

because iron man left a huge impact upon the universe when tony stark died iron man didnt die with him that would have been  if it did

"well riri is literally the second iron man in the comics who similarly managed to recreate stark tech and here has an actual arc reactor in her suit 

the midnight angel suits i will grant are kinda goofy in general but their only relation to iron manstark is that starks superpower happened to be technology otherwise powered armor isnt exactly a novel concept for creating superhuman soldiers and shuri is not only as much of a genius as stark but also has access to vibranium",2022-11-11 16:28:18
they’re setting up armor wars and also because the proliferation of that technology has been a subject since iron man 1,2022-11-12 21:48:52
"is it weird that when she mentioned an exosuit i in no way pictured it flying

if it was a grounded combat enhancing suit thats what i was excited for 

then it started flying and i lost all interest in the suits",2022-11-24 01:13:42
youre probably not gonna like armor wars then,2022-11-11 05:13:17
i also dont like that whole nanotech looking effect on every suit i liked it better when it felt like actual moving parts with gears etc,2022-11-15 23:47:27
oh they are doing a film about exactly that called armour wars starring don cheadle and set to begin filming next year tying back to that line one from iron man 2 about how many years it would take for the rest of the world to develop the same iron man technology,2022-11-15 14:38:26
i had the exact same thought they even used the same face with a black background and armor ui sequence from tony,2022-11-16 05:26:13
yeah i really thought that okoye was just going to get like a black panther version of the suit not a  iron man suit,2022-11-21 06:08:33
yeah it just felt like a bad iron man movie to me and then towards the end it was oh yeah black panther is here too,2022-11-11 16:15:39
its litterally directly from the comics,2022-11-11 06:17:25
this is the plot to a new show called armor wars,2022-11-23 04:27:30
i mean does it matter now iron man is dead,2022-11-26 12:55:10

they seriously  up developing his motives he and his people are supposed to be this noble hidden world that care for themselves but in their opening scene they’re treated as nightmarish terrors straight out of an a24 movie that slaughter dozens of civilians without any attempt at diplomacy first also why is namor so obsessed with killing the scientist…when the cia already has the blueprints she created killing her won’t magically get rid of those blueprints or stop other scientists from creating new ones,2022-11-13 05:10:34
he wanted to build an unstoppable alliance with wakanda since they have a duopoly on vibranium other nations attacked wakanda because they were viewed as weak but with talokan nobody would challenge them together like they said the earth is mostly water so they could wage war on any country at any time and theyd been around for over a thousand years and nobody was able to locate their civilization so theyd be safe if the alliance were kept intact,2022-11-14 20:14:38

namor totally stole the whole movie for me his parts were the ones i found most interesting only rivaled by queen ramondas i wish he wore his headdress more cos he looked so cool in it,2022-11-12 15:37:35
he conveyed so much power and menace,2022-11-11 11:40:14
"agreed and thats terrible for a black panther movie

 if your movie is titled wakanda forever and the only interesting part of it is namor and his world thats not good",2022-11-12 15:09:34
i think namor and shuri truly bonded when she was kidnapped she understood his grief of losing a child at her hands  she understood why he retaliated by klling her mother they both would never retrieve what was lost either way so might as well get it over with,2022-11-12 00:38:56
"im surprised namor wasnt like oh my crew won this one we got this in the bag byyeeeeee and then jumped into the ocean to get some of his strength back and win the day

edit i cant stress enough how crazy it was that depowered weakened beef jerky crispy namor was a 5050 fight with fully powered fresh black panther by that logic shed be getting rag dolled if he was still fully powered",2022-11-11 14:38:26
most movies arent meant to be analyzed too deeply,2022-11-14 04:27:58
"this movie was the biggest piece of information in her character the fact that she’s the director of the cia 

we still don’t know why she wants a superhero team or why or contracts assassinations on people she’s just so confusing right now and it’s exhausting seeing her pop up constantly with barely anything being revealed",2022-11-11 17:50:15
this was the reveal shes the cia director,2022-11-14 03:49:33
agreed she kind of just showed up and is now just here being a villain not enough development she isnt a bruce banner or steve rogers where we can just assume some things,2022-11-11 12:47:02
holy  you are right i didnt know what that was until i looked it up and wow spot on,2022-11-12 16:50:11
"i just feel like we dont know her character or motivations she just popped up in the captain america show and is just now here maybe it is bad writing or bad timing 

also agreeing with most that the cia parts of this film are a waste of time and didnt mean much of anything",2022-11-11 12:50:22
thank you fixed,2022-11-11 12:44:41
"not an insult an observation that observation was helped by namors people speaking in that undulating synthetic voice that most power ranger baddies speak with

thank you for my first reward ever ",2022-11-11 12:43:18
true and it did not translate well to the big screen,2022-11-16 14:01:11
i whispered you son of a  to my buddy when that happened lol,2022-11-11 18:27:22
dude said “tribal council” like we’re in survivor or some ,2022-11-16 05:53:37
finally i was looking for this comment,2023-02-05 03:38:58
you son of a  im in,2023-02-05 03:39:14
i wouldnt be mad if it cut to predator for the close up,2022-11-12 11:10:44
 “go home and be a family man”,2022-11-14 10:01:09
basset is a legend for sure and shoutout gurira for holding her own in that scene,2022-11-11 04:41:45
"seriously when she got fired the reflex was what  no way  she didnt deserve that

then as the scene played out i was like ok fair maybe just be glad you didnt get executed",2022-11-16 22:53:56
rene russo angela bassett marisa tomei nervous for michelle pfeiffers fate in antman 3,2022-11-13 06:09:44
feels weird though maybe that was a holdover form the original script i think romonda’s death is done well but having that come in the same movie where not only a beloved character died but also an actual admired person it takes the weight out of it,2022-11-11 05:14:19
rené russo was my childhood crush,2022-11-12 21:26:43
"he told everett ross in a very funny moment  “one more word and i will feed you to my children  just kidding we are vegetarians”

i don’t remember him mentioning a wife though",2022-11-11 03:27:14
considering riri kinda swings that was a lil in the comics i caught it too,2022-11-11 23:41:28
namor was definitely pulling a “hey girl wanna see my crib” move and i was aok with it,2022-11-11 18:11:31
i got that vibe,2022-11-11 23:40:49
namor is a   in the comics after all,2022-11-12 07:19:49
i did not but my friend who i saw it with also mentioned this,2022-11-11 15:00:48
she is so petite  the suit really accentuates that,2022-11-11 21:39:39
i had this exact problem with the woman king where the lead girl looks  thirteen and the guy looks like he was jason momoas body double,2022-11-12 02:45:12
she wanted to save shuri and she couldn’t do that if she quit,2022-11-11 13:06:31
ramonda didn’t forget that okoye stood by killmonger and she made her pay for it  still justified though  you don’t assure the queen that you will protect her last remaining child and then come home without her,2022-11-14 04:32:04
i’d just like to see life from the citizens’ pov a bit more,2022-11-14 02:39:19
its setting up wakanda being attacked by other nations,2022-11-11 16:05:59
thank  thats not what happened i dont need a bvs situation ever again,2022-11-11 08:13:39
it’s a common trope that if a character who normally doesn’t get a lot of screen time suddenly gets a lot of it there’s a reason why showcasing the character so that the audience is more affected by their death,2022-11-14 20:53:13
i got both vibes from namor and riri lol,2022-11-11 23:41:54
yes,2022-11-11 23:41:31
ayo replaced her in rank at least  she had on a gold collar at the end,2022-11-12 00:08:17
shuri isnt 29,2022-11-11 05:07:20
in terms of a tribute film for chadwick this was a very great job by coogler and everyone you could see there was real heart put into this and i’m sure this was a good way to help them grieve the loss of their close friend,2022-11-11 04:32:15
they left it on for stan leeswonder why they decided for this change  heck even the funeral in the movie is musical,2022-11-11 19:14:46
i love it,2022-11-11 11:05:31
i saw it at a drafthouse too  that message got applause from my crowd,2022-11-11 13:50:36
i saw this today at alamo s lamar and got the same thing i cried at the beginning and ending of the movie,2022-11-12 05:16:32
it was on the disney version the first time i watched it on there but when i rewatched the first one last night it was gone,2022-11-12 00:16:06
mine as well that was powerful,2022-11-11 13:33:04
and just the sound of the wind really tied in so beautifully with the ending,2022-11-11 08:03:57
it was me lol,2022-11-11 03:11:50
"same heard more than a few sniffles during that marvel logo

very beautiful",2022-11-11 03:56:12
that seems pretty annoying tbh,2022-11-11 06:51:32
ah sorry that was me,2022-11-11 04:32:43
that lady was me,2022-11-18 01:15:03
the person next to me did a wakanda salute right after opening credits,2022-11-11 04:06:52
saw it today and was definitely crying the entire film but the final scene on the beach had me openly weeping sniffling quivering lip i was inconsolable lol,2022-11-15 21:51:52
my wife and i had four or five boys in front of us and they loudly talked through about half the movie including this tribute before the man next to them finally told them to shut up they were also on their phones with full brightness and kept punching each other i dont know even know why they were there it didnt seem like they were interested in the movie,2022-11-12 00:19:40
the ending was beautiful too,2022-11-11 20:46:04
yeah i would’ve rather had a weaker villain and focus more on the emotional aspects of her becoming black panther it kind of all took away from what should’ve been a really triumphant moment in the movie,2022-11-13 07:00:18
didn’t know martin short was in this,2022-11-12 12:31:56
totally isn’t his ex wife the one managing the anti avengers,2022-11-13 06:23:58
its his catchphrase from the comics,2022-11-11 05:49:48
its a totally out of place reference from the comics but it literally makes zero sense with this interpretation,2022-11-13 06:53:35
yeah i didnt get that eitehr,2022-11-11 23:02:52
i thought he was going to summon an ancient aztec demon,2022-11-23 04:34:48
he was walking towards water and he passed by the exploded ships thruster  black panther blocked his path and activated the ships thruster remotely burning namor lol this will never be not funny from behind,2022-11-11 09:40:01
"because he’s not that in the comics and it’s a reference to the comics

it’s goofy but fans of the source material love that ",2022-11-27 05:41:40
its namors battle cryanother name for him,2022-11-11 06:06:49
its just a thing the character says a lot in the comics its kind of a meme by this point,2022-11-11 06:00:40
"nothing to explain its something the characger says that makes marvel people go yooooooo this is so  badass

good luck trying to explain why underwater mexicans speak latin",2022-11-11 05:59:26
"i think at least for me the issue with phase 4 is that there is so much going on and it feels like its going no where 

they busted their load far too early with loki and introducing a collapsing multiverse such a major event should have had lasting consequences but instead we got a show about a teen girl and a hulk lawyer all while apparently theres multiple multiverse destroying occurrences and a freaking eternal in the pacific ocean which based on its size would probably have some major impacts on the planet

oh yeah there was also an egyptian  stripping peoples souls away

all the while we have some form of the avengers parading around

it all just feels convoluted i know not every movie needs to push the phase forward in a major direction theres no clear setting for anything and nothing has happened",2022-11-12 18:57:14
" the quality of marvel has dropped significantly since endgame

thats because theres no longer any kind of overarching end point to these movies anymore  the first few phases were all about building up to a confrontation with thanos",2022-11-28 19:37:28
"im really hoping that now weve got through the last of the lock down impacted films we can see the quality come back  like i dont think p4 is bad and frankly i quite like most of the films but man it does feel like that marvels cgi end punchup is possibly exacerbated by covid meaning a big cgi fest is easier than anything tangible

at least the shurinamor fight wasnt as much of a mess as shang chis",2022-11-14 00:49:29
yeah i don’t understand all these comments saying the movie was intoxicatingly amazingbadass i thought it was a mess with some thoughtful scenes around grief but the plot was a mess compared to what used to be mcu’s standard,2022-11-12 06:26:41
actually yes i forgot about loki the only show that was actually good,2022-11-12 05:12:36
theyve broken love for the mcu,2022-11-15 02:20:56
hearing that dialect of mayan was awesome i dont know how accurate it is but it sounded really cool,2022-11-12 06:35:33
"  i think they could have chopped 30 min off

aka the entire cia plot",2022-11-12 21:23:34
take that 30 min and tack it onto thor 3 for some godbutchering scenes,2022-11-13 11:04:05
alright bro you cant justify an overstuffed runtime with grieving is long and messy and sometimes aimless that cia iron heart stuff was just set up for future movies and wasnt at all supposed to be representative of grieving youre are pretty much saying the pacing was bad on purpose,2022-11-12 17:15:04
it was shuri,2022-11-11 04:13:33
yeah i think i was a bit harsh here i think the movie overall did good at what i was hoping it would pull off,2022-11-13 03:44:56
i agree with this the movie was about gried and how to move forward with it but people just keep  about  suits and ,2022-11-13 10:45:59
"could also be the format you watched it in in dolby cinema or any dual projector setup you cant exactly line up two projectors that are side by side the middle can be quite easy but it blurs more the further you get from the center of the two lined up images 

source projection engineer for 8 years",2022-11-12 18:37:24
definitely noticed this in shots of wakanda the skyline was just blurry maybe to hide unfinished cgi,2022-11-13 12:09:12
this happened at my cinema too  the funeral scene made the city skyline so blurred,2022-11-14 09:31:27
yea the depth of field was pretty narrow  is that the right nomenclature,2022-11-16 03:44:13
it was done deliberately to convey a sense of loss often after a big loss people’s perspective on the world changes and can be disorienting so that’s where it comes from,2022-11-21 16:52:35
i have an easier time telling what is going on in aliens than most modern movies and it was supposed to be dark and creepy,2022-11-13 08:47:21
yeah exactly i couldn’t see anything underwater,2022-11-13 07:00:03
i saw it in imax laser and it was dark as  so i can only imagine what it looks like on a standard screen,2022-11-11 22:10:31
oof yeah 3d makes everything darker so i can imagine if mine was bad yours was worse,2022-11-12 04:50:56
no one ever faces consequences in these things,2022-11-11 03:37:16
i for sure thought okoye or shuri were gonna say “well you deff need to come to wakanda now …”,2022-11-11 10:44:32
same i thought “oh cool action sequence wait did riri just  a bunch of cops”,2022-11-15 06:18:41
attuma’s design was insanely cool and his bridge fight with okoye was one of the highlights of the movie for me i’m already dreaming of a namor solo movie with him as the villain,2022-11-11 09:27:34
whats happening in a month or so,2022-11-11 05:19:19
its just been revoked,2022-11-13 16:57:51
shuri said acab,2022-11-11 04:45:38
" so how do they control the whales again

they pay them orcas are some of the best mercenaries on the planet",2022-11-11 17:09:05
they probably train them i imagine its how we train horses and even whalesdolphins here but probably with more respect and understanding for that latter,2022-11-11 09:12:16
"the only cops you see or heavily implied die are killed by the telokans on the bridge the police cars okoye and shuri flip do not result in deaths because in movies a vehicle getting flipped and pancaking another car is survivable

the only trouble i saw was riri destroying the drone that was us military hardware with a hefty price tag and riri does not have tony stark funds now maybe shuri paid the fine or val waved the whole situation away  those boston pds families i guess but i would think someone would come looking for the person who broke their multi million dollar toy",2022-11-11 11:27:32
the wakandans plus riri were literally also following orders too lol if you judge judge equally,2022-11-11 09:17:53
because they wouldnt  a scientist or help conquer the surface world,2022-11-11 03:13:17
riri blasting feds on sight instantly sold me,2022-11-16 15:18:27
"i think they got up also

but like how do they climb the side of the ship what are the limits of the siren power bc that’s op as ",2022-11-11 18:44:05
when the people first ate the herb i think it was passed down genetically or they just have the warriors drink it,2022-11-12 14:44:05
i dunno vibranium is an mcu mcguffin also wakanda is more technologically advanced than anyone else and even in the last battle they didn’t exactly have a great way of killing them…,2022-11-12 01:30:35
the talokan are like superhuman navy seals  that can deploy undetected anywhere thats near a body of water and   up if they learn enough about the surface world it wouldnt be too difficult for them to destabilize countries,2022-11-20 13:35:51
"i pretty much agree with all points like you said the mcu has magic and gods but i can only suspend my disbelief so much in order to believe those little pigeon wings are allowing him to move that fast and that agile like i absolutely loved the way he moved and fought it was badass but if he doesn’t have some sort of magic helping him then i don’t get how those wings work

i also noticed them climbing up that ship like spidermen but i just thought they were maybe puncturing in enough to get a hold

that said i enjoyed the movie a lot",2022-11-19 04:11:08
watching wakanda after avatar must have been the most depressingly mediocre experience ever,2022-12-31 17:01:25
yeah i thought this was obvious and the wakandans need in an inside man since it isn’t only namor’s people that have eyes on them it would’ve been weird if e ross didn’t have any contact,2022-11-11 14:24:18
makes them seem noble but makes freeman’s character look like a trump giving so much with nothing in return also keeps wakandas political stance on the forefront and reminds everyone they have no allies,2022-11-11 18:56:12
that could have been a scene,2022-11-14 05:30:24
that takes 30 seconds tho,2022-12-04 16:15:21
as others have joked about  probably be the face of the chinese marketing,2022-11-11 14:38:33
"he told the wakandans about riri williams 

he should have just left after that",2022-11-11 11:41:07
"  it makes no sense why he’s in it

they needed their tolkien white guy

jokes aside i think it would have been a better fit if he just had a 30 second cameo where he gave them some info and then was never seen again",2022-11-11 16:56:14
exactly riri and martin are in this movie solely to set up other ,2022-11-11 06:04:28
well he is the token white guy of the franchise but they could of done something to make his character contribute to the main story and plot because what his character does contribute in this movie is unneeded like i’m sure they could of found riri very easily without his help and if they really did need his help ok fine but that’s where all his scenes should of ended every scene onward with his character in it was just blatant set up for thunderbolts,2022-11-11 04:06:31
to set her up as a bad guy later on,2022-11-11 06:05:01
"this was so  funny

honestly i dont mind ross hes the marvel comic relief character for black panther and hes great to watch",2022-11-12 15:51:15
 you felt robbed  come on now  being a little dramatic aren’t you,2022-11-12 14:15:19
that’s my big problem with the mcu right now their plans for the future always infect every film whether it fits or not,2022-11-11 11:47:58
it’ll probably take until the next big event comic that they can do it but tbh yeah the character would be all the better for it there’s only so much ground you can cover with atlantean namor  i don’t even think he’s had a solo title in years but mayan namor has new possibilities to explore,2022-11-12 06:51:59
completely erased all the character development peter quill had made over the decades to turn him into chris pratt,2022-11-14 17:47:11
"given ryan cooglers worldview i would imagine that in the absence of disney interference we would be seeing a whole lot more explicit panafricanism in wakandan foreign relations 

i cannot imagine that the existence of wakanda becoming common knowledge wouldnt jumpstart panafrican movements across the continent it would be contentious and immediately fracture among monarchistsocialist lines but it would be fascinating to see",2022-11-16 20:03:13
that was me and my friends takeaway we just want a movie on him and his people,2022-11-12 08:44:55
maybe they gave out some more herbs to others along the way,2022-11-23 21:05:16
"bro what weird to go look at my other comments but ok when namor first pops up out of the water and demands they hunt down riri they know nothing about him or his people he’s telling them to go kidnap an american scientist for him so he can  them and when said scientist is killed wakanda is the one that will take the rap since no one knows anything about  namor and his guys so going off what they know it looks like a setup of course namor then shares the story of his people with shuri but by then the ball is already in motion not to mention while i find him sympathetic the ultimate offer to be the only nation not destroyed by namor and hope he doesn’t decide to destroy yours too isn’t a particularly great one

edit ignore this comment there was a guy who i had a polite disagreement with and he proceeded to mildly stalk me ",2022-11-11 16:19:51
ironheart looked ripped out of a cheap 60s anime,2022-11-11 03:25:20
it looked more like plastic than metal one of the issues with making something pristine and brand new is it lacks the little human details like scratches and dents etc add the fact its only ever shown in very bright natural light and you got a recipe for bad cg,2022-11-11 20:40:11
what happened to that thick steel she was icycutting a heart out of because i don’t think it was used in that suit,2022-11-11 12:38:41
midnight angels looked like the hellboy fish guy,2022-11-12 04:21:01
honestly the ironheart suit felt more real than every iron man suit there was just a plasticky vibe to it,2022-11-11 14:09:47
i got gundam vibesinfluence from ironheart’s suit,2022-11-11 13:50:26
the final act occurs under direct sunlight everything looked pretty bare,2022-11-12 02:18:34
it kinda had a plasticy feel to me it needed that brushed metal texture that you could slightly see on ironmans suit,2022-11-15 23:49:07
incredibly bulky compared to the iron man suits very power ranger,2023-02-11 09:04:51
tbh they were never gonna match the coolness of the iron man or war machine suits that being said they definitely could’ve done much better than what we got that’s forsure,2022-11-11 04:11:41
the suit was great the heart shape thrusters even better what i think threw off the suit for everyone is the helmet it has zero human features beside the eyes it is just a blank sheet of metal iron man at least had a mouth cheeks and jawlines which clearly defined a human head this just look like a motorcycle  helmet or a robot the whole time i was thinking eve from walle,2022-11-11 19:03:24
" nearly every iron man armor looked so sick

and why is that stan winston designed the movie versions of the suits stan winston died so someone nowhere near as talented as him designed this",2022-11-11 07:40:15
because its an adaptation of her new suit from the comics which already looks like something from ben 10,2022-11-11 20:18:58
the nano ones looked like cheap cgi the iron man 1  2 suits looked clean however,2022-11-12 21:47:26
it was the bright primary colours that made them look tacky very few textures and scratches simple shapes it didn’t looked lived in,2022-11-13 07:10:59
"shes not tony stark though i thought she looked fine

the blue  tho is ",2022-11-15 03:23:13
also the design being a literal heart is fun,2022-11-11 04:33:45
it looked like  ,2022-11-13 08:10:21
i thought the ironheart suit looked fine at first but when the midnight angel suits came out it somehow retroactively made the ironheart suit worse like having it switch up between ironheart and the angels fighting made it so much more apparent how bad both of them were,2022-11-13 06:21:14
looks revolting either way,2022-11-16 10:13:37
well yeah they paid for a big  green screen and somebody’s gotta use it,2022-11-11 05:20:30
once shuri captured namor and they pulled the dora back onto the deck i honestly kept waiting for them to electrify the sides or something to get rid of the talokan attackers like captain nemo did with the nautilus in 20000 leagues or maybe i’ve just seen that movie too many times ,2022-11-11 09:32:20
wakanda tech seemed absolutely inept in this movie compared to prior ones,2022-11-11 19:20:38
its hilarious that a nation going to war has only one ship,2022-11-11 17:04:38
wakanda always seems to get its  kicked weird for the most powerful country in the world,2022-11-11 05:35:29
i think if a hyper intelligent space raccoon with a spaceship capable of ftl travel prefers weapons that shoot projectiles over hand to hand combat you need to reevaluate your cultures methods of warfare,2022-11-11 18:42:58
absolutely nothing about the talokan people gave me any impression they could actually mount any kind of real attack on the surface at all they apparently plan to invade the whole world with just a city worth of really strong dudes with spears and water grenades,2022-11-16 04:56:23
"we im guessing the wakandans dont exactly like having to sit inside the hull of a ship for long periods of time

 i could be wrong",2022-11-12 03:03:49
"plus he says  bring his whole army and conquer the earth and theres what 100 people tops between the two sides   


im pretty sure that 8 billion earthlings with earth tech plus the avengers etc could take out namor and 50 of his homies",2022-11-21 03:07:04
"the hand to hand thing is just a comic book trope i feel the super advanced asgardians and super advanced asian village guardians from shangchi also use hand to hand despite apparently looking down on actual normal human civilization as primitive 

basically it’s all rule of cool sword fights looker cooler than two people trying to dodge bullets i mean matrix pulled it off but it only works for small bits which also looks cooler than actual modern large scale combat which is computer systems engaging and blowing things up beyond a scale humans can easily perceive",2022-11-26 08:48:07
"no  it was all hand to hand combat at the end  the two nations did their best to even the odds wakandans drew them out away from the city used ear plugs to counter their siren call sonic emitter to get them on land and pulled namor from the fight talokans were baited into a trap so they focused on grounding all aerial attacks and overwhelming them on the ship with numbers and bullrushed it til they dominated at the end


y’all just love to hate for no reason ",2022-11-11 09:04:55
"there were some weird loose ends felt like they were building to a wakanda  talokan vs the us military and maybe a cameo avenger it also felt like there was some initial romantic tension between shuri and namor that they abandoned 

my guess is that there was originally a shurinamor romance angle that had to be rewritten with the death of boseman and then they just turned it into a classic hero vs villain thing",2022-11-11 04:48:38
a full scale war between two civilizations took place on one ship in the middle of the ocean,2022-11-12 04:32:37
"totally agree i think there shouldnt have been a break after namor attacked wakanda it should have led directly into the final conflict that break and montage sequence dragged for me and the momentum of the queens death was lost

i dont think it would be hard to do shuri tried to print the heart shaped herb in the opening sequence she could have made the change on the fly taken it as wakanda is being attacked confirmed her mothers death in the spirit realm and then led straight into the final fight",2022-11-12 21:38:01
disagree loved the third act i thought it was bad  and loved seeing shuri go toe to toe with namor,2022-11-13 04:20:33
same and i definitely agree on the second half on top of that i was borderline rooting for namor during that fight as well as she was going full killmonger at that point,2022-11-11 13:59:36
"i should know what to expect

i mean yes but you shouldnt necessarily accept it because of that

marvel used to do story telling much more consistently and theyve lost that magic somewhere after the final avengers movie

x200b

film would resolve itself in a different way

i too was waiting for a bait and switch on the expected resolution but it never happened and left me pretty disappointed tbh",2022-11-11 22:03:24
civil war was great it was small in scale but large in impact no matter what a hero loses and really both lose in the end,2022-11-13 03:46:24
the shot of the dora milaje jumping off the side did look incredible,2022-11-11 04:21:45
yeah on the deck was meh but the side climb was dope,2022-11-11 23:38:35
game of thrones did it 8 years ago,2022-11-19 20:45:48
"i think the style of meta humor in shows like shehulk rick  morty deadpool etc have gotten ridiculously old to the point anyone who is still doing it is more annoying then clever

shehulk and rick  morty are often guilty of using meta to make fun of certain tropes but then do the same exact thing they are making fun of the shehulk finale is just marvel doing that on an even bigger scale since they pretty much just continue to do a lot of the same  they are criticize for including in this movie",2022-11-11 08:29:41
"nearing the end of the last episode things start to quickly turn into a generic big fight the bad guy used her stolen blood to turn himself into a hulk emile blonsky turns into abomination and then bruce banner bursts in as hulk as well and then its briefly turns into chaos until jennifer shehulk stops everything and looks at the camera in disgust
and asks if this is actually what we really want for an ending

then it stops and the disney plus menu opens up you can hear her talking and she busts out of the panel like she does in the comics and finds another panel to go on which is a mcu behind the scenes documentary and she ends up on the disney campus she find the actual writers of the show and confronts them how lazy it is and then goes to confront kevin feige who turns out to be an advanced ai who programs everything in the mcu think the architect in the matrix she then tells him how derivative and generic of an ending it is and finally convinces him to change it to a more grounded and satisfying ending 

extremely meta and really well made",2023-02-01 20:47:24
wakanda constantly being called a super power and having horrible tactics and strategy and maybe like 2300 people on screen,2022-11-12 22:05:05
huge phantom menace vibes,2022-11-11 17:21:47
"yeah every action scene was straight up bad literally nothing that made me go huh okay that was coolfun even the worst mcu movies have at least one or two action scenes that i enjoy but this one just so bad the cgi was dodgy characters movement felt unrealistic and ungrounded the editing was so bad the final fight set piece was just a giant metal box in the ocean really like you had so much you could have done and thats what you chose

edit bridge fight was decent i wasnt bored to tears or confused by the editing so theres that",2022-11-11 18:22:24
i dont think he told his mom i think it is implied that nakia told ramonda when she visited haiti,2022-11-12 15:15:54
i know the way the movie was set up she couldnt be but i wish they had decided it before getting to that point so they could write the script around it,2022-11-12 23:43:13
im even more disappointed now that i heard they digitally reduced his bulge,2022-12-05 01:17:00
in the comics he had some horn that summoned sea monsters to attack the land but that was short lived 60’s fantastic four type stuff,2022-11-15 00:12:10
i can agree but as an overall film it was pretty bad and cringe,2022-11-11 13:42:12
my only issue is that this setup should be done much much earlier in the film than the pre climax,2022-11-11 08:46:56
its her subconscious mind giving her reverse psychology treatment flawless both times,2022-11-14 17:05:14
from wolverines blood so from another mutant,2022-11-14 04:09:03
they told us that by keeping letitia in the lead and keeping her in a prominent role for future movies,2022-11-11 04:15:32
they couldnt track her on land not to mention that  clad waterbreathing mayans would probably attract some attention,2022-11-14 16:23:02
who amongst our heroic wakandans do you expect to  a teenage girl in their custody,2022-11-11 19:43:25
i think they learned from what happened to killmonger and decided it wasnt worth killing a child prodigy lots of parallels with shuri who didnt even intend on harming them or aiding enemies killmonger mentions that when she sees him after drinking the purple leaf,2022-11-12 00:47:47
"the movie and coogler makes it clear  

it’s not only in namors nature to not trust the outside world but also wakanda’s that’s what makes this war even plausible if wakandanamor would have been open to trusting each other at first this movie essentially doesn’t exist",2022-11-12 01:03:22
wakanda had no idea who namor is how he got vibranium and what his people were capable of so they thought it was a safe bet to honor his agreement they didn’t know that he’d backstab them,2022-11-12 06:53:20
its said in the film that his staff is full pure vibranium and that it had the potential to do catastrophic damage to her ship when she was drying him out i think the suit is infused with vibranium but it isnt pure vibranium so it could be sliced through by pure vibranium i could be wrong though,2022-11-14 18:37:55
i believe because namors staff was so pure vibranium but your make a good point it still feels nerfed like i thought that stuff would still bounce off each other,2022-11-13 16:38:04
if she was in dark avengers then it would’ve been sick,2022-12-31 16:01:51
"this is different
1 shuri wanted to  him specifically for vengeance it isnt a killing is wrong moral its a being consumed by vengeance is wrong moral 

2 his death wouldve caused great political change maybe a never ending war his life shouldve been treated differently to footsoldiers where sparing them wont make a big difference",2022-11-28 01:22:44
the whole soundtrack was amazing i was constantly surprised by the unique sound palletes they were putting out there,2022-11-11 11:16:47
,2022-11-11 16:14:45
yesss thank you so much i only saw the soundtrack before but guess they released the score today ,2022-11-11 15:24:47
it was maybe the best original soundtrack i’ve heard for mcu at least the way it’s used is incredible,2022-11-14 06:21:38
there are 2 songs that caught my attention but i dont know their names one was from the scene where shuri and riri are working in the lab in wakanda the other was later in the movie but i dont remember the exact scene,2022-11-14 05:34:55
thunderbolts,2022-11-11 04:30:08
i wouldnt be surprised if someone at disney was just afraid to release a movie with no white people in it,2022-11-11 05:46:46
then do that in its own movie not by making another one longer,2022-11-11 05:13:25
correct,2022-11-11 13:10:49
they should make a sitcom about a divorced husband and wife couple but now the wife is the exhusbands boss  i’d watch the  out of that,2022-11-12 04:35:45
im actually hella stoked for rogue ross,2022-11-13 23:22:04
"that is the reason i came here to vent

marvel is losing me hard  im literally only sticking around for gotg3 and im out

i felt like i was seeing 90 minutes of a great movie with another  90 minutes of ads for sequels dragging it down

this movie did not need to be almost three hours long  and you could tell the parts that were tacked on to sell future movies",2022-11-11 07:23:54
thor had the same issues as this  feels like studio input instead of letting the creative process do their thing,2022-11-11 07:26:30
most of their scenes couldve been condensed into a postcredits bit,2022-11-13 02:31:40
im nigerian and we call the not so nice of the yoruba tribe yoruba demon  as an insultjoke it was hilarious hearing that my theater erupted with laughter,2022-11-11 15:31:20
they way he said “demon” transported me back to how my uncles they’re west african speaks  the flashbacks it was so on point ,2022-11-11 14:26:37
i had a pretty black theater place was uproarious with laughter at that line,2022-11-11 03:57:01
you leave my generals name out yo  mouth,2022-11-11 13:31:01
that kind of  can get you slapped depending on what award show you say it at,2022-11-11 05:18:12
character was great the suit didnt look good to me though it seemed plastic,2022-11-11 05:32:59
armor wars is gonna be a movie though,2022-11-11 13:31:49
i remember seeing that scene in one of the promos and it made me go see the movie in theaters felt like the humor overall in bp2 was better handled than the constant jokes from  do enjoy tikas brand of humor but love and thunder just smashes you over the head with it relentlessly namely the screaming goats,2022-11-13 02:04:22
"this is currently 2 people with iron man suits and 2 people with kinda similar exosuits not that big a deal

armor wars as a storyline is famously not about how cool it is for everyone to have iron man tech so again not a huge problem",2022-11-11 19:40:17
im just amazed namor didnt grab shuri and plunge her into the deepest part of the ocean as soon as they crashed into the desert he flies by her knocking her back with force why not just grab her,2022-11-18 12:29:29
i saw something online about it ,2022-11-11 22:58:01
yeah but wakanda forever is a 250 million dollar movie so not very unfair i felt that the action scenes and the cgi was not at par even with some other marvel movies however ryan coogler gets the core emotion of the story right and the acting is good which makes it a pretty good movie regardless,2022-11-12 15:10:18
" avatar has some of the best vfx of all time

looks terrible to me if this looks worse thats really damning",2022-11-11 18:09:42
the mouse owns avatar too ,2022-11-13 19:13:01
"the cgi in both was a bit meh the avatar trailer looked like a video game trailer  

and if cameron had artistic integrity he would spend more than 30 minutes on the script",2022-11-13 15:02:29
avatar 2 is ultimately a disney movie so the mouse still gets his cut,2022-11-11 17:54:52
not disagreeing with you on the disney part but avatar 1 is actual   it’s just another version of pocahontas with cameron stroking his  all over it,2022-11-11 09:41:00
"antman seems like its a distinct enough style that i didnt really notice or mind theres some fun design there that i think looks good even if its not cutting edge

the biggest issue with wf is that its literally another movie about an underwater kingdom of blue natives hard not to make very direct comparisons",2022-11-12 03:02:46
the budget for both the films is almost the same though,2022-11-11 08:57:24
they werent working on it for 13 years lol james cameron waited 13 years for the tech to get to the place he wanted it,2022-11-12 01:39:23
meanwhile not at all surprising that a disney mcu movie looks cheap and from a sweatshop factory theyve just earned this reputation and arent shaking it anytime soon,2022-11-11 08:22:37
it broke new ground,2022-11-13 00:32:05
i do love the idea of cameron having so much pull that they hand out 3d glasses just for one trailer before a 2d movie,2022-11-12 15:39:42
the location is a moon 4 lightyears away from earth so that explains it they must have had a huge budget to get over there,2022-11-27 15:01:49
sucks to not have taste i guess,2022-11-20 22:53:20
except multiple principal characters of avatar 2 are normalass human beings,2022-11-11 14:30:40
" a pretty generic people overcoming outsiders trying to exploit their land and resources plot line which movie am i talking about  uquople

please tell me the irony wasnt lost on you",2022-11-11 08:20:53
ya they were trying way too hard lol,2022-11-11 13:06:30
"problem is they wanted the suit to look wakanda level hi tech which means it had to be super simplistic and sleek and perfectly pristine with no scratches which never looks good 

maybe will see a step back from that in her own show as theyll have to design her suit with a more mechanical feel to it which is what made the iron man suits very grounded until age of ultron",2022-11-11 20:52:27
they are trying to distance herself from ironman and make her an  orginal unique character ,2022-11-11 16:19:26
the design looked cheap to make toys out of to me,2022-11-18 08:58:12
i mean i’m sure they will redesign for her own movie but the comic suit is so much better,2022-11-19 09:45:35
"bright natural light is an absolute nightmare for any vfx work its really difficult to make any cgi convincing in those conditions for example look at shehulk she looked awful in the office due to bright natural light then see her in say the magician stage fight sequence she looked great there

most directors will avoid these light conditions when doing very heavy vfx work classic example is jurrasic park and the trex they shot that in the dark with rain to mask the vfx and to a lot of people it still holds up 29 years later",2022-11-11 20:57:26
what,2022-11-15 05:05:14
honestly it was a no win situation,2022-11-14 14:18:10
“my haitian name”,2022-11-11 07:31:41
he said his “haitian name” he was born and raised in haiti haitian pronounced “hayshan”,2022-11-11 07:34:21
it was awful adr and even looked like they cgid some of his face,2022-11-13 07:22:22
same here lol,2022-11-11 07:02:52
,2022-11-12 03:15:25
heck in the first movie it was implied that nakia could challenge for the throne if she wanted to,2022-11-11 03:42:53
"and other warlords could challenge as well

lots of paths towards being king",2022-11-11 03:46:47
i mean he literally wasis the prince,2022-11-11 06:17:45
hed change heirs and tell everybody just be happy,2022-11-13 01:58:37
you must forgive my confusion on this settled succession,2022-11-15 03:06:24
i actually meant ross and the contessa seems like an odd match lol,2022-11-11 17:06:37
bp and nakia,2022-11-11 15:56:15
after all these horrible events i don’t understand why earth isn’t militarizing more they know there are aliens and  out there since earth has been attacked twice already so why don’t they start something like united nations space command and start mass producing space ships,2022-11-12 07:34:22
"i can see thanos myself he seems to have several different armies and resources he uses for different things as far as hes concerned earth is just a backwater planet with a few powerful beings but nothing that can really threaten him so he just tosses his equivilent of cannon fodder at them the chitauri meant so little to him he handed them over to someone else the second time he moves he sends powerful animals to just wear them out and it works if he hadnt stepped in personally to take the infinity stone the army facing his would have lost eventually thor is the wild card there but hes technically an asgardian from a race hes already beaten as for the final fight it was a rather rushed time travel with what was available we know hes destroyed nowhere and xanadu

still i do agree marvel doesnt do advanced tech well the asgardians had the same issue",2022-11-18 22:19:02
as one video i watched said the other issue is we have seen ways even the sling rings they had could have changed the course of the battle not just all the other stuff strange has done in previous movies,2022-11-18 22:20:14
which doesnt work that well for these types of  films,2022-11-18 22:20:43
yeah but they also arent  even though they havent had direct warfare,2022-11-12 02:58:44
wakandans dont live in a bubble though they have access to the entire outside world theyve sent spies to many countries they know how guns work they know how every type of weapon works they know world history i havent fought in a war i know im not going to bring a spear if i have other things available regardless of how sharp the spear is the atlantians built an entire city out of vibranium their structures are gigantic and complicated they have to have some kind of access to technology but theyre still doing basket weaving and living the same life as if theyve never advanced,2022-11-12 16:28:55
they literally just fought a gigantic battle vs thanos lol,2022-11-13 05:03:01
it happens in other series as well i am the most powerful sorcerer in this dimension i shall punch my opponent really hard,2022-11-18 22:21:37
my friend was  as  and was a menace plus it was 4d and one of the chairs creaked every 12 seconds,2022-11-11 17:22:02
i tried opening my snack right as that scene started and had to stop lol,2022-11-12 22:12:21
this is exactly why i haven’t been to a theatre in three years now and probably never will again,2022-11-12 13:18:03
"with that guy  why even go to a movie then

also sidenotewhy do people like this deserve a girlfriendgrumblegrumble",2022-11-13 21:54:38
the first one just didn’t hit that hard for me just felt like an average mcu movie to me this second one was playing with my emotions and i thought everyone in the movie did an amazing job with their roles,2022-11-16 06:17:06
shuri really did not need to recreate the heartshaped herb she only had to call dr michael morbius to help,2022-11-12 01:20:49
its time,2022-11-11 23:42:39
mutant,2022-11-12 04:42:58
"yeah i understand why they carried the body the little stoop every they did every other step was cool in slow motion but youd be crippling the pall bearers

i thought the silver plates on top looked like something from a knock off toy considering how aesthetically on point the rest of the scene was",2022-11-13 14:02:45
oh really,2022-11-13 22:00:01
"it will either be that or

its going to be hard defeating an army of water based warriors on water",2022-11-15 22:29:14
when the blue people first showed up a guy a few seats away from me said what in the avatar  is this ,2022-12-03 22:28:52
sure but that was the opening scene  there was little reason to have all the stuff with british jim and elaine that followed  that stuff could have been an end credits revealsetup,2022-11-14 16:46:19
i originally was prepared for a super mediocre movie but jeremy jhans review of it got me hyped so incredibly disappointed by what i just watched,2022-11-12 06:00:39
"nah opening montage and mcu title crawl excellent ending montage also excellent 

the bulk of the movie for me was too crowded and referenced tchalla too little for me 

x200b

pulse is a solid 72 bpm ",2022-11-12 22:54:50
honestly they used her how they used america chavez in dr strange more of a plot point than an actual character,2022-11-12 17:11:13
"she didnt really need to be ironheart though it could have just been a scientist w very little screentime such as the one who builds the bomb in the dark knight rises 

the way it cuts to her just suddenly saying shed help wakanda building a suit etc after wanting to go home felt very forced to me",2022-11-12 02:49:24
didn’t need to be her didn’t add much just added to the runtime,2022-11-12 06:34:05
like the others have said there are plenty of ways to introduce a conflict between them around the vibranium being found in the other parts of the world the riri williams actress was a very poor actress the whole character felt out of place,2022-11-12 15:14:10
good catch i never would have noticed,2022-11-12 15:44:17
i wont rewatch it just because it was boring,2022-11-18 13:34:07
i can understand that the makeup argument felt like improv they kept in,2022-11-13 17:10:43
he should’ve just killed riri the second they captured her and been done with it also dude her machine can easily be replicated  the idea that she’s the only person alive who can build that thing is laughable,2022-11-12 01:57:12
"see i could understand that if they didn’t lead with explosives shuri literally could have died before she even had the chance to hand her over or refuse which is instant war with wakanda

i mean yeah but that’s exactly what i said he’s a 600 year old  he should be wiser and more pragmatic than the mortals that run the us",2022-11-12 06:10:37
"i mean… inuniverse they are

hot take colonization and slavery are bad which is what forced both of these societies into hiding once discovered the first thing the west did was demand access to their advance weaponry try to steal it when refused and double down when they were caught",2022-11-13 08:32:42
i outright dont like letitia and i didnt really like shuri in bp1 but i thought she did very well for the movie  i still wish theyd tweaked the plot and made shuri remain queen  diplomatic and had nakia take the mantle of bp but overall i think they did about as well as they couldve with the situation they had,2022-11-11 03:18:38
yeah i went in fully expecting to be disappointed by her as panther but they really sold me on her arc and performance took more than enough arguably too much at times to develop her in a way that was believable from the fun sidekick of bp1 to the person tortured by the mantle and the feeling of responsibility for several family members lost,2022-11-11 03:22:15
i agree personal feelings about the actress aside get your vaccines and boosters shuris grief felt real and her character arc felt natural her  expressions the queens death scene comes to mind  very honest very genuine and relatable to anyone whos lost a loved one suddenly like that,2022-11-11 04:01:35
yep i was kinda disappointed to find out shes the new black panther mainly because of her real life situation but she did do extremely well here and i give props to her although everytime lupita was in a scene it showed she’s clearly a far better actor,2022-11-11 06:57:07
same,2022-11-11 03:14:21
im ready to not listen to anyones honest opinion of her,2022-11-11 03:48:42
nakia being black panther doesn’t make sense because it’s already established in the first movie she wouldn’t when she refuses to take the heart shaped herb when ramonda asks her to,2022-11-11 05:00:31
"i was kinda hoping for black panthers new age bringing new changes without the heart shaped herb

multiple panthers",2022-11-16 08:18:08
basset was great didnt really connect with shuri personally,2022-11-11 17:25:40
letitia wright did fine imo but in a leading actor you just need something special that she lacked that charisma or whatever it is that keeps drawing your eye to that one person when he or she is in the scene chadwick had that,2022-11-12 03:40:25
my theater was quiet the whole time a couple of people clapped when she first appeared in the black panther suit but nothing else,2022-11-11 15:38:41
not really but in this movie shes supposed to be the lead and lead her country you could see chadwick boseman or michael b jordan being that leader okoye would have been a much better fit too i just didnt buy shuri and her performance,2022-11-11 19:14:49
" you would think they would have more understanding to the situation of namors people

shuri did  right up until namor suggested they wipe out so human life outside their two nations and if she didnt help her would wipe out hers too",2022-11-11 03:28:05
"i disagree 

throughout the movie narmor and his people remain a secret so wakanda’s position to not initiate an unprovoked war is understandable ditto for not wanting to  a scientist that for all we know could also keep a secret",2022-11-11 03:17:33
" are you talking about they were understanding of namors people situation that’s why she didn’t  the  lol

in shuris mind it wasn’t right to take the life of somebody so young even if it was for the larger picture i promise you cap  both steve and sam  would of done the same thing and i promise you tchalla would of done the same thing",2022-11-11 03:17:00
"	they side with someone they never met

they took t’challa’s goal and mission and lesson from the first movie that killmonger was trying to achieve through force which is wakanda could “liberate” protect those brothers and sisters around the world with ease from oppressors but instead they hide in the shadows t’challa opened wakanda to the world and in doing so  and to continue his legacy  they had a duty to help this girl given they’re prowess in the world

but they also empathize with talokan because they were in their shoes before that doesn’t make talokan right",2022-11-11 05:05:33
"you would think they would have more understanding to the situation of namors people

what are you talking about they repeatedly told martin freeman that they couldnt tell him any more details because that would point him to talakan",2022-11-11 04:16:32
yeah would definitely love to see more of namor,2022-11-12 02:47:41
true her and evangeline lily should have both been recast,2022-11-11 19:13:25
totally agreed okoye nakia and mbaku are played by more charismatic actors but theyre sidelined for the entire movie so that doesnt help either ,2022-11-13 12:09:00
"shouldve given the mantle to okoye she was the warrior and let shuri continue to build her new vibranium suits etc

shuri was never shown in the slightest to be capable to physical combat apart from shooting from handheld guns so her suddenly drinking the magical herb and becoming the strongest in wakanda was not earned at all i kept thinking why namor doesnt kick her  even after she became the black panther",2022-11-11 13:03:52
,2022-11-11 09:36:42
haha totally agreed with everything you said ,2022-11-12 21:56:39
"maybe because they agree with the comment

going from chadwick boseman and michael b jordan to letitia wright is rough and she didnt do herself any favors with her performance ",2022-11-11 04:55:07
thor 4 was atrocious  bp 2 was a better movie just not a great one,2022-11-11 13:08:58
i did jog my memory if i’m wrong but what is there in the show that precludes them being at t’challa’s funeral,2022-11-16 01:54:23
"youre apparently cant understand what im saying

how does giving it to tchalla help the future he wouldnt have lived forever what about the next generations  im saying its weird that an elder who believes in tradition and continuation of the black panther still didnt take and hide some anywa y because killmongers decree was insane and destroys a tradition that goes back to centuries

kings and governments threaten death all the time that doesnt stop some people with convictions from doing something they believe is right",2022-11-17 15:44:52
opening scene killmonger escaping from wakandan prison ala loki,2022-11-13 16:08:22
what id like to know is how the wakandans pay for imported goods  they dont sell their vibranium and they have nothing else of value so where does the money come from  money laundering  counterfiting,2022-11-22 22:51:57
nah he already made bp1 and space jam 2 hes already got legitimately bad movies under his belt,2022-12-29 15:02:41
"100
i also feel the last battle scene was terrible like 20 people fighting each other on small boat in the middle of the ocean

i really do belive it was simply chadwicks passing that  it up i couldnt imagine trying to navigate through it",2022-11-11 23:16:34
describe to me shuris arc in your own words explain to me why the wakandans would protect a foreign national describe to me riris arc,2022-11-22 18:57:33
"i think letitia wright just straight up cannot carry a film the actress isnt good enough because she lacks the depth and the charisma necessary to be the lead and especially black panther lots of bad decisions from the character very hotheaded i couldnt really connect at all in most emotional scenes and i just found her very unlikeable overall i thought the actor for namor was way more compelling throughout the film and the character was just much more interesting as a whole with his motivations portrayal and how unique the action sequences felt i would 100 watch a standalone namor movie diving deeper into their whole culture and conflicts 

im with you on the gadgetry could not shake the fact that shes meant to be a scientist with presumably little combat experience but all of a sudden is overpowered beyond belief i dont know future plans for the ip but this isnt it for me if this is the direction its going to head in from there you can work diplomacy to keep riri safe but apparently no one in wakanda got the requisite training because they  it all the entire time i was straight up rooting for wakanda to get bodied by the talokans namor felt super reasonable to me as a villain because he very calmly let em know the deal that his people are threatened and need to take action and would like assistance",2022-11-12 20:14:35
where are you getting the joy ride part she literally helped save people and she had already established a relationship with namor so she went to go confront him,2022-11-12 15:09:44
cause everyone was already in the movie you want me to show up you gotta pay,2022-11-12 15:13:52
to be fair he had just sacrificed himself for the universe,2022-11-13 03:39:00
those are fair points  i’ll think on them in potential future rewatches  for me though when a movie isn’t very entertaining to watch i don’t get into the themes and such  it’s hard for me to imagine sitting down and going “i’m in the mood for ‘wakanda forever’” any time soon  who knows tho i do generally like rewatching movies and trying to find things to appreciate in them so we’ll see,2022-11-12 16:41:47
try ,2022-11-11 23:40:07
you’re watching black panther it wasn’t just about the actor dying it’s literally the main character in the story who died did you want them to just gloss over his death and have his family in the movie act like it never happened i’m a little confused about what you expected,2022-11-13 04:06:05
i guess we all had different reactions depending on our person i personally related to it through my dad passing due to cancer a few years ago it was like reliving the memory of losing someone to an incurable disease all over again i wasn’t bawling but i teared up pretty hard every time they discussed his death ’ but even i have to admit it felt like it went on a bit too much though it’s possible the cast and director etc had a closer relationship to chadwick and wanted to say goodbye in their own way,2022-11-11 13:35:40
you definitely sound cold,2022-11-11 06:25:22
do you not remember how huge the first black panther movie release was it was the highest grossing marvel movie up until that point no,2022-11-11 06:57:39
"nah i didn’t hate batman i thought it was okay  not a huge fan but i respected the film making  i liked thor quite a lot adoptive parents stories really get to me

it’s almost like i’m an individual with my own opinions and not part of some reddit hivemind  when you lump people in with “you mfs” you show how simpleminded you are",2022-11-11 12:41:59
especially as ironheart and valentina already felt super forced anything else would just feel completely unrelated,2022-11-11 06:22:08
they even cleared bucky of the winter soldier code words,2022-11-13 22:13:37
also nanotech it’s how tony survived being stabbed by thanos,2022-11-14 03:12:53
"its an unfortunate case where the remedy to the main conflict is immediately obvious  wakanda and namors kingdom are natural allies  but he needs to incite war just for the sake of conflict

i wonder if an earlier version of this script involved a full conquest by the americans over the underwater kingdom with wakanda caught in the middle and they just had to back away from that sort of actual political tension",2022-11-11 04:38:44
it was bad in dolby cinema too really tough to decipher what was going on at times,2022-11-11 08:04:25
surprised i had to scroll so far to find this i saw it in 2d and so many of the fight scenes were too dark to see what was actually happening,2022-11-12 03:39:04
"the first black panther is top tier for me and this was a solid step down again for understandable reasons but at least its not the eternals

i think the next movie could be good assuming letitia wright doesnt implode gina caranostyle before now and production",2022-11-14 06:41:15
lol ok fanboy,2022-11-11 08:04:41
well because from the flow and hint of this movie there is gonna be an empire of wakanda in a faraway galaxy im no talkin  look at it the  lady trying to start a war with whole world against wakanda talokan might not be coming to help unless wakanda gonna burn the world down so who gonna come at this stage the only answer left is wakanda but space civilization,2022-11-15 11:02:40
i came to see wakanda not these colonizers  i don’t give a  about ross,2022-11-12 02:00:50
even so it felt like a clone of america in multiverse of madness pretty unoriginal really wish she just wasn’t involved,2022-11-11 16:08:14
you guys are being extremely hyperbolic at most the cia stuff was maybe 15 minutes but more like 10 minutes,2022-11-11 16:32:05
i agree but all that was probably less than 1520 min,2022-11-11 08:05:11
nothing the us air force cant take care of,2022-11-13 17:08:29
i think her armor actually had a mix of gold and silver from when i looked at it,2022-11-12 05:56:10
didnt have namor say stay back shes about to panther,2022-11-11 07:02:16
nor did we get “it’s black panther not black panthim”,2022-11-11 09:39:27
you jinxed it a sequel is confirmed for morbious,2022-11-11 08:14:47
also namor is not a character who  off after just one film,2022-11-11 03:37:11
"i mean not everyone watched loki i’d say to the majority of the mcu fans it’d be pretty original and shocking 

i wanna see namor again but i’d be lying if i say i didn’t want them to go this route",2022-11-11 08:44:23
i mean whiplash and his bird did it after like 23 years tony had other things he was ions ahead with,2022-11-11 08:49:46
didnt feel nearly as earned as tonys moments were either give her her own show to flesh it out or dont put her in this movie thats already overly stuffed she distracts from the themes of the movie and this serves as a poor first intro to her character as shes so forgettable,2022-11-11 08:37:56
apparently shes also a natural suit pilot as she said shes never flown the initial suit she was making yet performs like shes been iron man forever they did a poor job introducing her character and gave us zero reason to care about her they could have had her help make some devices or something for the fight or to neutralize namor and teased the iron man suits or something but there gave her zero build up just heres an already apparently fully developed character that no one outside of comic fans has any idea of who she is enjoy,2022-11-11 16:58:40
thanks,2022-11-11 14:20:45
my theatre was cheering when she dropped down but it wasnt filled with white people,2022-11-11 15:02:16
"i think they really should have fleshed out why namor viewed them differently to “surface nations” 

either lean into the “we have all the vibranium” or maybe that both largely stayed hidden and out of the way… felt like he really didn’t sell shuri well at all",2022-11-11 05:15:18
"im not keen on yoing prodigy characters in general its a very simple trope charceter justknows everything already no flaws

tony stark was like a guy in his late 20searly 30s in im1 
now you got students building this stuff with a box of scraps during lunch break",2022-11-15 23:47:25
"it so crazy to see bad cgi in a marvel film in 2022

oh please theres been bad cgi since age of ultron",2022-11-23 18:51:33
marvel has had lots of bad cgi,2022-11-27 19:02:19
for the last hour hour of the movie i kept thinking please let this end soon please let this end soon please let this end soon,2022-11-13 11:03:08
cheers laughter gasps excited murmuring all part of marvel movie fun at this point almost like stage productions pausing for laughter it’s expected this  saw the line butchered it and left it out as a warning for other lines i’m incensed every time i remember this experience,2022-11-11 06:32:47
yeah but at that point how many people would really be left to fight back and he doesnt need to flood it all simultaneously to get everywhere right,2022-11-11 15:49:04
it was a very dark shot so i didnt see them get up but its also a thing that never got touched on again that seems like a big deal lol,2022-11-11 15:50:37
i never said it was a documentary but it feels cheap that for the first half of the movie all he wants is the scientist but then just doesnt take her or at least do something to weaken wakanda more to make them more liable to say yes killing a ruler has always been a way to incite war  it just feels like someone whos been ruling as long as he has and seen as much as he has would know he needed to do more to ensure wakanda would have to join as for shuri being the black panther letitia wright is a really good character actress but she doesnt have the screen presence that danai or lupita or winston duke has and the heart shaped herb takes you to the ancestral plane but doesnt transfer the skills over,2022-11-11 16:01:42
"absolutely others here also responded about the need to keep taking their masks off momentarily to spout various comments and it was like why tho you have the starkesque insidethehelmet view a few times why not use that

i hope we really see a big upgrade in the design area for the ironheart show because this was not it chief",2022-11-11 21:26:31
yeah i just don’t think he would be as likable if he were attacking wakanda over resources maybe in a later movie after the character has been established,2022-11-20 04:40:10
it just means dont shoehorn oversimplified supposedly real world  into a movie that just makes it problematic ever since why didnt superman stop the holocaust its just insulting to the audience and best avoided unless absolutely necessary it doesnt elevate the film material it devalues the real world events,2022-11-29 00:32:35
"i mean i get it it showed a more vulnerable side and she wasn’t supposed to be strong that being said if that was the angle they were going for then i don’t think she did a great job acting wise

maybe that’s on the plot of the movie which i found rough overall but rather it have been okoye at this point guess we’ll see in the next one",2022-11-12 16:35:05
nah spiderman is just pure nostalgia bait with a ridiculous plot and shang chi was great until the  of a ridiculous third act  just turned into a generic live action anime movie near the end,2022-11-11 13:38:29
shang chi is very good but spiderman pulls on a lot of nostalgia,2022-11-11 15:43:31
yeah especially if shes under a freaking mask 90 of the time lol its probably mainly a cg character anyway,2022-11-11 15:52:19
they did shes mostly a double with head replacements for the final act,2022-11-11 21:08:41
she got in an accident which kept her from filming for months from august to january the bridge scene where she fell,2022-11-11 15:13:21
that makes sense cheers,2022-11-11 11:36:57
"considering the comics  it would be highly illogical wakanda has a cure for cancer just isn’t publicizing it to the rest of the world with the justification one of the members of the wakandan counsel stated if they care about their peoples health they wouldnt sell cigarettes black panther volume 4 3 

of course that would open the possibility of it having gone undetected till it was already too late if it wasn’t for the kimoyo beads one of which provides a lifetimes worth of medical knowledge and is given to each individual at birth",2022-11-16 00:48:43
only because he was able to catch her,2022-11-11 12:28:48
that makes sense,2022-11-14 13:06:56
  dude just noped out,2023-01-21 23:38:22
he was literally like 10 yards from the  ocean,2023-02-07 16:45:44
thats harsh and i didnt necessarily like the movie,2022-11-12 01:07:40
you didnt see eternals huh,2022-11-11 21:33:05
then i guess in future movies every one their warriors should have a suit,2022-11-13 00:46:12
next we will have newborns creating armor for the celestials in 30 minutes  it why not,2022-11-19 18:24:13
wow wow wow wow wow wow,2022-11-20 01:23:52
exactly obvsly marvel is always setting things up but this film in particular just feels like a giant setup with an uninteresting story,2022-11-11 03:31:33
likewise i had to stop listening to them today,2022-11-12 01:22:51
its insane how much better aquaman looked than this and that was six years ago,2022-11-26 07:01:47
"yeah it literally just became whatever shapeformweapon would look cool and sell an action figure iron man 3 had already devalued the suits so much though dozens upon dozens of iron man suits taken out by a light breeze regardless of ai piloted prototypes it just didnt make sense and only further separated the magic and untouchable tony stark wearing iron man from the physical technology that he created

and dont get me started on the hammer hand he hits thanos with if he just used a  pickaxe hand we could have saved sitting through end game",2023-02-04 19:08:50
movie science is making things not possible as realistic as possible but massive holes in logic and having things one way then immediately turning around and making it the opposite way  are called plot holes,2023-02-03 14:15:25
and even that movie has massive problems they are just masked by andrew and tobey cuz it was great to see them again if they werent there the movie would be ,2022-11-14 20:39:50
i’ve always felt she was miscast she isn’t given much to do emotionally yet still under delivers,2022-11-12 16:34:57
can’t literally anyone of the tribe members challenge,2022-11-11 15:30:18
i’m not your buddy guy first off it’s a movie they can change the what they want even if they don’t if can be from the royal bloodline of any of the tribes not necessary tchalla‘s line thats why m’baku was able to challenge in the first movie,2022-11-11 17:38:13
"what i meant that we never got a nice clear view of it its either super close up so you can only see the face or way off in the distance and shrouded in darkness either way

im being hyperbolic when i say we never see it i just wish we had a chance to appreciate it i want to see what an iron man suit built in a garage looks like",2022-11-12 02:22:05
hawk man from black adam,2022-11-11 10:11:30
plus that actor would be trashed and have a massive stain on their career,2022-11-11 17:49:53
literally any notable young to middleaged black actor it’s not like his performance defined the role lol,2022-11-11 04:32:32
"michael b jordan  
  
yes he was amazing as killmonger but he would  crush it",2022-11-11 05:35:48
didn’t have it at the amc i went to,2022-11-12 16:36:48
i mean how many people within the mcu on earth are capable starks dead shiri just wouldnt do it for wakandas sake not in banners wheelhouse either its a stretch but i see the logic of going after her,2022-11-14 18:17:02
i am pretty sympathetic to the spot they were in im not sure what they could have done to be different and show a sophisticated society that is clearly descended from mayan culture im trying to imagine other possibilities that feel plausible to the world shown in the mcu like a nomadic underwater society but nothing im imagining feels particularly mesoamerican,2022-11-17 19:00:01
i doubt theyll do much outside cinematography or sound design for top gun and batman i think and i pray to  hope that movies like everything everywhere all at once the whale tár and a couple others will be the big spotlight movies at the oscars i sure hope theyll give the northman some love but theyve shown in the past that they apparently hate robert eggers so who knows,2022-11-11 05:43:39
because the first black panther was nominated for best picture despite being a formulaic mcu movie,2022-11-11 21:56:56
ya i thought that was pretty obvious,2022-11-11 14:18:16
i get that but could they not have used an airship or something or an aerial escape plan once they captured namor,2022-11-11 17:12:32
hes obviously joking morbius is way better,2022-11-11 06:37:33
there was definitely some weird cgi mouth movement stuff going on whenever people were talking underwater  that big speech namor has before they attack wakanda was way off,2022-11-11 03:21:32
"probably because namor doesnt really come off as a villian

hes trying to protect his people and wakanda just shrugs its shoulders",2022-11-11 03:15:05
thats true it just bothered me that he was singularly focused on killing her to the point of endangering his entire actual plan which was to ally with wakanda felt like a sitcom mixup that causes a war,2022-11-11 03:44:24
"except that it is the premier military power

the universe has shown that several times",2022-11-15 03:17:27
since when has the us needed hard proof to launch an attack,2022-11-15 20:44:26
audience rating is always a circlejerk the trolls feel like downdooting this one would be rude like hannibal lecter,2022-11-17 15:20:02
after rewatching the movie its not really a thunderbolts setup as much as it is setting up america invading wakanda which i suspect is what will happen in the next black panther movie namor also says that at the end of the film,2022-11-14 12:21:16
i can see that eternals being messier i just feel like maybe some people have rose tinted glasses on when it comes to bp i love chadwick but even his memory couldnt save this film imo ,2022-11-11 22:45:57
not really saying much there,2022-11-11 04:34:25
… which spiderman,2022-11-11 06:18:50
nwh was mid,2022-11-11 17:51:31
as a marvel fan people were really saying that i could buy that if people gave oscars for best trailer,2022-11-11 04:31:39
i don’t remember anyone really saying that but if that’s what they were going for it didn’t work and probably should have been lupita’s movie,2022-11-11 05:22:35
kidding but only sorta glad you enjoyed it fully,2022-11-11 05:42:53
nah i timed them in theatres all together theyre less than 10 minuted in run time,2022-11-12 19:00:56
no hes not kamala kahn was established as one before him at the end of ms marvel,2022-11-11 18:29:37
i think the issue here is that kevin feige learned from history in the wrong way gotg1 was better reviewed and funnier than gotg2 feige probably didnt want another gotg2 disappointment so he told taika to add even more jokes in love and thunder,2022-11-13 21:52:08
  all the taika hate is getting ridiculous   he clearly has a style in his movies  taiga’s films differ greatly from coogler’s  watch fruitvale station and then hunt for the wilderpeople  they tell completely different stories and their directors’ handle them in their own ways,2022-11-14 00:24:39
"he just wanted to protect his people the easiest way to do that is to hide but he understands that eventually he will be found

and yet at no stage does he abandon his goal to  the scientist if it were him realising the futility of that mission then the film would have revealed as much

he understands what is inevitable but keeping himself hidden can buy him some time to align with wakanda who has a similar history of hiding in isolation to deal with colonizers

he attacks wakanda after they take the scientist off of him just as he threatened he would to the queen he then attacks in response ceasing only when he thinks both she and the scientist are dead

this informs us that namor still considers the concealment of their existence to be paramount and the killing of the scientist necessary to resolve this

so he wants to protect his people by keeping them secret from the rest of the worldwhile also wanting to immediately conquer the world and thereby reveal their existencewhich hes desired to do for half a millenniaand yet he really just wants the scientist dead so that his secret is preservedbut then he also wants shuri to agree to itand if she wont then  attack wakandawhich he doesin order to convince them to help him conquer the worldwhile also keeping their existence secret from the rest of the world

namor and his plans are very half baked as mentioned before it would have helped substantially if it were revealed to shuri during her tour that namor had already been militarising and preparing his people for war against the surface world and simply didnt want them to be revealed earlier than their planned invasion",2022-11-13 04:54:21
yeah good point i don’t think that came through though,2022-11-19 19:49:57
i agree,2023-01-05 06:51:45
avatar flew by compared to this movie i had no problems watching that movie this movie was rough,2023-02-04 15:21:47
hrm my friend is also wondering if she can make it through something that long we might wait and catch this one on streaming though i bet its pretty in the theater,2023-01-21 23:37:19
yeah  it had incredible visuals but the story was all over the place,2023-02-02 10:47:25
that  her new suit  and we never really got to see the old one,2022-11-15 23:22:38
did you enjoy the cgi ,2022-11-11 04:03:33
ah yes because box office numbers represent if a movie is good or not lol,2022-11-11 04:27:35
why is this downvoted hes right,2022-11-12 22:22:24
namor is not cap tho and marvel will never take away the only majority black cast movie but yeah this should’ve been a namor and mutants movie,2022-11-11 04:04:44
i liked black sheep more,2022-11-12 01:07:45
"lol that part just had me so out of focus

your infiltrating the enemies lairwhich is underwater

and you send an elite special ops squad nope

one normal person",2022-11-16 10:42:26
nope this movie was  go watch interstellar shawshank redemption green mile forrest gump etc if you want good emotional acting this movie was not even close to those movies this was mid tier at best,2022-11-11 20:47:20

why she was very unmemorable there are better actresses out there ,2022-11-12 19:26:06
and she phoned that in probably cause she had no idea what the  she was doing in the movie jld is usually a really big presence anytime shes in a role but here she was nothing,2022-11-12 08:16:14
ah i seemed to have forgotten that fair enough,2022-11-15 12:59:30
ya but the best they could muster is a brief attack on wakanda civilians the surface world would absolutely destroy them if they ever went to war with the entire planet,2022-11-15 13:21:50

mbaku was a joke comedic relief made to be a clown referred to as having no brains by the female leads ross has always been a joke emasculated by his exwife the entire movie killmonger a sign of toxic masculinity leading to death and destruction,2022-11-14 01:24:59
yeah i know i meant the film wise,2022-11-11 17:26:11

these was a lot that needed to be fixed in this film…",2022-11-14 04:04:41

pretty much all mexicans are of partial european descent although oddly enough he looks more white in the movie then he does in narcos,2022-11-14 04:32:04
" tenoch huerta is mexican

mexican isnt a ethnicity most mexicans are mixed of european and native descent and he doesnt look like one of pure native background  which is he should be considering the story you can see the difference in  features between him and other fully indigenous actors

shuri referred to everett ross as a colonizer in the first film

but why",2022-11-14 18:29:55
whats the joke why would an american ever be called a colonizer by an african,2022-11-14 04:28:09
yes like  the why did we need to do that ugh it’s so woke and pandering these days like i’ll be walking down the street and i’ll see a woman out walking and i just think “it’s okay to be a woman but why does it have to get shoved down my throat” like it’s cool if you’re a woman but just don’t do it in front of me,2022-11-26 06:55:07
the first movie established the black panther is chosen via trial by combat the victor becomes king and along with it the black panther blood ties meant nothing,2022-11-11 17:42:33
my bad meant 510,2022-11-11 17:17:15
"not just that the actions sequences also were very boring  the final fight between two most powerful countries is a total joke i really dont understand how wakanda and namors country is so considerd powerful 

meanwhile aquaman you can totally see the scale of power atlantis had 

also young avengers thing is annoying they are repeating same story again and again  kate bishop america chavez riri williams asgardian kids all need to be saved from villain

and in antman and the marvels its going to be same thing need to keep scotts daughter and kamala safe from villain its the same story",2022-11-11 15:21:33
same here take out a half hour and it would have been great in the end it was just good,2022-11-14 00:15:56
agreed the movie was good despite it mostly because the music was incredibly done and edited well esp compared to the first one which was flat and bland,2022-11-14 05:58:18
its striking how bad suited for the role she feels she feels hollowed and too small for such a big role the screen engulfes her there is no sense that she is a superhero but bassett oh boy she commands the screen you forget theres even a set when she shows up she demands your attention wright is just there like prince charles err king charles pardon me who suddenly had the task he never thought he would do replace the monarch they make it clear she is in for the long haul this phase 4 is quite troubled,2022-11-12 22:06:43
thats pretty much untrue,2022-11-13 05:20:25
"but as far as i know mbaku isnt of the royal line  everyone so far has been

and shuri was called queen upon her mothers death

i guess shuri could abdicate  but to a nonroyal

ps  its going to get interesting later if mbaku has sons since the previous king has one too

pps  and as best i can figure the black panther has been the king  now its the abdicated queen

ppps  its interesting that in the movie mbaka was kinda the voice of reason and shuris trusted advisor  pretty much also for her mother",2022-11-13 17:43:34
thor love and thunder isn’t just the worst mcu movie i’ve ever seen i honestly think it’s amongst the worst films i’ve ever seen,2022-11-13 13:09:30

"sure but if you remember steve was strong but kept falling over himself at first  she fought before but it wasnt scaling walls while doing back flips and doing hand to hand she was shooting with her gauntlets i am not really that hung up on it but it was just something that stuck out to me they had a lot of things to work around to make that movie happen and that is minor if anything

also when challenged she needs to purge the powers so then what",2022-11-11 12:21:21
"that’s a good point you don’t want to make it seem like you’re exploiting chadwick’s death just to emotionally manipulate the audience still the movie was lacking a bit more emotional oomph for me even in moments that weren’t referencing t’challa’s death like queen ramonda’s death didn’t hit as hard as i would have wanted i will say though that the closing montage was the closest at getting me choked up i would have liked more moments like that that were a loving tribute to chadwick 

as i said before i just wasn’t as emotionally invested in this movie as i was with the first one which was a bit disappointing given the subject matter i think the script could have used a couple more pass throughs to make things tighter and to make the emotional moments pack a bit more punch",2022-11-13 21:28:19
" what youre talking about is replacing danielle radcliffe after the first harry potter

they absolutely would have recast the role is hermione now the chosen one or something",2022-11-12 08:12:12
" who would you have had replace him

there are likely thousands of black male actors that could capably have played the role of tchalla i dont work in casting i cant tell you specifically and i dont find fan casting all that interesting to begin with as it usually just leads to people suggesting henry cavill giancarlo esposito and kathryn hahn for every role in every project ever

 what youre talking about is replacing daniel radcliffe after the first harry potter

and what they did instead is have harry potter die an offscreen death and have ron and hermione attempt to carry any future movies to come




i understand if the people involved werent ready yet to move on from chadwick his death was still very fresh my proposal would have been to delay the project longer there was no reason a black panther film had to be released barely 2 years after chadwicks death",2022-11-11 18:33:18
personally my preference would be to delay the project,2022-11-11 19:21:49
i honestly kind of thoughthoped she would die and lupita would take over as the real black panther successor,2022-11-11 05:23:53
"fair my comment might have been hyperbolic but the opening scene was definitely the most cringe inducing for me 

namor could have easily dove in the ocean before attacking shuri they definitely needed to stack the deck for shuri to come out on top there",2022-11-11 03:37:39
she had black panther powe r it heals you that’s what they were testing to create in the beginning of the movie,2022-11-11 04:06:55
lol,2022-11-11 06:35:04
"it seemed to me like they basically made it parallel to real life whatever he had he didnt let anyone know until he was dying from it

i agree it felt pretty glossed over though and i dont get the whole tribal funeral ending with an alien abduction where does it go from there somebodys gotta do something with it and then shouldnt that be the actual funeral it was weird",2022-11-11 15:18:12
so it fits right in with the rest of the mcu,2022-11-11 12:55:11
thats fine,2022-11-16 18:25:06
the movie really sucks the first movie was among top in mcu but this movies is boring,2022-11-12 04:09:01
kamala’s friend says “mutation” in ms marvel but yeah,2022-11-12 21:50:40

what a sad state of affairs 2023 is for comic book movies the people writing the movies never at a comic,2023-02-19 12:33:37

"a bunch of old white dudes

so basically the same kind of people that created marvel",2022-11-12 19:36:25
yeah 2 hours to  time and forget after a few weeks,2022-11-11 08:55:01
yeah i think youre right the target demographic is gonna eat this movie up,2022-11-11 22:29:00

got em,2022-11-16 04:52:30
"i dont care about the movie that much what is wrong with you though i just gave my opinion on the movie its not that big of a deal you can like it and there is nothing wrong with that 

stop being ",2022-11-14 15:27:55
"so wait just because a film dealt with violence and grief before means a film that deals with it in a different context with different characters with different experiences isnt worth even considering or discussing 

like really tchallas way of understanding it and coming to terms with how dangerous the quest for vengeance can be was a completely different journey to what shuri goes through with wholly different set of context and experience not to mention having to deal with a entire different nation in the process 

by your logic we shouldnt discuss the fatherdaughter familial themes in interstellar as contact already discussed similar themes already

or  why discuss anything about blade runner 2049 because the first blade runner had a similar end message 

seriously your comment is such ignorant narrow minded nonsense that it absolutely amazes just how nonsensical one can get its one of the stupidest reasons ive honestly ever read of someone trying their damndest to hate on a marvel movie i honestly dont believe you actually think this",2022-11-13 05:35:07
"nah she could have handled that much differently iirc he said something about planning to and forgetting if he really didn’t want to pay her we would have seen a scene of him avoiding her still or ghosting her 

instead we saw ironheart extort someone for more money because things didn’t happen on her timeline 

she didn’t hold a single shred of understanding or empathy or care we got a bullish ‘genius’ that takes advantage of other people for their own gain",2022-11-12 19:42:45
i agree man,2022-11-13 19:23:39
yeah i have no problem with the mantle being passed down it’s more about exploiting chadwick’s death,2022-11-13 22:05:44
yeah that was way more apt analysis then ops comment good  feels like people are just pulling excuses out their  to dislike her since tchalla is gone,2022-11-11 15:23:58
avengers 1 mostly because it was a dream come true infinity war and winter soldier if were talking avengersexcluded it would go winter soldier  ragnarok  doctor strange 1 with bp2 taking 3rd place now,2022-11-12 14:23:53
"whereas i felt that it undermined the urgency and severity of the situation in fact several things did with him

 he forbids any mention of him as he doesnt want to be revealed to the world
 he has the wakandans secure the scientist to further protect knowledge of their existence
 after they secure the scientist he then has a group of his people attack them out in the open while on the bridge
 he then doesnt  the scientist despite every opportunity and instead tries to convince the princess that she should let him
 he then reveals that he wants to take over the world with wakandas help exposing the existence of his civilisation and if they refuse then he will attack wakanda
 he attacks wakanda to find the scientist kills the queen and yet doesnt confirm the  on the scientist and instead gives them one week before  return

his motivations seem to change from scene to scene

 he so desperately wants knowledge of his civilisation kept hidden that he will attack a water station approach wakanda for aid and seek the death of this scientist who is capable of building a machine that will inadvertently reveal them to the world and yet
 he also wants to attack and take over the world which he will do with or without wakandas help and if they refuse to help then he will attack them first revealing the existence of his civilisation to the world

to me at least and this is an issue spread throughout the mcu it feels that they werent sure of how to write a villain and instead fell into the trap of writing another killmonger it would have helped substantially if it were revealed to shuri during her tour that namor had already been militarising and preparing his people for war against the surface world and simply didnt want them to be revealed earlier than their planned invasion

where at least killmonger had been festering for years and had a plan already engaged with that would serve his ultimate ambitions namor has spent half a millennia doing nothing and only emerges upon the threat of his discovery to then decide that he wants to take over the world  i really like the actor in the role but the character comes across as very halfbaked",2022-11-13 03:21:30
yeah so both tchalla and ramonda lied by omission and denied shuri the chance to get to know her nephew  why,2022-11-12 08:07:53
yup saw all the videos about it as soon as i got home,2022-11-12 04:25:35

bp1 has one of the best leads in all of the mcu and  the best villain bp2 has 3 people combined that weren’t half as good as chadwick and an awesome villain that’s hamstrung by a completely nonsensical plan,2022-11-11 13:32:53
yeah the product has been highly commoditized disney should know better too i dont think its their new ceo but they have had this management culture of commoditize all the things right now they used to understand the value of making things rarer and still do in many aspects,2022-11-13 08:18:04

yes we all heard the words lol it makes no sense its pretty clear by the rest of it that hes being set up to be king so hes going to be king of a place he barely knows while having no experience in dealing with the pressure of ruling okay,2022-11-12 18:42:50
that’s silly,2022-11-11 03:38:37
also the mix of futuristic with lip discs and ancient tribal african depictions seems exploitive or ornamental  i think critics are just afraid to be critical for fear of being called racist  it’s def some silly stuff in this movie,2022-11-13 04:09:27
"to me it is not that i dont root for her it just doesnt fit her character at all she is this tech savy genius let her be the new ironman give her some weapons idc that would at least fit

nope she has to be black panther and look like a giraffe in costume lupitas or okoye both would have been a absolut perfect choices",2022-11-14 15:56:23
"i kind of knew it was going to be shuri because family nakia would make a better black panther because she has the build for it letitia wright is just too small and looked incredibly tiny in the suit most of the movie she was the smallest person in the scene 

nakia and mbaku are also villians in the comics nakia is malice and mbaku is manape idk if they ever planned on using them as fullfledged villains in the mcu but it would have been a good story winston duke is huge and is an excellent mbaku and i can see him being a great villain hes also great in this as a wise advisor 


in the first movie the queen was going to give mbaku the fruit to make him the black panther when she thought tchalla died i thought mbaku refusing was a sign of respect for tchalla and also him knowing that he has survived and was hospitalized in the jabari tribe 

 mbaku theres a story reason the jabari dont use vibranium and worship hanuman as opposed to bast hes not going to be the avatar of a  he doesnt worship

thats actually a really cool fact about him it must have been a small piece in bp1 because i dont think it was articulated in this movie a lot of necessary info wasnt explained about wakanda i didnt know the leader of wakanda and the black panther were two separate roles",2022-11-14 20:03:27
i only ever remember her firing a gun not taking on an immortal warrior  in hand to hand combat,2022-11-12 08:21:53
um what she fought with those laser arm things in endgame she did not even do a tiny bit of hand to hand combat like she displayed in this movie,2022-11-12 10:07:54
because he was born under water maybe,2022-11-12 19:20:40
one of the most important parallels created by namors backstory is his peoples avoidance of colonization despite the very real threat of it towards anyone who looks like him and his people did its a parallel to the same situation in wakanda and shows that there are different ways to respond to threats of colonization if namor and his people were whitepassing atlanteans i dont think that that similarity between telokan and wakanda would have come across at all,2022-11-12 20:42:24
"it might be unfair but it definitely felt weird seeing the bp be so slender

they could have worked with it by making her come across as much faster and sleeker but i dont know that they sold that",2022-11-15 23:26:10

oh dont get me wrong love and thunder was indeed terrible it felt as the worlds most expensive joke but at least it wasnt 161 minutes long wakanda forever has the worst thing you can do in a movie imo having a very basic story nothing wrong with that but stretch it to 2 and a half hours love and thunder was  unfunny and annoying but didnt drag while wf was like the school essay you have to write random stuff to fill pages,2022-11-15 15:15:24

i dont really understand does that relate to all you said
so the movie was good and acurate",2022-11-19 01:37:37
correct me if i’m wrong but the scene closed out and the credits started going for a good 7 minutes   indicates an end of a movie are people supposed to just sit around and wait and try to differentiate between those credits versus the “entire credits” my point is why even do credits at all  just do the scene and then end the movie,2022-12-12 19:19:18

but how would she know it was lethal to talokanians when she only has normal humans as the basis,2022-11-13 10:03:57
they process sharp object trauma injury and sound wave injuries differently it seems like many comments say,2022-11-23 05:03:12

the warrior was unprepared for an engagement with the enemy but the infiltrator was there solely to engage,2022-11-13 14:50:40
i think at one point the spy says its nonlethal from this range when she pulls away shuri from helping the downed enemy so basically a taser accidentally being super effective i couldve just misheard though,2022-11-13 18:23:01
they werent that deep underwater just in an underground cave place they werent being kept in the actual underwater city where you need to put on a suit to go down there,2022-11-20 19:44:38

"this is a great topic and its been a consistent debate throughout the entirety of the mcu   


the brilliance and dilemma with making a near 30moviestrong franchise is that it requires constant callbacks and tieins to string together an overarching narrative combine this with an ensemble cast and its no secret why these movies are successful and generate as much revenue as they do however in the same way that we see genius in callback writing steve being able to budge mjolnir in day of ultron and then proceeding to truly lift it in endgame we absolutely see a taxing level of references   


perhaps its a bit anecdotal but when i discuss mcu movies with people the most common reason for them liking their favorite movies is that theyre unlike the rest of the marvel movies movies like shangchi winter soldier guardians iron man  they exist within a vacuum and excel at the theme that theyre driving across while these movies do possess references and tieins theyre often minimal and only exist as a way to appeal to consistent audiences   


i totally went off on another rant again i have a very streamofconscious writing style when it comes to this stuff   


heres my two cents on what youve said  


i wouldnt say the movie or narrative failed to deliver i agree that things were left way too vague by the writers either by choice or to save runtime but as mentioned above i truly believe that some of the most iconic and rewarding moments in the mcu exist as callbacks to previous events   


this is once again speculation but imagine if in a future avengers film shuri suffers what appears to be a lethal blow not having officially established her regenerative properties as a trait writers could sell that moment as a death scene and use her regenerative properties as both a callback and a trump card against her opponent in my opinion this would negate what we both consider to be vague writing in wakanda forever   


i know imagine the potential isnt exactly a perfect defense so i cant say i totally disagree with the rest of your argument  her transition from being near death after a stab into doing a sick frontflip assault on namor was jarring to say the least however i think that in a majority of cases for better or worse marvels writers have been generous with callbacks to vague moments therefore its healthy to have skepticism regardless",2022-11-15 02:51:31
"the wakandans use a sonar weapon at the end to disrupt the foot soldiers that cant just use their ankle wings to yeet themselves outta the water

i was referring to specifically namor here as he was the only one unaffected by the sonar precisely because hes the only one with ankle wings",2022-11-17 02:57:38
its because its a sonic blast it likely works by using vibrations ability to exponentially alter energy levels to launch as wave of sound powerful enough to wound  over conventional engagement distance the sound would lose energy as it travels though air at the range they were fighting at there was no such chance,2022-11-15 23:29:11
ah you know what that makes a lot of sense,2023-01-16 17:04:50
it means its deadly to humans but leathal to talokans,2022-11-13 14:57:45
im assuming its like a bomb blast the pressure waves do way more damage than cuts turns your guts to juice,2022-11-16 14:25:17

also her mannerisms the things she says no way anyone could believe she’s even smart let alone a genius she looks and sounds plucked out from that’s so raven,2022-11-29 01:10:23
what a face palm comment you think shuri herself wouldnt know how to build an iron man suit when tony canonically in official book of his notes said she is one the smartest people he knows meaning he has had contact with her and likely shared information about the suit or maybe she learned it herself seeing the hulk buster was available for bruce to wear in the wakanda battle in iw who said riri built the new one all by herself also she said it took her years to build her prototype i think you are just being triggered because they are ladies having a superhero spotlight you are hearing and saying stuff that is untrue,2023-02-22 06:37:36
he was there to remind you that “wakandans are good people” and so that we could laugh at “colonizer in chains”,2022-11-29 01:13:37
ok yea she has no character arc but neither does mbaku so basically ur telling since she is a really important character for the movie but since theres no character development shes a plot device see im genuinely confused so just asking,2022-11-28 04:28:36
"so basically all youre saying is hes not even smart enough to know that scientists record their workso others can recreate itand an organization like the cia would certainly be more than capable of doing so 

her inclusion does not make sense when even analyzing it on a minimal levelit was a lousy element of the script and we know that in essence the reason they wrote that plotline in this manner is to include riri so they could promote her before her disney plus show",2022-11-28 03:46:32
the end of the film directly contradicts that considering he clearly had a longterm plan involving shifting geopolitics to get wakanda on his side,2022-12-02 11:36:00

whats a good series to start with i have marvel unlimited for another month or two i think,2022-11-16 23:21:54
also melee weapons like vibranium bullets sound like they would rock  hard but no melee only,2022-11-11 23:56:19
if the small nation had any type of sam whatsoever theyd be hunks of metal plummeting to earth,2022-11-19 07:18:17
it was supposed to be a quick recon mission though and it was working fine til namora plot armored her way through the sonar black that was previously incapacitating her and destroyed it,2022-11-14 15:55:09
seemed like they stupidly relied solely on the sonic emitter if it hadnt been destroyed theyd have gotten away,2022-11-14 19:17:13
wait i thought it was about to fly away but the emitter also was part of ,2022-11-15 04:35:22
it didnt weaken them that much since namora was able to swim through it and destroy it,2022-11-14 23:09:43
yeah these comments have me concerned not sure how this went over everyones head,2022-11-14 15:57:15
yeah shuri was hellbent on vengeance and only cared about killing namor she didnt care about invading or taking out the talocan army it was just a distraction and one where she was willing to lose just to take out namor people also make fun of shuris and your people will get to live too line while they were losing the battle but shuri was referring to an hypothetical war that would come afterward so many people seems to not get this and think the thirdact battle is a fullblown war it was scaled properly for the battle it was,2022-11-14 16:33:34
people always want to nitpick stuff that already has an explanation that requires the littlest of thinking,2022-11-14 23:48:37
the student had invented a vibranium detector so there was no relocating to avoid being found,2022-11-13 10:37:32
he told shuri he could breathe air when he dropped all the exposition on her,2022-11-17 23:19:57
"dolphins and whales breath air exclusively drying out is still bad for them

its not an unreasonable conclusion to reach",2023-04-19 01:57:55
i thought they’d just blast him with gamer goo that stuff that dries your hands out so you can grip your controller or liquid chalk for rock climbers,2023-06-07 16:38:59
what do you mean by indepth they showed french mercenaries attacking a wakandan research center in mali created as part of their outreach program for vibranium  not too far off from what was and currently is done in reality,2022-11-15 19:01:04
yeah the whole anti colonial message is weird because wakanda wasnt colonized it just looked at some other nearby places being invaded and did nothing then points at the outside world and tells them how bad they are would be like switzerland making a claim of moral superiority against the germans for their history of invading european countries,2022-11-20 17:56:47
well now a baguette seems so much less problematic,2023-03-26 06:05:11
they had the audacity to add another secret organization that is controlling the worlds history in shang chi ugh please stop it just makes the mcu into a joke,2023-02-02 10:12:44
just wait till they start going all in on mutants and the xmen lol,2022-11-20 03:32:14
"wakanda is not obliged to share its resources with the world especially one that can be used to destroy it the idea that a nation can not do what it wants with its own resources is dumb your argument sounds a lot like the justification for the scramble for africa are you surprised that an african country doesn’t trust the rest of the world with its resources 

what exactly does wakanda gain from sharing its resources why exactly wouldn’t the talokan be weary of the the surface world what brought their history they were at risk of genocide and their secrecy is literally what saved their culture from being wiped out 

i’m surprised at reddit not recognising the motives of talokan when currently all over the world indigenous land and culture is under threat from  environmental behaviour from the global north in places like the amazon and hawaii or in canada and alaska where indigenous and polynesians are fighting oil companies for their land",2022-12-03 05:06:46
"yes but in comics its understandable decades of continuity hundreds of thousands of character appearances and stories 

they have no excuse with the movies take a week and watch them all before you write a script",2022-11-14 14:21:32
" nonsensical lack of characters in certain situations

yeah the superman problem as in in the dc universe why dont other heroes ever ask superman to come in an instantly solve some of their issues has always been an issue in the comics and in shared universes but its just getting more and more ridiculous the longer these movies go on",2022-11-15 15:01:26
"marvel is supposed to have a historian that keeps track of these things

",2022-11-29 18:33:13
wouldnt that be so nice though for some super hero movies that arent necessarily a trailer for a sequel,2022-12-06 03:34:37

then that’s even worse he could have empowered the wakadans during the battle with thanos or everyone in endgame,2022-11-18 12:18:20
" i’m not sure why but i’m particularly obsessed with narrative continuity

its because up until now they made it the focal point of their storytelling in other words they trained us to expect it

its absence or disregard breaks the enjoyment of the current movie and creates situations in past movies that no longer make sense

im a comic book nerd and this stuff happens all the time but they 910 they retcon it the other 110 you can chalk up to decades of storytelling and countless comics and characters to keep track of

in the movies its a little less forgivable its not the end of the world to me it just tarnishes one of the things that made the mcu fun paying attention",2022-11-21 15:26:29

no,2022-12-28 17:08:44
it felt like they almost refused to acknowledge the other movies besides the first black panther though they did mention thanos thought it was a huge missed opportunity at the end for them not to use the shot of t’challa ramonda and shuri from the end of endgame,2022-11-15 06:19:50
ultron was so early on in phase 2  i tend to forget coogler wasnt even around for civil war he did a podcast interview with taneshi coates a week before the movie dropped  he reminded me that he didnt get called into play to make bp until after civil war was way on its way to release ultron is a mcu movie that theyve retconed a lot picked apart like a vulture  kinda forgot about in cannon for the most part i wouldnt be surprised if coogler wasnt thinking of ultron  his trickle down effect,2022-11-11 18:42:08
for a character so rich in comic lore what wasted potential in mcu,2022-11-15 01:28:23
thats just absurd even if ultron werent planning on destroying earth which he was ultron would be a serious problem for wakanda,2022-11-12 11:21:29
i mean he was really close to dropping an entire city into the earth which would’ve been catastrophic that would’ve affected wakanda,2022-11-14 16:04:42
threefour years before her appearance in black panther so well into her teens,2022-11-12 01:13:44
the sokovia accords are literally named after what ultron did sokovia is the nation ultron destroyed,2022-11-11 23:45:03
ultron is common knowledge the accords hank pym zemo and monica in wandavision all mention him and the events of age of ultron,2022-11-12 01:13:13
iirc one of the weapons vultures crew tries to sell in homecoming was described as being made with a subultron arm if a group of black market arms dealers are using that as a selling point to a low level street  then we can reasonably assume ultron is commonly known,2022-11-12 09:52:31
"the issue isnt everyone on earth though its people in wakanda

ultron was made from stolen vibranium even with the wakandas nonintervention policy their network of war dogs would have been aware of ultron",2022-11-12 14:24:03
what probably no one knows is that ultron was caused by an oopsie by tony stark otherwise what happened in no way home wouldve happened much sooner,2022-11-13 10:57:15

"considering that the end credits say that the black panther will return this seems like speculative bs that people like to spread as fact

im sorry i know youre just reiterating what you and your friends were discussing but i just hate the spread of speculative information and hearsay as fact

in fairness it could be true i certainly am just in the dark as you are 

but the info you are sharing doesnt seem accurate especially with how the film ends mbaku may be on the throne but shuri is still the black panther by the end of the movie theres nothing suggesting she wont be in a future installment by the final scene its not like jane fosters thor in love and thunder where that was clearly a onetime thing wakanda forever makes it clear theres more story with the character",2022-11-24 08:13:36
i  hope its mbaku shuri might be the most obnoxious and annoying character in all of the mcu,2022-11-17 03:48:20
good dont like the actress,2023-01-10 06:08:08
"mbaku challenging shuri is there

angela has been jacked ever since she played tina turner 30 years ago,2022-11-15 04:19:18
i kept looking at her arms and shoulders she was in shape michaela coel should get some credit too for bulking up for her role those back muscles were impressive,2022-11-17 03:48:11
insanely beautiful,2022-11-30 03:55:00
yes,2022-12-11 22:11:03
that’s a good point i think they should’ve put some muscles in the suit to compensate for her slender frame,2023-02-17 02:28:22
very true and she looks great but shes more the exception than the rule,2022-11-14 17:06:06
very true and she looks great but shes more the exception than the rule,2022-11-14 17:06:13
fair point so shouldnt she  at fighting and hand to hand combat yet she doing spinning kicks backflip gainers and ninja moves strength does not coordination and grace make bruce banner got pretty strong as the hulk and steve rogers as cap but neither were doing acrobatics the next day if tony stark got super strength and speed wed all still be like wait how does he know how to do more than throw some punches which was established that he practices boxing at least  monger was a trained warrior and its implied so was tachalla,2022-11-24 23:35:29
except she became as skilled as tchalla the moment she became the black panther while he spent his entire life training up to belooks suspiciously like it was written for tchalla but then jump imposed her onto those scenes,2022-11-28 18:55:29

"if anything its worse than it used to be watch a movie from the 70s and even action heroes are dudes with normal almost dad bodies 

i doubt its a coincidence that even comedic actors are now spending their entire lives in the gym 

the two examples you gave are not very well known heroes from one specific movie marvel is clearly still wanting the vast majority of its male heroes to be roided out",2022-12-06 15:38:16
yeah the jabari guy in the fur was realistic stacked i love bodies like that they look actual strong and stout,2022-11-16 14:58:45

"im not really sure what youre trying to say here do you think that the entirety of a persons physique is determined by genetics and that its impossible to become more or less muscular

its pretty obvious that men playing super heroes are expected to bulk up and become muscular and women playing superheroes are expected to be slender and thin matching eachs gender roles for attractiveness leticia is rail thin she absolutely couldve put on some muscle for the movie",2022-11-14 21:02:46

i thought a high budget power rangers episode turned on for a bit ,2022-11-12 03:41:53
i liked riri but the suit did look like power rangers garbage,2022-11-14 01:46:31
"i really liked the movie but the entire final battle bothered me we just had this whole meditation on grief  death and loss or as much as a marvel movie ever will give us both black panther movies focus heavily on the use of violence as a means and both movies roundly reject them then when the fight happens instead of showing violence as having a cost its instead slomo glamour shots of the newest action hero to buy your kids  i get it merchanidising and building character hype builds the franchise and makes  but ugh after priming me for a costly violent war you then go and sanitize it all by having the 19 year old in the power armur be like hey i got my first  d d d look at my pulse lasers isnt violence cool   


this isnt necessarily a problem i love arnold movies but those movies arent going in with the plot line of violence isnt the solution  they usually advocate violence is the solution it felt all the more weird when black panther v namor was shot in a way that spoke to the drama and the destruction of violence there was no heroism in black panthers maiming of namor and black panther didnt beat namor by out chadding him or anything she burned him horrifically with a fire and watched him struggle it was uncomfortable to watch in a good way so its not the movie makers were unaware how to do this 

i always struggle to get into marvel because they always prevent their movies from moving anywhere too far from cool super chads beat up some neer do weller  this one came so very close but the need to sell  iron mega man figurines took me right out at the climax",2022-11-15 01:04:40
the design for iron hearts suit was sooo bad and unlike marvel imo it felt like baymax,2022-11-13 08:48:25
glad its not just me that really didnt like the iron heart suit it looked like a mech or something all the other designs were stunning but this and the one okoye had were terrible,2022-11-13 15:22:35
i was like yep heres the mcu signature,2022-11-13 00:02:07
agreed with the new suits the flying robot and the clunky cgi black panther it was just too much,2022-11-15 05:44:00
"they even put a carbon copy of iron mans suit freezingher losing oxygen then removing it and powering on in the last secondher getting conscious and powering up most of the jokes were terrible tchalla spent yearsdecades training to be black panther then shuri immediately became super skilled that voltron whatever suit even had chest beam

i have so many gripes with this movie tchallas death including the worst offender of all though is all the talk how powerful wakanda and atlantisi cant remember the name are yet they look so  weak yes all of the underwater people are basically low level captain americas with vibranium spears but they exist in a world of such powerful characters and technology that they just look weak as ",2022-11-28 18:48:51
oh just wait until the next ant man movies takes a 2 hr trip into shark boy and lava girl territory,2022-11-12 12:51:31
the midnight angels were a bit too much for me too not that anything in this movie was really “grounded” but the wacky flying suits did kind of feel overthetop riri’s final suit was pretty wacky too but i did like that her earlier one really felt like an iron man suit built in a garage inuniverse obviously it was far beyond what someone could do in real life and her final suit did at least kind of feel like what someone who built her earlier suit in a garage would build if they suddenly had access to incredibly advanced technology,2022-12-12 06:26:05
why does the ironheart suit look so much worse and more cgi than tonys suits like it seems like the cgi is getting worse in these movies over time because they are just cranking them out,2023-02-07 16:49:18
"it turned into a mecha anime

ironheart had a definite anime vibe to it",2022-11-15 20:57:22
"the funny thing is that every time the suit came up someone would mock it so youd think the movie was setting up making some change to make it visually appealing

nope",2022-11-12 20:37:55
"i also couldnt believe how bad iron hearts suit was in the final battle   
i went in with so much hype for her because i like the idea of going back to the early mechanical iron man suits but more bulky instead we got power rangers

i also found her humour obnoxious",2022-11-12 04:02:58
and also draw away and trap the superpowered flying hulk level threat so they can weaken him enough to be barely defeated the flying suits were  vital in the wakandans not getting absolutely steamrolled,2022-11-17 07:19:49
no reason they couldnt change,2022-11-19 09:04:02
is having that mantle handed to you as an unprepared adolescent not more pressure as the only son of the last king he cant really choose to just not take on the responsibility,2022-12-19 16:11:24

i’m amazed you and anyone else even buys that  what aboht every heir in every civilization to ever have existed that’s what they all go through and no one is worse for it that’s why you spend your life being prepared for it",2022-11-29 01:37:42
i never thought about that before but this is probably it shuri and ramonda were on the topic of tchalla always being with them in that chat so it makes sense that ramonda was about to tell shuri about the son too,2022-11-26 23:54:56
i was expecting her to talk about t’challa dealings with the sea people,2022-12-31 14:52:25
if you believe tough times make strong men then it makes sense tchalla grew up pretty isolated and as a result was pretty traditional in how he addressed the world until killmonger forced him to change i think tchalla jr is going to be more comic accurate and be a child of the world,2022-11-13 20:48:56
"also why haiti it’s a hot mess

yeaaa that was an odd choice especially showing it so idylic

i guess mcu haiti isnt plagued by roaming gang violence",2022-11-14 13:15:52
because haiti brings forth the strongest men and women in the western world,2022-11-25 23:16:49

more info here





in the film during the flashback story scene for namors motherpeople you see the shaman dive down to get the plant growing out the vibranium in the cenote so i guess its implied that the vibranium was there because of the asteroid",2023-05-20 20:59:24

there’s a 5 year time skip in endgame that t’challa missed since he got snapped,2022-11-12 07:54:49
more like region war,2023-01-03 20:29:40
i just finished watching it and i was so disappointed with what they did with okoye danai acted her  off and her fights scenes are awesome and they just stick her in a cg sonic suit for some occasional quips,2023-02-28 09:12:21
man in the back of my mind i always new it would be shuri as the little sister it just makes sense from a script writing standpoint but i like nakia and okoye soooo much better than shuri that i kept hoping for it,2023-03-12 01:54:07
that’s messed up i didn’t even know that,2022-11-18 17:19:39
my theatre turned the lights on during yhe mid credit scene so you couldnt see their faces ,2022-11-13 12:44:44
in my theatre the lights stayed off even after the end of the credits and everyone stayed in the dark not willing to believe there is no post credit scene although the movie was obviously over,2022-11-16 22:22:23
i heard the audio callback when i rewatched endgame recently so idk,2022-11-11 12:05:07
on behalf of every theater worker we hate you,2022-11-11 05:14:12
there were a lot of people waiting for the next showing so they were trying to get it changed over asap,2022-11-11 13:56:10
you kiddin another harry styles and patton oswald appearance would have been perfect,2022-11-14 04:19:10
yes it was spiderman no way home i’m still a bit angry about it — i usually check wikipedia as the credit rolls to check whether there are mid and endcredit scenes and surely only the midcredits scene was mentioned on the wikipedia page i therefore left the theater right after it was pretty upset when i found out the exclusive at the time mom trailer was being shown at the very end oh well i watched it on youtube a few weeks later…,2022-11-14 16:16:02
shangchi and the legend of the ten rings,2022-11-14 04:20:31
they played the full thing at the beginning then cut in im still watching again at the very end,2022-11-13 08:04:10
actually no never have in my life but ive worked a lot of  jobs on time constraints i have a lot of respect for people who work in industries where you have to clean up after others,2022-11-12 20:59:51
i thought he was pointing out him not knowing whether they were killed or not,2022-11-23 17:21:51
"it reminded me of the  human predator iron man suit from the recent the predator movie

its my new suit bubba does come in 32 long  ",2022-11-12 18:00:33
as  as that movie was i almost wanted to see the iron predator sequel,2023-02-17 22:33:13
i literally said looked like some steam punk outift the crew of  boy would have come up with i utterly wiffed on the characters name,2022-11-12 00:52:26
the fish people who had a rock band in majora’s mask,2022-11-12 00:39:36
oh  that’s spot on,2022-11-13 05:11:15
never have i ever agreed with something so much lol,2022-12-17 12:00:40
"you need to replay metroid 

looked more like abe sapien",2022-11-11 04:37:56
throwing her on his planted axe was savage,2022-11-13 08:02:40
100 marvel hire the best stunt performers and then bury their craft in cuts and cg they need more of scenes like this that show clean movement and build drama with movement,2022-11-14 07:41:42
i also really loved the very first fight with the dora milaje  the final fight was actually really disappointing,2022-11-14 19:15:12
" big talocan guy

thats attuma whos a marvel villain with a long history  not just a disposable   expect him to be reused in a future movie",2022-11-16 16:32:21
yeah rematch with a super suit was lame,2022-11-21 09:05:31
the did attuma dirty comics attuma would have absolutely wrecked her with ease,2022-11-25 21:11:43
i said it in a different comment but the brutal fighting style and the sound effects reminded me of the more recent mortal kombat games and moves  so cool,2022-11-15 03:55:54
up there with the skyscraper fight in shang chi,2022-11-21 00:39:22
"marvel needs to do this more

ive rewatched the bus scene in shang chi so many times

i dont even even any of the nonsense in the final act",2022-11-16 11:10:33
his entire character was intoxicating  i could not take my eyes off him when he was on screen and just wanted more,2022-11-12 20:35:15
"the final fight was supposed to be intensely personal between shuri and namor so having it on a big scale wouldnt make sense

i also think the fight on the boat which was large scale was meant to satiate the audiences appetite for the big final fight while also allowing the more personal battle to happen on the beach",2022-11-11 21:29:15
well he was all dried out which made him weak,2022-11-13 00:06:53
for me the final fight problem you mention has also been a staple of mcus phase 4 films with the exception of no way home,2022-11-13 10:22:30
someone above mentioned i missed this too that the talokan herb gives healing factor thats why the warriors heal she mixed talokan dna from the bracelet with the wakanda  in the printer bada bing crossbreed herb,2022-11-16 15:19:30
shuris suit stitched her up,2022-11-14 06:15:23
i assumed she used the magic bracelet to give the suit healing powers somehow shrug,2022-11-15 05:56:32

im always amazed that people dont realize how bad aquaman would smell,2022-11-12 04:51:22
a badass whose most badass feat is trying to  a child and failing at that,2022-11-11 21:29:51
well his people might be able to they tamed friggin blue whales and orcas in this movie,2022-11-12 06:44:07
" does namor talk to fish like aquaman 

yes",2022-11-11 23:30:34
nothing says they can talk to fish but they sure managed to tame them,2022-11-13 12:49:01
not gonna lie when he first showed up i thought they were fish lol,2022-11-12 07:37:28
he looks so badass and then there is the wings fluttering,2022-11-11 16:53:56
thats what happens with mutations sometimes you get some really cool  like instaregeneration and bone claws while someone else gets cute tiny wings on his ankles,2022-11-19 06:03:08
good thing he has less of them lol,2022-11-11 16:07:42
"good  his wing feet and speedo were so bad attuma and namora had some cool costumes and then here comes this dude

the one scene where he had the ceremonial headdress was badass he should have worn that the entire movie",2022-11-12 03:49:44
as opposed to flying with no wings like superman,2022-11-16 17:29:02
its just comic books stuff,2022-11-13 04:29:52
prime iron man is stronger than vision peak hulk and base thor namor would get pieced up by any iron man suit aou and onwards namor is more of the tier below the demigod level fighters and on the upper end of the super soldier level characters,2022-11-26 11:34:20

"gave it  
this is the cia were talking about theyd take it by force",2022-11-14 23:11:53
my post was from the perspective of namor  his assumption was this scientist specifically built a machine to find vibranium and that was his reasoning for killing them,2022-11-13 17:09:36
 hes gonna play a role similar to magneto where  do whatever is necessary,2022-11-14 04:00:15
yeah i love that he isnt dead please let him live up to what we saw in this movie marvel,2022-11-27 21:42:07
i hope they milk the  out of his character because were never getting a solo movie,2023-01-11 17:07:41
ah so you prefer villains that are the hero but mean and in purple type,2022-11-13 16:40:18
not only is he one of marvel’s oldest characters he’s one of the oldest comic book characters in general i believe he was first released in 1939 he was introduced three years after the first ever comic book character was and is up there w batman and superman in terms of history,2022-11-13 01:49:52
coogler said that namor is hulkthor level in terms of power if he gets that hydration suit like he has in the comics then he can be used outside of earth,2022-11-13 20:35:24
that man is a risk taker lol,2022-11-13 01:24:38
a 19 year old college student with no combat experience built and learned how to pilot a suit well enough to take on a 500 year old mutant warrior in a week im all for suspending disbelief for the sake of story and agree its easy to be overly critical but thats a bit of a stretch she didnt beat him but she did seem to hold her own a little too well,2022-11-14 00:51:05
i will say it did bother me that they didnt have her making the suit more efficiently with 3d printing and engineering  there was one brief scene where they showed her hammering a piece of metal like there is no way you should be wasting that kind of time,2022-11-29 06:23:00
the mental gymnastics and the bringing up of the actual actress’s real life politics is so cringe,2022-11-13 07:26:50
lol now that you bring up thanos i wonder how talocan handled the blip,2022-11-19 23:44:53
not to mention they keep calling wakanda the most advanced civilization on earth and talokan is supposed to rival it but we literally see nothing in terms of any high tech anything other than the artificial sun and this is the nation thats supposed to rival wakanda i felt really let down that they didnt seem to give the mayan culture the same amount of thought and isolated development that they gave to wakanda its like if we only saw the farmers etc in wakanda and their capital in the distance and they drove there in suvs and didnt fly like sure theres hints of it but it felt almost like an afterthought,2022-11-28 06:41:58

"it was supposed to be a sharks mouthjaw right

but yeah first thing i thought of too was dbz",2022-11-11 08:54:50
and also talokan i guess they didn’t want it to feel too like aquaman so they just barely scratched that surface intentionally,2022-11-11 07:52:45
motivation is fully clear he is trying to protect his people from slavery or abusing their material just like walanda how more clear do you need to be theyve been living secluded until now like lol,2022-11-12 09:44:30
was happy they didnt  him off,2022-11-11 07:45:04
really  while i would’ve welcomed more of him i feel like his motivations were pretty clear he will do literally whatever it takes to protect talokan if that means protecting the world  do it if that means destroying the world  do it,2022-11-12 06:54:15
yesssss he was so well written and acted,2022-11-15 04:14:17
yeah i was intrigued by his relationship with the director and how it would unfold oh youre talking about namor,2022-11-21 10:50:42
given the big role he plays in the comics i’m hoping he plays a big role in the mcu going forward,2022-12-12 06:52:15
it definitely felt like something that was there more to serve the mcu than the movies narrative i imagine val will pop up one or two more times before thunderbolts,2022-11-12 11:32:01
i was so sure that the film was going in a direction where talokan and wakanda teamed up to fight against american attacks for vibranium it felt like thats where it was going with all the talks at the un at the start and the seeming bonding between namor and shuri surely they could have saved riri by pointing out that she didnt even sell her weapon she built it for school and it was appropriated,2022-11-14 23:14:47
100,2022-11-17 14:42:40
other than this movie have they killed civilians though,2022-11-12 07:30:40
eh i mean wakanda gave him so many outs they just wanted the princess back if that girl didnt try to  the princess she wouldnt of died namor went to wakanda and killed a bunch of civilians and their queen he clearly was in the wrong there,2022-11-15 12:29:25
or maybe its maybelline,2022-11-17 06:58:48
hes an ice cold  killer,2022-11-13 00:29:36
there’s no way they would do any cgi necromancy in a marvel movie they save that kind of disrespect for star wars only,2022-11-14 20:26:40
i thought it was funny that shuri remembering tchalla only had scenes from the movies like i know why obviously but i was there thinking like so you dont have any memories of him from like when you were kids huh or like just chilling around wakanda just those moments of him when the world is about to be wiped out by thanos cool cool,2022-11-21 10:41:15
my wildcard theory was that after chadwick told marvel about his condition maybe they agreed to film some scenes of him in the ancestral plane in case he had to be written out  but in hindsight im glad they didnt,2022-11-13 18:58:13
he’s groot so in space i guess,2022-11-13 00:47:10
oh my  when the car was all shiny and new at the end my bf literally whispered “is this where vin diesel shows up” ,2022-11-12 20:42:23
ehh agree to disagree she lost her husband then her son and then the breaking point is when she also thinks she has lost shuri her last remaining child and family member leaving her the sole member of her family alive up until then she had stayed strong but losing everyone seemed to me to be something that would break anyone and it made sense that she would take it out on the person who made that final loss possible regardless of what theyd done for her before,2022-11-23 12:56:15
i thought it was pretty obvious that the everything she was referring to was more  in regards to emotionally rather than literally,2022-11-28 03:42:22
if you watch the rest of the movie she dies and gives up literally everything to save an outsider,2022-11-23 04:43:31

"i mean she was responsible for one of his people being killed in the rescue mission where she even called him away for

adam warlock is more unambiguously good but he it also on such a high level that certain things are beneath him in the comics he and thanos start as arch rivals but end as friends of sorts after a story where they see why neither of them should be given godlike power,2022-11-13 09:40:19
they didn’t specifically reference i think they were alluding to the fact that in the comics he fits that role,2022-11-11 06:30:58
 this idiot keeps posting the same stuff over and over in this thread  killing a child genocide the world wannabe  someone start a gofundme to get this person some much needed therapy its sad,2022-11-11 11:42:23
well it’s genocide the world or the world genocides him i don’t blame him look at what the frenchies and yanks tried to do to wakanda for vibranium,2022-11-11 10:36:15
she was 19 which is not a child,2022-11-11 16:53:54
namor didnt care who it was they can find vibranium they gotta go hes not bound by stuff like morals only survival of his empire,2022-11-13 00:13:55
he had amid credits is after the stylized credits and title cards before the actual rolling credits start and post credit is after the rolling credits,2022-11-11 12:23:25
i wouldn’t go that far personally,2022-11-12 11:52:24

i have such mixed feelings on that thing and the light colored one like they look cool but they definitely look more like mega man characters but also they look somewhat on the line of just as upright and personlike as gallade,2022-11-11 14:55:37

and they did that  where they peeled back the mask for like a 3 second quip and then put it back on ugh,2022-11-11 04:43:47
its so they can sub stunt doubles easier its also why all the women fighter have long loose hair,2022-11-13 12:53:24
then give the suit to someone else she’s already her own action figure in her own guard uniform,2022-11-11 21:24:08
i dont know man shes a pretty  good actress pretty much everybody in the movie was,2022-11-15 04:52:30
yeah same here i was a bit happy when okoye’s final attack was a kick even after all that spear talk,2022-11-11 17:50:30
i didnt mind them either riris was great,2022-11-12 15:07:41

that design is pretty good just cover the silly fishnets and youre good to go,2022-11-12 21:28:38
the colors for one,2022-11-12 04:32:14
its not that easy not only do they risk damaging the machine if they reverse engineer it but she written algorithms into it and she even talk about how her data in lab was safely encrypted it is assumed that she is probably an algorithms mastermind if the cia werent able to build such a machine before she did,2022-11-13 22:07:38
its dumb but its dumb in the same way that nobody else being able to reverse engineer the iron man suits for so many films was dumb i tend to headcanon marvel super genius characters as having superpowers in the same way as the super strong ones so their inventions are genuinely unique to them,2022-11-20 18:20:13
" shuris decision  had no reason

wrong mbaku tells shuri that killing namor will result in an eternal war as his name translates to feathered serpent  meaning hes worshipped by his people she didnt want to be like killmonger despite giving into the emotions of vengeance at the time character development

writing was great i dont know why people are  on it every decision felt very human and believable",2022-11-29 00:57:02
the complexity isnt in the machine it was in her algorithm cia cant just take out the memory chips to save the binary code written on it without risking destroying the chip entirely,2022-11-13 22:10:40
vibramium is extremely rare so the sea operation could have been a trial run to see if the machine actually works why dismantle a machine you dont even know works might as well wait to see if it actually works,2022-12-13 12:50:13
he didnt it was a comparison to america chavez which he though fell flat its a very common way of phrasing things understandable if english isnt your first language but maybe dont assume the worst in people,2022-11-19 23:29:01

there was one dude in the back of my theater repeatedly saying  thats  up,2022-11-13 16:47:40
same so cringe,2022-11-21 04:08:23
fortunately ive only experienced it once and that was at the end title card of the dark knight which felt earned,2022-11-17 01:14:24
the only instance where people clapped during a movie i watched was after the paul walker tribute at the end of ff7 that felt appropriate but during wakanda forever fortunately the theater stayed silent during the first couple of minutes,2022-11-27 13:39:37
really  i’ve been to plenty of movies in ny dallas milwaukee columbus so a pretty decent crosssection as i’ve moved around the country and have never encountered this problem,2022-11-29 19:10:38
 that sounds awesome,2022-11-11 17:04:08
it was so funny seeing her in the movie as this genius scientist manipulating dna to recreate the heart herb and in real life she didnt want to get vaccinated to film the movie ,2022-11-13 00:27:23

lol dude,2022-11-13 09:40:43
i especially like how he counseled against war which turned out to be correct  so they play on his physical strength but his wisdom was on display,2022-11-12 03:13:42
"m’baku saved t’challa’s life  saved nakia okoye etc  fought alongside them against thanos and had the most reasonable perspective in this movie as well

he’s earned the title of king",2022-11-12 07:09:29
"and he seemed to have a level head despite how bruttist and strong he is his people are also fiercely loyal to him 

im gonna guess he rules wakanda while shuri is black panther",2022-11-13 13:44:50
what about prince tchalla thats the real battle,2022-11-11 06:56:35
hes good at gorilla guerilla warfare,2023-01-31 09:07:01
gorillas,2022-11-11 11:00:19
there was the scene towards the end where namor is telling the woman why he yielded to then after comforting her he goes back to the hieroglyphics on the wall and he’s tracing an imagine i know i saw a panther and i think it was being attacked but there was 12 other things with it do you remember what it was  it was such a quick scene i didn’t get a chance to absorb it all,2022-11-11 12:53:28
black gorilla would be sick,2022-11-11 08:35:43
i wonder how the people in the mcu can believe in one  when they see beings like thor and loki and basts blessings with their own eyes   id think thanos was a  if he came down wielding that infinity gauntlet,2022-11-12 05:05:13
i hate how blank panthers gods are now just a joke because of that thor movie,2022-11-11 20:27:13
are the monotheistic or do they just have patron gods because i don’t really see how one could not believe in a  that demonstrably exists and gives the sovereign of the country you live in super powers instead i assume they just don’t worship that ,2022-11-12 14:57:24
explains the giant gorilla statue in the background of their settlement would be awesome to see him get powers though,2022-11-13 07:59:56
isnt it kind of assumed that black panther is the avatar of bast,2022-11-14 15:26:23
both designwise and the name manape from the comics have some problematic connotations which is probably why the movies dont really delve much into that aspect of mbaku but they do have the jabari reference hanuman on multiple occasions it would be cool if they could find a way to make it work though,2022-11-17 05:58:16
i mean he’s manape isn’t he i hope m’baku doesn’t take a villain turn or nakia for that matter i like them both so much,2022-11-13 07:25:14
but really though they had enough purple drank in that bowl for like 5 black panthers they went through all that fuss to get a new heart plant and she doesnt even finish it off,2022-11-12 04:35:19
except m’baku is a vegetarian in the mcu,2022-11-14 04:09:40
i think the ill feed you to my children were vegetarian line is to show theyre different from the comics,2022-11-14 04:10:17
theyre vegetarians,2022-11-15 05:10:33
shouldve shown that or at least have him prepare for combat by getting better armor or a better weapon,2022-11-13 06:26:37
"shuri has now the literal genome to reproduce the plant ive also got a theory that its even more powerful than the original as she used the genome of the talokan variety and it will reveal unexpected underwater abilities

 a big issue of wakanda is that it seem too overly dependent on the singular figure of the panther if multiple people could share that burden

 a hybrid of the wakandan and talokan vibranium plants could become the symbol of an effective peace and alliance between them compared to now as its more of an uneasy truce",2022-11-12 18:46:47

botany is significantly easier than 3d printing,2022-11-11 12:34:17

"ugg yes i had the same thought i wanted to be amazed by the visuals of the underwater city and the score was perfect for it but i was just kind of left with a lot of floating forms backlit in confusing compositions

there was an avatar trailer just before this movie too and its pretty hard not to draw comparisons to the vibrant world in that trailer this just felt flat and boring",2022-11-11 18:12:14
that’s my biggest complaint about the movie so many of the visualsscenes were wildly underlit which i guess helps save on cgi that it was kinda stale in a lot of scenes,2022-11-12 21:21:18
all films are trending darker thanks to digital cameras certain scenes in this movie seem like they would only work on an oled display,2022-11-15 16:59:55
id say worse than house of the dragon night and underwater scenes  were near pitch black,2022-11-12 02:26:47
my thoughts exactly a lot of the scenes were very dark especially the underwater stuff where you are expected to be awed by the city like our pov character shuri but ends up feeling like a remote village with minimal lights they probably did so to differentiate it from the techno city vibe of atlantis from aquaman,2022-11-11 14:07:45
couldn’t see anything,2022-11-11 14:13:57
"it easier to create visual effects if the lighting is so low that you just leave large parts blank in black its cost effective and time effective 

thats the problem with modern blockbuster genre movies the script says the world is this massive complex thing or the action scene has thousands of people going at it because that is what the public expects now but in order to render it it would take a visual effects team years to match the imagination of the director not a few months or worse a few weeks never mind the additional cost of it so again the solution is to muddy the scene",2022-11-11 20:44:17

i mean the us military was the first one to even have supes if you consider cap and the super soldier serum and that ultimately didnt go all that well for them in the end,2022-11-11 08:19:42
werent the avengers meant to be that at first,2022-11-11 08:41:36
"well they already kind of tried that with the sokovia accords and they have supers like formerly falcon and war machine expressly working for the military as opposed to a cap who will fight for them but only for good cause its just hard to combat supers without your own and most of them have no reason to be loyal to any one nation especially when theyre combatting global threats that they cant fight worrying about oversight 

thats what the thunderbolts is meant to fix",2022-11-11 07:06:21
government man  moves at a snails pace you know how it is,2022-11-12 06:56:57
"thats just the inherent issue with comic books in general let alone the mcu you cant really allow anything to ever reach its logical conclusion otherwise the story stops working

like the us military has had unmitigated access to stark tech for an extremely long time the bad guy in spiderman homecoming was building power armor the  equal to any wakandan tech out of scraps rody has been rocking war machine armor which the military has had access to for years there is no logical reason why 50 of the us military isnt flying around in iron man suits in these movies especially special forces guys whose job is to secure vibranium

but then it would be a lot harder to make these movies if that were the case you would be stuck in an infinite loop of escalation if all the mooks are in power armor then the guys who beat up the mooks have to be stronger than the power armor guys what is mbaku or one of the spear women going to do against 5 iron mans blasting them with missiles and lasers from 800 feet in the air it just doesnt really fit the narrative that the writers are looking for and this movie kind of inadvertently makes that point for us in the very beginning that special forces woman who dies in the helicopter the atlanteans are supposed to be this godtier super power with unstoppable troops but she killed at least five atlanteans with just a pistol before namor took her out if the wakandans had been armed with m4s instead of spears that final battle would have been a slaughter based on everything weve seen of these guys capabilities but would that have made for as fun and engaging of a story obviously not",2022-11-14 08:16:07
"thats been the reason for a lot of different conflictsvillains in the mcu is trying to find a way to create superhumans just focusing on attempts to replicate the super soldier serum we have the hulk was made from trying to replicate the serum with gamma rays zola was recruited into shield at least in part o would imagine on his ability to create the knockoff serum that bucky was subjected to in the hydra facility karli and the flag smashers got theirs from the power broker who was trying to use it for typical arms dealer  and russia got one successful super soldier in the red guardian who was then mismanaged and imprisoned for 20 years

then outside the sss we have justin hammer and all the other military agencies trying to make their own iron man armour in iron man 2 aim and extremis in iron man 3 the yellowjacket suit from antman white vision from wandavision etc

theyve always been trying theyve just rarely succeeded and so far when they do succeed they get emil blonsky tearing up harlem john walker committing a war crime on video and hammer drones shooting up new york

so they didnt really have someone who could be sent on that mission unless we wanted to give the french a random superhuman for funsies the us has john walker but he works for val and she probably wouldnt want to loan him to the seals on this mission especially when they seemed confident there wasnt going to be any resistance on site",2022-11-11 09:19:56
"realistically its been 56 years since the world had a worldwide thanos sized threat idk if thats enough time to completely reboot their operating strategies especially when half the world was gone for the last 5 

there is still a looot of regular crime that you don’t need superheros for they just miscalculated what they were ip against",2022-11-11 17:51:48
the us military used different tech to hunt the hulk in his movie,2022-11-11 23:14:37
"from an inworld perspective that assumes that you can just pull people with super powers off the streets without much effort that they are capable and willing to train to be military special forces 

from a exterior perspective you can probably pull some dlister up to get their teeth kicked in by the dora milaje but youd need to add screen time to add them to the fight in a meaningful way and it feels like theres a lot of movie here already 

besides keeping normal looking special forces types cops maffia goons street thugs etc helps reinforce the idea of the real world but superheros in place and makes it seem all the more important when someone hires silver sable and the wild pack to do a thing",2022-11-14 18:10:12
im reminded of how cool the stormtroopers in the force awakens knew how to deal with people with light sabers ot show they are learning,2022-11-15 10:47:46
gotta remember mutants arent a thing yet so there isnt just a random accumulation of people with super powers popping in and out of existence hard to draft an army with super powers without a source of them avengers and their ilk are rare theyre only recently in universe becoming more common and theres only so many hyper intelligent humans that make super weapons,2022-11-19 06:11:25

they made weapons and shot them at khamala,2022-11-11 16:43:01

"that whole scene is screaming for machine guns big chunky targets running forward in an open field   

but no lets go run into handtohand combat with them   

same thing happened to iron man remember how fking strong he was in the first film even in this scene his bullets are more effective than the energy weapons and compare that to him losing to capt and bucky   

based on these movies any legit military would run circles around all the supes namor flying around those little energy blasts is cute how does he do against flak modern point defense weapons",2022-11-13 02:14:09

except what exactly looked like it had changed for these people in 500 years apart from being blue underwater and having a sun for themselves wakanda gets to be this massively advanced culture and all we see of talokan is their breathing things water bombs and the fake sun it felt really awkward to me comparing the amount of thought they put into wakanda and what felt like the lack of it for talokan,2022-11-28 07:13:22
same there was gravitas,2022-11-11 23:42:47
almost as if spanish was his primary language oh wait,2022-11-29 02:23:54
i think it’s just a difference in accent,2022-11-11 06:53:07
naymore is the technically correct pronunciation it was the intention of the original creator and has been established precedent for decades when the character turns up in cartoons etc but in the context of the movie it was a little bit weird he introduces himself as nahmore and the explanation of his backstory links it to the spanish amor so theres like no logical reason why everyone else would use the comics pronunciation over the wrong one,2022-11-17 06:06:34
growing up you learned both ah and ay as a sound that the letter a makes  its harder when youre language doesnt have the same   i have hispanic friends that have trouble saying the ay sound  they pronounce it as ah quickly followed with a hard eahee,2022-11-11 15:11:23
nobody said the character is latino… he adds the accent when he first mentions the name “namor” because it’s the name that his enemies who are of latin descent gave him,2022-11-20 10:10:29
i dont have any previous of the character i just saw and accepted the character as is i didnt think once this character isnt supposed to be latino,2022-11-17 07:10:16
oh gotchaim not too familiar with the comicsbut thats cool,2022-11-11 22:43:33
as a non comic book fan he predates apocalypse holy ,2022-11-11 23:29:07
"yeah and its annoying fan are justifying it just because theyre  to naymor we dont even pronounce nasty as naysty in english so whose bright mind even decided that namor should be pronounced as naymor in the comics its even dumber that it doesnt make sense even in english and these crazy fans are like we speak english so its correct for us to pronounce it wrong like we do with paris and mexico  if you speak english then you should actually be saying it as nahmor 

and whats with comparing peoples name to location names anyway its way more disrespectful to mispronounce a persons name if someone pronounces your name wrong in real life and refuses to correct it even after being told then theyre just an  its not like you need to learn a whole different language to pronounce a name properly so many people in the anglosphere have this monolingual superiority complex and refuse to respect other languagescultures they get butthurt over being told theyre pronouncing something wrong and whine about how they speak english and not moon language

the debate on namors name is just a highlight of how insufferable the anglosphere can be when it comes to the wider world",2022-11-14 16:55:27
seems like a fairly minor nitpick to get so riled up over… but that’s just me i guess if you really stop to think about it though the much more disrespectful thing is that he tells them that’s just the name his enemies made up for him and they just go with calling him that rather than his preferred name,2022-11-20 10:17:28
im pretty sure a good amount of characters in this movie refer to him as naymor anyway,2022-11-13 05:52:13
now that you mention it where did all that water come from,2022-11-13 07:32:41

"  besides the fact we literally saw that happen during the talokans attack on wakanda where they killed the queen and caused tons of damage

my take on this is that ramonda fatally underestimates namor straight after demoting okoye she or okoyes replacement should have beefed up security maybe get the council of elders airborne 247 away from water she chooses stealth and directs nakia to retrieve her daughter

its not until much later in the movie wakanda puts in the research on how to defeat a waterbased enemy that has access to vibranium",2022-11-11 16:20:17
" like his people are strong they were winning but he lost and made them surrender because he was going to lose but his people were going to win


surrendering wasnt that bad a move for namor and his people he could have beaten the wakandans there but whether hed beat everyone back at jabariland is debatable and to what end hed be weakened and have to fight everyone else anyway 

but his bigger problem is that shuri could tell the world about talokan out of spite and theyd preemptively strike",2022-11-12 21:15:19

i thought the cia stuff nicely continued the narrative of the outside world being a legitimate threat proving and showcasing that namor was right to fear attacks from nations coming after their vibranium my only problem with the cia plot line is that it didnt really tie into the third act it just kinda ended but a lot of plot lines didnt really tie into the 3rd act and thats my big complaint overall about this movie compared to the first,2022-11-12 15:11:07
i dont think so seems like a forced set up for another movie cia lady is definitely making her own dark avengers,2022-11-13 13:48:11
i disagree it’s plays into the next movies things as bubbling up as the world wants access to vibranium with him being abducted the cia will have no inside scope into the inner workings of wakanda if i had to guess they will try to use shuri’s beads to crack the code in how to breach,2022-11-11 13:04:41

its funny thinking about it now the american thing really didnt add much to the movielike they could have cut a few cia scenes and have vals appearance to a post credit scenes that said atleast to me it didnt hinder the movie,2022-11-11 04:52:13
i don’t know i felt like you needed some external factors to legitimize namor’s fears yeah i do think it also helped setup thunderbolts but no way was it pointless to the movie at hand,2022-11-11 06:58:47
thunderbolts movie or bp3 either way the cias gonna invade wakanda in a future movie,2022-11-11 08:55:20
but what the  happens here that is relevant to thunderbolts at all why do i need to know who val’s banged i think she’s just here because they really want her to be the new nick furry and they’ve gotta find somewhere to put her so people develop an emotional connection i guess but ross is going to be in secret invasion so this will probably set up that somehow but also i’m pretty positive he’s a skrull so i don’t know if i’m going to care about what happens to him,2022-11-11 05:10:53
exactly they had to put her in a movie sometime cia director fits,2022-11-11 11:38:44

i agree the movie was overall decent but just like love  thunder they introduced a lot of interesting ideas that werent fleshed out or developed that could have made this movie much better,2022-11-11 11:26:39
you are both right this movie could’ve and absolutely  should’ve been split into 2 parts so many good ideas stuffed into one movie made it seem somehow bloated and rushed it’s a real shame to because they handled boseman’s passing incredibly well,2022-11-23 19:45:34
is wakanda’s location definitely still a secret i assumed that people knew the general location,2022-11-14 17:14:33
i was more talking about the actual character since she openly called the suit  multiple times throughout the movie but the actress probably doesn’t know what it looks like lol,2022-11-11 04:46:58
common trope in these movies at this point person winning throw their opponent through a wall or into something like a car which gives enough time to reset,2022-11-11 07:54:35
"wakanda took so many ls in that final battle

it wouldve been good character development for her to realize that and then accept defeat without  but nope just a bunch of flashbacks",2022-11-14 20:00:01
i think that only applies to namor himself due to him being some sort of mutant hybrid kind of like how hes also the only one of his people who can breath air,2022-11-11 05:51:15

i guess banner wore a suit too…",2022-11-11 18:36:57
ive always pondered why he didnt use extremis to heal rodeys spinal damage,2022-11-18 22:00:01
that sounds neat though being a manifestation of tony’s fear of his tech getting into the wrong hands this feels more like “hey wouldn’ be cool if we put iron man here” and no not it’s not,2022-11-11 05:22:19
im glad they separated ironheart from iron man but now i want to know how shell fit into armor wars considering her suit is stuck in wakanda,2022-11-13 02:24:34
what lol riri didn’t have much screen time at all compared to the wakandans,2022-11-11 18:29:14
and the comics never do dumb …,2022-11-11 10:50:16
except she did so shes just angry she didnt see her brother or mother,2022-11-16 20:03:24
the one reason i wont go see this in theaters and will just catch it eventually on disney plus,2022-11-13 19:21:47
thank you,2022-11-13 18:13:03
people keep saying this narrative but several cast  crew have said that she never talked about her vaccine status on set  it was never an issue either way marvel didnt seem to be bothered by her health status  kept her employed so its no logical reason for casual viewers of a piece of entertainment to be holding a grudge against an actor theyll never even meet like this,2022-11-14 20:19:44
at the very least its alanis morissette level irony,2022-11-11 08:46:54
thanks for the armchair contribution captain lexicon rest easy tonight that’ll do,2022-11-11 06:48:20
emma frost as well,2022-11-12 07:14:17
ha too bad well have to wait till well after 2024 to see anything if any about this on screen,2022-11-14 12:18:56
magician to stretchy to cuck what character arc,2022-12-30 14:46:27

"better context

",2022-11-13 23:03:04
"to be fair dude is like over 400 years old at this point everyone is younger than him

except asgardians",2022-11-12 06:25:52
im confused he sexed a tapeworm,2022-11-11 22:08:56
who is he talking to,2022-11-11 22:48:27
i feel like these movies focus on magical tech while ignoring realworld tech we use now val turning on the tv so ross can see anderson cooper announce the death of the queen is so quaintly 1990s when his phone alerts would have been going off all night  when queen elizabeth died my phone was buzzing all day and i’m a civilian not a cia operative,2022-11-13 10:56:20
gotta love that the first diplomatic contact namor had with wakanda was literally just demanding something of the queen and princess and then threatening them while theyre alone and unprotected youd think 500 years wouldve given him time to have a a touch of patience b some diplomatic smarts,2022-11-28 07:26:24
then why was his first contact with wakanda seeking out and finding the queen and princess alone and vulnerable then demanding something from them before threatening them and leaving not exactly the best way to start an alliance of any kind,2022-11-28 07:28:34
it still doesnt make sense or answer anything he himself said he his civilization can destroy wakanda without any resistance they won the final battle even with it being a trap if he desperately wants to wage war on the world why not just include wakanda as a part of that list,2022-11-16 08:20:44
it’s like weirdly short sighted though there’s gonna be like 10 mega geniuses in the mcu who could build the device that riri did and they haven’t even introduced mr fantastic i imagine namor keeps some tabs on what’s going on on the surface,2022-11-11 04:55:02
"first namor was cool because he is oh so noble now he is a genocider that is dead set on killing children because why not

cant be both so which is it",2022-11-11 04:36:55
but he plays a 453 yearold,2022-11-13 10:40:30
and angela bassett is in her 60s,2022-11-14 08:45:30
holy  i legit thought he was like 2829 ,2023-01-31 19:13:34
what the  never would have guessed,2022-12-03 22:13:34
so are their kids born that way or do they need to keep going to the surface to get more of the plant tchalla was not born a black panther despite his ancestors being black panthers so how is the talocan gene passed down if they are related plant species,2022-11-25 21:35:23
"actually thats not at all how pressure works if their bodies are made to live in the pressures of the deep ocean their bodies would fall apart and split open in the comparatively pressureless open air of the surface world   


lets just assume its generalized im a superhuman",2022-11-12 00:56:36
"i agree that was confusing  they really needed to clear that up  could’ve just been an easy line in the movie without wasting too much time


my guess is they are probably saving it for a namor movie",2022-11-12 04:37:22
yep they cant be killed by spears but one hit from a sonic gun does why,2022-11-12 21:44:31
"its kinda weird on the first watch but on the second watch it didnt bug me much since you can infer enough to make it make sense

x200b

the ones on the bridge are warriors trained to master their senses so they can shrug off wounds from blades the one who died was probably a caretaker or just a citizen it showed in her hesitation a warrior wouldve just cut shuris throat so she got oneshot

x200b

or maybe their race is just really susceptible to sonic attacks and namor didnt have the time go oh  they hit with a sonic blast thats fatal to us a knife wound sure we can deal with that but a sonic blast youre deader than dead",2022-11-14 22:29:04
thats because air is a fluid both gases and liquids are fluids because they dont have a defined shape,2022-11-13 05:01:50
reminded me of the khan from mortal kombat so cool looking,2022-11-18 08:43:35
i liked that she was still getting rolled  he was shown way stronger so even weakened hed be something and despite the heart shaped herb power she wasnt an amazingly trained fighter before,2022-11-12 04:23:45
exhausting sounds a bit dramatic,2022-11-12 21:52:41
"is it that hard to understand though  even if you didnt see her in the falcon and the winter soldier her role here perfectly encapsulates her character shes the director of the cia whose purpose has shifted from traditional spycraft against the likes of russia or china to wakanda vibranium and super humans  its easy to see why the us government would have a role in this movie in fact i disagree with people thinking her role was unnecessary  showing how the us reacts to these worldwide skirmishes expands the world building  in bp1 we really only saw ross  it makes no sense an international issue such as wakanda opening up would only involve one lone cia agent so of course there are bigger players in the mix  

i would have liked an expanded role for her dropping hints that they are recruiting or trying to create super humans to make a team after nick furys in their eyes avengers project kind of blew up in his face  set this in the background of the wakanda and talokan war and to me it does a perfect job of deferring to the main plot in this movie and setting up a future one  i mean if people though val came out of nowhere here imagine how they would feel if she shows up in 2 or 3 years in a thunderbolts movie  might as well get the intro movie version out of the way here and gives us a reason to have ross leave the us and join the wakandans",2022-11-11 22:42:50
i have a feeling shell be in charge in thunderboltskinda like amanda waller in suicide squad,2022-11-13 23:21:57
that was pretty much the point of why she had a decent size role in this film explained her backstory and shows she’s ten steps ahead of everyone else,2022-11-12 03:30:22
shes had maybe 10 minutes total of scenting in the mcu,2022-11-20 05:35:45
"she got plenty of explanation in this film what part are you unsure of specifically

also its really interesting to think about how the us would actually react if it turns out that another nation had far more military power than we do i imagine a lot of war hawks in washington would be freaking out and thats essentially the role that val is playing",2022-11-12 00:38:26
she didnt do anything villainous in this movie,2022-12-30 00:04:29
"we know she’s director of the cia and wants us supremacy that’s enough for now we’ll learn more about her as she pops up more specifically in thunderbolts since it looks like she’ll be a main character there  
you could say the same about fury preavengers we didn’t know anything about him other than he works for a mysterious organisation and he’s “putting together a team” that’s how storytelling works you don’t always reveal every detail about a character right away",2022-11-11 23:49:20
she literally dreams of being able to have vibranium technology and using it against the rest of the world says this verbatim in the film she’s envious of the wakandans exactly the person they think the rest of the world is,2022-11-11 19:00:12
the actual cia spent 20 years drugging people with lsd to see if it could be a mind control drug because russia might be studying this do we really need more explanation for why the mcu cia wants vibranium and shadow super heroes,2022-11-12 05:24:43
weren’t they solely speaking through water except for attuma’s bridge part,2022-11-11 18:48:52
namor looks like hes wearing an immunity necklace throughout the whole  thing,2022-11-17 05:26:31
that bit where okoye sadly smiles and tears up saying “please i’ve given everything” hit me hard lol then angela follows it with a spine chilling monologue just so  good,2022-11-11 08:39:14
its literally what cracked shuri into becoming consumed by vengeance its completely necessary to the plot here,2022-11-11 08:12:57
then he walks in eating a carrot ,2022-11-12 03:52:16
and then he  murks her mom dude has no game,2022-11-12 02:43:39
i think she wanted to die trying she knew she had little chance to rescue shuri even if it meant her death,2022-11-13 04:00:43
well it’s tradition supposedly to remain loyal to the throne no matter who sits on it plus killmonger won the throne legally by beating t’challa in the fight so it’s not like he did it wrong still okoye did mess up by losing shuri but you have to remember that she was outmatched in multiple baddies so its like she was able to get to her and get her to safety yeah like i said i’m conflicted,2022-11-14 05:39:47
sigh same,2022-11-14 09:00:07
i understand that what im saying is theres another very plausible reason for her to get a ton more screentime in this movie the vacuum caused by chadwicks death,2022-11-14 21:39:11
in the end was too late when the queen fired okoye and then started to plan the attack on her own without anyone else in the room to plan it with and it ended up real bad,2022-11-12 09:39:14
"oh i didnt know the character was 16 in black panther though apparently it was retconned and later confirmed that she was 18 so shed be older than 18 in wakanda forever

but even then wakanda is in subsaharan africa and 40 of girls in subsaharan africa marry before 18 so its not like its out of line with the general ethics of the area if she was 16 and they did get together",2022-11-11 05:15:09
and yet shuri is a consenting adult,2022-11-13 00:35:24
i respect that they resisted the temptation to pull a star wars and try to do a scene with a cgi chadwick or a deep fake part of me was afraid that wed see a stunt double die in an opening scene to  off the character or that hed show up in the ancestral plane and either of those could have easily felt cheap and exploitative,2022-11-11 05:59:07
i teared up multiple times,2022-11-11 04:37:32
if i didnt know any better letitia wright is def his sister,2022-11-11 21:05:12
stan lee died of natural causes after a long and fulfilling life i think the fanfare was a good choice to kind of celebrate all his accomplishments chadwick died suddenly at only 45 this one was more subdued and sad in tone but it makes it no less meaningful,2022-11-12 06:07:32
"this time around after they ran that clip they had something like the following on the screen not verbatim

and well be watching you too

forever

chadwick boseman 19762020",2022-11-11 12:27:54
this is awesome,2022-11-12 05:46:15
the itunes version,2022-11-12 00:18:30
its not in the imax version on disney have to watch regular version,2022-11-13 02:23:21
so powerful,2022-11-11 19:24:57
freeman  it was 5am and i was sleepy,2022-11-12 17:54:49
"ahh that makes sense  


felt kind of out of place in the movie considering i dont know what reason hed have for speaking latin or why hed say emperor king  


but i guess thats the downside of actually understanding the words better just think of them as cool sounds",2022-11-11 11:16:00
wow wow wow wow……wow,2023-02-05 22:45:39
yep why the  does he know latin,2023-03-19 04:16:20

this will be the new  its the vvitch not the witch",2022-11-11 14:35:05
somehow that ship could explode twice lol,2022-11-14 06:54:46
i dig namor,2022-11-11 23:54:32
makes sense thanks,2022-11-27 08:22:01
thank you,2022-11-11 13:15:03
thank you,2022-11-11 13:15:13
you think they’re uncultured just because they live underwater,2022-11-11 06:00:33
the eternal  vibranium we can mine that like nowhere and japan and america will have giant mecha robots defending it ooh sentinels,2022-11-15 00:25:11
i have a feeling that plot was to set up the next movie where namors right  the unusa come after wakanda,2022-11-15 02:45:34
still bitter about that lol,2022-11-15 02:45:49
"tbf it can be a valid thematic choice  like the irishman was long  dragged out to represent the bleak dreary crawl into old age for mobsters who survive

a little artsy move for a superhero film sure lol not saying its why but it has been done on purpose to represent certain feelings before though",2022-11-15 02:48:40
"i think its fine being harsh in your critique as long its fair and objective marvel needs some of that and a little less pandering considering its a multi billion dollar franchise 

i too felt it falls short in a few areas when compared to the first but i probably need some time to digest it before i can critique it",2022-11-13 12:28:23
i dont think you were harsh the movie has a lot of negatives and its fair to point them out,2022-11-24 07:08:06
interesting maybe that was it i assumed it was some way to hide the background cgi,2022-11-12 19:43:51
huh interesting i noticed that too watching dolby today,2022-11-13 06:28:29
copium,2023-02-03 15:04:33
very dark just saw it and what stood out to me were the first couple of scenes with namor i get they were “hiding” him but it was to the point i could barely see anyone’s faces,2022-11-19 05:13:15
"except when they do and they get sent to prison but then dont go back to prison cause you can just kinda hide 

or if you have a family you just kinda get an ankle monitor and john krasinski comes over to make jokes and warn you not to do it again",2022-11-11 06:15:59
that was pretty  not only killing cops just to get away and honestly what was the worst they would have done to the princess of wakanda and her friends but also cheering after each car crash and explosion,2022-11-11 06:17:17
"yeah that bridge fight was probably my favorite part of the film to be honest when attuma planted his bladelance and threw okoye into it my whole theater groaned in unison due to how brutal it was 

the dude is a tank",2022-11-11 09:57:40
if okoye can hold her own with no suit in a 1 v 1 fight against attuma how does he possibly stand a chance as a namor villian head to head that is one of my only minor complaints they totally neutered attumas strenghth comics attuma would have wrecked okoye in one punch,2022-11-25 21:40:27
i don’t feel he hashad to be a villain though  he and  shuri were talking so nicely and chilling together i was bummed that their new friendship went south so soon and all over that girl,2022-12-12 06:28:04
someone else pointed out that you could see the cops running away from the explosion so they probably werent killed however the power dynamic is way off here riri okoye and shuri all have extremely advanced tech and okoye has supernatural talent so they should be showing more restraint with the low level cops itd be one thing if they were fighting navy seals or some secret military team but those cops were probably eating donuts when they got killed in and had no idea who they were trying to catch or why,2022-11-11 13:51:48
"namor just wanted to protect his people

and at first they just wanted to stop her not  her

wakanda just ignored them",2022-11-11 03:16:39
nakia killed one when she rescued shuri,2022-11-11 20:33:22
i mean their best weapon is a water balloon i feel like they were only a threat because the movie needed them to be a threat,2022-11-12 05:03:07
yes just watched avatar a few weeks ago saw this movie and wondered why it got decent reviews,2023-02-05 05:04:04
yup they’re both built different,2022-12-31 17:35:22
i watched avatar first and yes it really ruined wakanda forever a little the visual effects couldnt compare,2023-03-24 22:57:10
they lost that one but now hes an official refugee in wakanda which is probably a major upgrade for him also helps that he knows the royal family,2022-11-12 06:55:05
it doesnt seem like theres any hope for mcu in china anymore,2022-11-11 23:44:26
who martin freeman but why,2022-11-13 14:21:29
"tolkien white guy

",2022-11-11 22:52:11
agreed,2022-11-11 21:09:26
riri was actually part of the plot though,2022-11-11 07:20:42
she seems like a bad guy now,2022-11-11 08:07:47
"what can i say call me oldfashioned but i like my films to conclude with a satisfying ending with marvel it was wait dont go we havent finished the story yet that was just an episode i got tired of it

but with endgame we finally got an ending and holy christ what an ending not saying it was perfect but it exceeded my hopes there were real stakes people actually died not in the agent coulson sense and major character arcs were concluded beautifully

afterwards i felt not just satisfied but relieved i thought thank  i dont have to watch any more marvel films ",2022-11-12 15:07:53
i had an idea that maybe atlantis gets destroyed and they move to talocan maybe reveal that talocan was their original homeland but something forced them to relocate maybe do a namor title retconning his origins to fit this new narrative have it be about reclaiming talocan from whatever made them move in the first place afterwards give him a new mayan inspired look like the movie,2022-11-12 06:58:23
"yes they did include imperius rex in the movie so they might include more aspects of the comics later on and they did introduced the weird gods hangoutmeeting in love and thunder i wonder if they might connect it  somehow with namor being considered a 
it will be great if they add more of the mesoamerican mythology too",2022-11-27 03:54:10
"i thought her scrapyard suit was pretty good but how they ended up with that as the final design is crazy 

also from the trailers i thought she was gonna be a lot younger lol",2022-11-11 03:27:12
  jet jaguar,2022-11-11 05:06:14
or a comic book,2022-11-11 04:24:32
it looked like an early draft of something in big hero 6,2022-11-11 04:46:03
that’s exactly what i liked about it tbh,2022-11-11 18:35:10
which honestly i liked its designed by a 19 year old who probably watched a bunch of mecha anime of course its going to look like that,2022-11-11 04:32:38
looked like metabots,2022-11-11 16:39:31
"i mean thats kinda how her armor looks in the comics  

also i figure they want to make it perfectly clear that shes not just using an old suit of tonys also toy sales",2022-11-11 05:24:46
yeah it kind of looked like ultraman,2022-11-12 08:17:27
her comic suit was originally very gundamesque so not far off,2022-11-12 06:23:53
late 80s maybe bubblegum crisis,2022-11-13 02:11:19
this it felt like one of those toy robots you owned in the 90s,2022-11-13 14:18:15
battlebots from 90s fox,2022-11-11 18:59:29
namors costume and his warriors had awesome designs even shuris black panther suit was fitting they didnt have to rely on iron man designs to make a convincing suit they had a mayaninspired style for namors people and africaninspired style for wakanda the mech suits in this movie did not fit either style,2022-11-12 04:29:53
"check out ryan meinerdings concept art for all the early suits if he didnt work on the art for this movie than we have the explanation",2022-11-11 20:24:18
"rafa grassettis  of war studio art director iron heart armour concept is fkin amazing so much better than what was in wf

gee he passed away back in 2008 no wonder i dont remember recent news about it,2022-11-11 12:33:03
well adi granov designed the original suit winstons company just produced the physical suit,2022-11-11 17:30:08
agreed  and its essentially her 2nd generation suit or 1st gen if you consider the first one she wore a prototype  iron mans prototype suit was  af im sure the subsequent marks will become more refined,2022-11-11 06:47:03
black panther and bad third act cgi the new iconic duo,2022-11-11 18:05:52
i think marvel has been stretching their animators too thin honestly i think its less on the filmmakers than it is on timing and funds,2022-11-11 06:18:04
there was a shot of namor diving off a bridge that didn’t even look finished,2022-11-12 05:20:11
i was getting like rome total war vibes from the combat you could feel the basic cgi mass fighting,2022-11-12 00:06:58
thats because the mcu is mostly made in green screened parking lots in atlanta,2022-11-18 10:17:10
noticed some bad shots during the invasion of wakanda as well when people say the cg is bad with marvel to me its the obvious green screen nowadays purely cg creations are usually fine but man they are really struggling blending the soundstage green screen stuff with whatever backgrounds…it’s really jarring sometimes,2022-11-13 16:03:32
its called the volume,2022-11-15 16:54:28
gotta slap these water plates to open shield section b13,2022-11-14 06:44:12

 it worf youre supposed to be the most badass crew member why are you always getting your  kicked,2022-11-11 16:35:26
"meanwhile in the same movie nakia easily mercs the atlanteans guarding shuri with sonic ballistic rounds that are damaging enough to instant  one and injure the other severely enough that namor cant save her yet nakia is seemingly the only one that has access to that gun in wakanda none of the foot soldiers have any the only other ballistic rounds are from the air support

so their best strategy is to instead bring out a sick looking warship  that has a single disruptive weapon and a flat deck they stand on top of and pick off people climbing with spears and claw",2022-11-11 16:46:51
" it also felt like there was some initial romantic tension between shuri and namor that they abandoned

i hope namor will have romantic tension with every super hero girl he meet",2022-11-12 00:28:03
i think the shurinamor thing was just another piece of the burn the world storyline along with killmonger,2022-11-11 08:44:16
ive been watching too much house of the dragon because my first thought was they should just marry shuri off to namor and end the conflict and continue their monopoly on vibranium,2022-11-12 02:35:33
i think it was namor just giving those come hither eyes i dont doubt shuri was like im a little freaked out but  hes got it going on i know i was,2022-11-12 00:49:59
"gotta say the rewrites were too obvious i think your guess is accurate clearly building to t’challa wanting to  namor after queen’s death and zhuri stopping it and teaching him love or something

also killmonger in the dream sequence is obviously for t’challa not zhuri",2022-11-14 06:19:31
i’m late to this party but it felt really cheap to not have any avengers at the funeral,2022-11-15 20:38:51
how did the shehulk finale do the thing they were making fun of,2022-11-14 14:11:40
holy  for a moment i thought you were memeing then i thought it could be doable then i checked and its exactly like that,2023-02-01 21:57:21
surprised you are getting downvoted i actually really loved the movie but the fight choreography and editing was bad other than that and the cgi i really liked it,2022-11-11 21:25:54
sorry but the cgi was really great in this movie much better than what we’ve seen in the mcu lately and namor’s attack on wakanda was a fantastic action scene,2022-11-11 20:04:32
i was under the impression the mom knew recall when her and shuri are at the fireplace about to burn those sheets she tells her daughter theres something i need to tell you before she is interrupted by namor,2022-11-12 23:18:28
ramonda knew nakia explicitly said so when shuri asked about it,2022-11-13 02:17:55
thats a fair point i would have loved to see that as well,2022-11-12 23:55:17
not shocked at all surprised they didn’t censor his ,2022-12-05 03:07:48
i wonder if the downvoters thought you were calling blackpanther cringe aquaman definitely had a lot of cringe,2022-11-11 17:58:37
i still feel like im taking crazy pills when people say how good aquaman was like really that movie was baaaaad,2022-11-11 20:07:21
yeah for me shuris arc there was too short to be satisfying,2022-11-11 14:37:52
it was set up when shuri was telling her mom that thinking about her brother made her want to burn the world,2022-11-13 06:21:19
tchalla had a similar thing in black panther one with his father,2022-11-11 16:52:46
agreed the subplot of shuris vengeance came out of nowhere,2022-11-11 13:53:55
killmonger even points this out before tchalla no wakandan ruler wouldve given a second thought about killing riri,2022-11-11 20:01:48
ludwig is a genius definitely put himself up for contention for another oscar with this one incredible score set up for the talocan portion too,2022-11-12 06:59:23
even if that is the case they could’ve definitely done a better story,2022-11-11 15:10:19
exactly,2022-11-11 07:50:39
yes,2022-11-12 05:31:16
honestly i felt the runtime was mostly justified this movie had a lot going on and the vast majority of it namor and talokan shuri’s arc okoye ramonda etc was integral to the narrative  even riri’s story which definitely set up for the disney show was written to make her feel natural in what was happening which is why it was so jarring when the rossvalentina stuff came up because it had zero effect on this story,2022-11-11 07:29:12
no your not though your gonna watch the rest,2022-11-11 22:52:23

i loved it really distinct from tonys suit i was worried it was just gonna be slightly feminine shaped iron man,2022-11-11 14:42:08
i love goofy robot  so it worked for me,2022-11-11 05:39:35
ironheart will be a series,2022-11-11 13:40:03
and yet that is 2 many for me to feel that having an iron suit is a cool thing if random introduction college student can build one wakanda can build a couple is there any uniqueness to them anymore,2022-11-11 19:45:05
youre free to have that absolutely garbage opinion lol,2022-11-11 18:53:32
no its ultimately a james cameron movie if it were anyone elses movie there would be 10 sequels by now,2022-11-12 01:36:45
even the mouse cant stop cameron from doing what he wants and he wants superior visuals,2022-11-11 23:42:15
he was taking about the cgi not the writing,2022-11-11 10:49:03
"it’s not about budget for marvel films unfortunately it’s about the time they don’t have enough time to give vfx houses to work on all of their projects 

which sucks as a huge marvel guy i’d much rather them slow down and make sure these movies visuals are done than get 4 movies a year",2022-11-11 17:52:11
time matters,2022-11-11 23:55:59
i didn’t see any normal human beings in the trailer before bp2 did they play diff trailer for different regions,2022-11-13 07:33:57
they couldve done that by having the same talent behind her design,2022-11-11 20:28:39
well make it look wakandan at least,2022-11-13 07:35:53

to show that the us is actively plotting against wakanda and how ross put himself in harms way to protect them even though he didnt have to its more if a hidden message on allyship,2022-11-14 16:58:40
tbf he gave it a “good time no alcohol required” which is pretty middle of the line don’t know when the man tears was supposed to come though,2022-11-12 08:21:49
i had that thought too,2022-11-12 16:17:08
"hey i’m not justifying his actions just recounting what happened but yeah what do you expect it’s a marvel movie as of lately things only happen to highlight and expand possible characters for future cinematicuniverse roles now 

so she lives only for iron heart to exist they could have subbed her character for any other scientist or a generic wakandan scientist who created the tech for that",2022-11-12 02:16:35
it couldnt be replicated she said her notes were encrypted and it took a year for her to get back in when she got locked out i think namor wanted to interrogate riri before he killed her to see who else had access to the tech,2022-11-14 16:47:45
a lot of villains in movies shouldve just killed their captured main character and been done with it maybe namor wanted to monologue to riri before killing her,2022-11-15 06:44:39
"i had a brief hope that shuri would come out of the ancestral plane and realize that she was way too vengeful to take on the mantel of black panther and make nakia or okoye do it so she could focus on fixing herselfruling wakandaher technology 

but it was clear the entire movie that this was shuris story and she would end up as bp i certainly dont love letitia and her and her antivax nonsense but idk shuri just didnt seem like the right pick for bp storywise either",2022-11-11 04:04:47
i was convinced that once okoye was demoted that her redemption arc was to become the black panther at the end,2022-11-12 06:40:24
" but overall i think they did about as well as they couldve with the situation they had

i think they could have done it better by simply recasting tchalla

like sure chadwick is  amazing and was fantastic in the role but tchalla is insanely important to bp recasting him in only his second solo outing and like3rd or 4th movie overall wouldnt be too awful imo",2022-11-11 15:16:07
i was really rooting for nakia to be bp and felt really disappointed when it was given to shuri,2022-11-14 06:49:16
i thought she was great in the previous movies but it never made sense to me to make her the new bp nakia would have made a ton of sense and lupita is just a much stronger actor that said i do think letitia did a great job in this,2022-11-11 19:41:02
i felt similar to you i was on the recast tchalla train from day 1 i didnt want shuri being bp halfway through the movie i was ready for her to take the mantle unfortunately once she put the costume on my hype died i want tchalla to come back or his son aged up quick that being said i still felt that she was great just not a convincing enough bp for me,2022-11-12 06:33:09
shuri at the end at the beach was what sold her performance for me,2022-11-11 07:34:20
its been a long time since i watched the first one  i just dont like shuri and wanted some other black panther,2022-11-11 05:51:23
i get that for sure but theres lot of comments in here saying her performance was just down right bad and i feel like thats pretty ridiculous,2022-11-11 18:12:58
it’s gravitas and commanding presence when chadwick was onscreen he was the king when angela bassett was onscreen she was queen,2022-11-12 03:42:10
add to that that the only reason the cia got the machine was some  prof giving it to them shows that sacrificing her would have been unjust killmonger scene thematically also addresses the tension of action,2022-11-11 14:32:25
wakanda follows strength that’s always been their fatal flaw ironically the gorilla man is positioned to fix that by not fixing it,2022-11-11 06:02:15
also in the comics wakandans arent super nice people singing kumbaya all the time sure theyre usually aligned with the heroes but their policy is always wakanda first then everyone else,2022-11-17 03:03:18
"in shuris mind it wasn’t right to take the life of somebody so young

namors hundreds of years old

and thats not why she spared him its because she wanted peace",2022-11-11 04:15:37
"you mean at the end to avoid years of war

why didnt they just help in the beginning

your right this vibranium finding tech isnt good for either of our side lets get it out of the coast hands

instead they protected riri for 0 reason",2022-11-11 03:18:48
"so they would rather help 1 girl than another nation similar to them

what",2022-11-11 05:08:32
her performance was fantastic though,2022-11-11 14:50:58
at least thor 4 wasnt boring,2022-11-11 23:01:43

"ep 5 after he delivers zemo to the dora milaje ayo tells him to stay away from wakanda for a while
probably at the time of tchalla passing he still  not welcomed there",2022-11-16 02:27:20
"or maybe the elders didn’t hide any because killmonger was standing there watching them nakia only was able to get some because killmonger didn’t know she was there 

and regarding whether or not the herb should have been given to t’challa killmonger needed to be defeated quickly and without the herb t’challa would have died",2022-11-17 16:04:12
theyve got livestock and textiles according to black panther 1 movieis it enough i dont know,2022-11-23 05:44:29
no i asked you to explain how there was no character growth so lets start there tell me how shuris character at the start of the film was basically the same as her character at the end,2022-11-22 20:40:13
"do you know what a character arc is

it usually involves a character going through some personal journey or transformation

in this story at the beginning she’s mostly suppressing her grief about losing her brother this makes her emotionally volatile as we see later in the story as her suppressed grief especially after losing her mother too turns to rage and destructiveness

finally she’s able to realize that turning grief into anger will lead to nothing good and so she’s learned something in the end she faces her grief

you can criticize it for bad cgi or whatever but claiming that this movie has no character growth is…really strange given that it’s one of the most introspective and personal marvel movies i’ve seen literally the entire emotional core of the film is a character’s journey through grief without oneliner jokes every two seconds to break up the tension like in other marvel films",2022-11-23 14:35:53
i disagree it doesn’t sound cold it sounds rational people getting so emotionally invested in celebrities especially ones who haven’t been in the industry for decades is very weird people act like he was the second coming of christ chadwick himself didn’t share his medical condition because he didn’t want all that attention yet people act like it was a national tragedy,2022-11-11 06:47:03
i loved iron heart i thought she was really fun she plays great off shuri,2022-11-11 06:27:22
nanomachines son,2022-11-14 23:17:22
yeah i was really expecting the emotional core of the conflict to be that someone  atlantis up and then framed wakanda for it that would have been more cliche but its a cliche for a reason namors motivations  imo,2022-11-14 09:01:56
really i had no problem seeing what was happening in a dolby atmos isense theater,2022-11-11 08:18:03
same with cia inclusion for thunderbolts marvel used to be great at including other plots not sure what happened here,2022-11-11 18:17:32
15mins is huge for changing the movie for better or for worse,2022-11-13 17:25:30
"i saw this complaint before seeing the movie and i honestly don’t think it took up as much time as others are saying 15 is borderline hyperbole 

the movie as a whole though felt incredibly long though",2022-11-11 21:52:36
even if it were only 10 minutes my guess would be 1520 that would still be an unacceptable amount of time for a movie to spend on something completely irrelevant to the plot,2022-11-14 20:13:50
1520 minutes of runtime is very long in a movie thats 1520 minutes where i dont care about whats happening on screen that time could have been spent advancing the stuff we care about or it could have been cut to improve the pacing of the movie,2022-11-11 17:14:58
well that just panthered,2022-11-11 14:51:35
ya that would’ve been one of the dumbest things the mcu has ever done maybe the dumbest,2022-11-11 04:15:50

why not do you know of any great namor story,2022-11-11 04:06:05
i dont consider myself a hardcore marvel fan i still havent watched most of phase 4 projects but i did watch loki because hes an og character i like and i imagine a lot of casual fans did watch it too,2022-11-11 07:19:08
i wont be watching any mcu content with the rip off ironman,2022-11-11 13:42:19
i dont see how its any different from peter parker the high school student developing web fluid and slingers a lot of ironhearts introduction in this movie was like spiderman in civil war,2022-11-12 02:31:34
" apparently shes also a natural suit pilot as she said shes never flown the initial suit she was making yet performs like shes been iron man forever

why the  are so many of you straight up lying

when theyre in the garage shuri says have you ever flown that thing before

and she goes yeah theres a whole youtube channel dedicated to sightings of me in it

its ridiculous how much yall lie on this sub to try and  on movies man",2022-11-11 19:15:13
i saw this movie on 11th street in philadelphia and was 1 of 4 white people in the theater so im not sure race has anything to do with it guy next to me clapped as the movie ended but no one else did,2022-11-11 15:04:01
you seem really upset not everyone is fawning over this movie why’d you have to bring up race and movies isn’t niche lol it’s a huge sub,2022-11-12 13:26:11
he sees the surface as people like conquistadors or plantation  owners,2022-11-11 08:26:16
i think its a parallel to how oppressed minorities feel kinship to one another even with completely different histories namor saw wakandans and their history as mirroring their own history,2022-11-11 08:02:52
he mentions it when he first meets them wakanda is untouched air clean water clean etc,2022-11-11 17:37:06
"definitely there’s nothing worse than that kind of disrespect had a guy doing this  on the guardians ride at epcot last time i was there to the point some guy literally said “dude you need to stop this is not funny you’re embarrassing yourself and wrecking this ride for those of us who regularly leave our basements shut up” 

people clapped",2022-11-11 06:35:17
holy  i had no idea thanks for the fill in that musta really messed her up,2022-11-11 15:29:11
yeah i felt it was the smartest move dunno why i thought theyd go about it some other way,2022-11-11 12:41:24
cheers to cancer,2022-11-13 04:39:03
for me eternals was the worst or the early thors,2022-11-11 15:31:37
if you think about it war machine barely gets to do anything as tonys sidekick his suit gets hacked in 2 which means you spend most of the movie not seeing him do cool stuff with iron man until the end in 3 he loses his iron patriot suit to save the president and tony for some reason would rather let his wife who has fire powers for some reason fight discount syndrome then have his friend use one of the many aicontrolled suits at his disposal and he barely does anything in endgame other then reference time travel movies and ironheart is probably gonna get screentime he could have as a iron suit user in the d show shes getting assuming theyre gonna use her to fill a void left by starks death bucky gets more screentime as a sidekick then him as well,2023-02-04 19:18:26
"if that movie was animated it wouldnt be fit to hold into the spiderverses shorts

most of the appeal is just seeing older spidermen again in live action",2022-11-15 23:26:52
leaders of other tribes can challenge for the throne but you cant challenge the role of black panther like straight up directly you could ascertain the role of black panther through claiming the throne though i believe its a little murky but its not like as easily as op is implying,2022-11-11 15:32:24
thats for king being king and black panther arent exclusive to each other,2022-11-11 18:13:58
his performance was good but the idea that the character dies with him is asnine,2022-11-11 18:20:58
"namor doesnt know any of that thats the problem

he has no clue what banner stark pym or anybody from the surface world is capable of

there would be no reason to think this one scientist kept the formulaplansknowledge to themselves and are the only ones capable of building more machines",2022-11-14 18:25:31

is mornbin time,2022-11-11 12:31:53
probably because she doesn’t believe in vaccines haha,2022-11-11 05:54:37
no i didn’t i thought the queen was great shuri character arc was good,2022-11-11 05:08:24
yeah they sort of went the killmonger route with him and it worked fairly well,2022-11-11 03:28:08
i dunno when they first put up resistance to his simple request to get the scientist i was like kind of a  move but then they do go find her and find out shes a kid who had her tech exploited by the government and namor doesnt care about that he thinks killing her will solve his problems and i dont think thats the case wakandans even went as far as to take her in and get her to understand why she shouldnt make that tech and he still wouldnt accept that,2022-11-11 03:18:26
of course not but an attack on a nation that has more firepower us will not attack china without proof for example,2022-11-15 20:47:58
same reason why the us dont launch any attacks on china depends on the country your bombing,2022-11-15 22:04:42
"as a black guy i can understand that but still with the glasses off eternals just felt really bland by itself at least with bp we have established characters lol

i just dont see this movie being that bad lol i throughly enjoyed it better than love and thunder and multiverse of madness",2022-11-11 22:49:10
no even then trailer was trash,2022-11-11 04:34:14
the first one got a best picture nomination and won three oscars so it wasn’t completely out of the question that they could pull off a miracle and make a great sequel without chadwick boseman it didn’t happen imo but that was some people’s thinking,2022-11-11 08:18:40
his style doesnt work for the mcu for me,2022-11-14 00:54:51
"and yet at no stage does he abandon his goal to  the scientist if it were him realising the futility of that mission then the film would have revealed as much

why would he give up on that plan the vibranium detector is what led them to him in the first place killing the scientist wouldnt stop them from ever making a new machine but it would drastically delay the process this was just a move to buy more time 

eventually he knows he has to go to war with the surface but he wants to buy as much time as he can and make an ally to help his cause he tells shuri multiple times that he wants wakandas help with the war and ultimately i think his plan hinges on that partnership it also sets up a future plotline for namor where he tries to find other partners instead of wakanda probably dr doom and latveria if they choose to go that route",2022-11-13 05:03:22
"for me it did and quiet well

only thing that ticks me off they dont want to be discovered  they know they will eventually be discovered and they fear being enslaved because thats their understanding of the world 

so they decide to rash into their deaths and wage war against wakanda and there after the entire world thats the  plan ive heard  clearly they have some kind of international intelligence network  because they can even track where riri  shuri etc where before they kidnapped them in turn they should have an understanding of how the world works slavery isnt really a thing anymore and if you decide to attack the world the are quiet a bunch of folks that will  you up for that  

so as old as nymour is he lacks so much wisdom and diplomacy he is loved by his people but dude acts like a mad dictator i cant imagine how he runs his civilization day to day decade to decade",2022-11-19 20:05:27
its very very pretty i watched it in imax laser 3d and definitely enjoyed the pictures beautiful but we had a late show time of 1030 pm and then the movie started at like 1050 meaning we left later than 2am i nodded off a few times during the movie and sometimes it dragged a little bit but it is a good movie just need a little planning lol,2023-01-21 23:45:58
are you enjoying wasting your night ranting about a movie you didn’t see,2022-11-11 04:04:08
irrelevant to your original comment,2022-11-11 04:29:22
people cant read,2022-11-12 22:22:57
totally fair,2022-11-11 04:06:34
what great namor story do you hope to see adapted,2022-11-11 04:12:44
i liked the netflix film is that black enough for you,2022-11-12 01:33:41
that wasn’t their best though they never say or imply that in the movie that’s a retaliatory strike and it’s shown as such,2022-11-15 15:50:06
  it was pretty one dimensional in portrayal of black men tbf  i am not black tho just my two cents,2022-11-13 20:07:15
wandavision hawkeye ms marvel thor 4 black panther 2 iron heart upcoming and in black panther 2 black widow we get it marvel women are better than men now make a good movie for a  change,2022-11-14 00:22:38
shame because mbaku was a  badass in the first movie he has some wise words in this one but yea hes used as comic relief in a movie that didnt want it this is the most serious mcu movie in a long time after seeing thor love  thunder then shehulk i was dying for a real serious mcu movie,2022-11-14 20:10:36
"you criticized the film and don’t like anyone responding to your criticism


sounds to me like you are the one trying to silence people lol",2022-11-14 02:12:45
i wasn’t attacking you for having a different opinion nor i was silencing you i was just pointing out that you may have some kind of attention problems since you couldn’t comprehend the plot of a very simple and straightforward movie k bye for now,2022-11-14 02:13:49
" but why

read a little about the cia lol",2022-11-15 22:24:33
its straight up racism but its not a white person doing it so its totally acceptable,2022-11-14 04:58:54
"the joke is about white people being colonizers not “americans”

but you also can’t really say white people didn’t colonize america anyway it was kind of funny in the first movie but a little cringy in the second",2022-11-16 21:29:03
idk man she became bp back in like 2005 way before  complaiend about woke agenda or whatever npc rhetoric theyre spinning these days in that case marvel has been woke since the 60s rendering any complaint to that extent moot,2022-12-08 00:50:43
that’s literally wrong the trail by combat is to become ruler not black panther that should be obvious because t’challa was black panther while his dad was king,2022-11-16 13:57:18
who gives a  it worked for the story the movie was telling,2022-11-11 17:45:21
yeah the soundtrack was really interesting the first sequence of the attack on the boat was such a chilling atmosphere,2022-11-14 06:13:51
hey well always have endgame haha,2022-11-12 22:08:29
did we watch the same movie her growth from not being able to properly grieve for tchalla to wanting vengeance to being noble was the heart of the movie and extremely well acted,2022-11-13 05:19:39
"the throne is passed by royal line

however it can be challenged by having a fight like mbaku did when he challenged tchalla

the end of the movie was going to show the open challenge thing again but shuri had told mbaku she didnt want it and told him so he asks anyone if they want to fight him for it nobody challenges he is king

i agree they could go a potential civil war route down the line with sons of both tchalla kid will also have the bp genes most likely",2022-11-13 21:09:54
i’ve seen worse but it might be the worst movie i’ve seen in theaters at least i don’t think there was a single thing i liked outside of the shadow planet scene,2022-11-13 19:00:58
its called character growth,2022-11-13 16:04:17
my guess is the end scene of her not being there just means she’s stepping down and mbaku becomes king,2022-11-11 15:45:00
" there are likely thousands of black male actors that could capably have played the role of tchalla

there really arent and thats kind of the whole point exactly why you cant even toss a name out there 

 and what they did instead is have harry potter die an offscreen death and have ron and hermione attempt to carry any future movies to come

well no once again harry potter is a person not a figure harry potter is harry potter black panther is a mantle that can and has been taken up by various characters the main 2nd incarnation literally being shuri after tchalla succumbs to near fatal wounds and needs to recover

so the comparison youre using just doesnt work and makes no sense and is a massive reach

trust me i get it i really do but its not as simple as youre making it out to be and i can guarantee you so many more fans wouldve been  at trying to replace chadwick rather than going this route it was an unwinnable situation either way",2022-11-11 18:52:10
"it can heal you sure over time but she got impaled by a mayan  

the writers said we’ll just show a clip of all the bad stuff and motivate her to not bleed out 

she also has black panther powers so she can go hand to hand with a 600 year old warrior with the same powers 

it was sloppy okoye made much more sense to be black panther  shuri could have been ruling queen",2022-11-11 05:24:45
its definitely not better than the way they actually handled tchalla’s death,2022-11-11 15:19:31
better than the first movie for me and best movie of this phase,2022-11-12 17:48:57
"im not being cynical herebut i imagine this was totally a decision that they made so they can have actual real world representation they are supposed to always be blue not just above water but then you dont have a ton of brown people in the movie   


you get more diversity brownie points with hispanic actors with brown skin as opposed to hispanic actors in blue body paint",2022-11-16 03:56:18
 who are also mostly middle aged white guys,2022-11-11 18:01:36
"you didnt just give your opinion youre saying that everyone only likes it because of the tribute for chadwick and theres so much to love about it

youre downplaying its phenomenal reception by the general moviegoer audience and being snarky quit trying to act like you arent",2022-11-14 15:31:18
"seriously your comment is such ignorant narrow minded nonsense that it absolutely amazes just how nonsensical one can get its one of the stupidest reasons ive honestly ever read

true narrow mindness is to lower yourself to insults in the movie discussion

of course the context between two movies is different nobody is going to recreate civil war frame by frame but the context is dictated by the corporation not the artist marvel needed to introduce namor and riri williams set up thunderbolts and react to chadwicks death and movie does that yes

but why does this movie exists other than to set up future projects no reason it has nothing to say it has no message behind it except for the one the same franchise used eight years ago

you asked about the message of interstellar i think its rather obvious that nolan tried to show us that love is literally more powerful than space and time it was an attempt at scientific explanation to faith id say its pretty original message that wakanda forever definitely lacked",2022-11-13 09:22:05
"the student had no intent on paying her he literally said he did all the work but she just provided the final touches 

he didn’t think her contribution was worth the initial 800",2022-11-12 22:48:10
youre either a troll or a clownwhich is it my brain hurts trying to figure out how you interpreted that scene soooo poorly,2022-11-13 00:47:33
tony stark was able to build this in a cave with a box of scraps  obadiah stane at least she didnt have to build it in a cave,2022-11-14 11:38:35
she charged that one guy like 10k for a single assignment she was making bank,2022-11-14 03:33:26
at least youre self aware i guess theres that,2022-11-14 14:42:49
yeah  her for representing a strong black female superhero who lost her family for black girls all over the world antivaxxer is all she is ,2022-11-14 17:51:10
does it i’m curious to know how much control a director has on these projects i’m not sure how involved coogler was with the action sequences,2022-11-14 13:27:02
" dorothy steel

so i looked her up andapparently she started her career in the 80s and got into some of the biggest movies ever

crazy",2022-11-15 23:16:27
hmmm my mistake then but i hope you could see where im coming from when there are comments in here not seeing the irony of being  that mbaku didnt become manape in here,2022-11-11 19:25:52
"i like her character a lot more than a lot in here seem too and i thought they actually did good at implementing her and making her relevant to the movie

she also has phenomenal chemistry with shuri",2022-11-11 20:23:03
true i appreciate slow burns with characterization and world building so i loved but i can see how that would turn others off,2022-11-11 18:23:02
"ill give you chadwick is top 5 leads but the movie was still average at best he carried it so hard

also kilmongre isnt even coming close to thanos and imo naymor either thats just laughable to try and prop him up as the best mcu villain",2022-11-11 13:48:31
are ya,2022-11-15 00:52:07
dont worry theyre still signficantly richer than youll ever be happy,2022-12-08 00:57:38
"tchaka was king but had delegated the role of black panther to his son so theres obvious precedent

as for the jabari detail there are lines that make it clear in the first one like when tchalla accepts mbakus challenge and he responds glory to hanuman or in njobus voiceover at the start he explained that the four tribes that fought over the vibranium pledged their loyalty to bashenga while the jabari went off to the mountains",2022-11-14 20:41:34
neymar is a mutant bozo hes no “” get a grip,2022-11-12 14:56:19
my point is you can say anyone is born underwater as a people though mayans are real they exist and not underwater obviously atlanteans clearly better fit the narrative concept,2022-11-12 20:03:14
so you’re judging the movie based off an illegal cam version nice,2022-11-16 01:29:13
"i think youre expecting it to be completely logical when the people running these things are incredibly arrogant about how strong they are 

do you think wed have 100 years of american exceptionalism and then just take a back seat when wakanda shows up as the most powerful nation on earth on a tuesday 

were going to do everything possible to kick their leg out and keep em down 

even then im pretty sure the cia has no view into what wakanda is or their full strength 

they have the one cia agent but otherwise are blind outside of what wakanda wants to show",2022-11-16 00:02:32
 get out of my notifications and cope harder somewhere else,2022-12-03 19:58:24
alright i guessi dont get how people dislike her but to each their own,2022-11-13 00:48:52
what trials and tribulations did killmonger go through to be black panther on screen nothing cry more,2022-11-12 22:36:00
just type like a normal human being and you won’t be judged your post giving me a headache looking at it,2022-11-12 17:40:37
nope thats another reason the main reason is the 1st movie was mediocre also main character sadly died and they could not find a real replacement add the awful ironheart one of the worst superheroes in marvel comics given the super high price of movie tickets today i am gladly skipping it,2022-11-12 08:07:19
they made it clear that shuri could have cured him if he had given her enough time asshat,2022-11-11 20:46:39
the entire worldview of the wakandans towards the rest of the countries is heavily influenced by colonization and forced taking of resourcesland its like their top reason for keeping their technology secret for so long  considering any movie set in africa most of which was forcibly colonized at one point to be politically correct because it even mentions colonization or colonizers is just a  take,2022-11-27 02:54:51
true it just looked very silly to me only so far i can suspend my disbelief,2023-02-02 20:53:18
i think tchalla finding time to be intimate with the woman he loved during a tumultuous time isnt uncommon or strange at all,2022-11-11 16:06:11
"it hammered home the point that tchalla isnt really gone to shuri and that she isnt alone family wise like she thought she was

theres still a piece of him left i appreciate that way more than a shoehorned in doctor doom appearance or whatever they were planning",2022-11-11 14:24:32
yeah the kid intro was pretty ham  but his inclusion i think is purely for future storytelling there are a lot of really good tchalla stories that were cut short due to chadwicks death now with this new prince tchalla they can tell those same stories on the big screen with a new characteractor im especially looking forward to seeing the tchallaxmenstorm stuff and the huge role he plays in cosmic stories tchalla was an important character and im just glad marvel found some way to bring those stories back to the screen even though i admit that introducing a secret kid was really weird story wise,2022-11-12 20:20:34
ight whatever you say but i promise you this no two women yapping in the theater are gonna shoot you for asking them to quiet down,2022-11-12 05:34:50
they are very similar but have different pov on how to approach the world i look at it as like mlk vs malcolm x and magneto vs professor x etc,2022-11-14 14:25:12
they showed in the movie they didn’t know if it would actually work that’s why they were surprised to actuall find vibrainum at the bottom of the ocean,2022-11-11 05:05:40
i mean a certain subset of fans will always react like that to any kind of change plus weve already seen this exact scenario play out with jessica alba being sue in the first two movies,2022-11-12 18:31:13
unless the movie ignores its own logic then the heart shaped herb can now only be ingested by someone of royal blood linked to tchalla in the movie shuri asked her ai for tchallas dna in order to create the new synthetic herb to me that implied that no one else can take it of course i could completely be overthinking this its pretty much what they did in the amazing spiderman 2  i know that in the comicsi have never read them that the panther  bast has to approve of those wanting to be the black panther but the mcu has pretty much ignored that aspect,2022-11-21 16:15:07
 hes just king i dont think theres any indication they also made him bp or she gave that bit up,2022-11-20 14:52:49
"thats fine but you can be objective about it like the speed racer movie meant a lot to me because speed racer was a huge part of my childhood and i felt that they nailed the vibe of the show

its still a 65710

you can rate a movie objectively and like a movie more than your objective rating in fact you should operate that way aint nothing wrong with liking a movie more than other people while also keeping it real",2022-11-12 09:17:39
they also weakened him by taking him away from water and heating him up,2022-11-11 14:16:14
yeah but hed never been scooped up and tossed into a slow cooker before either,2022-11-11 15:09:39
"she literally fought in the infinity war with her brother she had a few years of warfighting experience in canon already

and they found namors weakness by dehydrating him youre trying so hard to nitpick when they explained it fine

also he didnt have over 1000 years it was clearly stated he was born in the 151600s and it was never even stated he had any experience in wars because talokan hid itself from the world until this movie did you even pay any attention at all",2022-11-11 14:15:02
he isnt being erased  riri is an original character,2022-11-12 20:46:06
but hes not a loved child thats the point the dialogue was all there,2022-11-15 01:07:43
we literally just sent troops to haiti a few weeks ago under the guise of a military intervention,2022-11-11 22:22:49
"they were forced to because they used the herb and it made them into fish people not because the surface world was full of mean people

here let me help you out why did they take the herb to avoid dying from smallpox how did they catch smallpox spanish colonizers brought it and other diseases with them so then going to the water was a direct result of the mean surface people who came to conquer them

and then he committed worse on wakanda 0 sympathy

way to just brush past my point you said that there was no reason for namor to be radicalized and i explained why you were mistaken on that point can you admit that he did have reason to be radicalized before moving on to a different argument as for this new point youre making i agree with the idea that his actions towards wakanda were cruel and had no moral justification its totally fair of you and anyone else to feel no sympathy for him because of his actions however that doesnt mean there isnt a narratively valid reason for his actions he is a flawed character and thats why he became the exact sort of imperialist that traumatized his people people who suffer trauma becoming like those that traumatized them is a realistic thing that happens it almost happens to shuri in this film so it makes sense for namors character even if its wrong and illogical because hes driven by intense emotions of anger and probably fear if hes totally honest


and yet it was captain america that curled a helicopter and threw hands with thanos meanwhile tchalla got one tapped

thanos is strong enough to ohko just about every avenger he knocked cap out in one blow in infinity war as well go look back at endgame before cap gets mjolnir he never tanks a direct blow from thanos always blocking with his shield meanwhile look at the scene where thanos enters wakanda thanos punches tchalla in the head hard enough to overload his vibranium suits absorptive properties so of course it knocks him out he then cold clocks cap as well and kos him thing is we know that this thanos is a more merciful one than endgame thanos he is only using enough force to disable each avenger because he knows he has already won he could have killed all of them

finally we all know why endgame focused on cap thor and tony in the final battle it was to bring their storys to their conclusion thats why powerful allies like dr strange were written out of the fight black panther gets encased in stone by ebony maw and its the last we see of him until after the battle considering thanos was able to immobilize the hulkbuster suit by encasing it in stone in infinity war its not a low showing at all for black panther to be taken out of the fight by a similar technique

im not gonna lie this has been some fun nerdy debate lol",2022-11-22 20:29:18
yup just mowed down for doing their job in blocking off 2 members of a sovereign nation theyre at war with who are seemingly abducting an american  them though amirite,2022-11-14 16:11:56
yes you asked why she said all her family was gone she excluded t’challa jr because no one else in the room knew of his existence,2022-11-12 00:22:21
except there are tons of comments here praising many aspects of the movie theyre not blindly hating on it like youre implying the only extreme here is that subreddit,2022-11-11 19:05:16
im in the same boat as you i havent felt this good about a marvel film since infinity war and it felt like a return to form of some of the best of past phases,2022-11-11 18:55:25
so the wings are merely an aesthetic choice,2022-11-11 12:15:29
i wish they put that in the movie or literally any explanation aside from just muh winged feetsies for his flight abilities,2022-11-11 16:41:46
why not just go on rmarvelstudios then you can discuss it with other people that enjoyed it,2022-11-11 06:30:16
the movie being a financial success has nothing to do with your original comment or my reply use your brain,2022-11-13 21:04:48
"i love it when it happens

nothing makes happier than when a marvel fan goes this marvel villain that wanted to  a child and genocide the whole world was so noble and nuanced i was cheering for him and stuff",2022-11-11 08:21:45
and bp died bro,2022-11-14 22:25:22
ill be honest this doesnt even seem like any genuine discussion is going on here id be surprised if really any of these people saw it because most of them arent even highlighting any of the great stuff going on in the film and are really just parroting the criticism of select extremely negative reviews from critics,2022-11-11 13:51:31
"yeah i grade them against other comic movies not like actual dramas or anything

that being said the 2 parts of the avengers movies are most certainly above an 8 and maybe the biggest event in movie history id also say guardians 1 thor ragnarock and winter soldier are 8 or above for all movies and not just comics",2022-11-11 16:46:48

not sure id call it racist but it was definitely weird for okoye to say that to everett ross of all people,2022-11-12 12:31:00
please stop trying to be a victim you wrote an entire essay because the word colonizer was used in a marvel movie as a joke there is no dictionary definition of racism in which the joke fits the definition of racism,2022-11-12 12:55:33
it was intended to be a friendly joke between shuri and others from wakanda and ross a term of endearment she uses for him from the first film,2022-11-12 15:01:56
"nothing was antiwhite though it was anti colonialism which the previous comment mentioned

colonizers happen to be white which is the truth",2022-11-14 03:34:14

i only typed as much as i did cuz i had just seen the movie and there was a lot more problems than there were good moments",2022-11-16 04:30:55
"you disagree

 do you even think defines what is considered oscarlevel acting",2022-11-11 08:12:50

"and im not asking anyone to but what is the point of discussion if its just going to a circle  the only time somebody should be downvoted this much is for purposely stating misleading information or lying or something offensive

disagreeing with somebody elses opinion is not a reason to downvote you are just trying to bury a differing one down to the bottom of the thread so nobody sees it",2022-11-14 18:13:26

sorry could you please remind me how i don’t remember much about bw it was pretty forgettable,2022-11-11 18:09:45
so it’s a cineplex thing i guess pretty on brand for them unfortunately,2022-11-11 08:23:23
she had actually shot scenes for the movie,2022-11-12 02:35:09
my remarks were lighthearted and tongueincheek but were reflective of my true feelings  it wasnt a good adaptation of the characters  the real joke was what would happen if you googled ann suda ironheart  especially at work,2022-11-19 01:49:28
it’s like this in almost all the marvel movies so it’s part of the recipe you should def stay for the credits the music helps close out the full movie feeling,2023-02-04 06:29:51
i agree theyre just making it more  and  every year,2023-01-21 23:37:10
i mightve missed something when did the wakandans speak it most of what i remember was either it was beads english or assumed eg when shuri was handed clothes and she sort of grokked what she was suppose to do,2023-02-11 00:08:38
it was the first time humans got close to talokan so i guess he took the suits to understand how they were able to withstand the pressure that deep in the seas,2022-11-13 21:36:46
they scavenge human tech for studies and to apply it to their own they are not as advanced as the wakandas,2022-11-14 14:50:39
well at that point he had been discovered,2022-12-07 17:54:29
how could he not,2022-11-16 15:01:26
killmonger is definitely worse at least namor genuinely cares about his people killmonger only cares about power and revenge,2022-11-13 23:18:51
i saw a king who will do any and everything to protect his people during a war,2022-11-13 14:20:15
the queen of a sovereign nation not wanting to  a scientist of a completely different nation shouldnt be a bad thing lol if talokan wanted riri dead they shouldve and couldve just did it themselves,2022-11-14 15:11:58
talokan people were unhinged killing civilians and cops left and right,2022-11-13 16:41:58
where they went to see the city not where they were imprisoned,2022-11-13 03:49:00
who said she knew  they already used sonic weapons  as apart of their regular arsenal,2022-11-14 03:43:25
it was probably just a guess but her assumption was correct,2022-11-13 20:39:33
she didnt she just knew it should be lethal to normal humans and the talokan just happened to be weak to that weapon  she also didnt know they should have superhuman regeneration,2022-11-16 22:28:57
i absolute agree with you as an in universe argument but i always find these kind of we dont use this because of our traditions and honour arguments crazy wheres the honour in putting your traditions and personal honour above the life of a child bigger picture people,2023-02-28 18:32:35
the spear is literally the only weapon the dora milaje use  they even literally say this in the movie,2022-11-16 13:31:13
i remember it being the contrary she mentioned that it was lethal from that close so theres nothing shuri could had done to save that character,2022-11-13 19:03:19
completely agree even outside huge franchises laying out every single thing in a movie makes lazy easily bored spoonfed viewership,2022-11-23 05:11:37
im happy with the sonic explanation too like how a blast wave from a bomb just iquifies your insides way nastier than a spear aound that can knit back together,2022-11-16 14:24:16
one was a guard with a spear that was about to  riri,2022-11-13 04:19:04
that would make sense for a lot but at least bucky should have been there,2022-12-28 00:53:56
they were at starks funeral because they just finished a war together and nothing else was happening,2023-02-22 06:22:25

hes not the brightest bulb in the ocean,2023-02-20 05:59:38
apparently,2023-02-16 22:25:40
shes iron man at home,2022-11-28 23:33:21
"what spurred her to make a  vibranium detector has she ever even encountered vibranium

how do you even test it",2022-12-28 12:24:22
exactly  like she had to be oblivious right and how would she test it anyway on top of that its such an unexplored plot point wow,2022-11-30 14:16:22
"what spurred her to make a  vibranium detector

she says her professor dared her or said it was impossible something like that",2023-02-28 06:56:43
because she wanted to flex  if ur a tech genius obviously you would build something never before seen  for fun just like how tony stark mentioned he hacked the pentagon when he was 12 why the  would he ever do that,2023-02-22 06:27:48
i can ask all of 1 2 and 3even after this comment you just made lol,2022-11-18 08:13:56
so recruit her,2022-11-28 03:42:11
yeah no kidding they didnt even write her character to have any groundbreaking additions to the story except the whole before the movie even started i did these things in my garage,2022-12-04 16:06:05
but there isnt really a way genius people act mannerism comes from education and upbringing not so much from intellect she is not present enough in the film to make a judgment of that sort,2023-02-16 21:44:41
oh youre just racist huh you couldve led with that bud,2022-11-29 22:18:36
mbaku started out as an enemy then became a friend and trusted ally over the movies how is that not an arc,2022-11-29 01:07:24
no character arc was a very small point i made in a much larger one did you read the rest of the comment i didnt say it was solely because of thati explain it pretty thoroughly,2022-11-28 04:30:19
why are you ignoring the fact it was obvious that he could have gone to  the scientist but specifically asked wakanda bc he 1 felt it was their responsibility bc they put his nation at risk by choosing to expose the v’s awesomeness to the world and 2 that he wanted to ally with them against the outside world it was less about riri,2022-12-03 04:27:57
why would he think that off rip its strongly implied he rarely leaves talokan for extended periods of time i can buy him not thinking that far ahead he does a lot of things in this movie that makes sense to him but not really anyone else,2022-11-28 04:26:59
that seems more like him coping that he lost than anything else even within the context of the film namora treats him with skepticism and were necessarily meant to follow him 100 percent on this logic,2022-12-02 13:58:36
they didn’t have any advanced technology yet namor had already decided he hated the surface worldit wasn’t worth saving and he was like 10 years old at the time,2022-11-30 09:04:50
"they needed to get namor away from the ocean they had to lure him with the vibranium miner capture him and the plan was to weaken and  him in the ship with heat

did you forget the sonic soundwaves in the water it forced them to the surface originally they were mostly forced to fight above water and therefore climb the ship only one of them seemed able to attack the sonic speakers so its fair to assume that wasnt an easy feat for most of them to be able to fight underater at that time",2023-02-01 06:35:25

its interesting because in the comics they have the hatut zeraze who are like a hybrid secret policespecial forces and they run around with guns the name is supposed to translate to war dogs which is a term they used in the last movie but for people who are just like regular spies abroad basically instead of the hatut zeraze i mean having a bunch of navy seals in white panther costumes probably isnt as interesting cinematically as a dope spear fight but i feel like theres probably a way you could port the fundamental concept over,2022-11-17 05:01:56
to be fair the last time a guy with straight as from the us naval academy knowledge of a modern wayfare and tons of experience as a vet tried to share his insight into how wakanda and its army should be managed it went spectacularly wrong but if njadaka was just a tiny bit more psychologically stable and less concentrated on his immediate revenge vs the bigger picture the movies would be over waaaay too quickly cause thats exactly it he would be too efficient with the instruments hed be given,2022-11-14 15:28:31

"i wanted colonialism to be a more significant driver of conflict in the movie than it was neither wakanda nor namor ever felt like they were actually threatened by colonialism in fact after that scene at the un namor was functioning more as a colonial power than france or the us which felt odd to me and didn’t make much sense thematically

i feel like they originally wanted to go for a deeper exploration of how colonized groups can be pitted against each other instead of resisting their colonizers and just never fleshed that out either to make room for dealing with boseman passing away or to avoid offending anyone",2022-11-15 19:23:48

the theme of thors story since ragnarok has been him struggling to step into odins place taking over as king and unlocking his inherent powers rather than channeling them through mjolnir in ragnarok fighting his own traumatic intergalactic war and its consequences in infinity war and endgame even winds up adopting his enemies child in lt only hes open with her about it unlike odin and loki",2022-11-27 16:08:46

big disagreement there the mcu has guys who are roiding big time like hemsworth and evans  bautista too but hes former wwe so not sure if he counts but the majority of the heroes are not really anything unbelievable cumberbatch ruffalo downy jr for example are literally just normal nonobese guys holland pratt and boseman are in pretty good shape but their physiques are nothing that scream roided to the hills like its entirely possible these guys were in sauce to get to certain physiques in a shirt amount of time  but the physiques themselves arent ridiculous,2022-12-07 18:48:30

look im not  i know you need fats to survive and that the guys in mcu are dehydrated af im also not one of those people who accuse anyone with muscles for taking peds i used to focus on building muscle so i get it its not hard to get athletic like chadwick or tom holland problem is these actors go from 0 to 100 and act like you can pack on 10 pounds of muscle in 3 months while already being muscular beforehand another problem i was getting is that they are supposed to have magical super strength so it would make sense if at least some of them were looking normal not even for representation i dont care abt that  just for a bit of realism for example  thor was a good opportunity but the inclusive idiots at disney managed to make him a  joke what irony even though thor in mythology looked more like a modern strongman perhaps hafthor bjornsson before he got shredded was a good thor or the bollywood guy from eternals like why did he have to have veins popping on his  cheecks he has magic powers and was clearly a theatre type in the movie,2022-11-19 10:03:03

instead of how t’challa was raised who was oblivious on an empathetic level to the outside world 

i think they could of touched more on it in the film but i think it’s in line for t’challa’s character arc and fits beautifully",2022-11-14 13:48:12

i mean it’s obvious that the ocean operation was years in the making and it’s not just something that happened over night to get that deep you would’ve had to be looking a while the fact that france tried to steal from mali kinda lends to the idea different nations are using trying to get v in multiple ways,2022-12-03 05:38:31

and why the  did they call okoyes husband a traitor they are the traitors killmonger was king of wakanda by right and trial",2022-11-21 23:59:34
so technically killmonger never won the fight as per tradition as one of the two would have to yield or die and t’challa did neither the end fight ended up being even as both had a suit  herb powers so by tradition the fight is even killmonger dies so t’challa wins,2022-11-20 06:53:14

i kept getting flashbacks of mr nimbus from rick and morty ,2022-11-12 12:42:26
i actually liked the fluttering wings  reminded me of hermes,2022-11-12 05:02:32
in fairness tho they made it look real cool at least imo,2022-11-11 22:03:44
i couldnt get over the fluttering sounds the wings made,2022-11-12 03:50:46
yes its much easier to accept pure will to fly than tiny  bird wings on a 180200 pound muscular man,2022-11-16 17:35:56

in terms of technology i saw the sun the bombs the masks weapons and the current production of whatever that was so there was definitely some but yeah i also wouldve liked to see more tech swimming and floating around can hardly be the most efficient way of getting around a city,2022-11-29 02:44:49
"not to mention they keep calling wakanda the most advanced civilization on earth and talokan is supposed to rival it

also have they never heard about win win situations negotiations or diplomacy the talokan are waterbound and have no idea whats going on on the land wakanda is the most advanced nation on land why cant wakanda spy for them to find out what the cia is planning then warn them the talokan can then send out animals to sabotage the scouting group that the cia sends to find vabranium or what ever they try to build so that they can mine it the talokan should be gods underwater compared to normal people the cia should never be able to mine underwater

instead of looking for a way to help each other since they are both facing the same problem and threat to their existence they decide to fight and  each other how   is that which reminds me of tribalism in africa which in turn just depresses me arent they supposed to be advanced civilizations the whole thing was  ",2023-02-19 21:05:44

what did you think,2022-11-11 09:14:29
i bet we’ll get a namor solo project to explore it more,2022-11-12 02:04:57
namor is definitely set to be recurring too well probably see more of talokan in the future,2022-11-12 06:20:48
fun fact but namor came two whole years before the concept of aquaman,2022-12-07 06:35:10
i am not saying i don’t know what it was in paper i’m saying i wanted to feel as to why more show me more of talokan and what it means to him the glimpses of that place were very rushed and as beautiful as it was it didn’t feel fully lived ininhabited,2022-11-12 16:24:04
walanda ,2022-11-17 08:29:02
yeah im fine that we didnt get his full character since he survives and will show up again its only when they just axe them off at the end of the movie that it feels like a waste,2022-11-11 16:31:15
i mean it wasnt her movie she was a side character plus she was the catalyst of the entire plot and she was the one who pieced together namors weakness saying she did nothing really oversimplifies it,2022-11-14 16:11:54
"that would have made way more sense

the plot resolution was we wont  the girl in exchange for wakandatalokan cooperation that could have been agreed to when shuri was exploring talokan",2022-11-14 23:54:35
"it didn’t happen bc marvel and the department of justice that’s literally why agent martin freeman exists so that we have a good guy cia agent a better movie would have been wakanda and talokan fight over riri cia bugs ross gets info about talokan uses the conflict between waknads and taloka to steal v from both countries both realise that they need to have an uneasy partnership and riri steps up and aids them namor  anti hero grey area character that has potential to be an ally or a foe to wakanda 
cia the big bad but have their obligatory good guy in ross and wakandablack panther be reluctant hero",2022-12-03 05:23:20

oof ,2022-11-15 02:37:57
her family agreed to it and it wasnt cgi it was all reuse from the force awakens deleted scenes if you meant grand moff tarkin he was only in it for 5 seconds anyway,2022-12-17 03:40:43
yea like the movie was already too long but i don’t think it would’ve been a bad idea to hire some young actors to look like them playing as children and as teens in wakanda to pad her memories,2022-11-27 10:07:38
that would be really  up thinking about it lol hey so youre gonna die aww thats sad  can we film some scenes of you in the afterlife just in case you die and we gotta write that into our next movie thanks,2022-11-14 16:01:48
chadwick definitely didnt tell them about his condition considering they had to scrap the script after he passed,2022-11-17 04:52:01
marvel didn’t know until he passed,2022-11-20 13:14:13
i think thats why chadwick did the what if he couldnt do the action but couldnt tell marvel why but accepted the voice role no one at marvel knew he was sick until he died,2022-11-26 18:50:57
sure but in that moment she was making a  speech incredibly acted but the words were ,2022-11-23 04:49:16
not to mention all the horrible  nebula has done  and yet now she’s hanging around with the guardians and having surprisingly wholesome scenes with tony and rhodey,2022-11-12 07:03:01
yeah they literally compare loki to  with the subtlety of a brick to the face in avengers and then within 2 films were meant to like him lol,2022-11-17 23:04:13
if everything fails alligatornamor will do,2022-11-12 02:02:00
yeah lokis redemption arc just  me off given how many innocent people hes killed,2022-11-13 09:08:29
i mean after shooting one in the head it doesnt matter where she shoots the other one,2022-11-14 06:26:51
she wouldve been absolutely shredded by that glass anyway,2022-11-15 02:36:02
his whole goal of going there was to  the queen it wouldnt have mattered,2022-11-15 23:25:06

"i understand seeking revenge but after namor divulged about his close relationship with his mother it really didn’t sit well with me that he’d intentionally  someone else’s mother 

and i wished shuri would’ve then made namor realize that he’s become the colonist that he so much despises that he has attacked an innocent people just like the colonists attacked his mother’s people",2022-11-17 03:21:01
in the comics namor is a genocider as well on top of a wannabe  is he right in the comics for it,2022-11-11 06:32:14
one single person saying a dude that wants to genocide the world isnt noble  you off,2022-11-11 12:23:37
has wakanda been genocided,2022-11-11 12:22:40
he made his bed when he decided to save the slaves what he did as a kid was heroic but if people are willing to  him and his people for it he feels that there’s no other way than to fight,2022-11-13 06:25:05
ah okay now his planned  of her and planned global genocide sound more reasonable,2022-11-11 16:58:52
why,2022-11-13 04:30:59
the newest one is apparently quite good i want to watch it because i loved amber midthunder in legion and shes from my home state,2022-11-12 22:31:04
im 90 sure thats the only reason they invented nanotech and used it on every single suit at this point,2022-11-12 20:42:33
was hoping that  would end after whedon quit,2022-11-11 07:15:39
i was so annoyed when shuri took off her helmet after being impaled wrong time to lower your defenses,2022-11-11 12:24:20
"i’m not saying she’s a bad actress she was just perfect as a comic reliefpartnered with the lead i didn’t think shuri was the standout in this movie either okoye m’baku riri namor nakia and the micheala cole character pulled focus from her in their scenes i don’t think there’s anything shameful in being an excellent supportingcharacter actor

ps i didn’t mention angela bassett because it’s not a fair comparison she’s a better actress than almost anyone else in the mcu",2022-11-15 13:51:23
i wasnt a fan of her design tbh but that might be personal taste too bulky for me,2022-11-12 15:35:17
the movie one houses a ton of tech to support super strength and underwater stuff so it makes a little bit more sense especially since its a prototype hopefully itll get smaller in the future,2022-11-12 06:15:18
i just watched it andit really doesnt look that different to me lol based on your comments i was expecting something horrible its the suit her group wears in the comics almost directly,2023-11-14 03:27:53
but how does namor know any of that like how would he know any of the data is encrypted or that it was just one person who worked on it,2022-11-16 06:05:33
"and also they were pressured to look for vibranium asap right it was a race against the world they could crack the code probably semi quickly but getting vibranium was so important i think they disregarded that and thought “oh we’ll just have her make another one”


what i dont get though is why they didnt do something with her as soon as she invented something like that if not kidnapping her offering her a billion dollar deal or something



also shuri was dumb she shouldn’t have killed him thatd be giving into vengeance and making him a martyr but she shouldve chopped off his wings and arms and feet to dismember him and have him go home as a warning “mess with wakanda that happens” after that come back with a knife at his throat with the demands that every single wakandan alive be safe and moving back home before she gave him back




…might be too dark though and im glad she didnt because i want to see more of him",2022-11-27 21:54:31
yeah i thought that was really clear in the movie if anyone finds that as a fluke then theyre not really watching the movie,2022-12-07 06:51:04
i’ve noticed that there’s a lack of comments regarding the fact that it’s their mothers that “reach out” to them in the final battle i love that m’baku shares the wisdom with her and that we saw t’challa rule with compassion an empathy so it wasn’t completely split by gender but i think their change of heart to cooperation is meant to be influenced by the contrast between killmonger’s very raw masculine energy and the love of a mother,2023-02-02 06:37:09
no when he made the post he couldnt remember the name but has since edited it to the right name,2022-11-20 06:05:07

it gave me chills  just got chills thinking about it again  amazingly well done,2022-11-12 06:42:13

"oof no i know the scene youre talking about though was he tracing them or painting them

if he was painting them it could be depicting the battle but if he was just tracing over them it would mean his people have had some sort of prophecy",2022-11-11 13:23:09
it depicted the final battle between him and shuri,2022-11-11 14:05:59
i thought he had just painted it it’s his room a jaguar and a black panther,2022-11-23 03:40:25
who was that i totally missed her context,2022-11-22 04:20:58
it sounds cool but pretty sure theres racist connotations heck its even the reason his moniker as manape isnt used here,2022-11-11 14:04:26
right then we could have a panther and gorilla team up mbaku beating people down shuri cutting them up,2022-11-11 09:17:36
bro the fact you think this is sick and are oblivious to the obvious connotation is so sad lol,2022-11-11 16:25:32
in avengers 1 cap says theres only 1  mam and he doesnt dress like that  so i can believe many people would believe that their  created all,2022-11-14 04:17:21
"probably because the beings considered gods dont interact with everyone and by the time we see them doing so humans have advanced to the point where the gods abilities can be understood and explained so far weve only seen the mcu people interact with gods that nobody really believes in anymore  present day wakandans havent met bast and shuri isnt religious though visiting the ancestral plane may have affected that so we know they havent seen that their  is actually real

it would be hard to consider thor an actual  when you see humans like tony stark and steve rogers going toe to toe with them",2022-11-12 10:31:42
if you believe in a single all powerful true  then you can believe that your  is superior to the ones you can see ie your  created those gods alternative explanation also could be that if a  like thor and loki can exist then why wouldnt your  also exist,2022-11-19 06:18:05
have you ever heard of henotheism also they could just handwave all those things away as demonic activity,2022-11-12 08:01:14
"killmonger was still of the same clan and he didnt have any opposing beliefs we dont know whether he didnt have faith either as his story was opposing the actual physical choices of the panther tribe not their spiritual beliefs he didnt believe in wakanda hoarding its wealth and staying hidden  thats the prominent belief he shows

since his father was born and raised wakandan and shared his knowledge of wakanda with killmonger its highly likely he also shared the stories of bast he also didnt seem surprised or shocked about the ancestral plane  unlike shuri who was surprised it was actually real

edit also none of what i said is the comics version thats all in the mcu its stated very clearly in the movies bast is even in love and thunder",2022-11-11 08:24:51
that movie made… a lot of things jokes ,2022-11-12 01:13:59
what was the joke,2022-11-12 03:23:40
"they dont know they exist just like how the modern day people didnt know or believe thor actually existed

its been hundreds or thousands of years in most cases since any of the existing gods interacted with people in the mcu before the current period if my dad told me a super strong woman wearing a panther outfit adorned in gold told me where a magical glowing heartshaped fruit that gave him super strength id be inclined to believe him because there is proof  but if it was something my 2nd cousins third wife had told me probably not

faith is just a belief in a story someone else told you about something so those in the panther tribe who take on the mantel of bp believe in the story passed down by their ancestors to some degree because they at least get some proof in the form of getting to visit the ancestral plane and the powers given by the fruit they cant prove bast exists because the last person to have actually met bast was their ancestor over a thousand years ago but 23 parts of the faith have been shown to be legit so its reasonable for them to have faith in bast also existing

the jabari dont have a magical fruit that gives them powers and dont get to go to the ancestral plane as far as we know so there is no reason for them to believe or have faith in the story that is passed down through the generations of the panther tribe instead they were provided the trees in the mountain that they use for wood so they have every reason to believe hanuman exists because they have their own proof for their own stories

patron gods come from the same faith hanuman and bast are different faiths believing only your  exists doesnt negate other people believing in a different  you just believe theyre wrong we have no idea if the wakandans who follow bast  the 4 tribes who allied to the panther tribe follow bast since the first bp  believe that hanuman also exists considering they still consider jabari as wakandans its likely the average wakandan just thinks theyre full of  instead of believing hanuman exists  since thes nonjabari only ever refer to bast and the jabari only refer to hanuman",2022-11-12 15:30:53
"yep well more than assumed the wakandans minus the jabari believe that bp is the avatar of bast  as in bast blesses the bp with the powers it has its unknown whether the average wakandan actually knows about the heart shaped herb  weve only seen chiefs scientists and priests express knowledge of it bp is the protector that bast has blessed the wakandans

it could later be revealed built on storywise that bast interacted with the wakandans in order to protect and hide the vibranium  as it is an extraterrestrial metal and extremely limited in supply",2022-11-15 03:09:26
"yea i get that

we all have different racial connotations around the world its common place to call someone a monkey or cheeky monkey in australia  it just means someone who is being silly or a bit of a fool its less used now but if you call someone an ape youre saying theyre all feet and no hands using those terms to be racist definitely still happens here and its usually through american influence

so black gorilla probably wouldnt necessarily be seen as racially insulting here  black abbo or black gin on the other hand 100 would

i can 100 see an issue with manape though  man is used to describe the ape the ape is like a man itd be like saying manspider  the spider is like a man we can say yellow sun and that means the sun is yellow whereas sun yellow would mean the yellow is like the sun",2022-11-17 06:53:41
i think it’s pretty safe to assume they stay good  sure don’t see nakia turning she is the mother of t’challa,2022-11-15 05:07:38
he was already a villian that took a hero turn i dont think he is changing back,2022-11-25 21:23:30
which makes me wonder if theoretically of they can all have the strength of the bp since the water people did too,2022-11-12 07:58:35
they can change the ritual or make an exception,2022-11-15 05:18:01
he did upgrade his staff it went from all wood to an orb of vibranium being held by a carved gorilla hand,2022-11-14 06:18:18
you dont remember how the dora milajae showed up in the winter soldier and captain america show they disabled bucky falcon and discount cap with ease they just need the black panther for the super threats,2022-11-14 04:12:55
i thought they were gonna pull a buffy and ask drink the purple liquid,2022-11-22 04:25:43
lots of people use plot hole when they mean plot contrivance,2022-11-15 05:15:28
" not really a plot hole lol traditions are extremely important in a lot of cultures

especially since wakanda has this as an tradition going back to the founding of their nation the oldest unbroken nation in the world allegedly given to them by their 

imagine if israel still had the stone tablets moses wrote the torah on if they broke and they could be rebuilt nobody would give a  that we have high tech copies",2022-11-12 20:54:48
oh i did  i mean it worked but i see the extra  and  now  thanks,2022-11-12 21:48:36
wow nice reference,2022-12-21 15:04:43
looks like a bootleg toy with nice packaging,2022-11-15 03:37:41
they apparently just managed to get underwater lights going so maybe with their alliance with wakanda theyll get some real lighting soon,2022-11-12 06:45:47
"i was totally fine with it being really dark and mysterious rather than the aquaman route which made atlantis this loud and vibrant underwater las vegas i mean it looked pretty but i bought into talokan much more it struck me as a far more realistic depiction of what an underwater civilization could look and feel like 

aquamans atlantis was safe and comfortable like here is a city where modern people would design an underwater civilization tailored to humanity as we know it

namors talokan was the opposite not a city tailored to normal humanity but a city tailored to a true underwater nation of people its dark and mysterious to us but perfectly comfortable and normal to them",2022-11-12 16:43:42
probably didn’t want it to be similar to aquaman lighting,2022-11-11 17:48:51
"i think to make is more starkly contrasted with wakanada 

talokan is ancient its very much a society in stasis because theyve had nothing bug them under the sea wakanda is futuristic and vibrant a vision of a people surrounded by potential enemies that had to advance in order to remain hidden",2022-11-14 18:28:26
avatar definitely won the vibrant award in the exotic civilisation of mysterious blue people category and the opponent even had vibranium,2022-11-17 01:12:08
i honestly thought there was something wrong with the actual film for the movie it was so bad lol after the first sneak attack on the navy boat i thought it would change figured it was to show how stealth they were but nope the whole movie was dark shadows,2022-11-11 18:18:06
" that actually makes a lot of sense i know how useful shadows are in art and animation and how special effects teams love using the darkness to highlight and make the subject more realistic rex scene in jurassic park for example but to think of it being used to hide unfinished areasman thats grim 

i can see now why some older films have special effects that hold up a lot better than newer ones sucks to be part of a huge production line instead of a standalone piece eh talokan wouldve been such an amazing sight to behold if it wasnt shoehorned into black panthers list of plotlines a lot of the superhero films feel this way nowadays — different set pieces tacked together to show as many new series and subplots as they can instead of letting them breathe and flow naturally",2022-11-12 09:14:54
i’d watch a namor movie after this honestly,2022-11-19 05:52:54
not my best phrasing lol,2022-11-11 13:07:22

this guy gets it,2022-11-13 04:24:20
think about all the committees rhodey had to sit in on explaining the suit and deciding what to do with it in terms of additional rd operations etc so many forms and reports too no one wants to see that movie,2023-01-15 11:22:03
i think comics have done this a couple of times small time skip to near future and everyone is suped up somehow be it mutation tech or whatever,2022-11-15 04:56:07
"that still doesnt explain the lack of technological advances they had war machine in an airforce base all the post ny invasion tech mysterio countless other threats which shieldother agencies fought heck they had helicarriers for a while tony starks stealth plane and so much research ultroniron man dusted sokovia in wrecked robots

its just insane that they have functionally not changed nearly all modern tech is antiquated the invasion of new york surely at least showed them that",2022-11-12 22:21:21
"idk if thats enough time to completely reboot their operating strategies especially when half the world was gone for the last 5

i disagree thatd be exactly the time to recruit metahumans

look at the recruitment surge after 911 the snap was a worldwide disaster militaries worldwide marketing to keep us safe from the next thanos wouldve been scooping up metahumans left and right",2022-11-11 19:29:33
"all true but the lack of technological progress in these units is staggering

coulson was shooting lasers at loki in 2012 and the us air force has had access to the war machine suit for nearly as long some guy in new york was creating atier flight suits and equipment with scraps from chitauri that stood up to spiderman reverseengineered equipment that far outpaces simple guns should be available for the most elite units of the world governments 

stuff like vibranium inuniverse is beyond nuclear secret level clearance stuff in the real world this is the most unique and powerful element in the universe the idea that the governments of the world will send lasers and supers against randos like kamala khan but not against vibranium deposits is crazy",2022-11-14 18:36:24
but in reality the snap would have rollon effects for decades now it’s just brought up as a one liner,2022-11-17 20:38:42
my point is that none of their depictions of the effects went anywhere near depicting how catastrophically disruptive it should have been the universe just doesn’t make sense any more and if they want to move on they should stop making references to it,2022-11-13 18:59:09
"oh im not disagreeing with you im just wondering where all these toys are on an international scale if theyve got time to issue them to people shooting at high school students 

you can tell me this is for top secret superhero missions only but what get more top secret and superheroy than missions involving the acquisitiontheft of vibranium 

long story short i feel like the navy seals should have access to laser beams at this point if coulson was shooting lasers in 2012",2022-11-11 21:37:16

"yes context matters theyre talking about what the navy sealsspecial forces are doing and why there isnt a team of supers to deal with spec ops 

im not sure how a team dedicated to the interest of a mutant population of a few hundred matches up with this scenario xforce is just the black ops of a group who is pretty much entirely made up of different teams of supes it really doesnt fit the post you replied to in any way  at all",2022-11-12 00:04:53
if youre inclined to read fantasy i recommend reading rebecca roanhorses black sun its the first in a trilogy and its a fantasy written entirely around a fictionalized indigenous precolonial mesoamerica with prophecies dark magic gnarly violence and intrigue and funnily enough one of the focal characters is a sorceress with explicit mermaidaquatic person roots,2022-11-14 19:21:24

it didnt remind you of any of the several other hollywood scenes where a mayan woman is forced to give birth underwater while evading spanish conquistadors,2022-11-19 13:34:54
the characters especially the villains are pretty two dimensional and the goes for the sake of it fit in better in the torture  era than after it the chase scenes and cinematography are still amazing though,2022-11-19 22:13:06
drizzt reference,2022-11-15 05:06:14
im still thinking about that movie so dope,2022-11-14 22:39:14
"did you miss the part where the wakandan citizens were living normal lives 

there’s also a big difference between a landlocked nation that fears being discovered and one that is underwater wakanda focused on weapons and technology that fit its imminent threats and we barely scratched the surface on not only the talokan civilization it’s much larger than one city but also their technology they wiped out most of a crew with just a siren song and they have an underwater sun there’s probably more",2023-02-02 06:57:33
no it’s a comic book reference that just doesn’t really make sense in the world of the movie there’s a pretty obvious difference in pronunciation ,2022-11-11 06:59:44
the wakandans use ah sounds all the time though t’challa ramonda m’baku nakia etc,2022-11-11 15:46:33
yeah the whole name thing was a a stretch lol,2022-11-20 14:57:51
appearance wise not chronologically,2022-11-11 23:31:52
rivers i think,2022-11-15 05:01:25
i mean theyre all super strong only inconvenienced by bullets can survive getting run through with spears and have weapons made of vibranium id hardly call them useless,2022-11-14 18:14:47
"my take on this is that ramonda fatally underestimates namor

yeah this is actually an issue namor told her what he would do everyone should have been on alert but it seemed a surprise when namor did come

ramonda might have gotten a lot of people killed",2022-11-12 21:10:58
"but they like… almost failed hilariously so

they brought a single ship to fight enemies in their advantage had a single sonic beam that was stopped by stabbing it then when they “won” they just sailed back why didn’ fly why weren’t there more

and shuri only won cause the plot demanded she should cause namor is apparently so blinded and dumb that he spends his time doing jump scare attacks on shuri instead of touching the water five feet away to get his powers back

like it was a pretty half baked ending battle lol",2022-11-15 04:24:20
i don’t think she was thinking clearly because her last child’s life was at risk as a mother i think she’d let her whole kingdom burn to save her daughter,2022-12-31 03:33:51
how have i never heard of this movie the cast is stacked and the very brief synopsis i read sounds incredibly intriguing i know what my next movie night is going to be,2022-11-14 00:37:22
that is how i interpreted it as well and i hope that this is the direction they go i would love to see mbaku in the role for the next movie,2022-11-11 09:16:54
i agree i also wondered since it felt so planned if this was something m’baku and shuri had agreed upon ahead of time that shuri willingly give up the throne as a result of her near descent into blind vengeance in the battle with namor i don’t think she foresaw the existence of t’challa’s son which could create some conflict regarding the succession line in the future,2022-11-11 13:38:23
yeah thats how i understood it as well especially with the callback to the first movie at ramondas funeral where shuri said you would leave this kingdom to a child who scoffs at tradition its a sweet gesture imo,2022-11-11 13:53:21
imo this was the only way it made sense its not like shuri can accept challenges they  you of the bp power before the challenge basically any adult wakandan could beat the pulp out of shuri in straight up handtohand combat,2022-11-11 16:12:24
i imagine we’ll get more of that with the wakanda disney series that ryan coogler is working on,2022-11-12 08:37:05
agreed i think that’s what happened because after the funeral and he tells her that people want to go to the jabari land while they’re lands are rebuilt and she says something along the lines of “a lot of people  would be in debt to the jabari”,2022-11-11 13:01:31
"if you read between the lines it gets funnier the jabari had been in the mountains for centuries before tchalla but they still had the right to challenge

how many jabari like mbaku marched themselves down to challenge only to get their  kicked and sent home",2022-11-12 20:45:29
nah im pretty sure the throne thing was serious as shuri was going to live with ol girl in haiti,2022-11-13 06:29:57
michael b jordan is a massive nerd irl and wanted that design to be based exactly like vegeta’s armor killmonger is very vegeta like you gota admit,2022-11-12 03:11:22
i mean canonically killmonger likes anime so this tracks,2022-11-11 15:46:11
you got the idea lol,2022-11-11 14:40:50
my guess is that it is planting seeds that will pay off later either on a d ark iron heart thunderbolts or something unannounced or a future bp project it took up way too much time to be nothing,2022-11-13 17:21:56
"thats pretty normal screenplay writing for the second act to introduce a sidequest of some sort that helps the protagonist come to certain realizations before reorienting them towards their original goal 

aside from her knowing how to find the rebels which could have been done in any number of simpler ways the rescue of princess leia in act 2 of the original star wars is relatively pointless to the finale of that film she literally just stares at a screen the whole time im not saying its a bad thing star wars is near perfect in terms of screenplay pacing",2022-11-15 09:57:22
"we dont even know if well be getting a proper bp3 phase 5 is already fleshed out and phase 6 leads into past 2025 meanwhile coogler has still yet to say whether or not hes willing to do a third one him and feige have only talked about the possibility of it but nothing is set in stone

so while black panther will still show up in other movies and cooglers production company is producing projects like ironheart bp3 is up in the air",2022-11-11 15:30:38
youre right its way less complicated than what i remembered they just wanted them to find riri so they could  her,2022-11-11 14:56:44
they followed the wakandans to  her once they found her,2022-11-12 06:27:42
considering only ross used it he probably dont know how to use it beyond contacting rhamonda,2022-11-15 00:23:42
" cia scenes and have vals appearance to a post credit scenes

according to people who saw an unfinished cut this was initially a postcredit scene",2022-11-11 11:57:01
i like the concept of other nations looking for an excuse to go to war with wakanda but the movie has too many other side plots and this is the one that drew the short straw it feels like it ends before it can go anywhere ross commits treason and then…that’s it i guess,2022-11-11 05:12:13
i appreciate the moral issue of what americans would do with that technology proving along with the french that they still after resources etc,2022-11-11 09:18:08
well they did need some token white people for the movie  all of the white people were bad guys  trying to findsteal vibranium cia and government wanting to start a war  even martin freemans character who was supposedly a good guy was a traitor to his own agency,2022-11-11 18:44:54
i thought so too but i was really hoping that they’d be the third player at that final fight to kinda prove namor’s point would have made shuri’s arc more convincing too but now all the cia stuff feels dangling,2022-11-11 07:47:14
she feels more like the new coulson sure shes director but shes way less serious than fury and coulson iswas director himself too agents of shield spoilers but anybody who cares has already seen it marvel certainly doesnt care,2022-11-11 07:37:36
isnt this the type of character development and setup that should be reserved for the television shows and not in the middle of a movie that the subplot is only tangentially related to,2022-11-11 17:25:23
this was my thinking too it feels like the scenes with the cia really will have no long term impact on the mcu other than to have more scenes with val running around it didn’t feel like anything that happened could be relevant down the line to set something like the thunderbolts up,2022-11-11 06:32:52
origin stories are solo while sequels are just launchpad for new origins stories,2022-11-11 17:57:31
mcu been doing this since age of ultron,2023-02-06 03:16:03
kinda how i felt about the comically evil militaryshield in wandavision they just existed so that wanda wasnt the villain even unintentionally of her own story instead we get a bunch of monica rambeau as the foil to evil hayward who rather than being allowed to justifably react to wandas actions with force like he was doing in the beginning decides to be an ultradick at the end who is resurrecting one of the worlds heroes as an ai  and who tries to shoot wandas kids instead followed by theyll never know what you did for them ugh,2022-11-11 15:12:50
its such a fun villain performance i want her to have a regular part in these movies already stop making me wait,2022-11-11 05:03:45
shuri is not good she tells namor this before she spares him vengeance has consumed us but that doesnt mean she cant make positive decisions we cannot let it consume our people,2022-11-11 13:37:08
really they brought killmonger back specifically to have this dialogue with her that she kept hiding the fact she saw killmonger pushing her to seek vengeance from nakia while later having flashbacks of her mother and killmonger describing tchallas mercy as too noble pretty directly spelled out her conflict all culminating in her sparing namor and basically admitting that she would  him if it wasnt for knowing what it would cause like mbaku warned her,2022-11-11 15:41:06
lupita legit was stunning when she first appeared on screen in the movie i was in shocked how gorgeous she was this time,2022-11-11 14:38:49

that didn’t happen and i think it would have been more interesting",2022-11-11 08:29:48

tony guarded the arc reactor tech jealously because as a former war profiteer he saw firsthand what his creations did in the wrong hands rhodey got one by stealing it and tony trusted him just enough to not bother taking it back pepper got one i imagine to protect her not because he ever wanted her to fight in it peter got a spider suit because tony saw a lot of himself in peter and wanted to pass the baton,2022-11-13 00:55:36
yeah he plays favourites because tony was a know it all  with a  complex,2022-11-11 16:44:17

the wakandans had iron man suits of their own though too the mcu is basically giving everyone iron man suits,2022-11-11 18:50:57
so what you are saying is she lacks balance in the force,2022-11-16 20:28:04
and you’re here on this spoiler heavy thread they called you a madman,2022-11-14 04:36:26
"i didnt say anything about her onset behaviour though her absolute nuthousery was clear for all to see on her own social media and i believe mocking her is fair game

i still enjoyed the movie well enough regardless",2022-11-15 05:51:22

he was a murderous psychopath for the entire movie and it wasn’t developedearned at all he left the ocean one time and saw a  plantation that’s the entire foundation for his villainy,2022-11-28 16:52:37
i mean i bet he would want to  them too then also for riri he felt it was personal because it was her device that allowed the surface to threaten his homeland once the word was out the situation for him is now forever complicated so he wanted revenge for that,2022-11-11 07:21:32
"i think the bigger issue is that they found the stuff the cat was out of the bag the world military was coming they knew vibranium was in that spot of the ocean and the presence or absence of another vibranium tracker at that point was irrelevant they didnt need to build another one they already found the only vibranium ever discovered outside of wakanda

full stop there shouldve been 14 aircraft carriers parked around a 10 mile radius the next day if this stuff is legitimately the most important element in the known universe when you see the extent that global powers went to to recoversteal nukes during the cold war when nukes were the beallendall weapon what they did to secure vibranium after they finally confirmed it was there is farcical

there wouldve been an interesting dynamic if telokan and the un went ahead and started scrapping and the deciding factor on who got to win the conflict was whomever wakanda decided to tap for victory thered be no way for them to avoid the grey area of that sort of decision youre gonna  one group off irrevocably",2022-11-11 21:11:28
people like namor and thanos have an agenda and just look for excuses to execute that agenda,2022-11-11 10:55:30
i never said he was noble they chose to portray him in a fashion that rings true to his character in some arcs he’s not a clear good guy his rationale is madness but so was thanos,2022-11-11 04:41:02
too many people around let namor pick a few of them off namor 2024,2022-11-11 11:35:39

my aerodynamics background reading this ,2022-11-13 21:41:34
yeah its a bit weird this is reaching this level of drama she is the director of the cia and shes been recruiting a team of superpeople does she report to some other higher power probably does it matter for the story currently being told no,2022-11-15 09:21:34
the idea that fury’s avengers initiative was a catastrophic failure could be a cool angle to explore after all it resulted in the creation of a deadly ai the destruction of an entire country the destruction of a small airport and death for a couple of its most prominent members i could see a bureaucrat looking at the whole thing like a failed experiment,2022-11-14 18:45:52
its so funny that marvel is spending all this time to carefully meticulously set up thunderbolts to the point its impacting the pacing and plotting of multiple other projects but meanwhile dc was like eh  it heres a suicide squad movie with basically no set up deal with it and theyve done that twice with wildly different results,2022-11-15 15:16:23
ross didnt even know what game he was playing,2022-11-14 08:02:41
the cia freaking out over a government that has better technology than us and they cant just stage a coup to destabilize them is likehonestly so on point like i sorta thought val was a hydra double agent in the government and she might still be but her just being director of the cia also absolutely fits too,2022-11-12 21:46:49
is that her only motivation is vibranium i feel like that is a single film villain type of motivation her character just feels weird and under developed a villain for villains sake,2022-11-11 20:11:41
the cia is not a character julia louis dreyfus is the character i dont know who she is her name why she is doing these things absolutely no motivations visible other than i had a dream about this once,2022-11-12 16:47:53
i think so i thought their whole design was cool including their voice,2022-11-11 20:14:46
phenomenal scene i’m loving the amazing acting from them,2022-11-11 22:30:09
"that monologue was so good it instantly gave me joaquin phoenix vibes in the scene from gladiator

 love acting chop monologues like this this scene alone made the movie for me",2022-11-20 05:38:10
its kind of necessary to have someone on the spirit world to talk to shuri as well  and having a cgi chadwick is a hard no,2022-11-11 09:44:24

exactly the whole theater was shook when they kept trying to revive her and shuri’s screams woo chills,2022-11-12 12:52:24
i saw it as more of a “do we really want to take one of our best weapons off the table right now” and not so much a “lol the queen is overreacting” thing  i agree with the decision but it broke my heart to see okoye surrender her spear  she has so much pride in being the leader of the dora and it must’ve been doubly painful for her to lose ramonda afterwards  they never got to mend that fence,2022-11-11 18:10:29
"also she stayed in an empty throne room with the person that namor was hunting she didnt hide or hide riri just stayed in the throne room close to the giant  windows where her flying enemy could see them

i felt sad for shuri for losing so many people but her mom was  dumb and i think that she probably had a death wish after everything",2023-02-19 22:02:25
i was in tears literally half the film at the start and then again in the middle and then again in the end even got a warning from my watch saying my heart rate was over 120 while i wasn’t doing anything,2022-11-12 20:39:25
i got chills,2022-11-11 05:21:31
thats beautiful,2022-11-11 17:20:12
namor is roman spelled backwards ,2022-11-11 12:37:05
you think namor watched jurassic world,2022-11-12 05:42:50
you think speaking latin is a sign of culture that their society was uncultured if they didn’t speak latin,2022-11-16 09:03:45

i felt like it was missing in some areas compared to the first as well but i can’t quite place my finger on it did the movie feel all over the place was the void of chadwick boseman’s absence too big to fill,2022-11-16 05:23:11

uh namor made it pretty clear that he wanted them to get the scientist so he could  her,2022-11-11 03:19:26
"he wanted the wakandans to get the scientist and give her over for execution

he then interferes with this by trying to  the team trying to extract her back to wakanda  yes namor kept them alive  but he also informed shuri of his intentions to  the surface world

what screams “just wanted to protect his people” to you",2022-11-12 04:46:42
and yet they never told the other wakandans to use the sonic guns on their boat battle,2022-11-14 09:29:59
"i dunno i think youre thinking about them just straight up starting a conventional war against the world

theyd prob just fight like guerillas think about how much freight is transported by ocean would be almost impossible to defend all of them and they would cripple the economy

maybe they could even hijack a nuclear sub or something",2022-11-12 10:12:18
well that and they had vibranium weapons super regeneration  limits unknown and the siren attack,2022-11-12 06:36:28
ross in wakanda sounds like a fun idea for a sitcom honestly,2022-11-12 07:13:42

martin freeman is one of the few white characters in the film",2022-11-13 14:50:02
its a joke dating back to black panther 1 but its still fitting,2022-11-12 02:22:49
she was essential to the plot without her namor wouldn’t have had any need to protect his people,2022-11-12 04:41:56
but she didnt do anything wrongother than the tacky hair dye,2022-11-13 14:23:21
i see your point   this far into the mcu i see it more as a television show in film format  with every conclusion i look forward to seeing clues to what comes next  got to enjoy it while it last because i doubt it will be duplicated again,2022-11-12 15:12:35
get some mexican artists and writers to work on it and you’ve got something cooking,2022-11-12 07:01:28

youre thinking of the target ad",2022-11-11 05:03:30

isn’t she like 13 in the comics  i think they want all the kids to be around 1820 for the young avengers thing,2022-11-12 03:19:43
thats what i meant in my last comment,2022-11-11 19:00:50
"oddly enough i thought the toy version of the armor looked better than the inmovie one the design is accurate so i cant place my finger on what it is that made it stick out but the inmovie one just looked i dunno too smooth or untextured maybe almost like it was plastic rather than armor reminded me of some of the later transformers just felt noticeably cgi in motion compared to everything else going on

which side note why does it feel like black panther is always getting the short end of the vfx stick while most of the movie looked great there were still plenty of shots that were extremely obvious which reminded me of the infamous bp vs killmonger fight the shots of shuri in the cockpit piloting the aircrafts like the dragon flyers were such obvious green screen shots that it looked goofy as  whenever they went back to that angle same with some shots of the capital and action sequences that looked choppy felt like when my computer skips frames during an intense part of a game",2022-11-11 16:05:59
,2022-11-12 02:07:43
tbh i think nakia killed civilians so they wouldn’t have been as trained,2022-11-12 15:16:04
i felt the same about the chemistry between shuri and namor but to be honest i think every woman in the theater was feeling a certain kind of way when he popped out of the water,2022-11-14 15:49:46
he just flirts with them and flies,2022-11-13 01:55:02

this is not a good bar to call cgi as “great” the cgi was decent mostly and very weird in some parts it is all especially noticeable when they play the avatar 2 trailer in glorious imax right in front of the film",2022-11-11 21:51:27

its nowhere near as bad as people say it is people act like its a 310 movie when its really a 6 or 710 movie,2022-11-11 21:26:37
aquaman is twice as good as pretty much any marvel flick it’s colorful the vfx are polished the set pieces are are varied and well staged and the world building is really distinct these are always the weak points in marvel movies and wan did a great job with them the rest of it is pretty much riffing marvel in tone so overall you dislike mcu i could understand disliking aquaman but i’m highly suspicious of mcu fans who don’t love aquaman it’s the same formula just better directed,2022-11-12 05:45:14
yeah its pretty bad maybe a 6 or 7 at best but it probably just looks good in comparison to all the other garbage dc has released besides like 3 films lol,2022-11-11 20:25:22
i get that but i feel those are two deaths tchalla and ramonda are completely different her anger towards tchallas death is more towards herself for not being able to solve the synthetic plant in time to cure her brother but her mother was literally murdered by another dude so that is just vengeance with all that said i think it is still in line with the core theme of the film which imo wasnt executed well  that if grief is left unaddressed then it leads to hate,2022-11-13 06:30:54
didnt she talk about wanting to burn the world in the first 20 minutes of the movie,2022-11-11 14:31:14

sure but that was then this is now shuri and queen ramonda arent about to  riri or order her death,2022-11-11 20:39:25
but this is killmonger still being wrong with his view of the world he said t’chaka would have killed the girl but i do not think he would have he killed his brother because his brother trying to fight back before that he was going to willingly take him back to wakanda wakanda was isolationist but it wasn’t shown to be murderous out of spite killmonger is not a reliable narrator because his hatred and corruption by nonwakandan society warped how he viewed the world hence become a conqueror and oppressor himself as a solution to what he saw as injustice in the world,2022-11-11 22:34:02
"for real either integrate americathe cia as an actual third party in the conflict or cut them entirely

"tbh riri had zero effect on the story as well unless you know who she is

the story that coogler seemed interested in telling was shuri  wakanda namor

those were the foundations of the whole storyline riri ross and valentina were purely setup for future shows or movies and took away from the main storyline about grief and either accepting it and trying to do better or taking revenge  and every time it cut away it diminished the overall plot in favor of future projects",2022-11-11 07:39:30
yes they did thats why it was so hilarious lmaoo yoruba demon in full is the insultjoke in nigeria im not sure of demon alone in other parts of africa,2022-11-12 04:31:11
good points the design itself was fine but it just looked  to me  just cheap plastic it didnt have the visual weight of other suits of that makes sense ,2022-11-11 14:53:15
yeah reminded me a lot of ultraman  if i was 19 and could make a suit i’d probably make something like that,2022-11-11 09:24:42
totally forgot about that announcement thanks,2022-11-11 13:40:31
"riri basically just built a metal rig with a laser gun and then the worlds most advanced country stepped in you know its just a metal suit right

i just dont buy that this somehow makes iron man less special he himself said it would be a matter of time before people started building their own

the idea that no superhero who wears a suit of armour should exist because iron man is so weird",2022-11-11 19:49:21
"this is such a weird complaint these suit aren’t supposed to really be that special in the comics they’re a dime a dozen tony just built the best ones and is the most iconic

there are probably at least a hundred characters with powersuits in marvel and about half of them are using star tech or emulating it bout time the mcu started getting into it because it’s a kind of weird to expect no one else with advanced tech to be able to build a working power suit in that universe",2022-11-27 05:45:54

hey shut up so now shuris the black panther and she has a suit and everything but we also find out that shes been making a suit for okoye too and shes now called the midnight angel

oh wow why is she called that

unclear  and also riri williams has her own iron man suit too

oh was it designed by tony stark before he died

nope she just builds another iron man suit all by herself because thats a thing that mit students can do but hers is different because it has a heart on it

oh why does it have a heart on it

well because see we kind of already decided to give her character her own disney tv series called ironheart

wow wow wow wow",2022-11-14 22:06:57
"	but idk shuri just didn’t seem like the right pick for bp storywise either

i understand not liking the actress because of her personal views but this is nonsense

people say okoye and nakia should’ve been bp because they proved to kick  in the first movie but i feel like people aren’t really remembering the movie well shuri was right there in the fight just like them the whole time in fact okoye stays back and doesn’t join them in the first after killmonger becomes king ramonda asks nakia to take the herb in the first she flat out refuses saying she’s a spy and won’t okoye wouldn’t either given what happened in this one as well as bp1 shuri was there for every battle  unlike nakia  including the endgame battle 

shuri was absolutely right story wise because she became bp the same reason and way t’challa did in civil war  for vengeance 

anyone who says shuri shouldn’t have been bp is just letting their personal views of the actress come through and while i get it it’s disingenuous to say it doesn’t make sense and i also hope the same energy is kept for evangeline lilly when quantumania comes out on february",2022-11-11 04:57:49
me too would have loved to see her as bp,2022-11-13 05:51:45
that was a very powerful scene especially with the lack of sound i wish they hadnt used it in the trailers because it would have been more impactful if i hadnt seen it before,2022-11-11 17:40:27
just because you dont like shuri doesnt make it the wrong choice for the story,2022-11-11 16:08:32
even everett would have been a better black panther than shuri,2022-11-11 14:54:07
to each his own but putting my bias against the actress aside she wasnt able to pull off the charismatic leaderwarrior of a country role,2022-11-11 19:16:10
i’m talking about riri her giving riri to namor is essentially killing her even if she doesn’t make the killing blow,2022-11-11 04:17:57
they protected her because it wasn’t right for her to die she didn’t build that machine with the intent of what it is used for she built it as a school project,2022-11-11 03:20:21
you seem hung up on the “one girl over a nation” thing so let’s look at it from a different angle m’baku has the right idea when he objects to helping namor his reasoning is that he may promise it’s just this one thing that him and his people want but they know nothing about his people and they could really want more and more and more from them it’s the natural reaction of leaders from a country who have continually had to deal with imperialists on the world’s stage you assume any country asking you to do something has an ulterior motive,2022-11-11 15:36:56
yeah it was bad and cringey,2022-11-13 22:47:55
"thor 4 was boring to me in that it seemed like they couldn’t go more than two minutes without a dumb joke that got old fast and made me hate the film after my first viewing

as a raimi fan i agree multiverse of madness has great moments of cinematography but the story and writing were so weak to me stephen and wanda deserved better,2022-11-11 17:13:01

"i never said the herb shouldnt have been giving to tchalla i dont understand where you think i said that but i never did and shouldnt be part of this conversation 

my problem is that fact that no one thought to take a hide some herb for later after killmonger said burn it period it makes no sense that it didnt happen

it wasnt nakias job to do that she isnt the one that tended the herb it was the job of the people who tended the herb to make sure to hide some",2022-11-17 16:11:25
nah still cold i teach at a all black school the hurt was palatable whats not rationale to you is perfectly rational to others who got to see themselves represented on the big screen for the first time,2022-11-11 13:02:07
i thought she was necessary to fill in a sibling role that shuri needed,2022-11-11 08:40:06
idk what isense is but yeah there were several nighttime or underwater scenes that looked super dark it could have been the projector but i’ve seen a lot of movies in this specific auditorium and that hasn’t been an issue in the past the outdoor daytime scenes were as bright as i’d expected them to be,2022-11-11 08:20:22
"more projects every year means more setup each project has to do which leads to not every setup getting the same level of attention because these things are probably added way later into the script

this movie sets up the ironheart show  thunderbolts  midnight angels  secret invasionmartin freeman is in it its obvious when youre pumping out moviesshows like clockwork with a year or less for preproduction in some cases youre probably not going to have an exact idea of what the story of a movie 3 years away is gonna be the best you can do is include some characters or mcguffins so people dont forget they exist",2022-11-11 20:14:52
its 10 minutes my guy i literally timed it on my 2nd viewing and it wasnt even that much its not changing that much,2022-11-13 19:59:30
i timed it in the theatre the 2nd time and it was around 8 minutes and some change it also wasnt irrelevant the cia and ross gave wakanda their leads for finding riri this whole sub is grasping at straws,2022-11-14 20:17:54
"i agree with that i just disagree with

a lot of it was wasted time though

most of the movie was pretty lean except the ross stuff",2022-11-11 17:45:22
im tired of panthering to minorities,2022-11-12 09:52:37
yeah even as someone who is tired of the about to  them until the last second trope the alternative being killing the mcu namor in his first live action appearance would have been the biggest waste of a character in the entire history of the mcu,2022-11-11 07:54:32

you can tell they dont watch,2022-11-11 23:59:09
i dont really see what your point is the reactions to black panther were barely any different also that has a lot to do with it as this movie isnt really made for white people and you have to be pretty out of touch to not recognize that,2022-11-11 15:30:32
exactly i just saw the movie and he explicitly says that brown people are exploited for their resources not sure how op missed that point obvious parallels to real world africa and central and south america,2022-11-11 15:23:47
"this honestly is the whole point of the movie 

the ironic wrinkle that two minority nations  are both isolationist because they’re experiences in capitalistwhite world have led them to not trust anybody including each other 

but both countries worlds have survived only due to their ability to trust each other and protect themselves and the ultimate fight scene shows the phyrric victory both sides would have if they didn’t understand that trusting each other going forward was the only way to ensure their survival 

how people are kissing this is honestly interesting this doesn’t feel like a typical marvel movie because it’s not supposed to be focused on the fighting  but why both words feel they need to fight in the first place and the toll it has taken on both worlds to continually fight and isolate themselves",2022-11-12 01:34:40
good call,2022-11-11 23:38:34
hes kind of missing out a large part though she did have an accident which delayed things for a week or 2 the main reason there was months of delays was due to her being anti vaxx preventing her from travelling to be on set nearly or maybe even did cost a lot of people their jobs due to it,2022-11-11 21:10:51
they offered the herb to m’baku before they found out t’challa was still alive,2022-11-12 13:13:56
thats what im saying he had one solo movie and a handful of scenes in other mcu movies tchalla as a character is important to marvel and the mcu overall the character didnt need to die,2022-11-11 18:34:14
"one would assume a man of his position would be in the know especially when he saw half his people turn to dust no way he didnt come up to the surface to see what happened both then and once everyone got brought back

if a tyrant wanting to  a child cannot convince you of their villany what can,2022-11-11 04:15:06
that’s fair though i’d imagine they would have quite a few allies in a conflict with wakanda based on the un scene in the beginning,2022-11-15 20:58:05
thats fair im glad you liked it ,2022-11-11 23:01:31
you’re right that killing the scientist doesn’t actually accomplish much which is a problem in and of itself because that was supposed to be his big plan,2022-11-13 19:21:32
"why would he give up on that plan the vibranium detector is what led them to him in the first place killing the scientist wouldnt stop them from ever making a new machine but it would drastically delay the process this was just a move to buy more time

his own selfexplained backstory included him violently encountering the outside world almost half a millennia prior and is used to inform his desire to conquer the world why does he suddenly need more time

he tasked wakanda to get the scientist and then during that task he sent his own people to attack them on the bridge in full sight of the authorities risking exposure despite his desire to be kept secret if not for shuri using her tech to speak with them and their decision to return her to their city as a result she and okoye would have been killed and he would have immediately triggered war with wakanda

if his intentions from the get go were to have wakanda join him in his efforts and time spent to convince them mattered more than the urgency of resolving the threat of the scientist why did he attack them on the bridge why wasnt the scientist killed before there was even the opportunity to learn that it was princess shuri why upon learning that he had the princess did he subsequently threaten the queen why did he only  the queen and not the scientist as well how was attacking wakandas capital and killing multitudes of its people including the queen serving his goal

the script puts forward that he meant for wakanda to keep silent on their knowledge of him for threat of conflict and he attacked their people retrieving the scientist in order to ensure they had her and otherwise  those with knowledge about the plan and the existence of him and his people

theres a disharmony between the goals and actions of namor between the first and second halves of the film

eventually he knows he has to go to war with the surface but he wants to buy as much time as he can and make an ally to help his cause

its not presented that he has to go to war with the surface world but that he wants to and has wanted to since he encountered and killed surface dwellers as a child half a millennia prior to the events of the film

he tells shuri multiple times that he wants wakandas help with the war and ultimately i think his plan hinges on that partnership

but then why would he immediately make an enemy of them   


it also sets up a future plotline for namor where he tries to find other partners instead of wakanda probably dr doom and latveria if they choose to go that route

we can only judge on what we have right now not the possibility of the future and i am judging what i consider to be flaws in the story of this film",2022-11-13 08:05:02
"yeah true it didn’t make sense either

i guess it’s more like he just assumed all humans are bad whereas wakanda’s reason to withhold vibranium makes some sense us russia andor china wouldwill do evil things with vibranium",2022-11-19 20:27:25
yes actually,2022-11-11 04:06:18
what no it’s relevant to your comment you  lol just because a movie gets seen a lot doesn’t mean it’s a well reviewed movie that’s why no marvel film ever wins any oscar’s black panther 2 is just marvel so of course a lot of kids will see it lol you bozo,2022-11-11 04:32:42
don’t read comic books and know nothing about the character lol only that he’s a cool mutant,2022-11-11 04:19:22

"as a black man theres a difference between saying black men characters were one dimensional and saying they were deliberately crafted to create a negative image of black men worldwide id also say those people i responded to if they are black should feel ashamed of themselves for seeing such positive portrayals of black women on screen and twisting it into that  narrative

also in the first movie tchallas closest allies were black women what exactly is the issue of focusing on those very women and their mourning in this sequel",2022-11-13 20:15:24

"yeah judging by my downvotes i see some people disagree with that just my personal view

except they were never discovered a possible vibranium rock was discovered and the founders were killed and everyone assumed it was the wakandans shuri literally tells namor that shell keep them a secret at the end lol,2023-11-14 03:37:06
i disagree killmonger wanted power for sure but only because he believed thats what would help his people more he recognized the how imbalanced that has been for all of history with white people dominating black people and wanted to redistribute that power he might have been blinded by his own thirst for revenge but he still genuinely believed it was the best move for wakanda,2022-11-15 16:25:45
bruh he started the war,2022-11-13 16:32:14
but then people spot them they goofed on the cambridge boston bridge either way,2022-11-15 04:26:17

the pressure would probably collapse your lungs so you would suffocate even for creatures adapted to extreme water pressure maybe thats why she didnt look injured but she stopped breathing,2022-11-18 06:22:01

they didnt say a single thing about her race the comment was specifically about her demeanor and dialogue quit projecting your nonsense where it doesnt belong,2022-12-04 16:04:27
we were talking abt black panther 2,2022-11-29 09:52:14
well i just rewatched itand he just tells them to find her and bring her to him so he can prevent a machine from being built again i would say your assertion is conjecture,2022-12-03 04:47:04
the fact that he learned to speak english tells you he has spent time out of talokan,2022-11-29 00:49:35
"why would he think that a machine built by an organization would have recorded work because he would possess common sense 

i mean if ur point is just that namor understands absolutely nothing about humans even basic psychologythenok buti dont really get that impression and itd still be a poorly written character",2022-11-28 04:28:39
so like 500 years of people made that whole city,2023-02-03 15:05:22

shuri loses her brother and mother over the course of the film having her think back to a peaceful moment she has with both of them not to mention the fact that the shot was the last time the 3 filmed together was indeed a huge missed opportunity,2022-11-28 00:16:18

the us and the west in general werent painted in a great light in this movie but beside the french raid on wakanda property it seemed fairly grounded to me could have been much worse of course the us would want access to vibranium would pressure wakanda to share tech and would suspect wakanda for the science team attack",2022-11-27 16:22:10

sorry for late reply just watched it today after it went up on disney but generally movie stars are made to look about 10 years younger than regular people of their age using makeup and post production anyway so if anything making them look their actual age might actually be pretty easy in comparison,2023-02-17 01:02:51

huh i thought her acting was the weakest point of the film different strokes i suppose,2022-11-19 23:00:38
yeah but this story was about her becoming black panther if they wanted it to be someone else they wouldnt have written this story,2023-02-06 20:14:29

"gsp is beefed up but even he could only play a villain because he wasnt quite beefed up enough

im curious as to how you know this specifically i would have assumed hes playing a villain because hes not a professional actor he can do a role where he talks little and had to be athletic ic but not carry anything more than that also keep in mind that was an older gsp not close to his physical prime 

even those you mentioned which are quite the outliars imho also gsp is short are still not as juiced up as both mcu chrisses in their prime

arent the chrisses outliers as well go through the rest of the male avengers rq rdj benedict cumberbatch paul rudd don cheedle have nowhere near body builder bodies then theres guys like chadwick and christ pratt who while being wellbuilt give no indication of some superhumanbodybuilder physique i guess next closest to that would be david bautista but hes a former pro wrestler and you know how they love to roid i think all the guys with the bets physiques fit their characters captain america is canonically supposed to be on the sauce regardless of what they call it thor is a powerful  and drax is supposed to be one of the more powerful characters he just got nerfed in the movies",2022-11-19 17:02:24

imma bet there’s like an 80 chance he’s going to be somewhere in fantastic four i thought the reason they didn’t attempt any romantic storyline with namor and shuri princess marrying prince to join their kingdoms is because they’re saving it for namor falling in love with sue storm,2022-11-14 15:03:19
it’s hard to make an underwater city feel livedin but i do think they could’ve done a better job,2022-11-12 22:03:50
i agree they said his village was almost wiped out by conquers’ smallpox but it would’ve been more emotional to show a mass grave or something,2022-11-13 06:54:52
my friends are filipino and weve been calling it wala na forever ugh cant believe ive type walanda,2022-11-19 06:15:39
honestly feels like the whole cia subplot was there for this purpose to set up namor being right about the unusa coming after wakanda  them needing his help,2022-11-14 06:03:49
"	pieced together

“aquaman doesn’t want to be dry”

sure but that wasn’t much of a leap",2023-02-05 07:25:23
would have been a way better plot direction,2022-11-17 14:44:44
agreed an avoidable war that could have been solved with simple diplomacy,2023-02-13 06:42:04
"because the two instances are not the same and wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt that you weren’t talking about this movie one person killed two civilians because shuri was kidnapped and her life was in danger also namor straight up threatened the queen with killing her 

namor brought an army and flooded a city killing hundreds because of his own arrogance",2022-11-16 14:05:02

most actors don’t actually care about the movie or the franchise like the fans do some actors do but for most it’s just a job and they quickly move onto the next role,2022-11-15 21:53:25
nah i disagree losing loved ones doesnt hurt less because youre well off also wakanda is literally a fantasy utopia so the wealth disparity of the royal family doesnt line up with reality no wakandan would hear her speech and think well my queen maybe try living in a windowless hut and then youll know real suffering,2023-05-10 17:50:14
thats no different from gamora herself tbf,2022-11-13 11:00:02
the running theme in the mcu seems to be that the avengers are so happy these people arent actively trying to commit genocide across the galaxy anymore that theyll forgive any level of previous genocide across the galaxy,2022-11-14 12:36:22
aw man i didn’t notice that lol,2022-11-14 06:29:23
he didnt verify that she was dead he just went to shuri and told her she was the new queen ramonda might have survived if she didnt try to save riri,2022-11-15 23:35:06
"shuri isnt really that smart outside  her lab

you would think she would have a way with words",2022-11-17 08:36:20
"i’m not speaking specifically on the genocide portion only as you seem to be fixated on in terms of this film specifically they established that the only focus for namor was his people protection and anonymity by any means necessary the search for vibranium in addition to him viewing the atrocities done by the surface world caused his extremist beliefs that the only way to completely protect his people was to destroy anyone else is that right obviously not however it is explained well and has some nuance to it vs him being a mustache twirling villain who wants to  everyone for no good reason in terms of riri again he’s a character who’s been alive for certuries who sees this one child who has the ability to expose notatlantis and his people after centuries of anonymity of course with his mind set he’d rather off her than take any chances they are exposed again is that right no but the explain why throughout the film

in the comics there are plenty of moments where namor is an  and only gives a  about his people but still is right almost the entirety of secret wars 2016 is namor doing what needed to be done to ensure the survival of 616 during the incursions when the heroes within the illuminati could not in regards to the  thing i’m assuming your referencing his obsession and fixation with sue storm which has always been an odd point in the comics but done better in more recent times",2022-11-11 06:45:19
whos  off its  comedy dude just take a look at your comment history,2022-11-11 20:17:43
by namor,2022-11-11 16:24:01
his point was perfectly reasonable even though his solution was excessive,2022-11-11 18:00:37
"what i meant was that the predator itself as weirdly black features

why does it have dreadlocks",2022-11-12 22:50:55
i can imagine being impaled makes you want some fresh air though,2022-11-12 02:02:58
its possible they interrogated the woman in the deep sea suit they stole we never saw them  her on screen,2022-11-20 06:17:09
isnt it possible that namor doesnt know that and goes ahead with his plan to  her to keep his people that much more safe also its kinda like  her because she made this to help the cia but also  her because she made it and its existence threatens our race,2022-11-21 14:55:22
they must have interrogated the women in the copter since thats how he got to know that riri made it,2022-11-21 15:24:35
i liked how they didnt have a cgi chadwick not even to show his dead body then how they managed to respectfully still show him by doing it as a mural in the city,2022-11-17 01:17:19
got a mask put on her to go deep dive into civilization,2022-11-13 05:50:38
to be fair hes lived his entire life knowing his country is the most powerful military force on the planet thats a difficult thing to not take for granted without proof,2022-11-12 20:59:16
true but his original point of not just doing whatever namor wanted was totally on point given that namor went from “just give us this one scientist” to “either ally with us in a world war or we’ll   all of you” at the first opportunity,2022-11-21 22:14:58
he does though he made that joke about feeding ross to his children,2022-11-11 11:50:26
"gorillas

i don’t know why you’re spelling it so weird also cuba doesn’t have gorillas africa does though",2022-11-11 15:10:46
yeah it looked like it was a prophecy that he had been reading before she walked in to talk to him almost like he was verifying that everything went to plan but all that stuck out was a black panther and they looked to be screaming or at least was barring their teeth and there wasn’t something next to it i wanna say 2 other beings next to it might have to go see it again just got rust scene lmaoo,2022-11-11 13:28:28
i know this is 25 days late but i just saw the movie and you haven’t gotten a reply so figured i’d give one she was his second in command i think along with the other guy who okoye had the big fight with at the end she and that guy were the two who were closest to namor when he declared war and they were leading the fight on the bridge after shuri and okoye met riri,2022-12-17 08:03:03
silverback could be a less controversial name i suppose although i guess there will always be controversy with a black man being an ape inspired hero,2022-11-14 18:05:14
its interesting that they felt that name would be offensive but then went on with his tribe making those monkey calls all the time i thought they were hilarious but also felt like i was being offensive just by laughing at them i wish there was a way to fully separate it from the context because the gorilla tribe is cool as  but i am not sure it is fully possible,2022-11-25 21:21:28
i would say innocentnot sad,2022-11-11 16:46:58

"i wonder if norsegreek mythology exists in marvel because clearly this guy is thor he comes from a place called asgard son of odin controls lightning and there are a few planet saving superheroes who can vouch for that or if everyone thinks its just a coincidence

i guess its more of a yeah hes a  for sure but hes not the  mentality",2022-11-14 04:20:34
i get it and they wouldnt be wrong if it follows the mcu comics because theres a being that is pretty much  named the one above all but in our world people are so desperate for a sign from  that they find him on toast or cloud formations so youd think theyd jump ship when an actual  does come down  im not religious but dont people like captain america believe only in one  and not multiple ones like in other religions  i see more realistically that civilians would label thor and loki as aliens more than gods,2022-11-19 06:24:38
his dad also narrates the opening of the first black panther movie so he very obviously knows of the mythology,2022-11-19 06:15:52
 got em,2022-11-11 16:25:07
the scene with all the gods just… all of it it didn’t take the concept of the divine seriously they made up a dumpling  that looks like an ad for crying out loud in fact everything that has to do with gods in that movie is about them being a joke,2022-11-12 07:59:37
but even though they do not have the fruit they know it exists theyve been fighting black panthers for multiple generations and are fully aware of the powers they are going up against,2022-11-25 21:22:49
"i honestly thought that was where the movie was going

between that and the super suits i thought the point was to syndrome that  and make everyone superhuman",2022-11-12 20:52:02
huh didnt notice that shame we didnt really get to see him use it much,2022-11-14 10:39:09
yeah they took some ls against namor and his people but theyve shown to be great warriors before,2022-11-15 05:11:04
i laughed,2022-11-13 04:17:30
"aquaman explained their eyes adapted to the dark and showed atlantis through their eyes like literal deep sea creatures then boosted with the high presence of bioluminescent organisms throughout or magma it was literally one of the first things the movie established so atlantis is likely darker to regular humans than you’re thinking 

the argument of realism seems ridiculous in the presence of something like vibranium being so common in talokan the same material that caused wakanda to be as advance as it is…",2022-11-15 20:49:39
"idk where you got the idea that it was an underwater atlantis that looked more to me like ancient greece but underwater and murky yet somehow a pristine kings court hall and modern creature comforts and technology 

it was definitely vibrant though but that was more on the fashion than the environment",2022-11-13 08:01:07
i did prefer the aquaman lighting lol,2022-11-11 18:54:35
talokan is 400 to 500 years wasnt their start during the spanish invasion,2022-11-19 17:40:41

when the government attempts to install oversight of the avengers through the sokovia accords steve is against it citing the earlier infiltration of shield by hydra as proof that they needed autonomy in their actions rather than just blindly following government directives the rift between tony and steve that it causes leads to steve abandoning the shield and becoming a fugitive nomad from the us government in wakanda he doesnt return as captain america until infinity war still being considered a fugitive",2022-11-16 15:33:02

"i was honestly really disappointed that wakanda gets to be this massively technologically advanced society but talokan is basically just oooo look i made a pretty sun replacement and thats literally the only thing that seems to have changed for them in 500 years 

it just felt like they put so much effort into making wakanda this really cool place with a huge amount of african influence of all kinds and talokan was basically i looked at a picture book about the mayans and put that underwater it could be just me but it felt really uncomfortable that they can have a highly advanced african nation but the mayan one hasnt changed at all since they isolated themselves",2022-11-28 07:10:05

rivers plus wakanda has a tendency to move around on maps as does latveria but its usually placed along the shores of lake turkana id have to rewatch but im pretty sure either civil war or bp1 had a news report placing it in the traditional spot,2022-11-17 06:18:26

i managed to see it at its sundance premiere a few years ago duke really does a marvelous job and yeah the supporting cast is great too,2022-11-14 04:06:17
well little tchalla is 6 now and part of his parents wishes was not to burden him with the throne from the start by the time he is ready mbaku would have had a long reign anyway the real issue would be if he also has kids tho it could be an interesting way to get black panther vs man ape as enemies closer to the comics,2022-11-11 13:45:59
that conflict is expected and structured not a big issue,2022-11-13 00:22:48
i imagine it was a long quiet march back into the mountains,2022-11-14 18:19:46
theyre quoting dbz abridged,2022-12-01 11:00:31
they announced a wakanda series didnt they,2022-11-14 01:20:03
that is true but one thing i admired about the first black panther was how neatly everything  came together in the third act it wasnt really a problem that it didnt happen here just a slight let down since the first movie did it so well,2022-11-15 14:08:48
tbf the end credits do say that bp will return,2022-11-12 00:32:01
thats not your original theory,2022-11-12 06:46:43
i meant the beads would’ve alerted the wakandan somehow that a device was placed on them or once turned on like ross did do at least once would’ve alerted the user of a foreign object still since it didn’t happen i guess whatever bug was used just worked or she bugged ross’s phone,2022-11-15 08:34:19
i’m sure someone said “i’m sick of elaine being pushed to the end credits give her a scene dammit”,2022-11-13 06:32:00
i think the problem is that this was a soft reboot for black panther and they had to also advance the story liked the movie but hope that 3 can now be more focused,2022-11-11 15:11:59
 why can’t white people ever catch a break,2022-11-12 17:11:21
holy smokes we found the redditor with enormous victim complex,2022-11-12 01:47:36
i think if they’d have been more involved then shuri’s decision not to  namor loses a lot of its weight her morality hinges on her making the decision despite the legitimacy of his fears,2022-11-11 08:00:57
she’s the cia director though idk why everyone is caught up in these comparisons,2022-11-20 13:08:37
"then they had that supporting character form the thor movies darcy who was awkwardly inserted into the story she didnt even get an end scene just a quick mention from someone else that she doesnt do goodbyes 

that wouldnt be because she was included at the last minute and you didnt shoot any extra footage would it guys",2022-11-12 06:52:29
yeah the point was mbaku was right,2022-11-11 23:32:43
she was fine as  but she also an incredible actress and much more believable as a super  my eyes not to mention she has no problematic takes as far as we know,2022-11-11 16:58:16
for real i was crushing so   nakia every time she showed up she looked  good in the new green river tribe outfit too,2022-11-11 15:36:55
yes and also they opened up remember the avengers flew there and whats her name made the joke about eating to host the olympics or a starbucks,2022-12-08 12:29:39
"all the people we know were on that boat lol
  
its supremely dumb for mbaku to be there no matter how good of a warrior he is if he dies then all of wakanda is on his land without a leader itd be chaos",2022-11-14 21:37:29
he told them to go to namora who was the female warrior,2022-11-11 16:35:02

everybody forgot about falcon that suit in civil war and after is all stark tech,2022-11-14 09:25:00
well yeah it’s tony stark not natasha romanoff or clint barton we can also assume that being more maneuverable is the reason why they don’t just ditch the wings and stick sam in a suit as soon as he joins the avengers,2022-11-11 19:57:42
no their suits i felt were more like a variation of the panther suit iron heart felt more like tonys suit,2022-11-11 20:30:54
honestly i dont care about spoilers that much endgame was spoiled the last starwars was spoiled same with some games i played none of that kept me from enjoying the movie or game,2022-11-14 08:22:08
"this was 3 years ago on social media lol…again i ask how long people expect to mock someone for views they 1 may not even have anymore 2 didn’t hurt or harm anyone she didn’t get anyone sick on set we don’t know her health status even when she did tweet those things it’s literally a pointless and illogical discussion at this point

i don’t know it’s just really weird how everyone feels privy to folks every thought and action these days…again her employers didn’t have any issues with her and she’s had the full backing of the people that i assume truly matter to her your mocking her literally didn’t and doesn’t do anything so why continue to do so the world and a lot of people in it are so so weird now ",2022-11-15 18:44:41
yeah cosmic irony is if she was helping people with masks in the movie like fatecosmos made her play a role opposite to what she believes but since both irl and in the movie shes fighting maskwearers theres no real irony here,2022-11-12 00:05:17

why would  worried though his civilization is clearly as advanced as wakanda which is miles away from any other country they had no trouble taking down the first ship a whole navy would be a hassle but they could probably take them out relatively easy,2022-11-12 04:32:27

and then saying i know how we should fix this i will take their powers and turn myself into the red hulk and everything will be cool,2022-11-14 20:39:50
but isn’t that why we enjoy the mcu for it’s intersecting plot lines that make it feel like a lived in universe dc has been great at dropping one off project and even though the new ss was set in the now dead dceu it felt like it was separate the inclusion of robbie’s harley didn’t make it feel like part of that rubbish so i agree but i also like the inclusion of these off paced little tid bits of character development,2022-12-19 02:09:40
"i thinkhope the hydra storylines are done but yeah you nailed it

her inclusion in the film was important because it shows that ramonda and namor are right to distrust other countries without the little cia subplot the film only tells us and doesnt show us how corrupt other nations are",2022-11-12 22:10:42
shes director of the cia in a world filled with powerful technologies and superheroes she wants to advance americas interests by acquiring control over valuable assets like every other government agent character ever i feel like it’s not too hard to understand,2022-11-12 06:11:11
personally that was my “problem” with it my head instantly jumped to “oh they killed her off so they could talk in the spirit world that feels… distasteful” but it seemed like the movie tried to defy that  but it still feels distasteful that like our minds would go there and the answer to that is just “haha so you thought”,2022-11-11 16:09:56
hes in a very happy and committed relationship with bucky  jk,2022-11-12 02:41:07
"do we really want to take one of our best weapons off the table right now” 

they were on defcon 1 from the cia and namor their princess was taken and the only bargaining chip they had was lost their defenses   and thats when she decided to fire her most loyal general the general who has been training their army since forever and a day

also the queen acted like okoye just gave her up shuri didnt listen to her and shuri demanded to be taken to namor okoye fought off three of them mortally wounding them and she fought off their leader as if that wasnt enough the  government was also after them the queen was wrong for firing her because she did everything that she could and nearly died for it what did she expect from okoye sure she convinced her to allow her to take shuri with her but she could have given them guards too

also why did they let the outside world know that the black panther died they have been hidden for so long and this is the moment that they decide to tell the world that theyre defenseless also shuri said that namor had vabranium all over him you know the thing that they have studied for so long the thing they weaponized the only thing that they have mastered and are known for still they had no way of tracking himthe vabranium on him 

finally they took that little girl who built the machine to their advanced lab showed her their country and customs the same girl thats being chased by the government that tried to invade them they claim to have taken care of it but how will they know if the cia just abducts her in a month or two alot of dumb decisions were made left and right nakia is the real and only mvp",2023-02-19 21:56:59
they made a bunch of really good decisions i didnt think i’d like shuri as black panther but i thought they did it just right,2022-11-15 03:31:58
the film handled his passing quite perfectly imo opening credits with the silence and then the emotional beats with music especially the end credits song with rihanna it was just an emotional movie i shouldve expected but wasnt quite prepared for,2022-11-12 21:05:00

part of the problem is that even where the cgi doesnt look bad its cause of usual tricks eg having a lot of stuff being done at night",2022-11-12 22:04:37
yeah low bar didn’t say that it was only great when compared to the other movies cgi was still great and also much better than what we’ve seen lately which made it that much more noticeable the movie looked fantastic,2022-11-11 22:06:15
and also they said nakia was gone for 7 years tchalla got blipped so thats 5 gone and the movie took place a year after his death so it didnt leave much time for him to tell his family about a son,2022-11-13 02:22:40

she blatantly did its crazy how much of this sub is like oblivious to clearly stated information and details that are in the film and then used for tying stuff together throughout,2022-11-11 16:15:52
yea discussion threads really show who pays attention,2022-11-11 16:49:49
the first third of the movie was ramonda and shuri grieving while the rest of the world took t’challas death as an opportunity to take what’s theirs no wonder shuri said that lol,2022-11-12 06:36:41
she did the issue is that shows no indications of it afterwards until her talk with killmonger a scene where she brutalizes an enemy like a talokan warrior or a ma police officer  could have made the set up less clunky maybe in the final battle while she’s gunning after namur she could’ve seen someone in need and actively chose to abandon them in pursuit of vengeance that i felt could’ve sold the burn the whole world angle better,2022-11-11 16:40:22

riri was the initial spark that caused the war with the us using her tech to mess with talokan she also served as some much needed comic relief in an otherwise dark film i personally liked her,2022-11-11 08:24:40
its produced by coogler and his company as well so hopefully that bodes well for the series,2022-11-12 06:49:13

avatar absolutely sucks is totally derivative brainless trash but the visuals are godtier,2022-11-12 21:03:35
most people agree that it wasnt a super interesting story but the whole point of it was to show off the visuals they just needed a decent story to show them off,2022-11-11 14:30:46
tbh the writing on this movie was pretty  too,2022-11-15 03:47:05

“ooh movie characters we can put in tv shows are tight”,2022-11-15 00:09:43
"yeah everything you pointed out made sense i was looking at it more from the self contained perspective of bp2 rather than the larger franchise you made good points

i just felt like the whole time it seemed like shuri was building to a bigger realization that didnt come until the last possible moment which i realize is typical storytelling and particularly typical marvel storytelling but it didnt feel like it fit with the shuri i had in my head the shuri that relied on science and reason and was imo both the levity and the grounding force in her family i just really wanted her to come out of seeing njadaka with some revelation other than i have been abandoned by my family and im super ruthless now

honestly it felt like a very male character reaction and im of two minds about it because on the one hand good that they are not writing shuri any differently than they would a male protag but on the other hand it just doesnt work for me personally it didnt work for me that she just played namors game instead of finding a more clever path

but these are just half formed ramblings overall i enjoyed the movie a lot and i thought leticias acting was great regardless of my personal feelings towards her  my more nebulous feelings about shuris arc",2022-11-11 05:21:47
my thought it is should have been nakia thematically because she is a worldly warrior and her story was linked to t’challa’s  without him elevating her to bp helps her done a new role shuri has an arc to become queen m’baku can do something anything please,2022-11-11 13:42:06
"my brother in christ how you have hit the  nail on the head

so much nonsense going on in these threads right now lol",2022-11-11 16:06:45
"i think you are missing the larger point people dont like the generically annoying marvel characters one of the best parts of bp1 is that it largely lacked these characters except for a few one of those was absolutely shuri a character actress that relies more on the formula 

i really dont care who they get to be the new bp as long as its good and i havent seen bp2 but i know that shuri was deeply annoying to me in black panther unlike basically every single other member of the cast so to pick her over all the other great charismatic characters played by big name actors its just weird it definitely has me less invested to see this one than if they had not done that",2022-11-13 15:22:01
what is right or wrong for the story is subjective though i think it was wrong for the story,2022-11-11 16:52:15
killmonger was the right choice for the story,2022-11-11 23:27:44
i don’t think she’s supposed to be a charismatic leader by the end of the film though she’s very much still a young adult grieving her entire family and just barely beginning to come to terms with everything that’s happened in the film… it’d be weird if she just suddenly did a 180 and starting acting like she’s got it all together and is ready to lead the country with the same charisma her mother or t’challa did,2022-11-12 20:27:49
"but you would agree that her acting was bad and she was extremely unlikeable thats the talking point im seeing in here frequently

the only actress being praised consistently in here of acting well in the film is basset i mean come on",2022-11-11 19:22:50
ah my bad,2022-11-11 04:20:33

yeah and it could have been 10 extra minutes for more shuri,2022-11-13 20:01:16
that’s not something that needed to be shown on screen across multiple scenes when 30 seconds of exposition would have accomplished the same goal riri herself was just a mcguffin despite pretty extensive screentime the sole purpose of all of that was clearly to set up ironheart,2022-11-14 20:46:46

im very much aware this movie isnt made for white people and have no issue with that you implied my theater was dead because it was full of white people it was quite the opposite it was dead because of the quality of the movie  black panther 1 was pretty much universally beloved aside from racist folks and who cares about their opinions anyway,2022-11-11 15:32:34
i mean its her body and her choice i dont necessarily agree with it at all but seems like the bigger issue is being hurt on set,2022-11-11 21:38:18
should’ve set this one in the 5 year snap gap,2022-11-11 18:35:37
i think the fact that the first bp was an unexpected hit that made over a billion dollars then people got upset when he was blipped then it was such a shock when he passed so recasting him would’ve been the worse option for the fans of the movies and also gave the writers an opportunity for more girl power cause literally every new hero has to be a girl that’s like super op from the start lol,2022-11-14 07:28:28
"yes that is the case the sum of its parts made it whole

interesting take id say wakanda started the war when they killed the women guarding riri and shuri shuri literally says this means there will be war after that,2022-11-16 23:36:03
no no no no wakanda created a situation where war became inevitable and talokan had become part of this conflict as much as i love wakanda they are not considerate of the ramifications of their actions that is literally their weakness and the story arc of black panther namor stepped up to be a good king to his people not to the world,2022-11-14 00:06:37

mbaku had more initiative and agency than riri had the problem is you could easily swap riri with an object and you couldnt do that with mbaku,2023-02-16 21:47:26
"not every thing has to be spelt out for you in the movie if you take the character’s behaviour through out the movie into consideration it makes sense just bc he asked the wakandans to find riri doesn’t mean he even trusted them to hand her over for killing 

it’s clear they regularly watch the surface world but choose not to interact with it they would know wakanda’s hesitation in handing over a girl to be killed 

he knew they weren’t going to call him to come  the scientist used them to find her then take from them and  her his only loyalty is keeping his people  safe  the movie should have spent more time in exploring the similarities and differences between namor’s responsibilities to his people and shuri’s wakanda wanting to embrace the rest of the world versus talokan’s isolation approach whilst protecting their respective cultures and resources 

it seems like that would’ve been the direction of movie if chadwick hasn’t died",2022-12-03 05:51:49

"i’ve seen it three times now and i think you’re right i felt like she was almost dismissing ultron entirely as something the avengers couldn’t control but she had superior ai i dunno if that makes sense

i guess my expectations were very low she begins the movie reluctant to take up her brother’s mantle and she’s very closed off emotionally she slowly realizes why it’s important and in the final scene she breaks down and cries aside from suddenly being able to fight which i agree is silly i thought she did a fine job",2022-11-28 19:09:50

"the sudden fighting skills were odd sure i just assumed that everyone in the family was a trained fighter so i didnt dwell on it

i did not notice inconsistent accents at all when did that happen i only heard an american accent from her when she was pretending to be a student at mit which was an appropriate time for it 

and overall i was impressed with her performance the pain of losing tchalla was really visible on her face although its probably not just acting",2023-02-06 20:07:44

benedict cumberbatch  hes a wizard so it would just be bizarre if he was too beefy wouldnt fit the image of a wizard he was still pretty buff though

paul rudd  beefy body with a six pack for ant man 

don cheadle  fair enough but hes a minor enough character that its not super strong evidence against the argument that they beef up their cast too much

keep in mind that thor captain america and spiderman all have significant plotrelated reasons to have athletic builds but these other guys dont

then theres guys like chadwick and christ pratt who while being wellbuilt give no indication of some superhumanbodybuilder physique

"im guatemalan so i appreciated the representation bc we are the least represented people in the marvel universe and i think they did their best to be respectful brought in historians and a language couch and actually cast latinx actors the art production and design was great i noticed them playing an ancient mayan ball game but it was clunky

why does namor have a spanish accent why did he choose a name based in the language of the colonizers he hated so much 

why are some of them blue but not others why change their skin color at all when it doesnt mean much and covers up the real people 

did they have mayan or latinx people involved in the writing it just felt like an outsider using mayan culture instead of them telling their own story 

i get that everyones just happy to be seen at all but that seems like a pretty low bar i think the reason it stands out so much is bc its in contrast to the incredible thoughtfulness of wakanda written and produced by black people 

we dont get a lot of complexity or spend time getting to know the mayan characters except namor and hes inconsistent 

theyve evolved under the water but their movements are super awkward they dont look natural ive seen scuba divers look more at ease than these people who supposedly live down there 

i didnt understand their physiology or their powers eg why do they inconsistently wear that breathing mask why could they just climb up the side of the ship like spiderman how did they successfully fight surface people when they went to burry his mother when theyd never felt surface gravity before how do they communicate in the water they still use their voices to communicate and hypnotize so do they spend a lot of time out of the water too maybe in cenotes

one of the movies first scenes literally shows how other nations are discretely trying to steal wakanda’s resources while politically trying to guilty them into doing so namor saw what happened what to wakanda after revealing themselves to the world even after wakanda helped save the us earth and the universe multiple times namor tried to preserve peace for centuries and now sees it will inevitably come to that so he decided he needs to strike first he absolutely has every reason to think the way he does is it right no but i don’t blame him for thinking that way,2022-11-11 09:14:00

aquaman had stunning visuals a great musical score and had a decent story all things considered it had consistent first second and third acts most comic book movies cant seem to pull this off wakanda forever included the fact that aquaman managed to not fall flat on its face during the third act is a triumph on its own",2022-11-11 23:29:16

i disagree with this but assuming you really don’t like that stagey feel then you would hate mcu films which are barren of any personality in their set design 

	the world building was no better or worse than anything marvel have put out

lol — nothing marvel has done in ages is as exciting as the trench sequence 

	even the worst mcu movie is still miles beyond aquaman in quality

by what measure the story and humor are in the exact same style of lightspirited adventure and the production quality is vastly better",2022-11-12 13:42:06

yeah im criticizing plenty of other  about the movie but its always wild on rmovies how people just seemingly completely miss whole sections of dialogue or not even subtle plot points and then complain something didnt make sense like  i know education sacrificing the arts whenever possible means the average persons media literacy is bad but they brought back killmonger specifically to address this inner turmoilmotivation its the reason why namor thought she would be on his side initially,2022-11-11 16:54:52

i would need to watch aquaman again to confirm but i did notice the sluggishness of the civilians here,2022-11-11 19:01:32
i think aquamans underwater humans are more fishy than the marvel ones  like the people of talokan dont have obviously webbed feet or hands which you would think theyd develop over time whereas aquamans people have water manipulation powers or theres literal fish people who have actual fish features like fins or tails,2022-11-13 05:55:52
"i get the movies dont explain this  well enough in their attempt to tackle and setup too many characters and teams and plots all at the same time like here where they rob precious screentime from wakandatalokan just so they can further setup ironheart and thunderbolts especially valentina who literally does nothing but exist to further establish that the us wants vibranium when they already had the us expedition slaughtered by namor to establish that but how you gonna come in here and call other people brain damaged for not understanding mcu lore while then  up basic info or plot points from previous movies

 thats not relevant to the point of people pretending the us doesnt deploy supers for black ops

which is an argument i didnt make i straight up acknowledged that heroes like captain america falcon and war machine do and have expressly worked for the us government specifically but the black ops mission youre talking about wasnt black ops at all black ops  any stealth operation it was literally a hostage rescue mission from pirates led by a dude on interpols most wanted list and yeah having us agent in the raid in bp2 would have been a cool extra nod to the eventual thunderbolts project but it was a french black ops mission in the movie so why would us agent be there

however shield is explicitly an extragovernmental agency created by the allies of ww2 for the protection of both the us and international community so they operate under the oversight of the world security council when agents like black widow or hawkeye are used its only at shields discretion under nick fury theyve repeatedly completely ignored missions from the us government if he didnt feel like it required them like leaving the rescue of tony stark to the army worked against them preventing the army from capturing bruce banner or disobeyed the world security council in the uss favor refusing to nuke nyc during the chitauri invasion again in the same movie youre talking about cap being a black ops agent shield was openly disavowed by the us government labeled a terrorist organization and largely wiped out as an agency when they were revealed to have been infiltrated by hydra it took until the signing of the sokovia accords to allow shield to exist again where supposed black ops agent captain america defects from america because hes against the idea of government oversight crippling their ability to do their job in an effective independent way

im agent phil coulson with the strategic homeland intervention enforcement and logistics division

 thats quite a mouthful

 i know were working on it

 you know weve been approached already by the dod the fbi the cia

 were a separate division with a more specific focus

this is why valentina as director of the cia wants people like us agent for the thunderbolts its just the cia version of the suicide squad where they want supers that are beholden only to the american government for actual black ops missions rather than the hardtocontrol supers like the avengers",2022-11-16 19:57:27

"i just flatout disagree on almost every point 

marvel gets criticised for its lack of colour but that’s a conscious choice to ground the heroes marvel has always had more grounded heroes compared to dc the fact dc makes it’s more colourful heroes more colourful does not automatically make them good it just makes them colourful the argument becomes laughable when you start factoring in guardians of the galaxy which is just as colourful as aquaman if not more so and yet noone says guardians is good because it’s colourful

marvel uses soundstages the same as anyone else but they rarely feel as obvious and cheap as those in aquaman aquaman’s soundstages were comparable in quality to red notice and…eurgh that was rough much of the time you can’t even tell marvel have shot on a sound stage

the trench sequence was beautiful…and it still put me to sleep literally black panther builds the nation of wakanda to a much deeper level than any of the nations in aquaman

both marvel and dc make superhero movies there’s only so much variation you can have in story from that genre aquaman is just as generic and formulaic as anything marvel puts out and as for humour at least the mcu can be funny aquaman was just pure cringe",2022-11-12 14:36:45

had you written the story your alternate killmonger could have been written  for me within the context of this story i think shuri is a generally unlikable character who lacks charisma and to my knowledge has shown little to no exceptional combat ability which is essential to have as black panther  several other characters could have been logical choices to be black panther while shuri sat on the throne,2022-11-12 12:48:51

there are so many characters throughout comics that were created with the intention to replace the lead i find it odd you only have an issue with the ones that are black or  were you this upset when dc introduced 4 new supermen after superman died in the 90s or were you just upset about john henry irons because he was the only one who wasnt white

the princess asked to go to namor she put herself in that position side point major plot hole here is that shuris ai did not mention to anyone that she asked to be taken but it did mention their language

nakia murdered 2 guards starting the war if that scene doesnt happen namor doesnt attack wakanda that was literally a declaration of war from wakanda

namors though process doesnt matter when wakanda  kills his own people his army then wiped the floor with wakanda

edit also racists rarely actually say anything about a persons race they have much subtler dog whistles they tend to use so your initial comment is never going of they didnt say anything about race is never really a good way to spot racism unless youre looking for old racist grannies from the 50s calling you the nword oftentimes most racist comments youll hear will be attributed to how you dress or how you talk it just so happens that coincidentally there is only one race that these comments tend to have any relevance to",2022-12-07 23:10:36

"	marvel has always had more grounded heroes compared to dc 

the dark knight trilogy renders this point moot the transition out of the grounded gritty nolan era into marvel escapism was a big point in culture marvel is not grounded the entire world is chock full of superheroes and advanced tech and gods and monsters meanwhile dc is full of grounded and gritty just compare this years the batman to any of the marvel slate in the past few years the only thing that comes close to grounded is black widow and it still ends with a physics defying set piece — which i thought was fun but the franchise is not grounded 

	the fact dc makes it’s more colourful heroes more colourful does not automatically make them good it just makes them colourful

also an absurd point the snyder era going alongside the mcu was always criticized for being too serious and dark marvel is so much lighter in comparison and it’s why aquaman was such a success — it emulates the mcu tone very well  

	the argument becomes laughable when you start factoring in guardians of the galaxy which is just as colourful as aquaman if not more so and yet noone says guardians is good because it’s colourful

first off guardians 1 is not more colorful guardians 2 absolutely but it is an exception to the mcu style it’s not even about being colorful it’s just about having good cinematography which marvel almost universally is criticized for

	the trench sequence was beautiful…and it still put me to sleep literally black panther builds the nation of wakanda to a much deeper level than any of the nations in aquaman

the world building of black panther is again an exception to the mcu style which is why that one got so much praise but even then when you think of wakanda and the rhinos or the cliff side battle the poor vfx just  the immersion even if the vision is there but often there is no vision in the mcu antman’s san francisco looks and feels the same as captain america’s washington dc the planets of captain marvel are so devoid of personality i can’t even remember their name the skrulls or whatever they’re called have the same jokey demeanor as the people on the planet in guardians 1 — again can’t remember because it lacks personality 

	both marvel and dc make superhero movies there’s only so much variation you can have in story from that genre 

sure but the homogeneity is not really the point and there’s tons and tons of variety outside the mcu — batman returns blade spiderman xmen hellboy and nolan’s batman all came before the mcu and showcase far more variety and style than the mcu 

	aquaman is just as generic and formulaic as anything marvel puts out 

my point was always that aquaman is just a well done marvel movie if you think the mcu is formulaic and generic than of course you think aquaman is 

	and as for humour at least the mcu can be funny aquaman was just pure cringe

this is subjective but i’ve cringed far harder in mcu films “what are those” references and “he’s right behind me isn’t he” to “scoobydoo this ”  the mcu humor is very cringe 

i’m not trying to convince you aquaman is good i’m just pointing out that in style and tone it is just like an mcu film except the production value is much better pretty much none of the final battles in an mcu film since avengers 1 have been on par with the big finale of aquaman including the final duel on the submarine it’s pure comic book cheese and if you’re not into that then it makes sense but for me aquaman pretty much nails everything the mcu does on its best day",2022-11-12 15:32:05

the people of talokan have no response whatsoever to aircraft guided munitions or even conventional firearms the sum total of their military strength is namor himself who is unable to engage in extended combat away from water to rehydrate himself in

namor can not personally subjugate the entire world and even if we assume conventional weapons are unable to stop him because hes like really good at flying out of the way or something there are plenty of people on earth who could defeat him from thor to hulks to wizards to random people in iron man suits",2022-11-15 02:09:43

compare that to marvel who’s heroes are much more streetlevel the most bombastic they get is with thor and eternals and even then the eternals were still depicted as relatively grounded and lacking the same level of bombast the mcu has been jokey and lighthearted to offset how much more groundlevel the action is another case in point compare the action sequences in snyder’s dc output to anything in the mcu and they’re absolutely bigger bolder and more ",2022-11-12 16:22:20

"

the jl cyborg is almost completely cgi and the other cyborg is mostly covered up

so what

a decade ago most heroes werent as big as theyre now

you realize a decade ago is well into the mcus start that encompasses many of the heroes weve already gone over add superman from mos to that too regardless i dont see any evidence to support that theyve gotten bigger either way 

going up quickly and crashing down on weight more than likely taking steroids isnt healthy

you think rdj for example getting to the level of fitness he was for the mcu has any negative health effects on him lol again im thinking youre way overestimating the average fitness of these guys these are all things achievable natty",2023-02-05 05:06:47
ok i see your point and maybe so but remember she was opposed to killmongers plan initially but then the other dude w’kabi was all like “well plans sometimes need to change” and was in favor of the plan and everyone else agreed to it also so at that point it’s not like she had much of a choice if she had tried to go against killmonger then she would have been an outcast she might have exiled or worse…killed plus when t’challa eventually came back she and the other dora milaje did turned against him and start fighting him meanwhile w’kabi and the others were still following him and tried to fight t’challa even tho he was their friend so he’s really a  person i’m not saying okoye is not to blame here at all she holds some blame in all this but think about it okoye folowed killmonger but she didn’t follow him willingly she was opposed to what he was doing whereas w’kabi and the others willingly followed him and had no problem carrying out his plan even after they found out t’challa was alive plus going back to what i said before okoye had an oath she‘s the general and therefore she is supposed to serve and protect whoever sits on the throne no matter who they are plus even if she had tried to go against him before she would have been outnumbered as t’challa had not come back yet and everyone was still loyal to killmonger and she would’ve been punished,2022-11-17 18:32:12

"huh we never saw namor’s army the troops he brought to that final battle was just a small strike team meant to fight some normal dudes like we saw them do in the beginning of the movie

they had a ton of impressive tech like the translators the masks that worked both ways the artificial sun etc there was explicit dialog in shuri’s lab marveling about how advanced their tech is did you miss that

there’s explicit dialog in the first black panther where they say they don’t want refugees because they bring their own problems even in the sequel the queen tells the un that she doesn’t trust any other nations that’s clearly indicating that humanity  outside of talocan and wakanda  is violent and untrustworthy as a side note that’s also what the val storyline established which was important to show thematically for the film

it’s not hard to see the parallels between wakanda and talocan isolationist because the rest of the world sucks namor’s strategy to remain isolated is to simply destroy the surface dwellers before they come for talocan we’ll see if the world comes for wakanda like he predicts

again i’m not saying namor’s plan in the film isn’t evil",2022-11-12 03:04:15

the reason he stole the vibranium so he can use it to develop technology to give black people a fighting chance when he reaches wakanda hes  that they had all this technology but didnt use it to free black people from the oppressors one of the reasons he killed some of them to get what he wants so just how colonizers took over the world he wants to do the same thing to them burn the world and have black people rule this is how i view it as my opinion not everyone is going to have the same opinion which is why i see both of your view points can be correct these are opinions as we each can see it from different view points",2022-11-27 17:44:42

i think hes just a bigger dude in general im not sure how youre so certain that his bulk is greater than things from like a decade ago like evans for cap or hemsworth for thor they all have detailed stories for thir regimines and we can assume great roids with that 

by a decade ago i meant a decade ago and before

so the things i referenced from a decade ago are fair game still it does seem wacky to slam together decades of super hero flicks but whatever 

spiderman got bulkier with tom being the bulkiest yet

not really unusual from the comics though 

so has batman

afflick might just be the biggest guy to play batman on screen period but i dont see how the bulk pattinson did is greater than what bale did to transform into batman bales transformation as legendary many people were saying pattinson was too scrawny lol 

so has superman

sure but again not deviating from the source material if anything supes was too scrawny ine arlier films 

heroes did not get less bulky 

i never said that im saying its about the same how big they attempt to get is largely based on what range they want for the character even then its unclear whats actually required and whats heroes discretion furthermore lots of guys with less favorable phsyqies are can just be sifted out at casting 

rdj is the one hero i didnt mention cuz he is fine

he is fine are you implying theres anything wrong with the guys youve listed previously though they all seem fine in their roles physique wise lol 

they are achievable the natural way but is easier and fast by not being natural these actors have deadlines and other  to do have access to th3 beat steroids out there it makes sense for them to take em

us leaders also saw haiti as an important military asset in 1868 president andrew johnson considered annexing the island of hispaniola consisting of haiti and the dominican republic for strategic purposes us lawmakers worried that an unstable haiti could be vulnerable to foreign intervention

between 1911 and 1915 the united states increased its involvement in the country to maintain its influence as the state department wrote in its history of us foreign policy

 “between 1911 and 1915 seven presidents were assassinated or overthrown in haiti increasing us policymakers’ fear of foreign intervention in 1914 the wilson administration sent us marines into haiti they removed 500000 from the haitian national bank in december of 1914 for safekeeping in new york thus giving the united states control of the bank”
