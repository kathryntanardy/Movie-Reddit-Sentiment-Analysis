the setup for miles to land in the spider’s universe and not his own was such a slow burn he’s finally willing to share his secret only to have his mother not be “his” mother and the comiccon callback from the first movie was a great way to hit the nail home,2023-06-02
a renaissance vulture was the most genius thing to start the movie with and in a modern art museum as well,2023-06-02
"“we are supposed to be the good guys”

did not expect miguel to be that menacing in this movie definitely got that overly crazed stick to the script unhinged vibes from him which is funny since he was the one who committed the greatest sin of all in the multiverse",2023-06-02

i love that the spot without his spots is just like a typical drawing figure used to draw characters with the lines in it,2023-06-02
i like how they kept the yeah i think its a banksy line from the first movie really cool to see insomniacs spiderman included for a second there its  insane how dark this movie feels for a pg movie once the spot became super powerful he was genuinely a scary villain very excited for the next film,2023-06-02

but the funniest part was when the audience voiced their collective shock and annoyance at the ‘to be continued’",2023-06-02
"the animation in this movie is staggeringly gorgeous

i’m finding it hard to find anything remotely comparable no joke

there are obviously tons of other shows and movies with phenomenal animation maybe even perfect animation but the combination of art direction and animation in this movie is just a tier by itself

it doesn’t feel random or just for  and giggles it serves real purpose to characters and plot and visual information i  love it

whatever praise this movie gets for animation it deserves more this is an incredible achievement it’s hard to even comprehend how they were able to not only create so many styles but seamlessly integrate them in scenes together not just drawing styles but literally how things moved vibrated looked felt it’s insane kudos to everyone who worked on this film it’s a true work of art",2023-06-02
i was hoping for way more lego spiderman during this movie i was honestly laughing so hard that they could incorporate the lego universe,2023-06-02
"i know this will be said a million times and rightfully so but holy  was this a gorgeous movie literally every frame could be a framed painting

i love how the one constant in the spiderverse is apparently jk simmons is always j jonah jameson

they did a really good job of making spot freaking spot a pretty terrifying villain in the end

the entire voice cast was excellent across the board

if beyond can keep this momentum and i see little reason why it wouldnt then this will be one of best trilogies of all time",2023-06-02
i like how gwen’s world was more water color and you could see it start to drip and bleed into other colors during the talk with her dad as her superhero and civilian identity were blending together,2023-06-02
"having a central villain being a literal plot hole threatening spiderman canon is both hilarious and genius

also just so much of the plot hinging on the idea that spiderpeople are inevitably fated to be sad and lonely unless theyre peter b and impacted by miles feels really apt considering how much discourse ive seen about how recent comics have treated peter",2023-06-02
ben reilly really stole the show with his muscle definition striking poses and tough talk,2023-06-02
i remember seeing that the spot was going to be the villain of the movie and once he got reprimanded by miles at the beginning i thought “ that just have been a smokescreen for miguel to be the real villain” but nope dude got so much scarier as the film went on and especially after the collider such a wonderfully crafted villain,2023-06-02

"one of the key aspects of this movie is how it begins with gwen and how gwen is essentially the colead in the movie

that is why even though the movie ends on a cliffhanger it feels like its own movie  the scene toward the end with gwen and her dad functioned for me like an emotional resolution within the movie

had tears in my eyes during that scene",2023-06-02

what a beautiful movie and i can’t wait for beyond the spiderverse",2023-06-02
"one of the best sequels of alltime

 cold open with gwen telling her side of the story makes this movie hers as much as miles
 spot being guy that got hit by the bagel is one of the funniest callbacks
 miles struggle is well depicted and brian tyree henry as miles father is the standout for me
 the soundtrack was pretty great but it went hard in the mumbattan sequence 
 everything in spider hq was perfect the scope the cameos both animated and live action the secret revealed the chase sequence
 one of the best plot twists ever with miles being in earth42 i never saw that coming


i didnt think it could match the first one but it did 
will easily win the best animated movie at the oscars and has a decent shot of being nominated for best picture",2023-06-02
"seeing spectacular spiderman get the recognition is deserves love to see it they actually gave josh keaton some lines and used one it’s episodes during the uncle ben segment 

miles saying he’s gonna do his own thing reminded me of final fantasy 10 and how they say “this is my story” and it’s fitting 

great movie and it they stick the landing could be of the greatest trilogies

looking forward to beyond",2023-06-02
loved the movie but can someone explain to me if miles was an anomaly how is his dad a canon level event or why did that matter that was the only thing that confused me he wasn’t allowed to join the society for that reason but then when he was there wasn’t allowed to leave,2023-06-02

did anyone elses theater have sound mixing too low for characters compared to the music other than that this movie was an absolute treat i was going to call it a slow paced movie but the pacing was entirely justified by the end,2023-06-02
i dont get why the spider society blames miles for becomming spiderman its not like he did had the spider bite him intentionally it wasnt even supposed to be in his universe in the first place why blame him for something out of his control,2023-06-02

it’s going to take me three more times to catch all the details moms snapping in puerto rican hobie casually stealing everything not nailed down this movie is a visual feast and i’m almost sad i’m not going to get the same experience with the first where i actually waited until it was streaming watched it once then watched again scene by scene catching all the tiny details until it is streaming the theatre is gonna have to take my money a few more times,2023-06-02
i have absolutely no doubt that the writers meant this movie as a criticism of spiderman comic writers if it wasn’t on purpose i would be shocked miguel’s whole deal being “spiderman must never change you have to follow the same beats” is a direct reflection of the writers who keep dragging peter back from anything different new and exciting i’m honestly super impressed that they made this the focus and i have a sliver of hope that they might actually help move spiderman along for the better,2023-06-02
"something funny i just realized about peter b parker in this movie

for those unaware one of the biggest criticisms of the spiderman comics in recent years is how marvel tries to maintain the same status quo for peter after several decades of basically telling the same stories over and over again  many fans want him to finally get married to mj and have a kid together but marvel continuously refuses instead choosing to constantly try and keep peter in the same state of being poorsingleetc that hes been in for years sometimes going to ridiculous extents to do so this video does a good job of explaining a lot of the general sentiments among the fans have

in the movie peter b parker motivated by his experiences with miles in the first movie finally gets together with mary jane and they have a daughter together however it is also explicitly stated by miguel that the events of the first movie  including miles getting bitten and meeting peter b parker  were anomalies and should have never happened

the implication of this is that all of peter b parkers character growth that pushed him to finally become a father wasnt supposed to happen so by giving birth to mayday peter b parker effectively broke the canon

im not sure if this is intentional or not but if it was then that means the movie was intentionally making fun of the spiderman comics complete refusal to let peter grow up and develop in his relationships which i think is hilarious especially if youre at all familiar with the current run of the comics",2023-06-03
the animation was next level the scene with gwen and the paint was dripping the plastic blowing when miles told his dad to let him spread his wings sooo many awe inspiring moments in a fantastic film highly highly encourage anyone to see this in imax if you can,2023-06-02
"this movie was not 2 hours and 20 minutes long 


i mean it was but considering how many people here are saying their theatre was shocked when “to be continued” popped up mine included i don’t think anyone felt the length",2023-06-02
what an absolute rug pull at the end there had no idea this was only a part 1 loved it though gonna see how it plays out for me to tell if i liked this one more than the first one,2023-06-02
calling it now peter parker of earth42 is going to help out miles in some way,2023-06-02
i mean not only was donald the inspiration for miles he also voiced miles in his first animated appearance in ultimate spiderman tv show so the fact that they literally had him as is homecoming character in the prowler outfit was great also i left right after so didn’t see the credits wasn’t feeling good think i over indulged in junk food and i wasn’t 100 sure but was that mahershala voicing earth 43 aaron also that first spider uk malala windsor seems to be a movie creation,2023-06-02

i absolutely loved it only thing is i don’t know if it was just how they had the sound at my theater or if it was the sound mixing in the movie but there were a lot of moments where the soundtrack was booming and the dialogue got lost and i couldn’t hear what they were saying like even gwen’s opening monologue i could barely hear i almost wished i had closed captioning was it like this for anyone else or was it just the speakers in my theater my husband and i might try to watch in a different theater,2023-06-02

"its perplexing how sony on one end spits out the worst superhero live action films milking the spiderman villains arsenal for all its worth and then sony pictures animation turns around and gives us 2 of the best animated movies of the last 10 years one of which being on the shortlist for best superhero movie ever made if they stick the landing next year spiderverse is something that can give nolan a challenge for the best superhero trilogy my  was this movie ever beautiful scenes in gwens house hobie ben reilly and the vulture from the beginning were the visual standouts for me hobie looked like a ransom note glued together from weathered concert posters ben looked like mark bagley drew a flip book the watercolor changing with gwen and captain stacys emotions was gorgeous 

one other thing the milesuniverse nails that i think marvel studios should take note of is tone this movie got all its quips in and funny moments while still having an unbroken moody and serious attitude the whole way through it didnt have the tonal dissonance of something like quantumania or especially thor lt with that movies bait and switch marketing",2023-06-02
that might have been the best first half of an animated movie i’ve ever seen,2023-06-02
"that was an absolute gorgeous  and i enjoyed every second of it

"that james blake song  rules 

so many incredible moments the agency of his parents specifically his mom ramping up the spot becoming legitimately terrifying spider punk stole the show in his brief lines the watercolors in gwen’s scenes 

legitimately do not think i’ve ever seen an animated movie this ambitious it goes without saying but if they stick this landing it’s the best superhero trilogy of all time 

ps maybe i’m tripping but we didn’t see 90s spiderman right i definitely saw villains from the series but not the spiderman from the 90s cartoon i hope we somehow get him 

also the fight choreography was insane",2023-06-02
"hey marvel

i think im speaking for all of us by asking you to release that upside down shot of new york with miles  gwen sitting together so we can all set it as our backgrounds

"donald glover’s return and used as a semichekov’s guntwist many people wondered if he would’ve played the live action miles in the mcu was well played by lord and miller’s writing i did not expect that miles ended up in earth 42 and miles in that universe is the prowler major micheal keaton’s vulture type reveal

"i hope that somebody calls miguel out on his fundamental misunderstanding of the canon events and their importance in beyond

imprisoning miles so he couldnt try and save his dad wouldnt have done any good  its not the event that matters its how that event reshapes spiderman

a loved one dies because you fail to save them and you learn a lesson  be that with great power comes great responsibility the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few whatever a loved one dies because someone imprisoned you so you could not save them and you become angry and vengeful

only one of those sounds like spiderman",2023-06-03

"there is so much to say about this movie but for this comment ill focus on one thing

despite this being a part 1 of 2 i didnt feel unsatisfied or cheated out of an ending and i was wondering how they pulled that off i think they did it by pulling a really clever trick with gwen namely by making her the main character

the movies central conflict between miles the spot and miguel absolutely did not conclude but the film still managed to feel complete because gwens personal conflict does conclude she reconciles with her dad reconciles with herself and her self concept as spiderwoman after losing peter and finally fully sides with miles to stand up to miguel the movie starts with her and ends with her and so it feels complete",2023-06-02

"hobie was probably my favorite character in a packed theater i don’t think anyone else caught that “it’s a metaphor for capitalism” but i could not stop laughing

that being said i love that the movie wasn’t afraid to be emotional and pull their punch with a cheap joke which is even more impressive when you realize it’s also a lord and miller movie",2023-06-02
i found it really interesting that miles points out that from his viewpoint the spidermen were the bad guys while they thought he was as an anomaly yet on the opposite side if he doesnt become spiderman he ends up becoming a villain in the prowler nice parallel plot and i am really interested to see how they spin it with the spot excellent villian btw,2023-06-02
cool twist at the end when miles morales met his evil altuniverse twin miles nomorales,2023-06-02

"this might be the most visually insane movie i have ever seen the animation is constantly changing and constantly amazing the color palettes in the universes being unique is a great idea executed perfectly gwens universe looked especially beautiful at points 

this really is a spectacle that has to be seen on the big screen if you’re a diehard spiderman fan then this movie has endless easter eggs that even go beyond that i have to see it again before i can say if it’s my favorite spiderman movie overtaking the last spiderverse but i’m happy to do so because this is a movie you have to view multiple times it’s just that amazing",2023-06-02

"i was unsure if they could top the first movie the first movie really leaned into the whole metaaware you know the rest attitude

i thought it could only be a onetime gimmick but theyve pulled it off again in a way that is still fresh characterfocused and true to what spiderman is

"i feel like the one aspect a lot of viewers will miss is when miguel ohara is explaining the interconnectivity of the spiderverse

before we see the web of life spiderversemiguel shows the marvel multiverse as depicted by disney  marvel studios this wasnt just a reinterpretation reimagining or newly designed displayno this film showed the multiverse exactly as it was shown in avengers endgame loki and antman and the wasp quantumania

so that leaves us with a ton of new info

1 the marvel mutliverse connects the disneymarvel studios multiverse and the sonyverse into the same multiverse now i know a lot of you are saying that didnt nwh already confirm this but the thing is that nwh was a sonydisney production this is the first time a solo sony film acknowledges a nonspiderman movie soon the defunct 20thfox multiverse too with deadpool 3

2 doctor strange was name dropped in a sony film post 2004 which means sony had to get some sort of approval from disney

3 add the multiple spiderman namedrops in multiverse of madness  quantumania which are the 1st times spidey has ever been mentioned in a film he wasnt in another sony approval

4 the way that tobey  andrew had liveaction cameos albeit in clip show form

5 donald glovers liveaction mcu prowler cameo which means disneymarvel studios  sony had to agree on this cameo

all tells us a lot about how sony  disney will move forward

expect a liveaction tom holland in beyond the spiderverse

i think sony  disneymarvel studios are now a married couple

the fans won",2023-06-02
i loved oscar isaccs voice as miguel not scary in a traditional way but you could hear the desperation in his voice to keep things intact really well done role the animation was super smooth with each song fitting the mood perfectly ingenious storytelling really no bs well layered deep and complex,2023-06-02
probably my biggest disappointment but also one of the more interesting aspects is that there wasnt necessarily a traditional climax  the movie didnt really follow a traditional story arc in general even though its a cliff hangar the movie does sorta justend,2023-06-02
what i really loved about this movie was that it didnt feel like an animated movie theres this preconception in hollywood that animation has to be aimed at kids to succeed or that adults wont go see animated films so often times they force the creators to make the movies aimed at kids with atsv they didnt do that this movie didnt have any of those corny child jokes you see in animated movies or make things more childish it was a more mature storyline with proper character arcs and everything that you find in live action masterpieces and i really appreciate that,2023-06-02
"when they kept mentioning hobie i kept thinking he was gonna be some dislikeable character whose closeness with gwen made miles jealous

instead he was miles 1 guy and my favourite character introduced in this movie

every word out of his mouth was gold and he kept coming in clutch for miles and gwen

and the way he just dipped out when the fighting began was perfect ive never vibed with a character more than at that moment

1010 movie will watch in theatres again

also did that news lady at the end say the sinister six cartel  i want more of that",2023-06-02
"spiderpunk is the real hero without him gwen would end up in her universe much longer

mcu vulture ended up in morbius makes more sense now see rennaissance vulture and other villain who ended up in wrong universe strange spell only makes them go into mcu not the other way around

bit reaching but when miguel says strange and some nerd in 19999 mean theres no peter parker inside the mcu anymore and the multiverse acknowledge it

two bagel in best multiverse movie so far everything everywhere all at once  across the spider verse

the ending of this movie is the premise of the flash movie two weeks after funny coincidence

 i can safely say that this movie is far better and more concise rather than the comic book counterpart too much spin off comic makes the main story comic less exciting",2023-06-02

way better cliffhanger than that other movie that came out recently the stakes feel as high as they did during infinity war 1110 give them the  oscar already",2023-06-02

"this film was art 

there was such a strong emotional backbone to this story and i absolutely loved it everything popped and felt intense the music amplified so many scenes that were already visually dense to give you sensory overload in the best of ways 

it was a beautiful cinematic experience",2023-06-02
return of the ham,2023-06-02
"after fast x two weeks ago it was really nice to see a really well done true part 1 film 

its also just really nice to watch this movie because its  great it feels as inventive and revolutionary visually as the first one felt five years ago and it doesnt skip a beat with the comedy and emotion its a two hour fever dream with not a single visually uninteresting moment 

i rewatched the first spiderverse today and noticed that up until the super collider turns on the movie looks unique but isnt all that crazy its not until that turn in the story that we get different art styles and experimentation and when things glitch it feels like the collider is bleeding into the normal world in the sequel the blood is woven into the fabric the experimentation is on full display at all times a shot of the city will switch to a different style for a couple frames and some characters seem to move at different frame rates and are downright amazing to watch animate it really feels like any constraints that may have been present in the first one are absent 

this movie feels like beautiful experimentation the entire runtime starting in gwens world where colors bleed into each other like water color spiderman indias world where its all busy and suntoned its all as specific and beautiful and conceptual as the spider characters in the first film but this time its entire worlds this movie is a visual feast and a total pleasure to watch 

its also setting up a fascinating theme about trope infested writing this really feels like the most successful and interesting take on pop meta filmmaking right now and i cant wait to see what they do to it to have the main conflict of the movie be that the entire idea of spiderman revolves around sacrifice and not being able to save everyone and have the reinvention of spiderman character be the one to say i dont accept that 

this feels like it could go so many directions in part two and thats how you do a part one when credits rolled i felt like they had to because there were so many moving parts that it couldnt wrap up any time soon but that end shot of gwen peter b noir penny and porker standing by the portal i tell you i was so pumped i could have punched a hole through a wall 

and what still works about this movie and elevates it from pop visual spectacle to actual master piece is the characters miles family life is still so sincere and well done gwen and miles is a relationship you pull for but when she said it never ends well i was crushed youve even got new characters like hobie and spiderman india who are so fun and specific to every line of dialogue and every action 

the streamlined way theyve made to introduce us to new spideys is so effective that these movies could introduce ten new spiders in a movie and we would still understand and feel for them because spiderman is a story in broad strokes that we all know and love and see ourselves in and this series is ready to dive into that to give us so many spiders you cant help but find the one that speaks to you and to ask the question is the tragedy necessary to build the character or is it manipulative writing that needs its cycle broken i dont know what theyll do in the next movie but i cant wait to see i think its fair to say spiderman knows how to stick a landing its a 1010

"anyone else just wanted to hold mayday she was a chubby little cutie i loved all the fatherly bits that peter showered on her especially the little kiss on the crown i bet he was the one who knitted the spider mask for her took the time to learn how to knit and did it himself 

love how they kept jk simmons for j jonah jameson i know that voice anywhere he is the universal constant for the entire spiderverse 

hobie brown aka spiderpunk is my new favorite design i love how the cut and past look to him he looked like a mashup of not just old school uk punks but us ones like crass meets bad brains 


i want to know the story about behind spiderrex and spidercat 

love the use of color in gwens world the contrast between the cold blues and warm pinks

edit replacing the irs agent with gwen",2023-06-02
i love that spiderman is such a unique character in terms of his place in culture that this kind of story can really only be told with him all the multiple iterations the years of comics the winks and nods all the different shows games and liveaction moments that you can drop in to build up this character and the structure of him and what hes supposed to be like all makes miles insistence to do his own thing more powerful,2023-06-02

4 pavitrs opening scene",2023-06-03
"let me tell yall something let me tell yall something

this film is freaking amazing each frame is a painting forget the story the voice acting and the music see this film for the animation alone im serious turn off the sound and the experience will be just as captivating 

spiderman across the spiderverse continues the mile morales arc from the prior feature into the spiderverse the movie tells a mature story about destiny and belonging it gets dark at times and the tension rarely eases ultimately though the film is about creativity lord miller and callaham use the film to argue that no property is bound by either narrative bars or the fan base opinions any writer can do whatever heshethey want with an existing ip as long as they have the drive to build that story 

the true villain is not the spot or spiderman 2099 its really the limitations writers and audiences alike place on themselves when confronted with a wellknown character spiderman has to lose uncle ben gwen and the captain for his character development he should also gain his powers by being bitten by a radioactive spider he also has to be of a certain race sexuality and gender such statements are now nonviable notions thanks to this film 

the animation is the real star of this film nothing of this level has been done since arcane netflixriotfortiche it may actually be possible that this film was delayed because of arcanes impact on the animation industry the style used in gwens world is very similar to the painting effect fortiche implemented in arcanes animation each world has its own unique animation style that is passed onto its respective spiderman spiderpunk for instance is portrayed via 70s pop art collage 

miles in this film is stretched between being spiderman and being a responsible teenager he is at odds with his parents gets a b in spanish and shows up late to meaningful events when he does show up he lands in trouble gwen is shown to be in a similar situation where being spiderwoman has placed her at odds with her father her relationship with her dad is the catalyst for the films events and ultimately leads her back to miles

gwen and miles have a teenage love story in this film that is truncated by their ideas of fate it grows from subtle flirty web slinging and ends abruptly with a painful confession the romance between the two is akin to terra and beast boys in the 2003 teen titans cartoon where loyalty friendship and a sense of belonging tear the two would be lovers apart 

ultimately spiderman across the spiderverse is an amazing animated feature it conveys a message about breaking limitations in storytelling while giving the audience a memorable experience through animation and character dynamics the heart of the film is the relationship between miles and gwen and it will be interesting to see how people react to it see this movie on the big screen every chance you get

notes spoilers ahoy 

 the studios and production companies title cards intro was hype

 gwen sure has a habit of leaving stuff around in dimensions she doesnt belong in

 prowler 20 and uncle aaron arent the bad guys in that situation see the events from their perspective and it becomes apparent why they did what they did

 donald glover sure needs something to do now that atlanta is done now that i think about it sony couldnt get lakeith and zazee in this film too

 any miguel ohara theories out there i have one hes not being entirely honest about the spiderverse if miles existence is an aberration outside of the spiderman canon why isnt he allowing miles to do his own thing

 spiderman noir took one look at that organization and noped out

 sony pictures imageworks dropped the gauntlet fortiche has yet to reply with arcane season 2 also starring halee steinfeld

 for all thats good give brian michael bendis a cameo in the sequel the man created miles morales after all",2023-06-02

the first movie was phenomenal animation wise this makes the preceding film seem like an experiment before taking things up to 11 with this movie i’d give an arm and a leg to see it for the first time again despite its very small flawssome scenes were mixed very badly between dialogue and score,2023-06-02
"to say this movie is a masterpiece is an understatement lord and miller are just showing off at this point

this movie did the same “remember that nondescript background character he’s now the main villain” and “massive cliffhanger ending” concepts that fast x just attempted and stumbled on and did them both fantastically

this movie masterfully did the “comic multiverse easter egg” stuff that doctor strange absolutely whiffed on and did it twice  it made the last tom holland spiderman movie’s multiverse adventure look like fan fiction

the fan service moments exceeded massive expectations   donald glover shows up lego spiderman the venomverse they went beyond what anyone could’ve possibly expected

twists you didn’t see coming a mile away

"honestly even with the beautiful animation and excellent storytelling the soundtrack was the standout of the movie for me

"absolutely terrible spot to end the film but despite that it was still great  gonna watch it again tomorrow 

the audio mix was bad though did anyone else experience that it was really quiet for some reason and i struggled to hear dialogue it was actually worse than tenets not sure if it was an issue with my cinema or what

edit this comment is too negative the film is fantastic there were multiple times i was surprised at how impressive something looked so many sequenced that could have been generic were animated in such a unique way the writing was great humour was solid i just wish it wasnt a part 1 lol",2023-06-02
this is gonna be a longshot but the girlfriend and i are thinking miguel’s story isn’t as straight as he’s telling it he conveniently shows up in another universe when alternate family man version of him dies so he can replace him without anyone batting an eye yeah i don’t think so miguel killed familymiguel replaced him destroyed a whole universe on accident and is now trying to prevent others from making the same mistake,2023-06-02

didn’t think i’d ever say this considering i’ve never heard of this character in my life before but the spot was definitely one of the main highlights for me too many comic book movies completely ignore the collateral damage from when our heroes save the day and the choice to use a villain that directly addresses that was genius tbh,2023-06-02
during spots origin story you can see braided miles sitting when the 42 spider is taken,2023-06-02
movie is so good it makes me want to rewatch it a second or even a third time always one of the best part is when miguel informs everyone to catch spider man and failed to specifically mention miles which brings us into the whole spider society pointing at each other also a reference to the old spider man cartoon and everytime the scene where gwen sits at the window at miles room it reminds me of the video from youtube  soundtracks are also a banger,2023-06-02
did anyone else catch the reference to the infamous scene from the wire where mcnulty and bunk investigate a crime scene and only use the word  except of course in this it was shoot,2023-06-03

no disrespect to pixar but this is the best looking animated film of all time they upped their game in animation and design with the multiversal characters looks at renaissance vulture,2023-06-04
"like its predecessor it was a great time

i’m not a superhero fan but “spiderman into the spiderverse was one of the few superheroes films i absolutely love as i thought it was perfectly executed with interesting developed characters great animation and structure with this sequel while i personally still love the first one it continues to achieve like its predecessor

throughout the film explores different themes and concepts in the narrative that were a bit darker and sometimes risky which worked very well as it really helped build the characters personality actions or motivations and setting as usual the animation style colors designs and models are excellent and beautiful the style helps to fit the comic like universe and adds a lot to the scenarios there are certain shots and frameworks that are seriously burned into my memory because of how beautiful they are the characters of miles gwen and others were all pretty interesting as the characters arches and personalities were interesting to observe i appreciate the emotional aspects surrounding miles and gwens current struggles and family dilemmas as it helped to add some interesting developments even if some small choices werent too big on me the voice performances from the cast members were particularly great since each of their voices fit the personality of the characters

the narrative is fun as the narrative explores some new territories that are dark comedic and intriguing which were focused and wellexecuted without feeling too convoluted the sound designs musical score and many of the technical aspects were very good as well as well with the direction the pacing was also pretty good with although certain moments did slightly drag a little as well with a few references that ended up getting a little annoying

despite some small gripes this sequel still manages to live up to its predecessor and it was a great time i will see part one again before part two comes out to have a much better view on it overall with beau is afraid and john wick chapter 4 it’s already one of my favorites of the year so far

810",2023-06-02
this movie kinda also feels like a meta commentary on multiverses as a whole yes there is inherent coolness to them that the filmmakers recognize and use to its fullest potential but it also acts as a “ the multiverse” kind of film where the best part about spidey is the smallscale choices made beneath the mask miles being willing to be labeled as a multiversal anomalyenemy for the sake of his singular multiverse feels perfect,2023-06-02
i like how this film really focuses on miless relationship with his mom before presumably returning to his relationship with his dad in the next one,2023-06-02
"my prediction for beyond  part 2

miguel is going to be right about the need of canon events to occur for the health and continued existence of the multiverse

but he is wrong about which is the canon events exactly its not the death its the lessons learned from that and miles is going to learn them in a different way",2023-06-03

"random thoughts

 the soundtrack  slapped i got such big chills when miguel entered miles world at the end

 they went even crazier with the comic book style of the animation and it was great a highlight for me was the scene at the beginning when gwen hugged her dad and the colors of the room suddenly changed

 speaking of gwen i liked her expanded role in this she was a proper secondary protagonist cant wait until hailee steinfeld comes back for her other character who is also a cold socially dejected fighter with shaved sides riot please

 mumbatan genuinely got a bigger reaction from my theater than the old spideys coming back in nwh

 plot structure was weaker than spiderverse 1 this was clearly written as one long movie that got split in two parts the ending was very abrupt and miles character didnt really evolve much compared to the start of the movie

 seeing miles finally open up to a mom who had the wrong eye color was crazy as soon as i saw she had green eyes i knew hes in the spideyless universe

 hot take the chase scene with all the spider people was underwhelming they went full on ready player one with trying to fit in as many easter eggs as possible instead of doing a better more interesting sequence

 im so glad part 3 is coming in 10 months and we dont have to wait another 5 years for it",2023-06-02

"i know this will get buried under the 7300 and counting comments but i cant even be mad about the amount of discussion happening  this film was fantastic and deserves the love 

so if for no other reason than i gotta get this thought on paper the metanarrative being told through this movie is executed so well

not unlike nwh or a million other movies featuring time travel andor alternate timelines were getting a big dose of determinism bad im fine with this theme recurring often in fiction but it can get tired the way its presented in across the spiderverse feels pretty fresh particularly because the concept is introduced subtly through spot early in the film the spot before miguel ushers in the existential highconcept version 

spot is as interesting a villain as he is initially hapless he is driven by the same toxic traits ego vengefulness misplaced rage selfpity as any number of other villains but seems 1 to have no particular desire to be criminal and is even apologetic about it and 2 seems to be fully aware of the trajectory he is personally on spot accepts if not embraces the idea that he is spidermans nemesis he does not reference predestination specifically but its clear that spot no longer believes that he is in control of his destiny  and dammit if hes doomed to be in spidermans rogues gallery hes gonna be the best villain he can be unlike villains who lack the self awareness to see themselves as the bad guy spot is smart enough to know that hes on the pipeline to supervillainy and just doesnt see a way off 

in this way spot is a mirror to miles who we see somewhat naively trying to have it all as though he is in total control in a hurry to grow up as his father puts it and failing pretty badly in some important but not yet immediately disastrous ways mediocre spidermanning messing up his relationship with his parents however miguel mirrors spot  or rather puts an gigantic lens on spots apparent philosophy as if to say yes not only is it inevitable but your rise to villainy is actually a function of reality

its fitting that the movie cliffhangs with miles coming face to face with his nearly literal mirror i suspect the resolution in beyond will bridge the gap between the free will that miles takes for granted re his seeming ignorance to just how much of his life is outside of his control and the nearly useless deterministic thinking which drives spots actions  as well as miguels his zealotry for the inevitable is so severe that it actually takes the form of prejudice against miles i mean this movie is using ageold time travel determinism tropes to talk about racism thats not super subtle but its very interesting",2023-06-05
"i liked how the spot was the bagel guy from the first one

also unpopular opinion but i thought the animation got a little too frantic and and made the movie feel unnecessary chaotic at certain points like some
parts of the opening battle there is just a lot going on",2023-06-02
"that was an immensely enjoyable movie im still digesting it in my brain so i cant do more complexorganized words about it but it was good shpidaman is good

i feel really bad for miguel ohara it is tough being the only straight man spiderman if i had to guess were going to get an extremely good moment next movie where miguel does a quip and everyone claps or something

lastly including live action people in this movie is going to open up a whole can of worms im looking at toei and disney right now emissary of  spiderman as a straight up toku hero would make millions of people happy i know itd make me happy

i wasnt really plugged into the spidey comics at the time but like the bit where miguel gets on miles case about not deserving to be a spiderman really reminds me of the old forum i used to go to in the late 00searly 10s when people who followed the ultimate universe were  that he was replacing ultimate spidey fun to think about",2023-06-02
i dont get the critique that there isnt a resolute ending to this film yeah miles story and the conflict with miguelprowler miles isnt resolved but this is clearly gwens film it opens on her and shes the one who finishes her character arc through the film and at the end she has this huge climactic reunion with her father before gathering the other spideys to go help miles i feel like thats as good an ending as you can get for a part one film and i know a lot of people didnt know it was a two parter going into it but i dont think they really hid that in marketing or anything granted it wasnt explicitly advertised as such either i feel like a lot of this bad ending critique is reactionary from the feeling of seeing to be continued and getting sad about waiting another year which is super understandable but my take is that give it another year or two and people will look back on the ending of this film and find it a lot better even without taking into context the next film that will almost certainly pay off what was set up here,2023-06-02
"overall i really enjoyed it although i still probably prefer into due to its simplicity that being said ill hold off until beyond comes out since it is kinda hard to rate only half of a movie

some assorted thoughts

honestly didnt expect gwen to essentially be the protagonist here i wonder if thatll also carry over to beyond

i was a bit miffed at all the live action spiderman pandering but then lordmiller effectively told a story about how marvel and sony have done  all with spiderman in the last few decades and i came right back on board lol that being said ill even admit i cracked a bit of a grin when donald glover made an appearance

anyone notice prowler miles in spots flashback to the alternate universe spider thats definitely gonna come into play",2023-06-02
i havent seen it said but the amount of representation in this movie is pretty crazy i mean they had a wheelchair spiderman for goodness sake thats definitely worth praise,2023-06-02
"i dont buy miles42 as a villain i have a feeling its going to be a red herring 

the question this movie asks is should you fight against destiny aka canon to save lives
  
miguel our antagonist thinks the answer is unequivocally no anything that disrupts canon is an anomaly that has the potential to destroy the multiverse from his view earth42 was doomed the instant its spider failed to create the right spiderman canon must be preserved at all costs  

but i dont think thats the viewpoint of the movie both miles and gwen our protagonists arrive at the opposite conclusion you should try to change things for the better you should try to save the lives that canon has deemed sacrificial canon is not an undeniable force it can and should be challenged  

i think a beautiful way to expand on that theme would be to demonstrate that earth42 doesnt need spiderman to have heroes did becoming spiderman the canonical hero force our miles to become a hero or would he have become a hero anyways  

while aaron42 and miles42 certainly seem to be performing villainous acts at the end of this film the movie intentionally leaves out so much context they are clearly planning a heist as aaron notes they have to avoid security but whos to say theyre not stealing from oscorp or kingpin or an evil tech billionaire version of peter parker  

and even though they beat up and chain up our miles what else were they supposed to do a random doppelganger showed up on the night of their big plan spouting nonsense about being from another universe   

add all that to the caring relationship they both have with rio plus the loving portrait of the deceased jeff davis and i think we have a more complex character than evil miles on our hands 

in other words i dont think gwens band is the only teamup teased at the end of this movie",2023-06-02
am i the only one who had a really hard time understanding spiderpunk,2023-06-02
anyone notice how earth42 mile morales rolled his r when saying morales makes sense because his dad died in this universe so he would pick up more of his moms accent,2023-06-05
"i remember this being touted as across the spiderverse part 1 and i was hoping they had since amended it to include an actual ending even though we know gwens team will obviously save miles and right the multiverse it just doesnt stand on its own as a satisfying movie this sentiment was echoed by other people i heard discussing it in the restroom

aside from that though i thought the movie was  fantastic the colors the style the humor i had forgotten how much of a liveaction comic book the first movie felt like so many great cameos too donald glover as prowler and that asian shopkeeper from venom plus archival footage of both tobey maguire and andrew garfield i guess tom hollands version doesnt exist anymore postno way home plus it was cool to see lego and video game versions making appearances i lost count of how many different spiderpeople were introduced here but it was all very entertaining and involving especially the gwenmiles relationship angle

but sadly all i can remember right now is that unfinished ending",2023-06-02

"i think that miguel is actuallynot a spider 

theres a sceneor maybe a couplewhere he is injecting some sort of fluid in his system also his eyes grow from amber to red at different sequences and theyre red when he gets more unhingedvenom causing an emotional imbalace plus in the callback scene why would alternate miguels spider die randomly by a gunshot weve seen all kinds of spiders dodge a variety of fastmoving objects so this doesnt really make sense i think alternate miguel was never a spider just as 2099 is not a true spider and he has claws instead of a regular spider which i think is because he cant climb naturallyhe doesnt get the full skill range of a spider miles even says this when he sees the clawsyoure sure youre an actual spidermanor something similar 

storybeatwise its fluid with a couple of thingsgwens peter wanting to be a spider and having such a personal emotional vendetta against miles hes angry that miles got chosen when he wasnt supposed to be and he miguel didnt i think theres more to miguels story he forced a spider arc for himself by creating some sort of venom that helps him hone spider abilities that it wasnt a chance spider at all that bit him 

ill be honest i havent read the comics and know virtually nothing about any of these characters outside of the movies im coming in as a relatively new superhero fan i just absolutely adore the spiderverse movies and enjoy picking apart and thinking about the clever story beats theyve developed you can prove me completely wrong by providing some comic lore i just predict this will come up in beyond as part of miguels arc",2023-06-04

watching this made me wish i could be spider man lol the only thing i didn’t like is some the inconsistent things from the first and this one like

 the young peter from gwens universe in the first one he was older when he became lizard in this one he was younger the location of the uncle aaron graffiti was changed from the first film too the only other thing is the way ben reilly was portrayed it was a bit silly made me laugh tho lol

i started freaking out when… spectacular  unlimited showed up in the background and was pretty close to the camera  awesome i  loved seeing donald glover as live action prowler lol mrs chen was kinda funny

lego spiderman was  dope trex spidey was dope too miles was so awesome in this movie man he was great and his performance in this movie cemented him as one of my fav versions of spiderman

 loved how the first 20 or so mins of the movie was all spidergwen loved every second of it and it looked so beautiful and that  fight with gwen 2099  jess aganist paper vulture was so awesome this movie the entire movie looked so  beautiful bro wow every  frame was jaw droppin 

 spot was great cliffhanger was dope i knew miles was in the wrong dimension when 42 showed up when he was tryinna go home that universe looked great with the green sky in the rain miles prowler was a dope reveal 

 the scene of gwen jumping out of her apt and starting swinging loved it gave me ps4 spidey vibes  scooby doo name drop loved how more this movie then the last one made me feel like i was reading a comic book with the explanations and other editors notes stuff 

great to see that jk simmons is jjj in every single universe lmfaooo",2023-06-02
if no ones got me i know spider punks got me,2023-06-02
so is miguel basically the toxic comic book guy who wants all super heroes to be a humorless bad  with tragic backstory and anything that doesn’t fit that mold is noncanon,2023-06-03
any theories as to why peter b parker was in miguel’s world that was collapsing,2023-06-04
i heard this film had a cliffhanger so i genuinely thought it was about to end so many times after miles went to earth 42 the music kept crescendoing with an epic shot so i figured a smash cut to credits was inevitable,2023-06-04
i liked everything in this movie except the pacing when it was obvious that they weren’t going to wrap things up i felt like the set up for the next movie really dragged even though the individual scenes were good it just felt like 5 ending scenes put together,2023-06-05
"moral of the story parenting is hard

also not enough love for peter b parker in the thread know he took a reduced role and was a bit goofier here but loved how enthusiastic of a dad he was and it was super sweet how he admitted to having a kid because of miles",2023-06-02
him having to apologize for the moustache is the best part,2023-06-02
"this creative team does a really good job of portraying miles’s spiderman miles has a traditional family dynamic which differentiates him from other spiderpeople and the way his family operates feels so authentic his family feels so tied to his community but he also feels like i did at his age kind of tired of having to make appearances with all the uncles and aunties who show up at whatever event his parents were throwing at their house that weekend but he also deeply appreciates what his parents have given him and is trying to balance their expectations with his desires 

another thing i really love is that miles truly embodies what it means to be spiderman amongst the army of spiders canon be damned if there is someone whose life he can save he’s going to do it the other spiders have logically concluded that some people just can’t be saved in fact the death of certain individuals appears to be a fixed point for every spider while they all have come to accept that reality as a force that molds each spider towards becoming the hero they’re meant to be miles throws that whole notion out the water he can’t sit by if he knows someone can be saved

so what if he was never meant to be spiderman so what if he’s the first anomaly he’s spiderman now and he will do both

“nah i’m gonna do my own thing”

him",2023-06-02
"oh my  i just watched the trailer for into the spider verse and realized something

miles says he cant save the whole world to which peter responds you cant save the whole world just think about saving one person

and here miles is doing exactly that this duet of movies has not missed a single connection plot thread reference to prior material all of it is right there possibly the best trilogy of all time depending on how the third one shakes out itll undoubtedly be amazing",2023-06-04
prowler jordans otw,2023-06-04
"caught a second viewing today and noticed so many new things but the biggest one is that screen says miles is being sent to earth 42 before it’s even revealed an observant watcher would see that he’s being sent to the wrong place before they slam the twist on them i love the attention to detail

oh yeah and this is my new favorite movie

i also see people go to the bathroom every time miguel explains the entire thing happening",2023-06-04
 i just realized that tom holland’s clips from the three movies did not show up because his feat is already erased from all the multiverses,2023-06-04

"y’all miguel is a prowler he’s pretending to be a spiderman because one of them wronged him he sees it as ‘spiderman is the reason my daughter died’ or something so how do you get revenge make sure every one of those spiderjerks loses a loved one suffers feels his pain 

miles  “are those claws are you even a spiderman”
miguel doesn’t have webs he doesn’t joke he’s a vampire ffs

canon events are detected by a program he wrote everyone uses his tech 
he’s a prowler not a spiderman",2023-06-07
"i expect to be in the minority but if the cliffhanger just doesn’t work for me i really loved almost everything in this movie but it doesn’t feel like i really watched a story there was no climax we ended on rising action the only plot thread that was introduced and resolved in any way was gwen and her father which i loved it just feels like a long beautiful trailer honestly 

it doesn’t help that so many of the payoffs in this film were already shown in the trailers that was annoying",2023-06-02

"i’ve looked all over and i’m surprised nobody else has mentioned the ending where miles’s parents listen to a girl they met a few hours ago tell them their 15 year old son is missing and they have 0 follow up questions

i loved it overall but that was just a really weird part of the script",2023-06-09
this just might be my favorite super hero film ever made i loved how upsetting and difficult the story is it  sucks to be spiderman you have to lose it absolutely deconstructs  enhances and illuminates every spiderman story that comes before it what an accomplishment,2023-06-11
"a few things i noticed on my third viewing

when gwen was recapping miles’ story at the very beginning and it starts flashing images while she’s drumming you do see a brief shot of jeff and spot from the bw “vision” of him getting killed in the future

i noticed a shot of “upside down kiss” from sm ‘02 when they were going over cannon events

miguel refers to the “captain dying” canon event as “asm90” which of course is the 90th amazing spiderman comic in which george stacy dies

when miles is in his earth 42 bedroom at the end talking to rio i noticed some blueprints for prowler gloves",2023-06-11
the entire spider verse is literally just a  narrative that justifies and reproduces systematic trauma just like a college application essay,2023-06-13

the spot was hilarious and im glad the cast from the first movie is returninng",2023-06-02
the way they incorporated the live action with the animation had to be the most well done i can recall to date was pretty  seamless how they got glover to interact with the characters,2023-06-02

"ok so i loved it i loved every second of it art style soundtrack writing everything  
  
but tell me if anyone else had this problem with it the same as fast x i felt like this movie had no main event or climax of its own rather it just felt a bit incomplete and unsatisfying and a setup for the finale  
  
at first i thought maybe this is just how it has to be with twopart movies but then i remembered how infinity warendgame managed to do it so well making even the first movie feel like its own whole thing even with the most deadly cliffhanger of all time i wonder why this movie or fast x couldnt do quite that and i wonder if mission impossible dead reckoning part 1 will be the same way",2023-06-03
just out honestly lost for words can’t see anything beating this for my film of the year,2023-06-03
"absolutely stunning movie i went to a 4dx viewing of the movie on sunday morning at 940am and the hall was packed ive been to other movies in this particular time slot and its usually just a handful of people  little mermaid for example had a total of 5 people in the audience including myself  but not this time

the spiderverse movies so far evoke a sense of wonder which i havent had since the first phase of mcu visually its absolutely beautifully made and this artistic direction evokes the comic feel of the first one but even better i really wish it would come to streaming services sooner so i can just pause and rewatch everything  first for the animation styles and second for the easter eggs 

as an indian pavitr prabhakar made me so  happy  especially with the nitpicks about chai tea and naan bread too real man glad to see  be returning in beyond the spiderverse same thing with hobie he was perfect spot being the dude hit with the bagel is  hilarious and i do love how they slowly ramp him up as a villain

my one big con with this one  it ends on a cliffhanger while it does a fantastic job of setting up for the next movie and i believe all this worldbuilding was needed the way that ended left me unsatisfied i was expecting a full closure like in the first movie but then i looked at the run time and realised this was going to be a to be continued kind of deal the realisation that miles had ended up in the wrong dimension was quite crazy tho ngl i also really like that the earth42 miles has a stronger spanish accent when pronouncing morales  the subtle distinctions between both dimensions 

overall i feel this is better served when looked at as the conclusion of gwens story arc than miles  because that is done well she opens and closes the movie for a reason but i think many people  including myself  expected this to be miles story so there is a level of dissatisfaction with the lack of closure 

imo this places more pressure on beyond the spiderverse to be perfect in order for the buildup in across the spiderverse to pay off standalone i certainly do like the emotional beats across covers  especially about parenthood because rios monologue hit hard  but that means little unless it pays off in beyond

overall 910 i plan to rewatch it over the weekend so ill see how i feel about it after knowing how it ends",2023-06-06
between this and invincible i need more animated super hero content maybe its the superior medium to tell these stories in,2023-06-07

"i just came back from watching across the spiderverse for the third time running and i’m planning to watch it a fourth and fifth time

i love this movie so much and it’s not just because as a comics fan specifically a spiderman fan a fantasy and scifi fan and a black writer that seeing a black spiderman being front and centre of his own series and arguably being in the best spiderman movie of all time is not something i ever thought i’d see

but because i can’t fault the plot the characterisation the music the character motivations the pacing and as a writer of 21 years i can have high standards

it is just all exquisite",2023-06-07

"i know chai tea and naan bread is the best joke in the movie but it actually make sense when these things are being imported to outside country such as britian they cant just call it tea since they would get it confused with their own tea which is black tea
out of respect they kept the name chai in it but if you go on street and tell people that you want some chai people dont know what that word is therefore we call it chai tea 
same thing with naan bread we all know bread means a loaf of bread and not the flat thing that looks like a tortilla so we used the word naan bread
now chinese tea is different because luckly british tea is black red and chinese tea is green  so we simply call it green tea",2023-06-05
anyone else notice how miserable and stressed gwen seemed throughout the movie  rly well voice acted and the scenes with her father were amazing obviously she felt terrible about leaving her dad but she also seemed really desperate about pleasing them when talking to the other spiderwoman jessica drew spiderwoman  who seemed really really tough on her she just seemed very depressed desperate and heartbroken was interesting,2023-06-05

you gotta love the layers in that scene where rio talks to miles rio knew that miles lied when she asked him to tell the truth on why he always flakes but he came up with some excuse rio always knew that miles had a secret life she is very worried about him living this secret but when he came up with that excuse she felt just how much that secret meant to him miles of course is very much capable of fending for himself in this secret life but to rio hes still just a little boy whos trying to say he can take care of himself however when she felt the weight of miles excuse just to hide his secret she finally decides to just let miles do whatever he wants but with some advice that is if he is gonna continue living that secret at least be careful take care of my little boy  little boy being the boy she knows miles as she is talking to miles secret life  as spiderman rio is literally talking to spiderman to protect miles although her speech also functions as a sort of parental advice for a son who stubbornly insists to be independent in this context it can be seen as her pleading to the actual albeit secret identity of miles  a very capable person to please protect miles a precious son whom she doesnt want to be hurt honestly amazing writing cant wait for beyond the spiderverse",2023-06-11
"this movie is insane so many intense scenes also pretty balanced with the slower but important family moments in there 

the mumbai and futuristic new york sequences are easily the best parts imo so good also a bit underrated but gwens theme at the beginning is amazing whenever she is fighting gotta listen to it again",2023-06-25
im going to get downvoted but i didnt love it the first movie is such tight storytelling — each scene didnt feel wasted this one has so many moments of nothing happening and two characters saying how much they mean to one another gwen and her dad was great but the rest was way too much there was a scene on the rooftop where miles is trying to tell his mom that hes spiderman and miles says mom im and  someone in the audience yelled out  and people laughed because its not a real moment it had no gravity it kills the pacing think about how uncle aaron and miles had such a strong relationship in the first movie and they never had a conversation about how much they care about one another show dont tell,2023-06-02
"across the spiderverse man how can you one up one of the best animated movies of all time the best super hero movie the best spiderman movie 

ever since spiderverse came out other studios have copied its style from dream works in  and boots and pixar with turning red across the spiderverse doesnt just do the same thing again which would have easily been one of the top movies of the year but improved upon it the storytelling the  immaculate voice acting the easter eggs the love for spiderman and the animation in a true art form that i dont think will be matched by any movies this year but  theyre welcome to try easily without a doubt in my mind a 1010 the empire strikes back to spiderverses new hope",2023-06-02

its mind blowing and the best spiderman story ever told on screen from a die hard spiderman fan it’s literally going to force the animation medium to step up its game permanently pushes the boundaries of the way you can tell stories through filmmaking yep the most visually insane and off the walls thing i’ve ever seen wildly original i want to take every second of that movie and frame it and put in a museum there’s a neat little reference to a wes anderson film in here too,2023-06-02
"i feel like the entire web of canon moment was a big highlight beyond seeing live action footage of amazing spider man which definitely shocked me it was definitely the most meta spiderman thing weve seen in a long time 

but i think whats most interesting about it is that into the spider verse was all about miles becoming just like all of these other spider men and the whole point that spider man could be anyone if that film was about the everyman nature of spiderman this is about the predetermination and common threads of being spiderman plus arguably the formulaic nature of spider man stories always involving tragic backstories and eventual tragic loss its an interesting opposite yes spider man can be anyone but the same specific  is gonna happen to him no matter what in every universe",2023-06-02
"perfect spectacular felt like a comic book right to the end

i just wish they had ended on “this isn’t my universe” and gwen with “he’s in the wrong universe” and cut to a to be continued with miles prowler in the mid credit scene that would have been such a way to draw viewers back and also be true to comic book cliffhangers",2023-06-02
"i came in trying to manage my expectations i did not need it to be as good as the first film which i loved just good enough so to speak the fact that i am leaving unsure as to whether i prefer this one or the first pretty much speaks for itself

i was blown away

the action setpieces throughout were incredible loved the little prologue with gwen and the more focus she gets throughout the film she goes through a journey and has a lot of growth herself really liked the scenes between her and her dad you can see the parallels between herself and miles

i like that its a more serious tone of story with bigger stakes while there is plenty of humour especially early on the film starts to shift just like how spot shifts from the villain of the week joke to someone who become an extremely serious threat it was executed very well not a villain but miguel is a compelling antagonist in this film you can completely understand where hes coming from and i am very interested to see what  do in the next film

so many details i could gush about a lot of the callbacks in jokes from the first film with making it seem like jeff was about to jump into the portal immediate cut to him running down the stairs the fact that miles did albeit inadvertently cause the spiderman in his universe to die if you watch the first film back or youve seen it countless times like me miles does delay spiderman enough to the point that the prowler is able to catch up with him and prevent the collider shut down the fact that was incorporated as a key plot element is crazy love that

the theme of destiny determinism or canon is an interesting one if miles was not supposed to become spiderman then was his father just destined to die albeit it wouldve been under the watch of chris pine spiderman i suppose that would also work

need to recover after seeing it 4dx which helped ramp up the action scenes even further probably going to see it again soon in imax",2023-06-02

this movie was visually and auditory stunning but i’m surprised that it’s getting such high ratings considering that it’s effectively half of a movie i like the idea that this is gwen’s movie and wraps up her story but i don’t see a lot of critics mentioning that,2023-06-04

so he wasnt just  not at first but later when they began fighting but he also lost his genitals correct me if im wrong but he had nothing inbetween his legs and i checked the images from the movie so did the mutation just made him that way how does the guy even go to the bathroom

visually this movie is outstanding every frame is something to admire and every universe is different even if only subtly gwen’s universe was easily the most beautiful to me

i liked the first movie don’t get me wrong i did really like spiderverse 1 and when a sequel was announced i was happy and ready to see it but this  i genuinely love this movie 

maybe it’s because it’s just out at a better time in my life i’m happier less depressed or maybe something tonally or how the movie comes together just strikes more of a chord with me but i adore this movie i’d happily watch it again i rate it above the first",2023-06-11

some people say the music was a downgrade from the first and while the music wasn’t as iconic as the first sunflower what’s up danger prowler theme it’s still  good spot theme miguel theme and gwen theme mona lisa and the ending song

its the heros lowest point before the satisfying conclusion overall i just love this movie straight upgrade of the first one in all aspects  it explores so much about the spiderman mythos and bakes the i saw and i clapped stuff directly into the narrative

did anyone notice a michelle obama president sticker in miles room the first time he walks in i want to say it was to the right of the door,2023-06-08
nahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh imma do my own thing,2023-06-08
i love that while peter b and jessica were squabbling about who the better mentor is hobie was the only one who taught miles anything and actually supported him he won the competition that he wasnt even a part of,2023-06-08
"did anyone else notice like a theme of mentor and mentee in the previous movie we saw all the spiders mentor miles and help him become his own spiderman like the  peter showed him the practical stuff the perfect peter was more on the philosophical gwen taught him to be more acrobatic etc 

then in this movie there’s like a switch all of a sudden miles is shown to be the perfect philosophical mentor like he is the guide that every spiderman should aim for always trying to protect everyone no matter the cost 

then we have gwen in this movie she’s a scared and alone kid who doesn’t know how to process her emotions and trauma properly so she’s lashing out on her father and exband mates if instead of miguel and jess coming out of the portal we had peter bparker the perfect peter i think he would have told gwen to confront her trauma talk about it with her father and not run away as that is the worse thing you can do as it will pile up and all come crashing down like we see later in the movie but instead she gets jess who taught her how to practically become a better spiderwomen but not how to process her feeling and mature emotionally 
 
we can see the duality of a mentor how if the mentor isn’t good it could lead the person astray and they not even know it until it’s too late as you trust a mentor whole heartedly but if you can find someone who can guide you back onto the right path then you can start to improve so i think the next movie is gonna be about how miles will ‘mentor’used loosely the whole spider verse on how they should strive to protect everyone and sacrifice no one",2023-06-10
spiderpunk was awesome and i like how he give tip to miles morales on how to use his powers,2023-06-11
i could have used subtitles for spider punk lol,2023-06-11
a small detail but when miles first meets spiderman at the collider in itsv his spiderscene is greenpurple and peter’s are redblue but then miles’ change into redblue too thought that was a cool way to foreshadow miles becoming the prowler if he didn’t have the influence of spiderman to change his canon event,2023-06-11

peter b parker explaining why he wanted miles to hold mayday is one of my favorite scenes from the movie and its sad that more people arent talking about that scene,2023-06-12

"loved the movie

miguel is explaining the spiderverse as if he knew everything about it but it was shown multiple times in the movie that their model isnt perfect

i expect the third movie to explain the real reason why his universe was destroyed

perhaps bring it back again introducing the true spiderverse

"this movie is about to be the next dark knightspiderman 2 of animated superhero movies imo it kicked so much  and blew me away especially the second and third act if beyond really nailed the conclusion then the spiderverse as a trilogy has a big chance to become the best spiderman trilogy followed by sam raimis trilogy

it honestly amazing how the way it tackled the multiverse really blows the entire mcus phase 4 out of the water",2023-06-14
"okay so i finally got the chance to see this yesterday absolutely blown away a visually stunning movie with plenty of action and heart felt moments

and the ending i know a lot of people are annoyed by the cliffhanger and i get it but earth42 miles being the prowler just made my jaw drop i am gutted that we have to wait until the end of march 2024 though really hoping its not delayed

overall a solid sequel where the humour lands the story expands and the gut punches roll",2023-06-14

"did anyone feel that the cannon event symbolizes how fans react to writers changing things and introducing new variables

i mean miles morales got some criticism when introduced now hes a fan favorite",2023-06-20
i can’t stop thinking about how badass the end of this movie was with miles being calm and collected in the face of some seemingly insurmountable odds the growth of his character across both this and the previous movie is so good for a movie that’s clearly meant to be the dark middle chapter of a trilogy i was really pleasantly surprised how positive some of the notes this movie ends on were and obviously it was visually arresting,2023-06-22
i laughed the hardest with the little kid licking the train windows hahahaha,2023-06-27
"i adored the movie ive seen it twice already but i have some issues with it

1 i don’t like how all of the spiderpeople are so quick to side with miguel spiderman is a hero that standsup for the little guy and always tries to save every person i don’t believe that hundreds of spiderpeople would let uncles and police captains die just because they are “canon events” spiderman is the type of person that would save captain morales while also finding a way to stop a multiversal collapse it doesn’t make sense to me that miles is the only spiderperson to hold this ideology that goes against everything we know about the character across all iterations
2 peter b parker was a standout for me in itsv and i’m not the biggest fan that he’s been reduced to a comic relief character i understand that he’s happy now but i don’t like that he doesn’t take the situation seriously and doesn’t show a lot of concern for miles’ plight or the possibility of a multiversal collapse i also cringed when peter implied that miles would feel better about his dad dying if he just held mayday does peter not remember how heartwrenching it was to lose his own father figure uncle ben having a baby doesnt magically erase that pain weirdly out of character",2023-06-04
mannnnn when that prowler theme played i was shook never saw this ending coming miles vs miles gonna be good hoping they team up in the end,2023-06-02
"i guess im definitely in the minority but im a little shocked at the glowing reception this movie is getting i was so disappointed because the first movie is incredible

visually it was stunning like wow wow wow music was excellent but i felt the script was a mess

this one abandoned the 3 act structure to jam pack as much as possible in its runtime i kept waiting for a climax that never happened i get that its a part 1 so not everything will be resolved but the runtime was devoted more to fanservice than telling a concise plot it didnt need to be over 2 hours honestly

instead it felt more like a marvel studios movie this time you got gratuitous moments devoted to fanservice you got characters making unnatural cool superhero poses i dont remember this being a thing in the first movie so why now and youve got a plot bogged down with explanations and overlong dramatic scenes that wrecked the pacing throughout

edit also writerproducer phil lord tweeted about asking your theater staff to raise the volume if its too low so sony knew the audio mixing was bad and they released it as is",2023-06-03

"my two big takeaways

1 spidergwens origin is the best au marvel has done in like 20 years i loved that they kept it pretty much the same in the first movie but to actually see it in full here was worth the ticket price by itself i imagine that jason latour and robbie rodriguez are not getting paid for this but i hope they enjoyed it anyway she was the core of this movie 

2 right now between the ending of no way home and the current arc of the amazing spiderman comic marvel has never been as hardline on the stance that spiderman is popular because of how sad he is his current book is so bad so antithetical to what fans of the character actually want that its unfavorably colored online perception of american comics in general so to see this movie so loudly protest this treatment of one of the three biggest characters in the medium is really profound",2023-06-02
"wow i dont usually get blown away by movies much anymore but this was pardon the pun amazing

this was the most live action feeling animated movie i can remember 

i cant think of many especially western animated movies that have so many great long scenes of character driven dialogue 

when you look back on this 2 and a half hour movie there werent too many action set pieces the ones we got were of course brilliantly animated  particularly fight scenes with the spot where the angle changes are all accounted for

i could sit here praising this movie for hours without a doubt the best part one film ive seen in years even though it ends of a cliffhanger i still felt more than satisfied and very excited for beyond the spiderverse

also as a huge spiderman fan some very nice cameos both live action and animated",2023-06-02

this is probably the first movie i’ve ever seen where i knew it was going to end but i tried hard to convince myself it won’t cause i wanted it to go longer like when gwen is rounding everyone up and narrating i was like no no this can’t be it just let some montage music play but then i heard the little closing build up music kick in and then “ to be continued “ popped up,2023-06-04

"i absolutely  loved the scene where hobie encourages miles to break out of the cage giving him the advice to use his palms and to not back down against miguel i think one of my favourite scenes in the movie along with rio having a talk on the roof with miles

only slight gripe i have is that i wish they made the earth42 sign on the computer more subtle when miles was going back so that it was easier to miss i saw it the moment it came up so it kind of ruined the twist for me as i was just sitting there waiting for it to come 

aside from that though have the mention the soundtrack so so so so  good was perfect in every scene",2023-06-07

"okay i wanted to rip on you nerds so bad for making this one of the highest rated movie ever but after watching it i get it i kind of hate superhero movies at this point but i really really get it

the animation in this movie is the best ive ever seen and probably will ever see until part 3 comes out i guess this is not an exaggeration this movie is stunning and so creative and layered and even like super experimental this takes the superhero movie genre and completely turns it on its head the action scenes are fun and thrilling the dramatic scenes are really great and nuanced the characters fleshed out and interesting  the music is even good and that was my biggest complaint about the first one it literally surpasses the first film in every way

i have some minor gripes but nothing that really killed my enjoyment i think a lot of the humour was great but some of the jokes were a little lame chai tea was a banger though but people were dying laughing in the theatre so couldve been just me as well like anytime theres a movie with multiverses and like time travel and all that  theres going to be a ton of plot holes so much so they made the villain a literal plot hole lol i think if you can just turn your brain off for a second and just remember youre watching an animated movie about spiderman the plot holes wont bug you as much—still bugged me just a little and like this story isnt complete so its hard to gauge it as a whole just yet but if they keep it the same pace as this movie i think it could be one of the best trilogies of the modern era

it really is a love letter to the character of spiderman from the history to the characters place in popular culture i like thematically how it talked about the bond between parent and child and felt it was really moving and made sense with the character of spiderman theres been so many superhero and multiverse movies at this point and its really hard to do something that is not only original but just  good and worth seeing this movie accomplishes that almost herculean feat the ending really surprised me cause i went int completely blind my whole theatre was so into it will go down as a classic as i was leaving the theatre and waiting for my friend to get out of the bathroom i saw a kid probably around 9 or 10 come out of the movie and he was just looking at the poster art in awe this is what its all about

"saw the new mix of this today which i’m dubbing the “i’m going home cut” 

honestly i never had problems with the sound in my theaters the previous two times i watched this but i specifically noticed they took out a line when miles shocks miguel off the train he originally said “nah i’mma do my own thing sorry man i’m going home” they took out the second sentence just something i noticed 

movie is still a 1010",2023-06-12
"the art the music and the music was all phenomenal

between this and eeaao it has been a big couple of years for bagels,2023-06-20
"i love how it started off differently with gwens story in a different universe instead of miles her universe is seen more differently with miles with a lot more colors in it not sure if it was the way her universe was a way of showing her emotions or maybe both heart wrenching to see gwen and her fathers reaction to her identity reveal

with miles i like how they showed him struggling to balance his schoolhome life and superhero stuff as he becomes distant from family and arrives late to any important event even when he has a family celebration to attend to he never seems to catch a break just goes to show being a superhero can be stressful as a teen its however very impressive that he has straight as in almost all of his classes with everything going on

with what the writers did with spot its brilliant that they made a minor side character from the first film to be a secondary antagonist to miles i had to go back to rewatch that scene and spot was indeed only shown in the first film when miles threw the bagel at his face while escaping the facility 

it was great that miles brought up mens mental health in a somewhat casual way with his dad pretty comical when his father keeps dismissing it he must be thinking who do you think you are  

aw when gwen went down the rooftop and miles put his head down i personally felt that for sure almost cried i found it cute that they were both seemingly jealous about another potential mate

the first plot twist when all the spider people appeared around the group while miles was talking about how everyone had the power to reverse a tragic loss but understandable that they had to let things be to not disrupt the canon events that was such a tense scene i really liked that spider b parker came back and is still trying to mentor miles like a father figure from his introduction he noticed he definetly went through a character development to being more happy and laid back having a kid for sure changed him for the better as a person  

that second plot twist when miles went to the wrong universe to find his uncle is the one alive and not his dad with that color scheme its almost something out of a telltale game like the wolf among us that final cliffhanger with miles as the prowler was nothing but amazing 

such a great film that glitchy soundtrack is still there and fire",2023-06-21

with the way it ended it sucks that we may have to wait until 25 to get the third film not unless sony hires a  of animators to meet a 2024 release",2023-07-01
"overall i liked it but it’s got some issues for me

first of all the audio mixing in many areas was just straightup bad i missed so many lines simply because i couldn’t hear it over the music  action

while the colors and styles are great it’s way too much spiderpunk and vulture were hard to keep track of and i found gwen’s scenes way too much and too blatant she sad so make da room bloo it took away from what should be really impactful scenes something like wolfwalkers handled these kinds of backgrounds much better imo i know my dad will hate this movie’s animation because he already didn’t like the first’s that much he doesn’t care for the cg2d heavy stylization mix showing up more and more and this is into’s animation on copious amounts of coke

a lot of the action was also hard to keep track of especially in fight scenes or when introducing new characters at times it makes it hard to tell what’s happening or where my eye’s supposed to hang out and a lot of the fight choreography felt sloppyrushed because of it like in mile’s first fight with spot a swan gets involved somehow and i have no clue where it came from despite keeping my eyes on the screen the whole time there are moments where the audience needs to rest or reorientate but the movie doesn’t provide them

which brings me to my next point the story’s pacing is really off it switches from “way to fast” to “snail’s pace while i loved the visuals of it most of the time at the rooftop party could’ve been cut completely to give us more time with pavtir who just disappears in the last half of the movie andor hobie or even to just add a bit more breathing room for fight scenes

or even to further flesh out gwen’s arc which honestly feels so halfbaked compared to miles’ in the first one i get the argument that this is supposed to be gwen’s movie but there’s so much focus on miles that it really doesn’t feel like it

finally this movie really struggles with “middleofthetrilogy” syndrome where it just feels like connective tissue so into and beyond make sense i’ve seen this a lot in books where the middle one is kinda necessary but you overall feel like you wasted your time part of it is because it doesn’t feel as tightly written as into but also because it just introduces a bunch of stuff without really doing anything with them while also ending on that massive cliffhanger i honestly don’t see myself rewatching this one overandover like i have with into the spiderverse imo even if you’re making a trilogy each moviebook should work as a selfcontained story that weaves itself into the greater whole

in conclusion i did like this movie but it’s got some significant flaws that drag the experience down quite a bit for me i feel like it’s been greatly overhyped",2023-07-10
"im someone who is just like so  sick of superhero movies i know thats not a common opinion around these parts especially not for anyone who went to see this movie but i saw into the spiderverse and thought it was quite good and the reviews were excellent also so even though i have had it up to my  ears in superhero movies i decided to give this a go

and holy   what a  incredible movie i think it might be the best animated movie ive ever seen

what i loved about it was that they clearly made this movie for the fun and thrill of making movies everything was just endlessly creative and inventive from the incredibly dynamic art style to the witty dialogue and the cleverly plotted storyline that still made the whole multiverse concept feel fresh rather than beaten to death like it is in the mcu alreadyit must have been a tremendous joy to be involved in making that film and it was just as much a joy for me to watch it too

a very interesting choice to have the art at gwens apartment so secondary making the interaction between her and her dad become the greater point of emphasis i love how the colors ran during the latter part of the movie when she returned home like a symbol of how the structure of her life is starting to fall apart and remake itself somehow when a movie starts doing these little things behind the scenes to enhance the storytelling like that you know youve got a really amazing movie on your hands

and yes ill go ahead and say it its refreshing to see a movie with a black lead and a black family and have that be completely normalized and not be patting themselves on the back for having a diverse lead for their movie either its just nice to see

for real whats an animated movie thats better than this the lion king eh thats a movie for kids this is a movie for everybody goddamnit

the next movie i plan on seeing is mission impossible so thats going to be two movies in a row where the movie doesnt actually end lol",2023-07-24
"610

i liked where the story was heading but felt it was drawn out didnt know until the end that it was a cash grab cliffhanger movie so thats why it was drawn out i dont mind story that gets split but dont feel what we got in this part was satisfying enough what was the climax  the  chase scene where it showed how ridiculous the the other spidermen were

loved the cameo from all source materials but wish they did more than just one liners or background characters loved gwen and miles characters dont know if were suppose to sympathize with miguel but hes just annoying on screen peter b is still great id love a movie with peter b and may

beautiful movie but id just wait until next year and watch both movies at the same time",2023-06-02
"i have nothing against part 1 movies some of my favorite movies are just part one or two of three what i didnt like was how the end of this otherwise fantastic movie just completely negates any of the earned emotional payoff it was building towards yeah its cool how he built up the courage to finally tell someone hes spiderman but then it just doesnt matter i feel like they could have handled it being the first of two movies in a much cleaner way give him some emotional payoff and then the sequel hook dont go and fake out the audience like that its a little cruel and cheapens the whole ending of the movie for me especially after how well they handled gwen right before it

otherwise i think its a solid 45 a great sequel that builds on what made the original great with tons of fun dialogue references and character building moments its just such a shame that they had to structure the twoparter cliffhanger in this way compare it to say the empire strikes back or even the matrix reloaded both dont finish the story both obviously set up sequels they feel so much better realized in that department however they feel relatively respectful of the audience and give them something that surprises them but doesnt feel too cheap well maybe someone feels that way about reloaded but i remember liking that movies ending quite a bit in spite of the cliffhanger anyway

yeah its good also i dont really like the whole lol guess those people are not true fans for not knowing it was a twoparter vibe im getting from some of these comments some of you need to grow up",2023-06-02
"thought the movie was joking when it ended

its 180 minutes long and ends with a to be continued what feels like 20 minutes from the typical ending where a villain shoots a laser into the sky

roughly 100 minutes are the most cliche scenes imaginable of parent and kid struggling to connect repeated over and over

only real gripe was that it went on for like 20 minutes after the climax just to set up part 2 i knew it was part 1 of 2 so i just kept expecting credits any moment but it kept going but it was still good stuff even then

"semi coherent thoughts about miless character writing

i remember seeing the official poster for this months back and thinking cool but kind of a bummer that miless story always needs to share so much screen space with other spiderpeople except thats the biggest non issue because they keep using the multiverse as a fantastic narrative tool for miless character growth the first movie used all these spiderpeople to help miles become spiderman the second ones entering metanarrative territory wherein its using the history of spiderman as a character to explore what type of spiderman does miles get to be how much of an original can you be when there are versions out there whove lost entire universes for being too different which is in a way culminating into that old question of exactly how miserable does spiderman need to be the spiderpeople in this one are also not helping him realize his potential for the large part theyre in fact holding him back the space elevator chase i felt was a parallel to the leap of faith scene from the first one except this time he makes that jump for himself not for the mask — spiderman the characters narrative expectations are holding him back theyve already told this story so many times and you think you know the rest so how do you make miles stand out you maybe let him break the canon how exactly idk but beyond is definitely going there you let him spread his wings theres a blank page waiting on that guidance counselors desk back at visions academy and miles will return and fill it out himself",2023-06-05

"this is easily a top3 spidey movie of all time 

words cannot describe how good the animation is its stunning gorgeous sublime breathtaking and the story is so good  its fun but sprinkled with tragedy they put so much love into this film and it shows daniel pembertons score is even better which was already great in into the spiderverse this time around and its sooooo gooood also spidergwen rocks and my future wife hailee steinfeld kills it with her performance everybody had great performances actually i hope we get a spidergwen game like imsoniacs spidey one day

i read that there was a cliffhanger so as soon as miles escaped from miguel i thought that it was gonna end there so im grateful that they took the time to set up what was gonna come next

i loved this movie man best film of the year to me so far",2023-06-11

"i really loved this movie all the small details in the movie you could tell that they put a lot of effort in making this movie the animation is  tier and so is the writing small details such as the colour changes artstyle changes minor call backs to the previous movie like the joke about miles not knowing about comicon and i loved the whole indian spiderman thing 

the indian spiderman was really well done i thought it would be just for americans but i was amazed to see references that only south asians would get like the zomato board more like a in movie sponsorship ig being angry about chai tea and naan bread mentioning the british stealing things and the joke about indian gwen’s dad thanking miles as if he was helped him with moving things rather than saving his life no matter what you do south asian parents will always thank you like that lol",2023-06-12

i think miguel could have gotten miles on his side if he had let peter b talk to him from the start because when they were alone miles was almost convinced until the other spiders showed up i know miguel was trying to be sympathetic but  he just fails miserably at it,2023-06-17

i just realized that while miles  42 is approaching miles 1610 while hes strapped to the punching bag you can hear jjj on the news talking about the sinister 6 maybe even though this miles is the prowler he isnt really a bad guy with the other villains still being prominent im curious how the sinister 6 will play a role in the next movie i cant wait",2023-06-22

however i feel like the movie could have spent much longer on the cutting room floor scenes started to repeat a lot especially with miles family trouble which were already retreading the first movie 

a lot of the plot was set up for the next movie which made it quite tedious once it became obvious this is just part 1

honestly felt like they tried to cram a little too much in fantastic movie gorgeous art and cinematography but the audio was a bit cluttered at my theater did anyone else have trouble understanding gwen during the intro i could barely hear a thing almost looked like parts of the movie were the 3d roll as well maybe my theater just sucks,2023-06-02
"my personal positives and negatives for this movie

positives
fantastic visuals
good character development for miles and i liked getting more gwen backstory
miguel ohara was a really cool character and i want to know more about him i know hes kinda the villain but i really liked him a lot
very funny dialouge
any screen time with peter b parker is a treasure
spot guy was amazing and probably my favorite character and i love his 2d animated segments
lego spiderman

negatives
while the movie did have a long run time there honestly felt like way too much stuff packed into it there were several locations i wanted to see more of and take my time around it i felt like the spidey hq stuff could have been a majority of the second half i would have to explore that area and some of the characters a bit more
again while the visuals were stunning as usual it did get a bit overwhelming at times so it was hard to see what was going on i like spider punks newspapersketchy quality but it was a bit distracting that there were so many color flashes in scenes where it was just them talking 
same for gwens universe it kinda seemed like there were times where they didnt know what direction they wanted to go with it in the scenes where shes arguing with her father there were many shots where the entire color palette would change on a whim which looks cool in some shots but seemed unfocused in others
some of the action scenes needed to be tightened there was often so much happening on the screen with many different color effects that it was hard to follow what was going on also the editing seemed a bit weird in some places
not sure if it was my theaters fault but the voices were very low in some scenes especially the opening monolog also characters talked over each other a lot which made it hard to understand some jokes
finally this is just my own weird opinion but for a movie that heavily focuses on family and the struggles of parentingits kinda weird that peter b took his small baby into many life threatening situations and pregnant spider woman definitely should not have been in the field if she was that far along i know its a cartoon but still




maybe im just a killjoy or maybe i just need to see the movie againbut i did not enjoy this one as much as the last one i did like it i had fun watching the cameos and seeing the different art styles but overall it fell flat to me in many aspects",2023-06-02
ngl this felt really all over the place for me nowhere near as tight as the first,2023-06-02
"okay now that i let it sink in a bit i had several issues with this movie keep in mind the first movie is one of my most favorite movies of all time and basically my second favorite animated movie behind inside out

the first half suffered from serious pacing issues there was about 45 minutes of family drama followed by a 30 minute or so sequence in india where proper stakes of the movie still havnt been properly established and then another 20 minutes in the spider society before the movie really gets going i think the movie lacked focus and it makes for a lack of story structure i get this is a part 1 but you still need a beginning middle and end infinity war is a perfect example of giving you a movie that stands on its own and as a part 1 this movie gave us a beginning with bits and pieces of a middle and bits and pieces of an end kind of

this is gonna sound like absolute blasphemy but i also think the visuals and easter eggs were a little overindulgent it felt like the movie knew it was taking a while to get to the point so it spammed beautiful and colorful visuals and cameos at you to help ease the wait the first struck a balance of insane visuals but letting you sink your teeth into the story that i think this movie really lacked

the good a lot of the incredible visuals did work the voice acting and soundtrack were phenomenal miles remains an endearing character that i will root for every day of the week and i thoroughly enjoyed the meta message that spiderman stories should be allowed to divert from their canon and create something new didnt catch that until i came on reddit i will admit 

i still liked the movie but i am disappointed hoping part 2 elevates things a bit",2023-06-02
my mind was blown by how marvelsony beat dc to the punch the flash now has an almost identical story to this movie even down to if my loved one lives in your universe then i need to be a part of it i was so  on easter eggs in this film that by the time the story was laid out my head was missing,2023-06-02
super dissapointed about the ending why tf did they not advertise this was a part one of a series of movies the open ending was super unsatisfying especially since it was a great movie but at least let people know theyre paying for half a product like ,2023-06-02
"the ending kinda ruined it for me i loved everything until the end and the more i think about it and the worse it gets people have brought up infinity war or empire or dune and all those movies can stand on their own they gave some closure to certain arcs this just end midmovie its so baffling

i understand the script ran long but move pieces around once you decide to make 2 movies out of it so that part 1 can somehow stand on its own fast x pulled the same  and while that was a bad movie all around at least it had a set piece to finish the movie across the spiderverse didnt even give us that they even teased us with the new villains and the amazing punch by his uncle and then it ends there a superhero movie ending just before a fight  baffling man

it seems we are in the minority but i still dont get that its being praised so much more than the first one not only for the story but also the animation was a bit more coherent and restrained in the first while still being amazing and overthetop here it seems they have leaned a bit too much on the fever dream part still loved it though my main problem is the nonending",2023-06-02
anyone else think its no where near as gd as the first,2023-06-03
"i must have been in a bad mood

to start i could barely hear the voices for everything in the spider gwen universe so bad that i complained and the waiter guy dine in theater just said yeah a lot of people have been saying that dont worry wth 

everything after the intro and until the end of the miguel fight was excellent although the trope where everyone knows the big secret but refuses to tell the audience and main character and just force you to wait the entire movie is perhaps least favorite 

the twist was so predictable that i was very confused why they drew the reveal out so long they showed the universe he was going to in big flashy letters so it wasnt even a twist but then took like 20 minutes before his mom revealed it it felt like we were running out of movie to have a whole nother fight scene add on the fact that we got our checks normally given right before the end of the movie and suddenly i realized that the movie wasnt going to even have a conclusion i was disappointed by this so i just submitted and waited for it to end but then there were almost a dozen face zoom ins and music climaxes that i thought for sure was going to be the end started driving me up the wall by the end i was fuming 

i rewatch the first one regularly because of how tightly knit and cohesive of a movie it is this felt like a great movie that ended up being too long so they panicked and cut the last 45 minutes and replaced it with some very sloppy hacked together mess 

i look forward to the next one but i doubt ill ever look back fondly on this one",2023-06-04
way overhyped the movie was slow it dragged just so they could sell a third and then nonstop in moments lord and miller tried bringing that meta and humor from the lego movies but it doesn’t work here it takes the seriousness away though i loved the animation and shots it fell flat on actual story and character advancement,2023-06-05

"im going to get downvoted into oblivion but i disliked this movie  it was too long and bloated and filled with fan service they could have easily edited it down by 3045 minutes  theres so much exposition and setup for zero payoff  the cliff hanger ending was frustrating after sitting through all that dialogue  and now this movie has just setup another cinematic universe 

 i loved the first movie because it told a self contained story  this movie was just setting up more movies  if you cant tell a complete story in three hours youre doing it wrong  and yes my theater had the same audio issues as everyone else where you couldnt hear half the dialogue anyways  

the whole movie was a muddled garbled mess of swapping who they wanted the main character to be  if they wanted a spider gwen movie just make a spider gwen movie id have watched that  but the constant shuffle between gwen and miles just left the entire movie unfocused  

and on a personal note the  spider therapy scene was in bad taste and mocks something many of us who are either in or need therapy  it wasnt funny it was insulting",2023-06-05

"my favorite superhero movie of all time beating logan and dark knight it has so much heart this movie made miles leave the shadow of peter parker the character development he has makes it so he is the guy and you see that during the train confrontation with miguel

multiple art style was amazing especially with the emotional scene with gwenlooked like paint bleeding  on the canvas animators flexing since the start with the vulture scene the emotional beats were paid off in full and then some the diversity and culture in all the spidey was so awesome to see the music was so  good especially if you are a hiphop fan album drops tonight most of the jokes hit and were funny

oscar isaac ate every scene he was in his 2099 spidey felt genuine and menacing hailee and shameik emotional scene hit it out the park

the spot story were good and he actually felt like a real threat at the end and the animation they did with the inky tendrils really did it for me had 2 movies to develop miles relationship with his dad unlike uncle ben dying usually in the first 20minutes so when they reveal his fate it hit harder

forming the spidey team with gwen and the alternate universe without a spiderman and miles as prowler was interesting can’t wait to see it explored and how the fight or the resolution of that scene in the 3rd movie

the easter egg with spiderman ps4 being played by ganke every single cameo of spiderman ranging from comics to live action movies also the pay off if you are a spiderman fan that watched every single animated series mcu prowler easter egg loved playstation spidey easter egg wished he had lines and a role spectacular was awesome didn’t see 1990s spidey tas but saw the unlimited one think i saw a quick scene of the japanese spidey wanted to see a symbiote spidey or superior wish they all had more involvement but the current line up that was mainly used were good enough spider punk and miles were  cool 

criticism would be that there wasn’t enough it’s only part 1 of 2 so it’s valid but the story was already so stuffed that i was satisfied
i didn’t see how they coulda top the first movie but they did now i don’t know how they are gonna beat this movie

love how much focus on miles and his parents’ relationship we got as well as gwen and her dad the inclusion of tobey andrew and the mcu stuff… and the video game stuff everything was just perfect for me

movie really felt like a comic book brought to life and i love that they had the actual comics that certain storylines and events were borrowed from the easter egg video for this is going to be so fun to watch

metro soundtrack not only lives up to the original but surpasses it that ending scene with gwen putting her own team together and heading into the portal… goosebumps

one subtle thing i liked about this movie was how miles and his nonspidey life could meet in the middle with the college conversations about miles’ struggles with feeling like he belongs in academia i thought that this was a very clever and modern way to approach the problem of bridging the two sides together in a movie full of amazing set pieces i loved the college counselor scenes the most,2023-06-02

"i doubt ill be in the minority with this but i  loved this movie

x200b

first of all its difficult ot overstate just how visually gorgeous it is i was hoping to see it in 3d but either they didnt format it for 3d or they werent offering it in my area san diego which would be weird either way just in standard the art and graphics were stunning id recommend watching it for that alone

x200b

the story itself was cohesive solid and engaging i wasnt bored a single minute i was in the theater there was practically no fluff and the pacing was better than ive seen in superhero movies in a while 

x200b

i dont think the original soundtrack for this one was as good as the first which is why i think it was used less than the first one was but thats just my opinion and it was still good 

x200b

was cool to hear daniel kaluuya speak in something close to his actual accent in a movie for once lol and his character was the lowkey mvp of the film hoping he makes an appearance in beyond

x200b

all in all i have nothing bad to say about this film maybe i will after some reflection nd nitpicking but for now easy 1010 and i dont just throw those around on my amateur ratings either this was honestly a good film and i cannot recommend it enough easily the most fun ive had in a theater thus far this year",2023-06-02

"can we just talk about how beautifully the family dynamics are portrayed in this film 

miles’s balcony scene with his mom and gwen’s resolution scene with her dad to me these were at the heart of the movie

really nice stuff with peter as a father too 

gwen’s dad talking about “this parenting stuff is a big mystery” that line felt like a real wonderful underpinning for how parenting functions in this film",2023-06-03
easily one of the best sequels i’ve seen didn’t quite reach the heights of into the spiderverse for me but was still great loved the arcs for miles and gwen and spot is a great villain was a bit bummed that peter b was sidelined and sometimes all the amazing visuals could get a bit overwhelming but as far as “part 1” movies go it was great and a worthy sequel even if it didn’t emotionally resonate with me the same way the first movie did the leap of faith sequence is still one of my all times faves,2023-06-03
miles immorales was a great reveal,2023-06-03
i feel horrible for miles in a way all the friends he made from the other universes betrayed him they all knew the truth and kept it from him and not only went along with miguels plan for a while but didnt do much to back him up they just stood there during his intervention or at least thats probably how he sees it im glad gwen rounded up some likeminded spiders to try and do the right thing but my heart broke when miles broke the tether that gwen threw when she tried to catch him a metaphor for broken trust,2023-06-03

"just realized something after seeing the movie last night

the gohome machine it scans anomalies and sends them back to their correct universe here it sends miles to the wrong universe because he was bit by a spider from a different universe but the machine is able to correctly identify entities which were not bit by a spider so should it have been able to scan miles and detect that he was from earth 1606 instead of 42 maybe there’s a special exception for spiderpeople where it prioritizes the spider which bit them

not sure if anyone has thought of this i’m sure someone else has but it would be pretty funny if miles got sent to the wrong universe because whoever coded the machine forgot to check for the one in a trillion edge case that could never realistically happen until it did that’s peak software engineering",2023-06-04
"beautiful animation the scene with miles fleeing from all the other spiderpeople was the highlight for me all the action and jokes thrown into that scene were nuts

x200b

i prefer the first movie though  i think the miles story takes just a little too long to get going in this one and there was a little too much focus on his family drama  we dont learn about the canon events plot until a little bit into the second hour which is where the movie really takes off until it grinds to a halt in the last 15 minutes for the sake of sequel setup",2023-06-04
"absolutely loved the movie except for the sound our cinema sounded like it was
recorded in mono with all sound coming from the centre front channel couldn’t hear a lot of the dialogue and it sounded tinlike and echoey this was in a dolby atmos vmax cinema",2023-06-05
"i really enjoyed this for the most part the animation was absolutely stunning the first movie looks amazing but i  think the animators somehow managed to make the visuals for this movie look even greater i really enjoyed getting to actually see more dimensions since the first movie was pretty much confined to miles’s dimension i liked the way the first movie experimented with different animation styles but i think this movie blew the first one out of the water in that regard i also enjoyed the characters a great deal i liked that gwen was sort of a coprotagonist alongside miles i think miles’s actions drive a lot of the plot but the character arc and development was really more focused on gwen this time around gwen reconciling with her father was one of my favorite scenes in the whole movie hopefully we’ll get some good resolution on miles defining what it means to be spiderman on his own terms in the next movie 

if i had to give one criticism for the movie i think it felt like an incomplete story i don’t think cliffhangers are a bad thing but the second half of this movie very much felt like setup for the next movie it doesn’t really stand on its own as a relatively emotionally complete package i think how well this movie will hold up very much depends on how well the third movie turns out",2023-06-05
"its a very good movie but i am going to mention a few criticisms

as amazing as the visuals are a few too many cuts and its hard to focus a bit in many scenes i wish i could pause this movie and just admire it

a bit too much happening they already introduced spot as the big bad then theres miguel and then again at the end they introduce yet another one

overall i think the previous one is a better movie but cant wait to watch this again",2023-06-05
"this is a very good movie with masterclass animation i thought  in boots would have the best animation in a movie i’ve seen for a long time but this outdid it the two hour run time felt short too


one thing i will add that doesn’t have to do with the movie itself is that i need to stop seeing anything marvel on opening weekend aside from not being a huge fan of crowds these movies bring out all the people with zero theater etiquette which theater etiquette is usually as simple as “sit down and be quiet” obviously you can react to jokes and stuff or just whisper little quips you have to your friends but i was next to a group where someone was flat out responding to lines using their phone laughing during obviously serious moments in the movie and just in general not being respectful of the people around them unless you’re like 10 or under it shouldn’t be hard to just watch the movie and react when everyone else does",2023-06-05

"my favorite part of the movie is that it is not another villain of the week plot as almost all superhero movies are it has the spot and it even makes a few jokes about him being a “villain of the week” but the plot isn’t really about him as he is just a small part of a much larger story

i feel that ever since batman 1989 almost every comic book  superhero movie has had a villain centric plot batman ‘89 with the joker batman returns with penguin and catwoman batman forever with two face and the riddler batman  robin with mr freeze and poison ivy raimi spiderman with green goblin spiderman 2 with doc ock spiderman 3 with hobgoblin sandman and venom all of the mcu and dceu movies and even the nolan and reeves batman movies follow this same formula spiderman into the spiderverse does with the kingpin as well

the only comic book movies i can think of that don’t fall into this trap are the xmen movies as they tend to focus more on the social commentary about mutants and humans trying to coexist together although they still sometimes follow this formula as well eg xmen apocalypse

it was just so refreshing to see a comic book movie deviate from this formula and deliver a unique and thematic story that didn’t revolve around a villain trying to get revenge or take over  destroy the world

and don’t get me wrong i still enjoy a story that is villain centric if done well avengers infinity war was amazing and is almost entirely about the villain but the formula has gotten tired and stale over the decades and i loved that this movie decided to take a risk and do something different",2023-06-05
does anybody know the song that’s playing after miles gets grounded when he is in his room,2023-06-06
"my theory about how the next film will handle the canon events issue

its already been heavily foreshadowed twice in ats  

so the main thing is that canon events must happen otherwise the structure of the spiderverse will collapse and therefore erase a universe or incursion  but with that said weve seen events gotten prevented twice with the inclusion of multiple spiderpersons helping out  the helicopter save in spidergwens universe and holding up of a building in mubahattan  of course it showed that multiple spiderpeople came to fix the hole that threatened to swallow up the universe  but that is the point  

what do spiders build  websthey build the web they write the storynot the other way around  miguel is so concerned about the shape of the web he isnt thinking how he could build a new one a stronger one  obviously he cannot do it alonehe hasnt been doing it alone  but looking at how the spiderpeople had helped with saving people from death in the two events by combining the webs and building something stronger than a helicopter or a an entire science building whos to say that they cannot use their abilities to build a stronger web for the spiderverse  if there is a weakness in the web because of a lack of a canon event then we just need more spiders to build webs to hold that part together",2023-06-07

question at the end of into the spiderverse gwen calls out to miles that scene was mirrored in across the spiderverse but miles is wearing different clothes listening to something different as well are they supposed to be the same scene,2023-06-08
anyone else catch the joke about miles being in the horse was it a reference to the first ever recorded ‘movie’ or am i tripping,2023-06-08
"there is so much to talk about with such a fantastic film and a lot has already been said here but i will add this
 
a plot twist i think would be insane to see is if peter parker is like some sort of evil genius in universe 42 and the prowler miles is actually a hero we are missing so much context around prowler and uncle aaron and i can’t help but think it’s for a reason… maybe i’m asking for too much but am i alone in thinking that would absolutely sick",2023-06-08
i gasp so hard when gwen open miles mint condition figurine ,2023-06-08

love how similar to spiderman 2 that starts and ends on a shot of mary jane this starts and ends on gwen stacy though also love that unlike spiderman 2 she bookends it with narration and the drum theme,2023-06-08

very “james bond  like” ending credits which was cool when the movie is already fully animated,2023-06-11
"loved it as well so much heart awesome fight and action animation beautiful art style and its wild how they mix so much different art styles and abstract backgrounds and it just works because the whole thing is like one moving comicbook that cliffhanger ending was painful man but  what a setup   

loved the mumbaihattan world fun concept loved all the action scenes with the spot they mustve  had so much fun choreographing all those portal attacksgag and it felt like you could barely keep up with the zaniness",2023-06-11
"will def need to watch it again but

i cannot believe they actually roger rabitted andrew garfield and donald glover into this like when i watched no way home i was like how are they ever gonna top this well they did something alright",2023-06-11
im glad that they didnt have the insomniac spiderman chasing miles considering he has his own miles,2023-06-11
i liked the subtle moment where miguel it looks like is going to bite the italian vulture and he looks menacing and almost evil for a few frames than the helicopter shows up and he goes right back to trying to act like normal spider man something is up with that guy and he’s not letting everyone know what’s really going on,2023-06-11
"i have some questions does every spidey in the spider society know about their future canon events if so are they just sitting around waiting for those events to happen kind of out of character for them if the usual time theory is correct not actively participating in the canon events should also alter the timeline which sounds risky this brings me to my next question

if cap morales is supposed to die he should die regardless of miles being there as long as no other spidermen interferes the event eg captain singhs event in every other canon event the respective spidermen have actively participated in trying to save the victims why was miles being stopped from saving his dad",2023-06-11
this movie is a work of art and a masterpiece ,2023-06-11
"what a phenomenal film 

spoilers for logan 2017

i was dreading that miles confession to his mom revealing himself to being spiderman was paralleled to xaviers when he shares with logan feeling like he didnt deserve the most perfect night ive had in a very long time and then the clone of logan kills him

it was a really tense moment that dragged in a phenomenal filmmaking way when the parallel clicked for me and miles kept on talking i was so scared for him and kept looking over his shoulder waiting for him to get attacked through the window",2023-06-12
at first i didnt like that they merged liveaction and animated stuff together it kind of broke my immersion a bit but when i thought about it a little bit more it was a natural extension of mixing these multiple styles together nice way of making people think that a spiderverse story is happening right now in another universe and its in a animated form like each universe of the spiderverse is its own animated style so ours would be an live action one,2023-06-13
"just watched it a second time today with my nephew he loved it and wont stop quoting spiderpunk

i noticed more things to appreciate in this movie and dislike a bit compared to the first

in the first theres more static scenes that hold on a scene while this one is quite full and active thats not a bad thing since it was just absolutely amazing

compared to the first movie this one has more onscreen action and personality for my eyes a bit too much to look around at

the music seemed louder too first time watching i didnt have a problem hearing the characters talking but this time i felt like i could barely hear what was said but my nephew had no problems 

i had a greater appreciation for the villains in this movie

spot really came off as a victim i mean he is he lost so much because of the spiderverse and he hasnt even hurt anyone

miguel was badass and seemed different he cant wall crawl can he i noticed he wallcrawled with his claws instead of sticking to things

the end villain reveals were intimidating scarier than compared to their counterparts

im stoked for a third film",2023-06-15
was alone on this in my theater but i absolutely cracked up at the jeff koons balloon dog getting destroyed,2023-06-15
how are the peter parkers okay with miguel o haras plans,2023-06-16
"i’ll be honest i didn’t like the first miles movie it felt nonsensical and the typical self discovery movie also didn’t really appreciate the art at that point in time

but this one i rewatched 2x in the cinema blown away by the sequence and artwork

spot is a very powerful villain and it’s so satisfying to see his growth into something more than just a villain of the week

personally spot might be the most strongest villain in marvel history and it will be so satisfying to see miles grow into someone that will kick his ",2023-06-17

"so just rewatched it with the improved audio that sony sent to theaters and it definitely helped with hearing gwen in the beginning and spiderpunk overall 

loved this movie just as much the second time around the animation is just so  good",2023-06-17
was miguel wrong in his reasoning i know he is portrayed as a villain but if letting miles’ dad die saves the universe doesnt that mean that miguel is doing the right thing by stopping miles,2023-06-18
watched it for the second time yesterday and  it was even better noticed a lot of things that i didnt the first time,2023-06-19
"i cant wait for nik cage for the third movie

absolutely loved this movie really good very emotional and good soundtrack also i loved it has its own identity and didnt fall back on the first movie great alltime movie sequels",2023-06-19
"when gwen steals scarlet spiders watch and crushes it in her hand shes visibly confirming her rejection of the spider society and miguels indoctrination

she still has a long way to go to repair the damage she did to her friendship with miles and to his heart but at least shes started

and though i understand that miles has every reason to be furious with her i hope he eventually sees how genuinely she desires to make things right with him calls to mind the last of us part 2 when ellie tells joel that she doesnt think she can ever forgive him but would like to try",2023-06-20
did anyone think the spidermen were a little out of charcter spiderman is a character that saves everyone he can and always finds a way to do so or try seeing the spidermen being willing to let people die for the sake of being a canon event was odd,2023-06-22
loved it,2023-06-22
are there multiple versions of this film ive seen across the spiderverse multiple times and noticed a few things for one there seemed to be improperly rendered models of the main characters in some scenes there was an instance where there appeared to be guidelines surrounding miguels head during his first appearance in the spider society building some on twitter have also noticed that lylas actions in one scene are different depending on where and when the film was viewed are there other oddities supporting the two film theory,2023-06-22

i also loved the concept of mumbattan and the brooklyn bridge design from it",2023-06-25
"that movie was phenomenal never been so tempted to buy a ticket for a 2nd showing to see what i missed lost track of the amount of spidies i recognized

did not think they could make a sequel as good as the first one because it was that good but holy  they pulled it off gorgeous across the board",2023-06-26
i just got out of my theater this has to have been the most serious super hero movie ive ever seen i was constantly tearing up at the dialogue and being amazed by the visuals,2023-06-27
i absolutely loved this movie like a 1010… until the end it just kinda ended it was building up to this big conclusion all movie and then it just ends without any resolution i know they’re saving it for the third but i felt a little burned that the main plot of the film didn’t resolve,2023-06-27
they apparently couldnt find a way to translate shoot so in the german version there was like five minutes of gwen and miles just standing around saying  over and over and i love it,2023-06-27
i was sort of bored the whole time idk why i loved the first one,2023-07-01
rewatched it today i am literally obsessed with that movie it’s amazing,2023-07-01
"miles saved 5 spiderpeoples lives saved them from glitching out of existence and how did 3 of them repay him

shunned him lied to him told him to let his father die and 2 of them  1 his mentor 1 the girl he loves  then joined an army to chase him down and lock him up gwen even had the cheek to look jeff in the eye with miles and rio present while she was ready to  him to death

even if gwen peter and peni did believe miles was an anomaly the bloody least they owed him was telling him the truth

so yes i badly badly hope miles reconciles with gwen peter b and peni and yes i feel downright awful for what gwens been through and im so glad that shes finally figured out how badly shes hurt miles and has started to make things right again but even then i also want miles to give them all a good piece of his mind before they do make up",2023-07-03

"i think people have said plenty it is an amazing movie if they finish with the last movie on top there is a great contender for best movie trilogy

i know i am one of the last people to the party but holy  i audibly screamed when the credits rolled i did not know it was ending i was so enthralled i didnt even realize how much time had passed i thought there was another hour of the movie left oh my  what a  perfect first part,2023-08-22
although the movie had some cool moments it  failed to catch my attention like its predecessor i was disappointed in it and i liked the first movie better,2023-09-08
"this is very much a minority opinion so i just want to connect with a few people here who might have had the same qualms with the movie as me 

from a technical and audiovisual standpoint this movie is absolutely mindblowing every frame is gorgeous and the sheer level of technical and artistic skill on display is staggering and that alone sets this movie mileshehe ahead of anything else in the comic book genre and thats what will keep me coming back to this film  spoilers ahead

but i do think there is one huge aspect that soured the experience for me the fact that this is half a movie maybe i was a bit aloof to some of the promotional material of the film but i had no clue that this is was supposed to be the part 1 of 2 movies i really wish i had known this was the case so that i would then have been able to better with the movie conscious that things wouldnt be resolved but fundamentally i dont think this needed to be split up into two movies especially in the way that it was done its 2023 and the movie industry is no stranger to twoparter films but such twoparters usually come at the end of a series of films ala marvels infinity war and endgame the last two harry potter films and even the mindless fast and furious films while each of these have been successful to varying degrees my position is that they as such earn the twoparter by creating blockbuster after blockbuster movie that fleshes out the universe that they are creating to a good degree before diving into the twoparter but this is absolutely not the case with the movie i feel like the second movie in this spiderverse series should have been a complete chapter that put our characters through new trials and tribulations but also resolved them and closed out most loops by the end much the way the first filmwhich is an absolute masterpiece imo did instead i found the movie to be extremely unsatisfying to the point that it reduced my enjoyment of what came before 

this halfamovie syndrome is what most affected my enjoyment of the film but aggravated a few other aspects that i did not like as much aside from the beautiful hearttoheart between miles and his mother early on it sort of became clear retroactively that scenes were being dragged on with the kind of quippy humour we associate with lord and miller productions to pad the runtime later on just as the spot becomes a formidable villain he suddenly disappears so that now more than halfway through this movie the spiderpeople society can be introduced and quickly revealed to be new antagonists to miles spiderman in the last few minutes there is the amazing reveal that miles is in an alternate universe captured by a prowler version of himself which while interesting happens too late to meaningfully contribute to this story leaving all the good stuff with regard to this scenario for the next film because of all this it felt unsatisfying this is surprising because even when franchises do opt for twoparters there is some semblance of chapterwise breakdown of the overall story that makes each half amazing but this movie spends so much time delaying its actual plot and introduces new antagonists later and later into its runtime that it ultimately only promises the next great film instead of being one while all the above has to do with miles i found gwens arc weirdly disappointing in that her fathers reversal from wanting to arrest her at the beginning to turning in his badge was not adequately explored and i do feel they should have spent more time there establishing how that reversal came about as we see gwen rounding out her ragtag team of spiderpeople at the end instead of feeling like this was a tightknit team that had each others back and will pose a considerable challenge to miles foes it did not sit well with me the great characters we see in into the spiderverse are only revisited at the very end here which seems like a lost opportunity to have had a few scenes with them early on in this movie as well so that we see them interact with each other and get the sense that the closing teamup is earned 

because i was surprised how little i enjoyed the overall story of the film i went back to the first film to understand if it was really the same but instead the first one is equally beautifully animated and scored and importantly wellpaced and plotted with amazing character interactions a lot of which while funny never become the kind of nonstop quippy mess that much of the first half of this second movie reduces to 

but clearly most people have enjoyed this film more than the original so most do not share my opinion of the film so maybe i just did not vibe with my first viewing of this movie i will try watching it again at a later date and i hope that it ends up being more enjoyable before the next movie comes out though because i am still excited for it hopeful that all these unfinished storylines will be fantastically concluded",2023-06-08
"just walked out collection of random thoughts

my eyes hurt like literal physical pain about the halfway mark i knew it was going to be bad and i had to start closing them for 1020 seconds every now and then im prone to eye strain and this was brutal

visually its the most remarkable movie maybe  ever its also dialed to 11 basically the entire time and thats a lot

this feels like a spidergwen movie maybe more than a miles morales movie she has the more interesting storyline miless often feels redundant to the prior entry and also to other spiderman films shes a smarter and more interesting character and her powerset isnt absurd miles is basically the guy from the infamous video game series spiderman and also insert invisible superhero here it feels like hes a walking cheat code a lot of the time

the imagination and creativity on display is just mindbending every few minutes something else that brought a smile to my face and then something even more amazing would happen and then they would top it a few minutes later trex spiderman bollywood manhattan awesome

miguel ohara isnt a spiderman is he they allude to that when they say he isnt funny and spiderman is supposed to be funny im guessing that hes a manspider and the injections are to keep him from turning i would have liked to have seen more from him because i totally identified with his frustration theyre trying to save worlds and people are bringing children with them going offmission and doing random  and acting like little jackasses

i really really wish theyd made miles 17 instead of 15 he is too young for the way hes behaving the storylines theyre giving him  everything him being on the cusp of turning 18 and struggling with the transition to college would make so much more sense for that whats your future hold academic advisor meeting and make the romance and rebellion storylines feel a bit more organic this was a bit of an issue in the first one but its a lot here there are a few points where he says im not a kid  yeah you  are you totally are a child a fifteen year old is a freshman in high school my son is a freshman in high school he and all his classmates are children

imagine for a moment that they cut the gwen stacey intro and instead gave us a kaleidoscopic 60 second flashback during the scene when she reveals that she knew what would happen to miless parents it would have hid her motivation from the audience cut 15 minutes off a running time that could use some trimming gotten rid of some pointless action sequences camouflaged the miguel reveal until he lowers down on that slowmoving throne thing and we would have lost nothing it would have also made it feel more like miless film though maybe they dont mean for it to be

we could have used a lot fewer scenes of angst with miles and his parents so many repetitive angst moments jfc

the reveal that miles is in the wrong universe was telegraphed from the beginning and i still didnt see it coming what a moment  awesome the cliffhanger worked like gangbusters for me  perhaps in part because my eyes couldnt take anymore

i cannot praise the character design and look of the worlds enough phenomenal chefs kiss the prowler and uncle aaron at the end are a study in lighting and color and framing to create menace in familiar nonworldshatteringdiscoball environs the chase scene with the spidermen is simply one of the most astounding unbelievable film sequences of all time

so i wasnt the hugest fan of the naw im gonna do my own thing in the first film and i could have done without them bringing that line back  it feels flippant given what the character had just learned frantic desperation seems like it would suit the mood better

i saw a trailer for an indiana jones film starring harrison ford and a superhero movie with michael keaton as batman before across the spiderverse im twelve again",2023-06-03
"i think i get what the canon means it means in spidey life at least theres 2 tragedy the loss of the loved one by getting killed loss and the loss of another loved ones by their battle against the enemy sacrifice   
in tobey its his uncle getting shot loss and harry getting stabbed sacrifice

in garfield its gwen loss and capt stacy sacrifice against lizard

in tom i think its may loss and mj sacrifice what is getting forgotten if not living death this is debatable nonetheless maybe soon in spiderman 4can tony sacrifice count nahhh not sure bout that

in miles its his uncle aaron death loss and someone close to him sacrificing his lives his dad his mom gwen peter b spot redemption ganke ",2023-06-02
"i usually dont like when movies plan for a sequel but in this case it works im going to watch into the spiderverse across the spiderverse and then beyond the spiderverse backtobacktoback

also i kind of want to bang miles mom",2023-06-12
"am i the only one who didnt like this movie

the visuals were amazing sounds were so on point but anything else
in terms of narrative and story what did it tell they mesmerized us with flawless animations yet they seem like nothing to tell

if it was a couple of short movies that had little connection between them i could like it i believe i just watched a 35hourlong trailer which makes no sense at all 

dont we all know to be a spiderman that requires great sacrifices dont we know spiderman tries to catch their life but couldnt because of the villains on their roads dont we know to learn changing the timeline could cause bad things what did this movie give me

i dont accept it is the first part of the series that doesnt give the right of being a video that introduces a bunch of characters in fancy animations

many scenes dont fit in with the entire movie why did i watch the university conflicts between miles and his family does that contribute to the movie
 the spot was a desperate person who tried to steal an atm from a market and 5 minutes later he became a nemesis of spider man how come just how did you change your ultimate goal to rob a market to becoming a villain by just jumping across a few streets 
why the  didnt miles become invisible while being chased by all the other spiderman the movie showed that the invisibility of miles doesnt trigger the spidersense of gwen 
how logical to webbing to stopslow down a collapsing building and try to save people there must be many casualties yet no one talks about them except the young girl and the sheriff they saved 
what is the reasonscience or what ever behind of atom collider with spot if he needs an energy only why did he used that

all these make me unable to believe the world they created and cant make me love the movie i wonder your thoughts and challenge you to make me believe i am wrong",2023-06-06
"the plot was too meta for my liking instead of a spiderman movie we got a movie about spider men spidermenning ifkwim 

too many repeated family drama  could have done less of those scenes miles’ problem felt like nothing burger and was unable to feel sympathetic oh your parents don’t want you to go to princeton what a sad life 

oh you want to come out as spiderman to your parents what a tragedy

compare miles’ problems with what happened to spot bro literally  up spot’s life and kept joking about it and didn’t realise what a tragedy that was 

spot was a fun tragic character but they didn’t give him the seriousness it deserved while they kept showing the family problems of miles’ as if that is the worst thing that could happen in the spider universe",2023-06-06
"anyone else felt like this was originally supposed to be a disney limited series each segment was roughly 20 minutes long and felt like a bunch of smaller stories within a larger framework

edit since people seem to think i’m downing the movie and not just pointing out how it’s structured 

ep 1 catching up with gwen and seeing her backstory  
ep 2 catching up with miles  
ep 3 miles and gwen catch up in new york  
ep 4 miles follows gwen into mumbatten  
ep 5 gwen takes miles into the spider verse… lobby miles escapes  
ep 6 miles ends up in the wrong universe gwen reconciles with her dad then assembles the team  

each segment is roughly 1520 minutes long 

just like a tv show 

and they each have a well defined beginning middle and end

it’s not bad it’s just different from the typical three act structure of most movies",2023-06-06
the ending was very unsatisfying idc if it’s a two parter give some sort of conclusion like infinity war did,2023-06-02
what the actual fck how is hollywood getting away with this bs 2part film without advertising it before hand as a multipart cinematic experience cutting off the story right as it was getting to act 3 so anticlimactic i cant express how furious i am at this,2023-06-03
"overall i liked it but for a spiderverse movie i was a little put off by their disinterest in honouring the past

spectacular spiderman …gets 1 line of dialogue

scarlet spider …is a complete joke

spiderman ‘67 …breaks his back

spiderman unlimited …no lines

hopefully the next movie expands on some of this as i have a tough time believing every version of spiderman from every spiderman cartoon would go along with the “predestination” thing  for the record i think 2099 is right over miles but peter especially spectacular is such an optimist i feel he’d act the same as miles i didn’t like every version of peter acting like 2099’s chumps i’m glad they portrayed peter b parker as conflicted and showed that he actually watched the death of a world or else it would have bordered on character assassination

i really like miles but you don’t need to beat down every version of peter to prop him up

it was a great movie for miles and gwen though in fact i thought the stuff between gwen and captain stacy was what hit the hardest emotionally

also i’m uncomfortable that peter is taking his toddler to fights and that jessica drew is doing deadly motorcycle stuns pregnant that kinda stuff lowers the stakes and makes it all seem goofy the different tones the movie takes on is like an emotional whiplash laugh cry laugh cry

i did love how they incorporated all the liveaction stuff though donald glover and scenes like the asm 90 scene are what this needed more of i think i’ll like the next one better with the fullspider team back

animation was spectacular ha as always",2023-06-02
"
	art style was obviously turned up to eleven and luckily it worked i think the mixed art styles helped with that by adding some variety but even the studio montage was so  pretty
	on that note shout out to regal for having red ghosting around the top of white objects really added to the effects… in all seriousness though it wasn’t noticeable once everything else got rolling so i didn’t really care because everything else looked so  good 
	i liked the “incomplete drawn “ buildings instead of construction infrastructure on the background skyline 
	in the same vein the spot had construction lines showing idk what those are actually called until he “leveled up” they were still sometimes visible once was upgraded so maybe that shows he still has a final evolution form
	miguel also had construction lines showing maybe he’s due for another transformation
	speaking of miguel it wasn’t that surprising that he turned out to be an antagonist considering his suit actually had a skull on it but there wasn’t like a big reveal he was going to be the antagonist as if to shock us so it wasn’t annoying it was a slow ramp up so it worked 
	for a middle part in a trilogy the story was good i dig the “canon” plot device works perfectly with a multiverse concept excited to see how they resolve it in the third half my prediction is something to do with miles creating a “new canon” 
	if they don’t  the third one up this will be the best super hero trilogy of all time please be nice rraimimemes
	i’m sure most people will do a better job pointing out the references than i will so i’ll just say the lego world would have made me roll my eyes if the writers didn’t have that connection so they get a pass and donald glover cameo gets a pass because i love him 
	 it was so beautiful i know i already said that but i just wanted to say again
	hyundai product placements were jarring and  was that a metaphor for captitalism too that product placements are  also i like how bk went out of their way to food dye a burger irl and it doesn’t even match the off color burger they had in the movie 
	edit forgot to mention i thought of while in the theaters i liked that they didn’t subtitle the spanish lines i didn’t understand most of them as a monolingual but it worked because it felt like “yeah only bilinguals will get this” and that’s the point 


way to go sony animation you did a good job please don’t  the third one up and maybe can we get some 1431 scenes for imax",2023-06-02
"man everyone is so in love with this movie i feel like a wet blanket thinking it was incredibly disappointing

fwiw the animation was beautiful loved the different world styles like renaissance sketch vulture spiderpunk etc and there were a lot of fun characters looking at hobie and the spot here i dont want to diminish the amazing work the artists put in this film

but

it was so dense and cluttered with
 convolutedyetuninteresting plot points
 too many characters with their own arcs who the movie didnt actually have room to develop
 too much highconcept moral debates that didnt feel grounded in actual tangible events in the story
 too much meta stuff that feels tonally dissonant from what the first movie was like
 too much escalated emotional tension that was so intense but went by too fast to fully land
 disasters like in pavitr prabhakars universe that felt like they should have worldshaking fallout wrt the breaking canon stuff but there wasnt enough time to actually see the consequences
 a villain who the story seemed to revolve around without enough interaction and screen presence midway through to keep him feeling relevant despite being one of the most interesting and engaging characters in the movie
 honestly boring fanservice referencing other movies because mcu corporate culture has infected everything and media can no longer stop being a snake eating its own tail
 a twist at the end that sidelined the entire story again with evil miles feeling like he belonged in a separate movie with a separate story
 a to be continued that didnt need to happen if they just cut out the million complications that derailed the movie in the first place

i dunno it was a neat movie but once they started talking about canon events i just started to check out a bit reminded me of the homestuck sequel i felt bad for all the little kids watching the movie who would have no earthly idea what was going on halfway through except that miguel was mean

i dunno im happy for the people who enjoyed this one but for me too many things dragged it down",2023-06-05
"ima post my own review lol l im a comic fan and really enjoyed the 1st one but this felt painfully average  a 510 in my book is a average film this was a 610 just good it was a popcorn movie similar to the fast movies



this movie makes no sense once it passes to dimensions hopping

pros
the 1st 45 minutes are great gwen stuff  miles pre universe jumping

visuals 1010

music solid

spot was good

cameos were good

cons
we treating spiderman like a drone now mf peter parker is now letting people die because of fate now if your gonna argue well it was actually miguel  they still followed him

no other iterations of miles are anywhere in the film which makes no sense since ps4 peter is here

the pacing after miles jump is terrible

if this is youre 1st time seeing miguel im sorry this iteration is terrible if you like him good for you but as a comic fan this was embarrassing

the jokes are needed because its a spiderman film but most didnt land it genuinely felt like children humor which was pretty disappointing because the 1st film was great even though its jokes didnt work for me they felt more natural this time around no one in my theater laughed at most of the jokes

replace miguel with superior and i couldve bought his aggression twords miles
 
i could probably add more but if someone ask i will elaborate",2023-06-05
was a great movie until that ending and it drags it down overall for me it’s a great set up and will work great once part 2 comes out but there is no climax to the movie after the spidermen fight it’s all set up miguel is definitely going to be miles rival not the hole guy but i hope prowler miles is evil and they don’t pull some bs out of their  where it was a misunderstanding it should of gone the dune 1 route where they still have the climactic fight but have another major event to end the movie on,2023-06-02
nicolas cage is bacc baby ,2023-06-02
"oscar isaac was outstanding as miguel ohara  the anger despair frustration with miles in their last scene together was visceral

also great timing releasing this on pride month  so many will relate to the difficulty of coming out to their family and the fear of what will happen if they do",2023-06-03
"mixed thoughts on this one absolutely beautiful film with some incredible moments and accompanied by an amazing soundtrack but doesnt live up to the original for me

the 1st was one of my favourite films ever but unfortunately it feels like theyve  the pacing by splitting the film into 2 parts i still enjoyed it but it felt too meta and too all over the place to flesh out anything at all in the story quite exhausting imoa few new interesting characters were introduced but character building was poor and mostly consisted of them injecting witty one liners into random scenes hence why it feels like the film relies on the more interesting characters from the first filmand are we really supposed to believe miles managed to escape from thousands of spidermans spidermen who also have much more experience than him plot armour seemed just a little too strong

best parts of it for me was when the story slowed down and kept it in miles morales universe i loved watching the dynamic between miles and his parents and gwens interactions with them

its a shame they didnt let this sequel stand on its own two feet like the 1st film and instead relies too much on the 3rd film coming i dont mind there being a part 2 but it needed a proper conclusion and it couldve done it whilst still leaving it on a cliffhanger for the 3rd

also did anyone else think the dialogue was too quiet at the start of the film audio was weird and who else noticed his roommate playing the spiderman game haha",2023-06-04
im really interested to see how they handle prowler miles it would be an interesting juxtaposition between miles being raised by his father and miles being raised by his uncle im intrigued to see where it goes,2023-06-15
"amazing movie from the compassionate parenting themes token minority themes capitalismanarchy forging your own path and not letting society tell you where you belong and what you can do 

they broke so many superhero and story writing “rules” and it all lead up to miles breaking canon plot which was meta genius 

the writers introduced new types of morals and messages perfectly wrapped up in a funny emotional and action packed ride 

can’t wait for part 2",2023-06-21
"just saw the film and it exceeded my expectations by a country mile what a masterpiece best film of the year for me

it was so good it took everything that worked for the first one and injected steroids into it

the twists were refreshing and got me hooked the entire film",2023-06-02
i needed more pav in this movie he was hilarious,2023-06-02
"saw it loved it might be the best animated film of the year and we have a miyazaki film coming this year too

couple of things

the guidance counselor was ms weber

why miles parents want to ground him he gets great grades isnt in trouble with the cops or does drugs hes a teenager of course hes late and shifty 

we got spidercat but i want spidercorgi

but yeah terrific picture",2023-06-02
loved donald glover’s cameo,2023-06-02
loved the use of different art styles between gwens world utilizing pastels and the whole rain web swinging sequence at the end of the movie,2023-06-02
"i wasn’t expecting the extended intro to be from gwen’s perspective but i really enjoyed it her teaming up with 2099 and drew was super cool i didn’t think i was going to like the romantic subplot between her and miles coming in but i really liked it by the end

spider punk got the most consistent laughs out of me so many good one liners i watched nope for the first time last night so i’ve seen two banger daniel kaluuya performances in a row",2023-06-02
i had a great time the animation blew me away just like last time and even though it isn’t as complete of a movie as the first one i just know that when beyond the spiderverse comes out it will complete one of the best superhero trilogies of all time,2023-06-02
"looking back it was so obvious that miles was going to go to earth42 instead of his earth… the machine even explicitly said it

yet i missed every single hint both obvious and subtle and the reveal took me by complete surprise

side note peter parkedcar was my biggest laugh in a movie theater in years do we think he is the spiderman from the “cars” universe",2023-06-02
one thing i noticed but am unsure of is that gwen has her captain dying canon event with her dad because he “dies” in a sense when he quits the force maybe i’m over analyzing,2023-06-02

"watched it yesterday as it was released a day earlier  in india 


this movie blows the 1st one out of the park in animation story character development humor and emotional weight be it any department it has surpassed its predecessor


the ending was kind of unexpected but now im actually eager for the future projects",2023-06-02
spiderverse is what film is about easily one of the best movies of all time in my opinion it goes beyond animation this is art,2023-06-02
i didn’t think daniel pemberton could top his ‘into’ score but i think he might have gwen’s theme is absolutely incredible unique perfectly suited to the character and equally as good as miles’s miguel’s theme is so looming and ominous and comes in like a barreling freight train and oh my  the title score even though it’s shorter than the first just put a massive smile on my face in the theatre honestly just listening to it hammers home the darker tone of this one compared to the first one i only wish the mix in my theatre was better to appreciate it more but a repeat viewing perhaps in imax might do the trick,2023-06-02
is donald glover’s aaron davis supposed to be the one from the mcu,2023-06-02
best marvel ip related movie in a really long time i will be rewatching many many times,2023-06-02
i love how real miles world felt small details like the liveloveaap poster or his roommates son poster were so cool the donald glover cameo was so fking cool as well considering he is the insipiration for miles was awesome,2023-06-02
movie was great overall but the audio mix was awful it seems like there was missing sound effects and the dialogue was so quiet,2023-06-02
"accidentally wrote this in the review thread because i thought it was the same thing lol so i’m posting here too

when the “to be continued” popped up i legitimately thought it was a fake out not in a bad way but because i was enjoying the movie so much i couldn’t believe it had already been over 2 hours

as somebody who went to see the first one in theaters 5 times i was blown away with how good the sequel was this had all the vibes of an animated spidey cartoon i grew up watching with the story and visual effects on a whole other level seeing all the different animation styles in dolby was a  experience",2023-06-02

"every so often i’m pretty sure i had a tear rolling down my cheek just from the sheer beauty of this film the animation the voiceacting oscar isaac was incredible the soundtrack the narrative the expanding universe and the characters  as close to perfect as that sequel could get deserves to break tradition and get a place in the best film category at the oscars

also i think a lot of people are disappointed with the way it ended because they didn’t know it was a part one in the early stages it was marketed as ‘part one’ but it seems like they took that away and decided to call part two ‘beyond the spiderverse’",2023-06-02

spiderpunk looks like he hangs out in salt lake city beats up rednecks and has a buddy named  bob who has a irrational fear of needles,2023-06-02
great movie cant wait for the next one one weird thing that stood out for me  miles dad at one point is wearing a shirt that has the police shield on it and underneath it says nyps but in into the spiderverse the police department is pdny that seems like a very strange continuity mistake in a movie which pays so much mind to its prequel,2023-06-02
"if this movie was titled spiderman spiderverse of madness i would not even complain because it did the multiverse waaaaaaaaaaay better than dr strange

always good to see a comic book accurate spdr  


hello peter parkedcar  


the conflict was so good i was rooting for all sides even the spot  


  
starting the movie by spoiling the literal ending was badass i was expecting to see what i heard and i was not expecting what i saw at all  


again that  ending dude

insomniac’s spiderman on genki’s tv is a “they thought of everything” detail  the whole plot of across the spiderverse hinges on miles being an anomaly  insomniac’s spiderman has its own miles morales story making our miles not unique but having it be canonically fiction inside of our mile’s universe closes that plot hole,2023-06-02

when i was was in high school my mom and i would go to barnes and noble and i’d always read comics and graphic novels while she browsed this movie recaptured that for me crazy premise tons of cool characters and beats compelling cliffhanger i loved how it had editor notes like some comics too spiderverse 1 and 2 feel like perfect comic book movies to me was so hyped to see noir at the end i’ll probably have to catch this again before it leaves theaters,2023-06-02
they should cast sofia coppola in the sequel and have a family reunion with cage and schwartzman,2023-06-02
the cliffhanger plot twist in this one is truly a rival to infinity war i started noticing the eeriness when miles’ mom moved out of the door frame and you can clearly see the water color background,2023-06-02
just saw it and thought it was amazing i really cant wait until i get the 4k bd and can watch it again,2023-06-02
"fastest 2 and a half hours of my life i swear until i heard the soundtrack building up to the cliffhanger at the end i didnt notice how long the movie had been going 

i get that the cliffhanger could have felt too abrupt for some folks the other well regarded setup movies two towers empire infinity war all had obvious climax points and a stable ending that set up the sequel spiderverse is a comic book movie though and leans into its source material a lot the to be continued is like it was pulled straight from the pages it worked for me even though i forgot it was a part 1 going in 

i couldnt help but laugh though since i had just watched fast x last week hahah how many of these are we going to get this year",2023-06-02
"this might be the most visually appealing movie ive ever seen it is actually a big artistic step up from into the spiderverse

"i will fight everyone here when i say this is probably the best spiderman film to date theres so much going for this movie and i dont think i can emphasize how much i loved this movie but i will put down some tiny things i enjoyed

spiderpunk had a small role but his actions managed to impact the entire movie a part of me was afraid they were gonna do the whole love triangle thing with him miles and gwen but nope dude is for real the coolest character in the movie and he walks the walks when it comes to being a full on punk hobie for real saw through miguels bs and said nah and dipped

hearing josh keaton again as spectacular spiderman was a small thing but i was extremely happy that he made a cameo appearance in the movie and that he was given some attention i may be too hopeful but maybe this could lead to a comeback idk

spot is such a terrifying villain and i dont need to explain that any further he for real went from a comical villain to a full blown nightmare within minutes and jason schwartzman did a fantastic job playing him

do i really need to mention the groundbreaking animation or the amazing pun intended writing no i dont

everything is canon mcu venom donald glover as prowler ps4 spider man bro i have to stop here because thats probably still the most unbelievable part of spider verse and why it works so well

the reveal that miles was never supposed to be spiderman threw me out of a loop and im shocked that i didnt pick up or thought about that before i saw the movie hearing miguel tear into him about how miles himself is a walking talking anomaly tug at my heart but as the first movie proven anyone can wear the mask which leads to my final point

miles morales as the prowler i dont need to say much more than that but i might theorize that this alone proves that miguel might be wrong about the canon events that aside im so hyped that the og spiderverse gang is back heck im even more happy that the sequel is right around the corner its next year but its still better than waiting five years lol

overall go see this movie i saw it yesterday and let me tell you every single spider man fan will love this movie

1010 see you guys in march 2024",2023-06-02
genuinely a stunning leap for animated movies it was serious but hilarious at the same time beautifully animated and using the multiverse as a tool to experiment with different unique art styles which was genius just a wonderful beautiful amazing movie gwen’s universe in particular with watercolor designs that would change according to her mood was a particular touch i loved and the editor’s notes and split screens scattered throughout the movie really called back to the comic book vibe just a brilliant movie that i hope will serve as an example for what animation can do as a medium and it shows why saying “it’s just a kid’s movie” shouldn’t be an excuse anymore,2023-06-02

i am ok with ending a movie on a cliffhanger however i think in a movie you should have a clear beginning and end to most of the plot as opposed to a tv series where multiple storylines are left hanging i feel it would have felt more like a finished chapter if the perspective was completely gwens,2023-06-02
" ya’ll weren’t kidding about that ending being abrupt but all and all a solid 1010 from me honestly it’s everything a movie sequel should strive to be

now i’ve said it once and i’ll say it again if beyond the spiderverse manages to stick to the landingand honestly at this rate i would be shocked if it didn’t then we honestly are looking at the greatest trilogy in not just animation but in cinema as a whole

so please for the love of  be a stellar follow up beyond the spider verse and go out on a high note

"what an amazing movie from the opening scenes with gwen the animation is on a tier by itself when she walks into her place and she is literally a shade of blue and then the colors are almost water color shifting with the tone of the conversation 

and then to have a total 180 on multiple antagonists the spot starts as a random goofball who you don’t take serious to quite literally one of the scariest villains i’ve seen in a movie in a while just absolute terror and malice and the artwork when he goes completely black was just sinister and then hobie being a person you want to hate because implications between gwen and him and weird love triangle energy but he ends up being just a fantastic character who you can’t help but love 

the movie is also extremely funny especially in the mumbattan section but also the very real parents conversations that were spliced into the movie perfectly 

but my favorite bits were just miles being resilient especially on the train section even feelings betrayed by all his friends just chefs kiss absolutely awesome movie probably going to see it again",2023-06-03
"feel like this movie is what dr strange wanted to be but 100x better 

killer sound track va animation

while the to be continued ending is a bit annoying the turn around time is less than a year and from a plot perspective its in a great position 

only issue was the sound mix i could barely hear gwen at parts as well as spiderpunk

those disappointed in no climax truly just want to watch another run of the mill mcu movie the movie spends so much more time than your avg mcu movie on character drama and imo it all lands i hope more super hero movies go towards a character focus more than  cgi  mcu likes to do the opposite these days but hopefully they learn",2023-06-03

holy  i had goosebumps when he became an actual threat in the middle of the movie he already has the perfect presentation as a villain his powers and theme are amazing i hope the sequel will have more of him and maybe learn more about his motivations

also didnt expect the amount of live action here yeah it was only a couple but still more than i expected",2023-06-03
"in this movie spiderman 2099 tells miles that if it weren’t for him the spiderman of his universe would not have died he says it was his fault his spiderman died

so i went back and watched the first movie again but i don’t see how that statement is true i don’t think miles’ involvement made any difference to spiderman’s death at all spiderman only stopped to save him when there was a lull in the fighting then green goblin held spiderman’s head into the beam shooting out of kingpin’s machine which then exploded and injured spiderman kingpin then goes to the injured spiderman and kills him

i don’t see how miles in any way caused spiderman’s death at the very least if that statement was not a lie then the first movie did not do a good job showing it",2023-06-03

seeing peter b as a father was a wholesome and warming experience i hope those marvel editors take note instead ruining the character in the comics gwen universe was greatly adapted same vibes as the comic one spot was funny until he got  real with the power up visuals were outstanding as usual and ohara man he was scary af even more feral than comics and i loved it

"man i was a little worried this wouldnt live up to the original but i think it matched it easily though the ending is gonna be a sore spot i am at least immensly hyped

i dont need to talk more about the visuals those speak for themselves the film is gorgeous so many shots where i think thatd be an amazing wallpaper background lots of different styles too i love that they drew spiderpeople from across mediums even if it leant mostly on animateddrawn styles

i think the thematic throughfare was great but also needs the second part to wrap it up nicely

if the first film was about miles getting to grips with what he wants to be then i guess this one is about him proving he can be that person his mom talking about how her little boy has grown into a man contrasted by how characters call him boy or kid and how he doesnt like that

theres the whole thing with how miguel calls him out for how hes not supposed to be spiderman which is like what his parents were saying about if he left brooklyn he has to assert himself that he does belong it really is a film about branching out i suppose as well

the spot even fits into this everyone treats him as a joke at first but his motive is to literally prove himself as a threat and make miles pay for what he did to him and of course the irony that miles only did that because of what he did to miles its all circular

and i think itll come through in the next part but fighting fate the prowler miles at the end was such a sick reveal when it said miles teleported to universe 42 i thought there was going to be a bit where hes in the wrong universe but when uncle arren appeared oh man thats such a sick reveal  again its why it hurts so much that weve gotta wait for the next part

also i was dreaming of a scene where all the previous spiderpeople come back for an epic rescue or cavalry charge and were going to get it oh my  im so happy i just hope that miles saves his dad in the next one itd be sad to lose him i wonder if prowler miles is going to be a recurring force in the next one or just a oneanddone

also wondering if itll get really meta i kinda hope not honestly meta is fun in small doses also why is miguel a vampire is he a vampire i didnt really get that",2023-06-04

"really fantastic movie will be going to see this one again saw it on a huge screen and glad i did my favourite things

1 the animation duh its beautiful but the variation is jawdropping this is what good art direction is instead of pumping out cgi  every 3 months with zero identity that every character has a clear identity through how theyre animated contineus to be wonderful

2 the soundtrack was fantastic im really hoping that alone gets an oscar because it was soooo brilliant and did a great job of accentuating all the emotional beats the music and animation in the scene where miles speaks to his dad with the flowing plastic roof wow that was worth the admission alone

3 i had it in the back of my head that this was a twoparter because beyond the spiderverse has been known about still wasnt 100 sure it was gonna be a cliffhanger ending what they managed to do really well though was tie a nice bow around gwens emotional arc with her dad as it starts and ends the film i think narratively they made all the right choices to guide us to knowing this first part was her story about miles and that the next film will be miles i was also impressed with how the ending sort of kept approaching after gwen has the bit with her dad it feels like the film is gonna end after every other shot but they keep ratcheting the tension up its a great way to keep us wanting more because enough new storylines are established for a second part to be justified

all in all this is one of the best superhero films ive ever seen and once beyond the spiderverse comes out im sure this trilogy will be the best superhero film series ever",2023-06-04
the cinematography was beautiful every frame was a work of art,2023-06-04
was there a reference to everything everywhere all at once in the scene where gwen leaves the tracker in miless universe i saw a billboard with a bagel and writing that seemed to be a play on the title but i didnt catch it quick enough,2023-06-04
"i remember seeing articles months ago saying nicolas cage wouldn’t be voicing spider noir in this movie and i’m assuming that’s because he only makes a brief appearance at the end with no voice lines

does this mean  come back for beyond the spiderverse",2023-06-04
"what an increidlbe film  ill need a rewatch but i think this might be the best looking animated film ive ever seen  its just beautiful

x200b

huge fan of the movie taking its time to tell its story  theres a good 30 minutes of just characters interacting with each other before we even get to the spiderverse and even when we are there they do more character development   i was very into it

x200b

the to be continued doesnt bother me that much because if its on the same quality as this film i might say its the best animated trilogy to date  its that good

x200b

my biggest issue is the sound mixing like a lot of people have mentioned here  not sure if it was intentional or just bad  but there were a few scenes where i just couldnt understand a  thing because i couldnt hear them over the music  the beginning every scene with punk spiderman a shame too gwen and miles swinging through the city and i think 2 or 3 scenes with the spot were just very hard to understand what was being said",2023-06-05
"just got back from seeing this some spoilery thoughts 
  
1 i see at least one movie a week at my local theater most times i either have the whole theater to myself or share it with maybe a handful of others tonight the showing i went to was sold out so i had to go to a later one and even that was packed 
2 i had only just seen the first one earlier today ahead of plans to go see this i enjoyed the first but this was even better sort of like portal vs portal 2 this felt far more fleshed out of the concept established in the first one
2 the whole theater collectively groaned when to be continued showed up on the screen i think thats actually a testament to how good the movie was i certainly wanted it to keep going and didnt feel it had overstayed its welcome 
3 miguel was right and miles was being emotionallyreactionary and selfish i get that kind of response and i bet that others had it as well including gwen when told of their role in the fabric of time and such and what the sacrifice meant but they all seemed to accept and make peace with it rather than risk the entirety of the multiverse for one person a line repeated more than once in the movie im sure of course that miles will end up saving both as he said but its a big risk and it makes sense for the entire spiderverse to go after him to save their own individual original worlds as opposed to help him that part especially the end with gwens group seems hard for me to grasp",2023-06-05
"this is a follow up to a previous comment analyzing the characters questions and moral questions of the film a bit there are a couple more incredible story and visual details i wanted to bring up and encourage some discussion on ive seen the film four times now i have a problem

pavitr

the film makes sure to note how new pavitr is to being spiderman hes only six months in and he claims that being spiderman is sooooo easy something we know is absolutely not true hes given his implied first playbook spiderman challenge when saving civilians from the collapsing alchemax building while holding onto a bus filled with people including his love interest he sees that inspector singh is in mortal danger and tells himself that he can do both he can save everyone this directly mirrors miless current situation as well as miless current attitude however pavitr isnt the main protagonist of the story we can see that he cant do both while reassuring himself he can do both he begins to wrap the single thread of web suspending the bus full of people onto one of the small concrete grid rods sticking out of the collapsed bridge hes hanging onto he cant save everyone miles had to intervene for everyone to be saved miless intervention is mirrored by gwen and her bands intervention in helping miles in the next film however pavitrs dimension collapsing could foreshadow that the bands help wont actually address and resolve the moral problem presented to note pavitr was spared the pain of losing inspector singh but he was also denied this opportunity to grow he wasnt challenged to forge ahead in the face of the death of someone close to him

george stacy

aside all the current analysis on george stacys role in proving that canon can be subverted as well as gwens coming out character arc to her father theres a parallel between george and miles that i dont see anyone talking about one of the core themes of across the spiderverse is responsibilities specifically conflicting responsibilities the moral dilemma george stacy does not only possess responsibility as a father but he possesses responsibility as a cop when gwen is revealed to be spiderwoman to him his two responsibilities are immediately made incompatible with one another hes forced into a position to choose one responsibility over another he chooses to be a father over being a cop this further plays into another theme in the film you cant have it all in george stacys little monologue police captain is interchangeable with spiderman the mask is the badge and vice versa miles is in a position now where with the information given to him and us the audience his responsibility as spiderman is in conflict with his responsibility as a son he may ultimately have to make a choice to uphold one responsibility and abandon the other we want gwen stacy to come out on top so having george quit the responsibility of police captain is great for her and for us but having miles quite the responsibility of being spiderman is a much more morally challenging choice

clearing up jeff daviss role in prowler miles  miles42s life

ive been seeing some debate online on whether miles42s dad had been absent from his upbringing or whether he had died recently similarly to the timeline of uncle aarons death when the camera follows miles1610 around his earth42 home variant the family photos only contain him and his mom when the camera follows gwen around miless earth1610 home variant the family photos contain all three members of the davismorales family both characters are used as tour guides to subtly inform the audience that jeff has been dead for most of miles42s life and wasnt a large part of his upbringing not a recent death

peter b parker

i absolutely love peters monologue to miles about good things and bad things happening his message to miles is a much more emotionally touching and charitable version of the current status quo of what it means to be spiderman the message highlights that there will always be bad things that happen you cant always stop them from happening you probably often cant stop them from happening but you have to take the good with the bad you have to find a reason to keep going rest in power uncle aaron you have to make a reason to keep going struggling and fighting more and more against the bad actively prevents you from finding that good and those reasons trying to shut down the all the harm and all the pain now furiously and stubbornly creates more harm by shutting down the good you couldve fostered in healing and moving on a much better version of miguels point peter is a more optimistic and emotionally charitable version of miguel in reiterating this point and approach on spiderman as a character and this compassion encouraged miles to begin processing this point of view however the watchs beeper prevented us from getting to see miles begin to seriously consider this approach

miless strength

miles speech to his earth42 variant of his mom was incredible the line i know how strong i am now has beat me with an emotional stick during each of my four viewings to go through exactly what his mom foreshadowed he would go through and to come out with an experience that validates his identity and his claim to the spiderman mantle of power is the kind of selfdiscovery that inspires us to be strong assertive independent and charitable to ourselves but heres the thing miless strength hasnt faced the ultimate test yet he hasnt yet come face to face with the death of his dad and the destruction of his universe his immediate and current moral decision is to still risk the safety of everything else and everyone else to rescue his father see pavitr he thinks he can save everyone he thinks he can have it all he doesnt actually know how strong he is yet

miles being a unique spiderman

ive seen a lot of sentiment that because miles is a unique spiderman he is or should be exempt from the rules of canon  miles isnt actually all that unique though  hes unique in the sense that hes the main character so were meant to empathize with him and focus on the differences between his journey as spiderman from the journeys of other spiderpeople  however showing us an absolutely ton of spiderpeople in spidersociety isnt just fanservice  we get so many different costumes color schemes bodytypes voicesaccents and artstyles between the spiderpeople that its difficult to find any two that look nearly identical in any scene where we see the spidersociety  each spiderperson is unique the same way miles is they each have their own stories and their own aesthetic  i think the writers deliberately chose to highlight how unique each spiderperson is as well as highlight how they are all still the same because of the common narrative threads between all their stories  despite how unique any of the spiderpeople are their experiences have broadly given them the same moral lessons",2023-06-05
"the opening action scene gave me feelings that took me back to early mcu days  it was just so satisfying  the music and action struck the nerve just perfectly in a way i havent felt in theaters in a long time  i didnt feel like i was watching a rehash of something id seen over and over again and while the movie itself was great the soundtrack really took it to another level 

it was just fun all the way through and it took itself seriously even with all the meta humor  and every character was well fleshed out and brought something positive  there were no wasted scenes  and it perfectly balanced being family friendly while primarily targeting adults

best time ive had in a theatre in a long time",2023-06-05
"idk if im just a complete idiot but ive had something on my mind since i walked out of the theatre a few days ago

so miguel explains that every spider man has a canon event where they all experience a great tragedy and this includes miles but later says miles is an anomaly and he was never supposed to be spider man

so do the canon events create themselves any time someone is bitten by the spider or does miles have a canon event because the spider that bit him was destined to bite someone and it just got the wrong person because i feel like miles shouldnt have a canon event because him becoming spider man wasnt supposed to be canon according to miguel

am i just being an idiot did i miss something is there a comic explanation that im not understanding",2023-06-05
"i loved it but not as much as the first one or spiderman 2 its really hard to judge the story though as its only half done thank  beyond is coming in march

 the animation is incredible ive never seen anything like it they found the absolutely perfect balance of all the competing styles and mediums so that it never felt messy if itsv was a game changer for western animation then atsv throws the game out the window and builds three completely new ones to replace it

 the action scenes and swinging scenes too are a huge improvement over the first

 the ending felt very back to the futureesque miles trapped in the wrong universe hobie leaving a watch for gwen even the tbc tag

 i like how the spiderverse includes not only its own multiverse but the mcu films sony films comics video games merch and animated series as well it feels like a very eeao take on this concept

 speaking of which weird that theres two multiverse movies that hinge on a bagel

 i have mixed feelings on the spider society i find it really hard to buy into the idea that every spiderman in the multiverse except miles would accept this predestination shtick especially when the last spiderman movie was about a spiderman trying to change the fates of dead villains its also weird that this seems to be the only miles on the team when theres so many mileses in the multiverse heck insomniac spiderman shows up and he has a miles as a protégé 

 since the release of the first game insomniac spiderman has met the comics spiderman in a comic book multiverse adventure and met the animated spidermans in a cinematic multiverse adventure do you think they will address this at all in any way in spiderman 2

 the sound mixing was really bad gwens narration and hobies dialogue were unintelligible at times",2023-06-05
"i absolutely loved this movie and ill be seeing it again really soon gwens universe was spectacular and her story was perfectly written

that said and im sure this was intentional but i was constantly frustrated with how she treated miles throughout the movie i kept waiting for her to stick up for miles and be a good friend be the only one thats there for him but ill have to wait for the third movie for that and honestly i dont know if she deserves miles shell save him and  forgive her assuming she doesnt sacrifice herself her dynamic with miles was tropey in this movie and that disappointed me otherwise i loved it",2023-06-05
that opening sequence with gwen was amazing,2023-06-05
my only complaint is that miles saving captain singh disrupts a “canon event” but that wouldn’t have happened if the spot hadn’t arrived and destroyed the alchemax building but they mention the spot isn’t canon,2023-06-05

i had a hard time with the first half of the movie it just kind of felt like sensory overload too many people talking at the same time loud music and  flying everywhere not to mention the amazing use of color in the film i’ve never had an experience like that watching a movie once we got to spiderverse hq i got better and i throughly enjoyed it i know i’m not even close to the majority i feel bad because i recognize just how amazing this movie is this is a movie i think everyone should go see but at the same time i don’t know how to feel about it because of my experience,2023-06-06
"my favorite part was the 6 year old sat next to me who couldn’t sit still and wouldn’t shut up

other that that the music and animation was amazing but i prefer the first one for story",2023-06-06
"no point in picking sides miguels goal was the same yet diff to kingping trying to change history by intentionally taking or placing its multiverse counterpart but he fails to notice that miles being the anomaly has a lot unknowns and possibilities miles is the byproduct of an event which already rewrited history if the canon algorithm stated miles shouldnt exist it already contradicted itself with miless earth working fine miles cant save uncle aaron but he can save his dad as history is up for grabs

tldr the canon algorithm is flawed and miles has the choice of saving his dad without the collaspe of the multiverse he only needs to save his dad since the multiverse is already adapting to this new miles",2023-06-07
ok so i love how this whole theme of destiny affects both characters miles and the spot both of those characters feel like they dont have a choice but to be whatever society defines them to be spot the villain and miles the hero they both take follow their paths unwillingly spot doesnt actually want to be a villain and miles doesnt want to be peter parker specifically its such a cool lens,2023-06-07

i get that hes different and all but theres literally no way anyone could escape that many spiderpeople at once with zero help theyre all as skilled or much more than he is it just doesnt make sense to me   
that scene bothered a lot other than that amazing movie",2023-06-07
"i feel like this runs into some of the same problems that loki ran into where theyre saying they have to protect the universes from multiverse interference but a lot of those events that theyre trying to protect are the direct result of multiverse interference

like they were saying that the mumbattan canon event was the bridge falling on the captain but the only reason that bridge even fell was because someone from a different universe made it fall so without multiversal interference then the captain wouldnt have died anyways",2023-06-07

mahershala ali will have been in a whole spiderman trilogy before blade comes out  prob before it even starts filming,2023-06-08
one thing that i find interesting about this world building is that earth42 directly contradicts miguels assertion that these events must happen or the universe will end or like with spot creating another hole in the multiverse miguel insists its because miles messed with that universes canon but its obvious that that hole there is specifically because spot blew a hole in the multiverse what happened to miguel is i think what was described in doctor strange multiverse of madness and considering how many elements were used from the mcu here i dont think thats a coincidence miguel doesnt realize it but his presence in that universe specifically caused an incursion but he wont accept it i think the next film is going to be about miles closing out his arc of course but also miguel coming to understand that his actions have not always been right and condemning an infinite number of spider people to tragic backstories makes him a monster,2023-06-09
"i thought the movie was really really good but the only issue i had was howeasily it seemed miles got away from all the spidermen 

like he basically beat hundreds of spidermen including miguelpretty much by himself and maybe a little bit of help at the end just made them all seem pretty weak in comparison to miles",2023-06-10
lemme know if im totally off base but could lyla be a villain shes the one who calculates whats a canon event or not and miles even points out how weird that is whos to say shes not manipulating things just to keep producing the type of spidermen that sustain their community,2023-06-10

the only constructive criticism i have is they could have finished miles story up in the conversation with his mother where he realizes hes in the wrong dimension still have gwen assemble the band at the end and give some plausible 42 is dangerous it doesnt have a spiderman they could have saved 42miles and 42aaron for some act 1 suspense and thrill in beyond and tightened the story a bit

also i dont understand how her explanation of her spider senses told her to go to miles school holds up being that miles wasnt bitten yet and per miguel wasnt even supposed to get bitten
something just doesnt add up and it bugs me because they seem to have been pretty meticulous about putting the plot together in this movie and i think its a pretty significant hole if its not addressed",2023-08-27

"after considering the movie for a bit and looking at different opinions i think i’ve come to recognize my own that said it might get refined with another viewing

overall 810 i liked the first one better as it was a whole story

pros

•	⁠animation was beautiful
•	⁠acting was great
•	⁠plot and drama were gripping personally i know some people thought it was slowboring
•	⁠hobie best boy
•	⁠action scenes were very fun

cons

•	⁠ended very abruptly i would have preferred even ending at the point where miles realizes he was sent to the wrong dimension maybe add the gwen spider team
•	⁠they rehashed the lizard peter thing twice once in the first movie recap and a fuller backstory for gwen i think they could have kiboshed the first movie recap at the start
•	⁠audio mixing at the start gwen’s monologue was wonky

hot takes all the comic nerds predicting that miguel isn’t a real spiderman has a made up backstory and will be a secret vampire villain are dumb

we saw that our peter was with him when his universe got messed up and making his whole trolley problem schtick just an act would undermine all the themes they worked to build up in this movie would they say miles isn’t a real spiderman because he has slightly different powers so he has to be a different character altogether

if i turn out to be wrong then so be it

also

•	⁠yes the spider people realizing that sacrifices may need to happen is ok and within character see the first movie where everyone tells miles that they all lost someone but that made them who they are “the hardest part of this job is that you can’t always save everyone”",2023-06-02

"i was so happy that my theater got a new sound system or maybe they just turned it up the mix was terrible i had so many moments where i just couldnt understand  was being said like tenet bad there is that one sequence right before the titles i swear sounds like gwen is having a  or i was in the theater

the movie is visually unrivaled its beautiful but its all mostly forgetable outside of that but maybe the first one was to in many ways i dont remember miles getting invisibility but i do remember lots of bits of plot and the general vibe here its all over the place and mostly fan service

the villian in this is fun and interesting but the way they set him up and then just completely ignore him for the rest of the movie is just not a good look miles having a friend who knows his identity but is not really a friend is weird when his whole schtick is that he cant tell people his identity and has no friends his obessesion with gwen and her obsession back is weird and creepy its not played up as love its like an endless hover hand over the shoulder the parents dont seem like characters anymore they feel like theyre there to just move miles from scene to scene the whole fact that all spider folks basically know and have access to all of time is kind of world breaking and makes the whole plot feel dumb the ultimately ending where it did was incredibly anticlimatic

reviews for this are way too generous",2023-06-04
i thought this was a boring movie too childish for me but then again it is a kids movie the girl next to me fell asleep i never saw spidey and his amazing friends but this is what i imagined that to be the showing was packed with kids and adults but all you heard was children laughter my own fault for expecting anything more,2023-06-05

i’m very conflicted because it genuinely ruined the experience for me but i know when the next is out it’ll probably be amazing combined 

ultimately i can’t support this decision it feels like a greed move to not end with any conclusion no bonus scene and not indicator to the viewer that what they’re in for is half a product 

my entire theatre was having an audible blast and when those credits hit it was an noticeable mood  and everyone left annoyed or  clearly they did testing and knew they’d get this reaction",2023-06-11
 this movie was so multiversal even i made a cameo my name is jonathan and i look exactly like dr johnathan ohnn before the spots,2023-06-02
"im kinda surprised to see such high numbers in the poll so far i was pretty let down by this movie now ill admit i hadnt seen the first one until just last night so it was still super fresh in my mind but i dont think this one held a candle to that one at all it was very slow and i wasnt at all surprised to see the to be continued at the end because it felt like the entire movie was just prelude and buildup that never paid off the pacing was very weird with lots of slow dramatic scenes a few tense scenes mixed in and then no real payoff and a lot of the dramatic scenes started to feel repetitive they had very clearly made the point about the conflict between being spiderman and hiding it from your family by the halfway point but then they kept hammering it over and over again

im assuming the climax was supposed to be the giant spiderman chase but i didnt even realize it at the time because i kept expecting it to actually go somewhere with the main villain afterwards instead we had to be reminded that he even exists at the end of the movie because he just vanished for two days and the movie was only two hours long but it felt way longer i had to keep resisting the urge to check the time and see how long id been sitting there not to say i was bored but i wasnt edge of my seat either and my friends kids that came with us were definitely getting fidgety long before that point the older one said she was kinda confused by the end too and i can definitely see how the plot would be a bit confusing for kids",2023-06-03
halfway through kinda boring ngl,2023-06-03
"the first one was a 1010 for me truly so inventive both visually and storytelling wise

second one is a 810

overall story wise i didn’t find it as fresh as the first i didn’t find the villains to be as menacing or interesting as the prowler or kingpin in the first one the spot felt like comedic relief and miguel felt like a character that feels too familiar spot felt like he was quickly forgotten midway and then the movie focuses on miguel the spiderverse canon doppelgänger multiverse shinangans and by the time it comes back to spot arriving in mile’s universe  everything left for part 2 feels like a forgone conclusion impending big marvel battlewar that i don’t necessarily feel invested in

i didn’t like the live action fan service it just felt inelegant and unnecessary for some reason

the standout overall for me was gwen’s universe both visually and story wise

on an unrelated note  did anyone else find the coming out scenes very  coded",2023-06-03
"man i think im multiversed out this movie feels like a rick and morty episode council of mortys spidermen included how many multiverse stories have we gotten in the past few years theres  been loki into the spiderverse dr stange 2 no way home eeaao  it almost seems trite at this point

i think there was a point in the movie where they even reference this someone says something like the fate of the multiverse is at stake and someone else retorts something like i dont even know what that means anymore

moreover i think its constant meta references uncut a lot of the sincere emotional core of the movie it may have well as lego spiderman for how much it delights in referencing other properties

i still loved the movie but i think it goes from a 1010 to a 910 for me just because im burnt out on multiverses",2023-06-03
"very  the eyes and the dialogue was sometimes hard to hear the ending 

good movie tho fun references fun cameos

75",2023-06-05
"good movie but really hard to get me emotionally invested in it same problems with the first one i guess theyre trying to appeal to children with the constant jokes straight after an emotional scene which is kind of kills the vibe of the scene

nitpicks
 a pregnant superhero really
 taking care of a baby while fighting 
 using said baby to make someone less angry in a conversation 
overweight spiderman really how can they do backflips and web around when theyre starring on my 600lb life  
 peter parker saying random  stuff to say that he was inspired by miles to have a kid really may be i need to watch the first movie again because i dont havent the slightest recollection of that ever being happeningor being implied 
 the whole spidersociety tf one scene they show some spiderman holding guns and marching like theyre soldiers what arent yall litteraly spiderman why are you guys marching 
 villains lack depth unsurprisingly its a superhero movie are not interesting hopefully spiderman 2099 gets more development in the future movie 
 weird dialogue at times when spiderman 2099 is chasing miles on the train and out of nowhere miles starts his monologue  my name is miles morales i was a bitten by a radioactive spider  blah blah blah why why are you saying these words miles i litteraly started laughing at loud at the absurdity of it all 
 unnecessary tension build up for scenes that when you look back on eas completely unnecessary when miles is seeing gwen go to the indian spiderman dimension  was the point of miles being invisible and taking a moment to decide 
characters dont make sense or evil miles morales knocking out good miles morales dor some reason or the uncle punching him for some reason character decisions dont make sense 
the  cameos oh my soul the cameos i dont care if its donald glover of toby maguire please lets get back to the movie but other people adore it so eh
 goofy at times which kills the immersion kung fu panda 2 had tbe perfect amount of gofyness but still made me ball my eyes out
 scenes are weirdly built up miless uncle starts playing music for some reason i feel like a lot of emphasis is placed on aesthetic if the scene instead of a scene naturally flowing out between the characters again killing my immersion
 building fake tension in a scene when there is no tension
 story is a mess at times which is probably because of the above mentioned factors
 also spiderman 2099 said that stopping a cannon event breaks the universe which we were shown to be a true statement now miles has zero idea how to stop his father dying and even if he does its going to  everyone in his universe he has zero plans on how to stop that too so his rebellion against spiderman 2099 makes zero sense i really hoped they dont put in some  plot device that lets miles save his dad and his universe 


other than that gwens story was nice but loved her scenes with miles even more miles scenes with his family were also ten out of ten these two were the highlight of the movie animation was great too so was the music",2023-06-05
"im ready for the down votes but unfortunately i found across the spiderverse underwhelming its not at all a bad movie but it was no where near the expected greatness i heard about ill just quickly brush over my thoughts

the pacing was off i totally get the character building they were trying to do but i found that the film stayed uncomfortably long on scenes that didnt seem to move the plot forward miles and his parents clearly are having issues but instead of his parents taking any real action toward figuring why their son is always disappearing they take it fairly easy on him and ultimately give him a pass to do whatever he wants in reality concerned parents would of worried their son is either on drugs or messing with a girl or a bad crowd of people and after seeing miles with gwen would of immediately suspected shes the reason for his weird behavior and taken appropriate action 

the spot was interesting i definitely like how they made him a bigger threat than he was jn the comics but his motivations were a bit flimsy to me i get his anger toward miles but with how angry he was with miles youd think miles did everything to him on purpose in reality miles did what he had to in order to save the universe and the spot was an unfortunate casualty of that despite this the spot hates his guts and wants to ruin his entire life idk just doesnt work for me on top of that at a certain point he barely pops again and i had nearly forgotten he was even the main villain

the legion of spidermen was awesome and the way the easter eggs worked into the story was satisfying i totally caught spectacular spiderman spiderman unlimited alex ross spiderman and a few other spidermen i recognize spiderman 2099 was great and had very convincing motivations

the film was visually exhilarating but there were times where it felt overwhelming like when gwen was talking to her dad the drawing style kept changing and it just seemed unnecessary 

overall a good movie not great not horrible a worthwhile sequel that is as flawed as it is good i feel the 1st had a better more concentrated story",2023-06-06
"just came out of watching this movie and i had fun but i’m disappointed and just can’t judge the movie

it’s a fun movie it’s well animated  but this isn’t a whole product

i had read a comment here before watching it that the ending teased a third movie and that at least we wouldn’t have to wait that long for the new one maybe there is an announcement already

but this i didn’t expect this ending

this is not a full movie it cannot be judged 

the final arc just doesn’t exist just when it’s starting it’s completely cut off as a writer and story teller this really bothers me i know why they did it but it felt too sudden

and mostly i guess it comes down to expectations there are plenty of movies that tease there will be another movie but they are complete arcs by themselves

other movies for example avengers infinity war we already know in advance there was going to be another movie in fact originally they were announced as part 1 and 2 before they were given names

and even if we didn’t know there was going to be an avengers end game before hand the arc of the story is still complete thanks set out to do something progressed through the story and in the end achieves it and completes its arc we know there will be more of course but the arc isn’t cut short

maybe if it was announced and promoted as part one and two but it wasn’t",2023-06-07
"i think i loved a lot of things about this movie but like  what a weird place to end it

like i knew i was going to be a twoparter but i was not prepared for just ending like halfway through a story arc like i thought there would be some sort of resolution there idk

theres just no payoff really like infinity war we thanos the whole movie as he tries to do one very specific thing and everyone else tries to stop him and then at the end that thing happens and we just have to sit with it for a year

this movie like nobody really had a big overarching goal for half of it and then we meet miguel and then we get some more stuff about the multiverse but its i dont know we just dont get any pay off at the end basically 

the third movie really better deliver is what im saying",2023-06-04
"okay so show of upvotes or replies how many of us actually remember when this movie was first marketed as part one 

because i noticed that they dropped the “part one” in the title and just hoped that they pulled an infinity war and not a justice league on that…

and i’m noticing a lot of people surprised by the ending",2023-06-04
"i like how they began the film with gwen and lead on to miles

its a simple thing but avoiding the whole 3 months earlier flashback sequence gave the movie this flow that could ramp up or down as needed

all of the characterisation was great especially miguel the trailers had me expecting this angry and authoritative figure but hes clearly sympathetic to miles plight in his own fashion

prav was awesome im surprised and a little disappointed that he wasnt present when they were discussing the canon dont think he would have agreed with the idea of letting captain singh die

negatives the third act was far too long they could have cut it at numerous points and maintained the energy and emotion the movies was building up to

instead it just felt like a runway train unable to stop at the designated station",2023-06-04
i love how the spot starts off being a joke and by the end is a genuinely intimidating threat completely sold by jason shwartzman’s voice acting,2023-06-07
"was critical going into the movie and didnt even see the first one

absolutly loved it funniest and at the same time one of the most emotional super hero movies they nailed the family dynamics

the scene with gwen and miles in front of the upside down skyline while self love is playing in the background might be my favorite movie scene of the year so far",2023-06-07
capitalism really is going to be the end for us all,2023-06-11
"so i overall enjoyed the film but there was one moment that really didn’t work for me i really disagree with the decision to show the sendmehome machine when miles is using it 

it very clearly albeit quickly shows that he’s going to universe 42 the rugpullplottwist moment of revealing that miles is in the wrong universe is built up to as this big thing but it’s completely undermined by the fact that the movie has already outright shown as a fact that he’s in the wrong one 

they should’ve avoided this and let the different art and miguel’s earlier explanation as to how the machine works be enough to make the audience sceptical before revealing gwen going into the room and not finding milesrio not knowing who spiderman is if you caught that he went to dimension 42 the next several minutes of buildup to the reveal just feels very drawn out and unnecessary

maybe a bit of a nit pick i do like that he ended up in the wrong universe it’s a good twist i just feel like they misstepped by first outright revealing that to anyone watching closely instead of teasing it out before ultimately having miles explicitly state it it’s just kinda like yeah i know i saw what the machine said several minutes ago the character is just catching up to the audience now and i’m not as invested in his reaction because i don’t share it

i also don’t think this movie is as good as the first though i also consider the first to be one of my favourite films of all time if not outright 1 i feel like this one just didn’t have the same emotional weight and memorable moments that we had before 

plus miles’ whole conflict of “i need to go save my dad” doesn’t entirely make sense to me miguel and the others talk about every spiderman having “their moment” where they lose someone and it changes who they are… but in that same conversation the computer shows miles losing uncle aaron alongside the simulations of everyone else losing someone it seems to be showing that this was his moment  a sentiment explicitly stated in the first film mind you  before then stating that he’s going to lose someone else the movie just kinda seems to rewrite its own rules there edit someone pointed out that this scene was used to portray that spiderman always loses someone close to them and a police captain not one or the other i may have misunderstood this scene if that’s the case

the central conflict of a spiderman having to choose between saving someone they care about and saving everyone is always a good story though and i really like that he didn’t just accept the situation but has a knee  reaction of “save him now figure out the rest later” it’s a lot less noble than so many similar stories where the hero just accepts what needs to be done and peter and gwen needing to reevaluate their personal choices to side with miguel after miles clearly feels betrayed by them is fantastic all throughout the chase scene it felt like neither of them knew who’s side they were on

spot getting sidelined once miguel was introduced is understandable but unfortunate the story pretty much stops paying attention to the main villain not main antagonist mind you that would be miguel halfway through the movie despite him being built up to as this climactic world destroying villain the third movie will have a lot to juggle between him prowler and miguel as antagonists with a sufficient runtime though i trust they’ll pull it off",2023-06-02
"i definitely need to rewatch this the second i get a chance but holy 

alright first things first animation beat the first one out of the park as expected the amount of easter eggs and references were so  delightful to the point where i want to go back and pause each frame to see what i missed just to name a few
donald glover as prowler referencing spiderman homecoming literally unbelievable and im so happy they did this
ganke playing spiderman ps4 
spectacular spiderman makes a short appearance as well but honestly i was just glad i got to see my favoriate childhood spidey for the first time in over 13 years 
live action spidey scenes yadda you get the jist

anyways i do feel like the pacing of this movie was a bit off the first hour essentially felt like the first movie which is not a complaint but a bit too slow for something that was marketed as a multiversal rollercoaster the marketing was awful for this movie as many would agree and i wasnt expecting just a random  but it felt underwhelming but the actual movie starts around the second half where it finds its emotional depth and  just gets really fun i loved miles character development and us watching his growth as not only spiderman but just as a good hearted kid wanting to do the right thing the message of wanting a place to belong was really beautiful and the importance of family was showcased in a way where it wasnt cheesy as youd normally expect from a kids movie speaking of that this movie gets dark in the second half the tone slowly gets eerie and i  loved it at some points i forgot this was a pg movie the producers did a phenomenal job with the writing 

now as for the ending im a bit conflicted with it on one hand im very happy we are getting another installment of this the finale of the trilogy but it felt like the last 20 minutes were moreso just a teaserstaircase leading upto the next movie now i understand its a two part finale but at the same time it causes this movie to feel less like a standalone and moreso just a stepping stone one thatll be forgotten by next year when something bigger and greater comes as opposed to infinity war which in its own right was a great movie with a solid ending because yes it was predictable in endgame where avengers save the day and blah but there was at least a definitive ending to infinity war where thanos wins instead of being ambigious 
overall apart from the  marketing which gave off argubably the best parts of the movieweird pacing and ending it is probably one of the best superhero projects in the last 10 years",2023-06-02
good movie but if i knew the whole movie was just a setup i wouldnt have watched it in a theater,2023-06-02
"did anyone else despise the ending

why do they make 4 star films with 1 star endings

honestly devastatingly dissapointed with it",2023-06-04
"ittsv is by far the best spiderman movie but i’m really not understanding the love for this sequel 

undeniably beautiful and ground breaking animation but next to no plot the film is just 90 spidermen chasing other spidermen around and then leaves the audience on a cliffhanger 

i also hate twoparter movies films should be self contained stories or you’re just making tv 

understand i’m in the minority here though and am happy so many others enjoyed it ",2023-06-06
"did anyone else think the ending was very disappointing because it seems like miles prowler situation is easily solvable 

we already see him starting to escape with the venom powers and gwens group is looking for him gwen also knows hes in the wrong dimension which miguels group doesnt 

the prowler twist just seems really low stakes to me as miles can easy escape or be broken out

also the entire movie builds towards miles opening up to his parents and then it just doesnt matter it feels really unsatisfying",2023-06-02
i love the animation but the end left a bad taste in my mouth if they wanted it longform then they should not have made it a movie wheres the end i paid a movie ticket for an episode ill still watch beyond the spiderverse somehow but not gonna pay for it,2023-06-04
i’ve never seen a more attentiondisorderpandering movie about a villain this was bad cool animation,2023-06-05
"gonna farm some down arrows but i didnt like it as much as i had hoped

like it either felt 1 hour too long or 1 hour too short to be satisfying i went in there not knowing it was a 2parter but when it got to miles meeting miles and gwen assembling the team i was like man this has only just been the 2nd act the  feels like ive been sat here for 3 hours and then it was just over

the beginning felt like it dragged on for way too long without much happening  id like to think that there couldve been a better way to show miles and gwen living through the same struggles that wasnt just showing the same story basically twice

stuff got pretty neat once we got to the spiderverse part but even there i think the movie couldve done with less spiderman running away from spiderman and heres the 97th spiderman variant  like not that it was bad just that it started to drag on eventually

spot dude was pretty neat but kinda just vanished halfway through the movie to make room for miguel to become the villain and shout his way through the final hour of the movie

also i kinda think that both the music and the visuals were better in the first one

like i think the movie had a solid 90 minutes worth of a very good story but repeating the same points over and over and over again while cramming in a solid 137 cameos just didnt do it for me im kinda worried the next movie is gonna be like that as well  a solid 90 minutes worth of plot stretched out to 2 hours to justify the 2parter probably because a single 3h movie just wouldnt work although i wouldve most likely prefered that

again not that it was bad but it didnt hit me like the first one did obviously gonna rewatch it 27 times though so theres that also pretty sad about no prostcredit  even just a slight sneak peak at whats about to come woulda been swell kiiiiinda felt like theyve leaned a bit too hard into worked for infinity war and endgame so its gonna work for us as well for me",2023-06-04
"the first film was way better

miles better actually",2023-06-07
how is nobody talking about how the film is completely missing an ending no arcs are resolved no stories lead to a conclusion no payoffs for any foreshadowing the entire third act is just missing i liked the beginning and the middle but without an ending i honestly cant really appreciate them i feel a bit swindled to be honest,2023-06-09
i feel like i’m on drugs why is no one upset that this movie had no ending everyone in my theater was baffled but no one on the internet seems to even notice,2023-06-03
"theres six different conflicts and we dont get a real one until halfway through the second act the second and third acts are basically nonstop exposition that doesnt really further the plot and they just keep going over the same issues again and again miles conflict with the spot could be resolved with one earnest conversation miles conflict with gwen keeps getting expanded on in different ways without real resolution or cohesion and we dont learn about the universe canon until the movie is halfway over in the first spiderverse movie had a central conflict established in the first fifteen minutes i wish this movie knew what it wanted to be about 

x200b

the constant changing of animation style was cool at first but then they started doing it so fast that it just became distraction i liked the visuals of the sequence in mumbattan because it stuck to one visual style long enough to actually appreciate it but then the third act had so many different animation styles and color palettes that it just sort of became visual sludge 

x200b

and lastly stop using quips and jokes to defuse tense and meaningful scenes let tension exist it sucks when marvel does it dont try it we heard that same bad teacher joke from peter parker four times in ten minutes",2023-06-08
"ok was that the spectacular spiderman version of peter cradling captain stacys dead body

"ok so i loved it i loved every second of it art style soundtrack writing everything

but tell me if anyone else had this problem with it the same as fast x i felt like this movie had no main event or climax of its own rather it just felt a bit incomplete and unsatisfying and a setup for the finale

at first i thought maybe this is just how it has to be with twopart movies but then i remembered how infinity warendgame managed to do it so well making even the first movie feel like its own whole thing even with the most deadly cliffhanger of all time i wonder why this movie or fast x couldnt do quite that and i wonder if mission impossible dead reckoning part 1 will be the same way",2023-06-02
sony did it again this movie blows the first out of the water somehow and now i think spiderman is my favorite franchise sony is doing a better job setting up the multiverse than mcus kang  theres so much happening on screen yet they still keep it understandable the music artwork characters its all a masterpiece every single frame is some of the most creative and expressive stuff ive seen in modern media props to sony animation,2023-06-02
honestly no joke this is the best piece of content ive ever experienced not just movies im including series and video games too,2023-06-02
it just  hit me what “beyond the spider verse”means it means beyond the universes where spiderman exists earth 42 is one of them and we’re about to see more,2023-06-03
"its a tiny detail but i loved that both gwen and miles had bs in classes for one of their native languages english and spanish respectively and both gave the excuse that they had just missed a few classes because of being a superhero fun to catch the small details that show just how closely all of the spiderpeoples lives line up even outside of the major canon events and the other characters in their lives

once again outstanding animation which went beyond the style of the first movie giving each universe its own distinctive flair and sometimes giving clues in scenes that didnt take place in the universe that we thought we were seeing like when miless mom has green instead of brown eyes an excellent sequel and great setup for a third film if they can stick the landing this will end up being the most complete and consistent spiderman trilogy todate imo",2023-06-04
alright unpopular opinion but i felt like it dragged on at times a lot of stuff definitely could have been taken out in my opinion,2023-06-04
is anyone else really annoyed that they basically put the entire climax of the moviemiles’ big moment in the trailers couldn’t properly enjoy the entire nueva york sequence because i felt like i’ve literally seen it twenty times,2023-06-05
"it was a great movie i went in not knowing it was a part 1 and that left me disappointed

i hate when movies end with to be continued and do not tell a complete story it recently happened with dune yeah i understand thats how the book ends and the newest avatar i feel like the second matrix movie ended without a real ending  they just come off as setups for the next flick i may be weird about this but i think that a movie should try to have some sort of conclusion i get that there is more to the story but try wrap up something maybe im just too used to the whole discovery conflict resolution approach that is in basically every movie or maybe im forgetting how other great multipart movies didnt tell whole stories in the individual movie

anyway ill be at opening weekend when the next one drops",2023-06-05
"i was crying through almost the entire gwen intro for so many reasons ive been a massive spidergwen fan since her books started and i never thought id see her story play out in a movie then the watercolor art style kicked in and i realized they were animating her scenes just like much of her cover art then it hit me that they were going through her whole origin it was weird because i never felt strongly reading it but i started bawling both when peter died and when captain stacy turned on her i knew it was coming but that just made it worse they really did her justice and hailee did such a great job

  
seeing the mary janes and hearing them play was surreal im wondering if well ever get gwenom andor carnage mary jane in the all female spinoff thats been talked about",2023-06-05
i loved the movie but sadly my experience was brought down by the people that like to  talk during the movie and explain it to their friends i dont give a  if you recognize an easter egg your friends probably dont give a  either i dont know why this is becoming very common in movie theaters and if you tell them to shut up they feel offended i just wanted to vent,2023-06-05
the whole movie is  1010 i was on the edge of my seat in second half each frame is so beautiful to look at for a moment i forgot it was twoparter and i believe whole theatre too cause of the collective “oh c’mon” when that “to be continued” appeared on screen the only slight very tiny tiny issue the songs were no where as good as the first one,2023-06-07
"saw it last night and i cant stop thinking about it that movie was an absolute masterclass in storytelling and animation not for a moment did i think it dragged and there were multiple times where i was just in awe of how beautiful every frame looked it was almost distractingly gorgeous at times and the way the soundtrack almost melded beat by beat to the frames was incredible the whole beginning segment with the opening then gwen playing drums was just unreal animation and the movie really didnt slow down i am upset that transformers is taking over the imaxdolby screens because ill definitely be seeing it one or two more times the spot was a perfect villian and the dilemma between the spiderman 2099 crew vs miles was one where i still dont know what side id be on just unbelievably good

my only complaint was the audio in some parts especially at the beginning was low in my theater to where i thought it wasnt nearly loud enough and i missed a few lines of dialogue",2023-06-07
pretty sure i’m the only person who didn’t love this movie it’s good… but not worth the hype,2023-06-09
my friends were talking and laughing during the whole movie i should have just seen it by my self tbh,2023-06-17
great start tedious ending way to drawn out with his family stuff we get it good movie but if they would have edited 20 mins or so it could have been fantastic,2023-06-27
i didnt like that they made all the spider man just agree to the fact that they gotta let miles father die most spider man wouldnt stand for that,2023-06-02
probably in the minority here the movie felt like it was edging me the whole time somehow i feel like it didnt really advance the story that much it just kind of dragged love the animation and music just not the story,2023-06-03
miguel really is the  this story miles is crazy,2023-06-03
that ending was one of the biggest movie mistakes i can think of what were they thinking,2023-06-03
i wasnt the biggest fan compared to the first one  too much visual clutter for the sake of it the parts with miles parents dragged and i hated the cliffhanger,2023-06-05
this movie was so good it i cant express enough gratitude for this life and the feeling it allows me to feel,2023-06-02
i am so happy that we got an appearance and even a line from the spectacular spiderman a pretty standout line in an important scene too,2023-06-02
"even knowing that this was only part 1 that ending seemed pretty abrupt otherwise this was a straight up masterpiece building upon everything that was amazing in into the spider verse

not only is this film a celebration of everything spider man its a celebration of comics and animation as art forms the return of the comic book covers the different art styles of each universe that gorgeous credits sequence need to watch it again",2023-06-02
i love that spiderman 2 ps5 game existing in miles’ dimension implies that him and ganke know there are versions of them that exists in the game also donald glover’s cameo made me wonder what earth19999 aaron did that led him to become an anomaly and how he became prowler also spiderpunk is gonna be my personality for the whole year,2023-06-02
so many fantastic emotional moments in this movie and the blending of all the different art styles is incredible it really feels like a comic book come to life the biggest issues i have is with it are that it feels really drawn out towards the second half and is such an unsatisfying ending its like watching an incomplete movie,2023-06-02
"i will never emotionally recover from this cliff hanger holy  what an amazing movie i had pretty high expectations from the first one and this movie blew them out of the water like half way through just the visuals alone are a technical achievement if this isnt strongly considered for best picture this year then the whole thing is rigged 

also a shower thought i had while driving home what if the universe that didnt have its spiderman in it was our universe man that would have hit hard",2023-06-02
"great movie but was it just my theater or was the sound mixing nolan level in multiple parts right off the bat i could barely understand gwens opening monologue over the sound of the drums

there were a few other parts where it was really bad as well

edit shouldve looked more thoroughly through the comments before posting this i see that a lot of people had the same issue",2023-06-02
seeing spectacular spiderman holding captain staceys body was a really nice look into post cliffhanger finale of the show about what he went through later on,2023-06-02
"everything i could say about this i think ive already seen said in the comments so far except

 everyone was wrong about this movie i saw so many people worried about this movie because of the love triangle angle that got played up by the media by marketing im honestly not sure where this came from thathonestly isnt even really present in the movie at all plus concerns because of the writers  we were so wrong 

 the soundtrack was insanely good i dont think the licensed  pop music included was as impactful as it was in the first movie there was no whats up danger for this movie but now i understand why  it was still good it just didnt have that umph but daniel pemberton with the original score hoooooly  he picked up the slack where the licensed music left holes  or rather the filmmakers let him go wild and let him shine over the licensed stuff which was honestly a perfect choice pembertons score took themes from the first movie and wove them into new ones elevated them into brand new mixes that still held the spirit of the original  it was ear candy the whole time there are so many reasons to watch this movie again but for me i need to just listen to it again if nothing else

 animation has for a long time been seen as just a kids genre this is false as many have said but especially guillermo del toro most recently animation is not a genre its a medium it is not just for kids this movie shows that more and more kids movies these days are getting away with swearing and in this one i counted multiple instances of  and  two uses of  and a  i know swearing doesnt equal maturity but to me it speaks to the fact that theyre not playing around this movie is for everyone and yeah kids will be entertained by the bright colors but honestly theyre not gonna get it

 beyond the language this movie has a lot of mature themes and things to say about choice and what you choose to do with your life its taking what the first movie did and expanding on those themes in new ways that are only possible if you treat your audience like adults its incredible and mature and so so so lovingly made and written and i honestly couldnt be happier with the way this turned out im overjoyed we got one of these at all and to think the second one blew the original out of the water  a hard act to follow and an even harder one to improve upon 

its so hard to process my thoughts on this as soon as the title card flashed at the end my theater erupted and i was right there with them i honestly started crying because i was just so so happy i knew about the part 1  part 2 thing but i did actually forget and at the time thought they dropped the title because a part 2 was up in the air and they didnt want to bank on it so early i thought this would be like the first movie  a neatly wrapped up story that didnt hinge on a sequel but would leave the potential opening for one if it did well enough im so glad i was wrong and i cant wait to see what they do next",2023-06-02
"it was a ton of fun and a worthy sequel but i dont think its better than the first really feel you could cut about 1015 minutes and really get the pacing down pat though admittedly you would be cutting good stuff to sound like a  for a sec it just felt a bit self indulgent at times compared to first one

still an incredible movie that im happily going to see a couple more times",2023-06-02
"love that they continued to prominently feature the musical motifs for the spider characters and the hero’s journey from the first movie i was geeking out every time i noticed them

not only that but the more punk soundtrack that accompanied gwen was just beyond excellent the music in these movies is so  good",2023-06-02
"loved this movie that scene where miles said “nah imma do my own thing” had me shook 

i thought hobie was gonna be the stereotypical  rival for gwens interest but he really won me over with his quips and morals love that he told miles how to better use his electric blast thingy and miles proceeded to use it to escape the cage and blast miguel

really loved the gang reassembling at the end with the spider people from the previous movie and this one teaming up to help miles

although a quick question did miguel and co go to earth 42 or miles earth since the scene where they were waiting for miles and when miles was running home looked quite similar and were both in the rain

overall enjoyed the  out of this movie and cannot wait for the next one",2023-06-02
amazing film much better written than nwh,2023-06-02
"anyone know the name of the chill rap song that plays before gwen and miles have their upside down talk over the city

i don’t think it’s a part of the soundtrack released",2023-06-02

"loved it  need to watch it again as im sure i missed a bunch of references here and there

during the leadup to the reveal that he was in the wrong dimension all the way up to the end was so well done i had chills the art and the sound the whole movie was top notch too probably my favorite movie of the year so far,2023-06-02
haven’t seen it yet but would someone who has mind letting me know if this is too scary for a five year old who has seen the first one at home but was pretty close to not being able to handle the opening scene when peter dies anything that harrowing this time around,2023-06-02
this is 23 of a fantastic movie,2023-06-02
as a spiderman 2099 fan anyone think they did miguel dirty ,2023-06-02
miguel gonna be an excellent villain  antihero in the next movie,2023-06-02
the spiderverse team is really 22 so far this was such a great movie in so many different ways definitely seems like its the empire of the trilogy its darker and doesnt end on a happy note but there are sparks of hope for the next installment i cant wait to see what they have in store next,2023-06-03
great no fantastic movie top 3 animated films in my book something i don’t get though if miles is this og anomaly to the point where his version of spiderman shouldn’t even exist why does his lifestory have to be held to the canon events ie his uncle dying his police captain dad having to die he’s an anomaly his very existence shows that they aren’t defined by the “script” maybe that’ll be a plot point in the next film i feel like this should be obvious tho lol,2023-06-03
somehow a lot better than the first one and the first one was incredible,2023-06-03
is paul a canon event too,2023-06-03
in the beginning he’s wearing a brooklyn nets jersey 42 lol,2023-06-03
gwen in this movie might be my favourite character across the two films,2023-06-03
great watch only think i didn’t like was that they went the  “villain makes a little too much sense so we have to make him lose control and beat up the hero” route with miguel also is every spider man evil now except miles  co  obviously we don’t know what happens in the next film just thoughts based on this one,2023-06-03
if youre looking for something to scratch the itch in terms of animation and sound track i would recommend redline a gorgeous wacky races meets speed racer anime movie that has 100000 hand drawn frames,2023-06-03

"incredible film that absolutely lived up to the first 

the visuals were off the charts just a complete eyegasm and a masterpiece i can’t think of any other film that competes visually

the plot of the first film is tighter and better as a standalone but the overarching story this creates is excellent",2023-06-04

my only gripe…unless i missed it was that there was no japanese spiderman  

i was hoping we’d see a mech or something in the background",2023-06-04

this was fun to watch there were some slow moments that dragged on a bit too much some tropes shouldve been moved along quicker and the movie couldve been shortened a bit but the plot was great animation and artstyle was incredible cultural and movie references were great overall a 910,2023-06-04
"loved it now i have to watch the sequel i am so disappointed in myself for not catching up on miles being in the wrong universe the spider from wrong universe motif has been written all over the wall for someone who usually sees plot twists ahead of time i am blind sighted this time around 

the visuals and sounds are on point this is one of those films of which the presentation and styles are so well made to the point that the plot and characterization do not take the entirety of my focus and no i am not saying the movie is style over substances because both the style and substances are spectacular the movie is a full package

the movie is emotional touching while remaining to be hopeful and light hearted if you are an adult like me there are some very strong themes to enjoy especially if you are a parent or someone who struggles between maintaining the status quo due to pragmatic realism birthed by experience miguel and optimistic idealism due to hope and faith miles if you are someone whose interests are more about style art and music then the movie is visually stunning and the music used are enchanting as well this movie has something for anyone to enjoy",2023-06-04
good lord as of 4600 ish votes the median rating is 10,2023-06-04
"absolutely stellar movie even better than the first i adored the different distinct art styles of each major character and their worlds the opening with gwen and her more impressionist world with the colors bleeding and representing her emotional state was a great choice i loved spiderpunks cut and paste looks reminiscent of so many photocopied punk zines from over the years

i also found the spots evolving design really intriguing when we first meet him you can see pencil outlines as if hes not yet finished so when he goes from villain of the week to an eldritch abomination its so very striking

the humor and action all played a role in telling the story i could feel the care put into each scene and i honestly didnt realize two hours had passed im honestly quite burned out on superhero films nothing thats come out in the last few years or scheduled for release this year has captured my attention but across the spiderverse had me psyched from the first teaser i cant wait to see the end of this trilogy i feel confident that it will stick the landing",2023-06-04
"personally i think the canon event concept works better in time travel stories than au ones 

like i can see brainiac 5 trying to stop flash from saving krypton from blowing up because otherwise there is no superman and therefore no jla or legion  thats a pretty straightforward cause and effect but here they have to add the universe explodes if stacy doesnt die as an external cosmic punishment to make the plot work",2023-06-05
"visually stunning as expected pretty much every shot was gorgeous easily the best looking movie of the year
i guess my one complaint is the central dilemma about how spiderman  is defined by tragedy and canon its absolutely a callout to various writers keeping peter stuck in a permanent state of depression and how spiderman can and should evolve beyond certain set pieces and of course miles was never going to be okay with the fact that his fathers death had to happen i my issue is with how many spidermenspiderwomen were okay with that fact

like obviously not all the spider people were peter parker and not all of those peters may be the most upstanding spiderman but i have a hard time believing that many peter parkers agreed with the idea that some people just have to die for the greater good

for example you are telling me ps4 spiderman who has a version of miles on his world and saw that version of miles also lose his father saw what miguel and the others were doing about their miles and was like alright seems cool to me i cant accept that",2023-06-05

im so happy they tied in the prowlermiles into this one tiny moment i loved in into the spiderverse was miless spidersense changing colors from purplegreen to redblue when first meeting peter parker while this did get peter killed it was also the incident that turned miles onto the path of spiderman rather than prowler but with part 2 well get to see what it would have been like if that hadnt happened,2023-06-05
ive been hearing that theres an evangelion reference regarding peni whats the reference,2023-06-05
"honestly no one in this movie was unlikeable to me i understood everyones point of view be it miguels crushing need for every spiderman to stick to the script because of his own failure miles persistence to save his father and do his own thing gwens uncomfortable middle ground seeing miles

one other thing the original songs just like the first movie were amazing im listening to it on spotify at this very moment

i loved it and i will be happy to walk into the theaters next year to see part 2",2023-06-05
i really hope everyone who worked on this movie has a spectacular day,2023-06-05

they should find miles quite fast in the next movie right i mean they know all about the spider,2023-06-05
"i didn’t like spider punk in the beginning but by the end he was one of my favourite characters his little plants around the story to bring the original group back together were fantastic 

one thing i was thinking too was could miguel also be an anomaly we didn’t get a massive delve into his past who was his captain why isn’t he funny he wasn’t bitten by a spider he active injects himself with an agent that makes him spiderman was there a peter parker in his universe that died

also is the universe being destroyed by an anomaly the same as an incursion in the mcu",2023-06-05
"beautiful film i came for the visuals and i was not disappointed they really went wild and abstract with the backgrounds

all the characters are perfectly balanced gwen is great miles is a boss miguel is a beast jessica is a badass hobie was lots of fun and peter is still the best version of the character in any movie comics fans should be over the moon with his portrayal even more all the references to the actual comics stories and all the different spidermen were a real treat ben reilly was a joke character but still really well done they even threw in the oneoff costume from one of my favorite spidey stories

the music wasnt as good the pacing didnt have that snap that gave the first movie so much energy i missed that the emotional family stuff was done well for the most part but for the sake of pacing i would cut about ten minutes of it all the canon stuff is kind of a desperate contrivance but they still managed to beat out a better spiderverse story than whats in the comics i understand they had sequel setup work to do in the end but it really should have wrapped up quickly after the third act chase 

my biggest problem is the pacing and thats the one thing keeping across the spiderverse from being better than the first movie",2023-06-05

"—————— spoiler ——————

my theory on what could happen in beyond the spider verse

miles lands in earth42 where the spider that bite him is from he is then captured by a variant of himself and at first glance it made it seem like he was the villain on earth42 but if you notice some details of earth42 it’s kind of like an inverted version of the earth miles is from 

when he tells his story to his variant he mentions specifically “our dad” and his variant corrects him by saying “no your dad” it’s important because it seems like the variant didn’t like his dad or despised him in a way it’s possible that his dad in earth42 was a dirty cop helping the sinister 6 crime group who run the show in this reality and variant miles ended up killing him now variant miles thinks that all versions of his dad are evil or corrupt this would imply that variant miles is kind of an antihero with the prowler alterego and could be on a dark path 

during the into the spider verse movie a miserable peter b parker came to help a misguided miles morales and the relationship themes amongst the two was very mentor like i believe this could also be the same dynamic between milesearth1610 and his variant earth42 in a way his variant could very well be the answer to the solution he’s looking for regarding a potential error in canon events",2023-06-07
im guessing theyll touch on it in the sequel since they drew attention to it but what was up with miguel injecting himself with that little gun i assumed that if he was a vampire it was some kind of idk plasma thing for food til i was reading about his comic counterpart later and his fangs are just venomous hes not literally a vampire,2023-06-07

did anyone else get rattigan vibes from miguel rabidly chasing miles,2023-06-08

i am never getting over the everything everywhere all at once feature,2023-06-09
thoughts on miguel not being bit by a spider to gain his abilities he seems to know too much about all of the spiderverse especially his concern with miles being bit by a spider from a different universe he also is clearly a contrast to the attitude and characteristics of all other spiderpeople there was also a clip of him injecting something into him that wasnt explained not to mention that he didnt fully explain how he messed up the canon,2023-06-09
"question about canon event 

miles already had his canon event  his uncle died in his arms that was even shown during the sequence where we saw all the other canon events why then does his father have to die miles has to experience two canon events i’m a bit confused by that",2023-06-09

is this version of spiderman 2099 really a vampire or was gwen just making fun of his fangs",2023-06-11
"movie was awesome i cant believe i have to wait until 2024 for the end

weird crackpot theory

what are the odds that the one pulling all the strings in the back is superior spiderman

i mean we started this trip fighting against dr liv octopus there is a couple of cameos of different dr octopus in the spider hq there is even an spiderman wearing what looks like dr ocks tech during miless chase

i mean if someone wanted to get rid of spiderman for good he would make it so they are all in the same place

they also wouldnt know any better to them he is just another spiderman after all

anyways just a crazy theory",2023-06-11
"just a couple of thoughts 

	2099’s universe already had a peter parker right and he wasn’t bitten by a spider either so i think it’s funny that he’s giving miles  for that 
	knew something was up when miles was sent back to “his own” universe and his hoodie was purple",2023-06-11

it was art the whole thing amazingly done

does anyone have any links to where i can get some of the movie posters ive seen released  ive looked everywhere and cant find anywere to buy them",2023-06-13
i liked the movie way more than the first centered in miles gwen miguel great movie the only thing i thought wasnt very good is the final you dont have a final battle you let miles locked by another prowlermiles ok the movie is a twopart but infinity war managed to give a proper finale with thanos winning and going to rest across the spiderverse itself those final scenes doesnt look like a movie finale but overall i really like the film,2023-06-13
im super confused about the universe miles ended up in his uncle purposely traps him so that prowler can get him does his uncle know that prowler is also miles if so how was he not confused when he saw that younger miles just in the house,2023-06-14
i know the gwen we know is integral to the plot but where is gwen in miles universe,2023-06-15
felt like i was watching rick and morty at times… the citadel of spiderpeople,2023-06-15

did a rewatch of into the spiderverse how come in that film gwen’s peter looks like peter b parker meaning older but in across the spiderverse he looks like he’s a teen,2023-06-15
was it me or did the universe where miles was from had intentional chromatic aberrations on the edges to show how miles is actually an anomaly,2023-06-16
just noticed in my second viewing that metro boomin was the spider who said theres nowhere to go ,2023-06-17

the minimart lady from tom hardys venom universe got me so excited i always found symbiote spiderman to be super cool and slick,2023-06-18
"based on what i can gather so far from it both sides miles and miguel are right and wrong in their own ways

miles in that you really shouldnt just stand around and let something happen without trying anything

while miguel is right to put the safety of the greater whole over what would ultimately be a selfish desire

i can see where miguel is coming from in his really hellbent drive to stop miles from trying to defy what can be considered destiny at this point being one  of a bad idea since as most other media has shown that doesnt just bend over and let the the hero win regardless of their choice improbable or how ridiculous or nonsensical it would be in reality defying it in a way it didnt like and youre probably gonna wind up making things worse

some holes i found in the whole gwens dad argument is that in her case her dad is just no longer the captain she may lose

she just winded up replacing the target not removing the event itself

whats to say who will replace him in his role isnt someone shes either equally as close to or will grow too

or he winds up getting back to the role later on due to unforseen and uncontrollable circumstances

canon events are describe as less things that are gonna happen immediately and more like an eventuality

so by all means using her as an example doesnt work as a way to say it can be stopped more like delayed

another one is the whole miles and the one who was supposed to be bitten universes not tearing themselves apart

yeah if you look at it and focus on them not tearing apart it looks like proof that miles maybe right

but then if you actually think about it instead it becomes obvious what happened instead was just a simple role swap

miles already had the makings of becoming the prowler of his universe so the opposite can be inferred that his counterpart had the makings of becoming spiderman instead

but because of the mix up the universe instead worked with what it has it just role swapped them hence why it wasnt tearing itself apart

yes we know there are holes in miguels working theory but so far all weve seen is miles not so much as proving them wrong and more doing a bit of both

they can be altered but so far everytime he tried there was some disastrous results indian spiderman sorry forgot her name universe being destabilized by the spot is prime example so far

honestly at this point i hope the third movie acts more of a wake up call for miles while also being one for miguel

miles in that he gets to finally realize that choices and actions can have consequences even if they were done with the best of intentions since some of the greatest atrocities in history were done with just that the best of intentions and you have to take accountability and responsibity for them whether you intended it or not

miguel in that no he doesnt have to try and shoulder the responsibility by himself there are people who are willing to help him with it because the more he tries the more his starting to buckle under the pressure

ive found it weird also that most argue tom spiderman would side with miles

if anything hed side with both of them and try and get them to understand each other

since at this point his walked in both of their shoes quite literally

hes been where miles was at in having the childish belief his invincible and can accomplish anything and because his doing the right thing

doing just as miles did almost destroyed his universe only to be averted and the consequence being it got his aunt may to die by the end of it

and his been where like miguel hes has in that he has to make the choices that caused him the most pain in the end with him erasing himself from everyones mind just to keep them safe and keep his universe from being torn apart",2023-06-18
"the movie was amazing in terms of plot art style direction animation dialogues  everything 

however i am still not getting one thing  what is the intent of universe 42s prowler to hold back miles in their universe maybe that miles wants to take place of our miles in 6016 to meet his dad",2023-06-19
"okay so i could definitely be wrong and this is more a question than me pointing out a plothole but here we go 

so we know that the spider that bit miles in into the spiderverse was from earth 42 we know it altered something in him because the ho home machine retinal scans him to be from earth 42 and sent him there 

we know that people from the wrong universe glitch in a different universe without a watch or a band that stabilised them 

if miles is from earth 42 according to the dna scans how come he doesnt glitch when hes from whatever earth he actually is from ive forgotten the number",2023-06-23
"i have a theory warning spoilers ahead …

the reason why the universe miguel visited got destroyed isn’t because he stopped a canon event it’s because he stole his doppelgänger’s family without even telling the family that person died he was trying to replace a dead guy which is unconscionable and goes against what spiderman would do that’s why that universe was swallowed by a black hole because miguel did something wrong and violated the laws of the spiderverse

everytime a spiderman does something with bad intentions a blackhole appears i think all those other spiderpeople in miguel’s universe are creating more blackholes by their inaction they are willingly letting people die and even abetting their deaths for the sake of preserving canon events 

spiderman’s character isn’t designed to be like that if there’s a chance he can save people he will take it he will try to save everyone instead of sacrificing one person to save the rest of the world he doesn’t pick and chose who dies that’s why miles saving his father won’t destroy his universe",2023-06-26
i cant wait to watch this movie on shrooms lol,2023-06-28
maybe its because i watch everything on 15x speed nowadays but i feel like even at a 2 hour runtime its a little bloated felt like half the movie was building up to the ending being a cliff hanger still pretty good but i think it couldve been great if they cut down or shortened some of the earlier stuff,2023-06-29
"i have questions in no particular order

 why did the indian spiderman know about the society when his canon event didnt even happen yet

 if the whole spot thing is not canon then why was the indian captain supposed to die there

 why did they even bother going to the indians spidermans world in the first place if they did manage to stop the spot in time then the captain wouldnt have been in danger either thus he wouldnt need to be saved thus causing an anomaly this whole ordeal makes 0 sense to me

 if miles is an anomaly then why is his universe not already on the verge of destruction like the indian spidermans universe is after saving the captain saving the captain immediatly caused the world to almost to crubme but miles become spiderman which was not supposed to happen has no effect on the intregry of the universe huh

 i find it incredibly hard to believe that all the spidermen in that whole society are on board with letting certain people die just to preseve the cannon",2023-07-01
guys odd question but would spiderman from earth42 if the spider was never transported would that spiderman be able to go invisible and do all the things miles can do or was it just a miles thing and he can do that,2023-07-01
gwen stacy dying is a canon event… i think likely outcome in next film,2023-07-02
boy i hated miles throughout this whole movie i know hes 15 but if he just shut the  and listened every once and a while everything would be normal i hate movies with that type of premise,2023-07-03
when gwen and peter b are climbing the bullet train towards miguel and miles are they trying to save miles capture him or both,2023-07-06
i love that movie ive seen it twice and im thinking ill watch it at least one more time before im done something bugs me tho my best mate said he didnt enjoy it as much as into the spiderverse since the whole movie is essentially just buildup and he was expecting and wanting a movie with a somewhat satisfying conclusion i knew about the twopart thing beforehand so it didnt bug me at all but i cant find any arguments against his claimanyone wanna help me,2023-07-09
"what a dense freaking movie but what is up with twoparters honestly kinda ruined it for me cant we just have a relatively stand alone movie instead of ending it right at the apex of the story

honestly so much of the movie couldve been condensed to fit in a finale the spider society scenes alone take up a huge chunk of this film and its just exposition

also can anyone tell me why gwens universe kept changing colors",2023-07-15
anyone knows what song is in the beginning when miles is swinging across brooklyn before he comes across spot some kind of old rap from 90s or early 2000s,2023-07-20
i hope the cgi artists of this movie were the most paid from the cast and crew how could they not,2023-08-08
that to be continued gave me blue balls,2023-08-09
"peter to miles youre the reason i had her mayday okay i thought that if i did a decent job raising her that there was a chance she was going to turn out like you and that got me excited because you are a wonderful person and i like being around you

 i can totally see miles thinking sure you like being around me enough to stay the  away from me for 16 months  
  
to be sure i completely believe peter but i can also see how miles would think its  especially after miguel uses peters watch to sic all his goons on miles however much peter didnt intend that to happen",2023-08-09
"this movie made me feel old and im just in my early 30s my eyes and head hurt from all the visual overload 

everytime theres a fight its like theres something going on in every corner of the screen every nano second i love the choreography and creativity but i dont know where to focus because everything is happening too fast with texts and info popping up in between i love the unique and gorgeous artstyles in every universe but most of them are a blast of contrasting color and nonstop imagery if i watched this in a theater i probably wouldve gotten a seizure with hobies backstory i feel like this was animated with a lethal dose of adhd medication

still tho i freakin loved this movie probably the best movie and trilogy for me ever since super hero movies started dipping in the multiverse short and concise but also heartfelt stories for the supporting cast the universes are actually explored and given life plot twists that are cleverly hinted on early even on the first movie and my personal favorite is that theres none of that overdone tensionbreaking cheap jokes from the mcu every funny and emotional scene here landed for me 

its not only a great superhero movie its also a great family movie i hope they dont rush the 3rd one and give the animators proper breaks and compensation im hopeful that this trilogy is shaping up to be one of the best superhero and animated movies of all time",2023-08-09

never manage to have the time to watch it during its relase at the cinema bought it instantly today when it got out on digital amazing movie i wounder if miles talk regarding dark matter is a foreshadowing about it being a plot device for the upcoming movie,2023-08-14
ngl the ending kinda reminded me of back to the future part 2 when he didnt end up where he was supposed to be kinda freaky too how he only realized this wasnt where hes from only when he got home,2023-08-18
my favourite scene was just after miles enters earth 42 and the voices are playing in his head with intense music in the background literal chills,2023-08-23
"late to the party and no one will probably read this i feel like i’m getting old the visuals of the movie are amazing and gorgeous no doubt but my eyes couldn’t keep up at times with how spastic and jerky the scenes were a lot of scenes were so quick that you couldn’t even appreciate the beauty and technicality of the shot because it was literally a split second other times so much was happening i couldn’t concentrate on the scene like the first fight scenes with the spot where it was difficult to see how exactly they were fighting

i don’t remember feeling the same way with the first one no issues whatsoever with everything else other than the weird sound mix as others mentioned i agree with the movie’s rating definitely an excellent film

maybe i just need to rewatch it earlier in the day when my eyes aren’t tired from work yet",2023-08-24
"when i first heard of into the spiderverse i never gave it my attention simply because it was animated

oh boy was i a big idiot for thinking that these two movies are the best  thing i watched in years

plot  characters  graphicsva you name it its all so good

the one piece of criticism i can offer is the fact that some scenes tend to have too much going on i feel like its effort that goes unappreciated because your eyes cant catch up to it maybe my poor ability to concentrate when too much is going on has to do with it but that is in no way disturbing the experience ofc  i just  dont want the talented people behind the animations to burn out working on details people may not notice  have some deserved rest you know and i do hope theyre being paid well for the quality ive seen

this movie is just amazing ",2023-09-03
i actually had difficulty understanding the movie due to rapid dialogue and strange pacing  far cry from the first movie in terms of quality in my view  a challenge most sequels fail at  by the end i was left feeling bland and uncaring  im not very invested in how this all ends,2023-11-06
okay so sorry if this is already a post but do we think gwen and hobie are hooking up i feel like thats exactly what was implied but im open to other ideas,2024-01-06
it seems like im in the minority on this one but i was disappointed by this movie the visuals were just too overwhelming at times that first battle between vulture and gwenmigueljess was particularly hard to follow and the sound mixing was awful though i think that was partially my theaters fault they seemed to crank up the volume way too high early in but the main reason im disappointed is because of the ending im ok with a cliffhanger ending but not when it doesnt feel like an ending at all there is no resolution there is no completion of miles arc infinity war is what a cliffhanger ending should be a movie that gives us a proper ending and a resolution to the main characters journey it still functions on its own as its own individual movie that doesnt need endgame to be complete this movie doesnt function at all as its own film especially when the first half of this movie is basically all setup i think i will like this film more when beyond the spiderverse comes out and the story is actually complete but right now im frustrated at how incomplete this was,2023-06-05
"let me preface this by saying that i fully understand that im in the minority on this

the ending really took the wind out of the sails for me i knew it was a twoparter going in but i was incredibly dissatisfied with the actual cliffhanger nothing happens and theres no real immediate threat miles is the wrong universe not a problem theres hundreds of spiderpeople who can travel to any dimension with the press of a button and theyre all looking for him gwen was able to survive in his world for a week in itsv so the glitching isnt an issue miguel and his crew want to stop miles not an issue he already singlehandedly defeated them all and they are shown to be mostly idiots even the main villain is a nonthreat despite looking extremely cool he does nothing to solidify himself as an actual danger hes such a nonthreat that the movie completely ignores him for the entire third act

people keep comparing it to empire strikes back or infinity war but i dont think thats true empire builds to luke confronting vader thats what hes training for and why vader is building his trap infinity war revolves entirely around thanoss snap and ends with him completing his goal those movies two towers back to the future part 2  they all give the characters a clear mission at the start and conclude that particular story this just stops halfway not because its a good stopping point but because they ran out the clock

again just to be clear i loved this movie and ill see beyond opening night but that cliffhanger absolutely missed the mark for me",2023-06-06
"there are things in this movie that are absolutely amazing the animation is even better than itsv the stuff in gwen’s universe and in nueva york particularly hobie is an amazing new character i love gwen’s arc with her dad the structural and thematic writing were good

but i really did not enjoy watching it most of the movie that isn’t the precredits sequence with gwen and the nueva york sequence did not really work for me the pacing felt way off i did not like miles i did not like his dad the dialogue writing and performances on those characters felt weirdly off the ending “falling action” was bizarre and it felt like they added climactic music and chopped that part up to make it feel like an ending but it ended up feeling like a bad music video

also oh my  the sound mix what the  was going on  how did this release in that state

i’m gonna wait til i see the next one to see if this pays off and try a rewatch i hope so but honestly a really frustrating watch because it should have been amazing",2023-06-04
first one was way better this doesn’t even come close except for animation and style yes animation is mind blowing and gets even better with this one but in terms of story and plot this one felt very lazy writing and cliche cookie cutter characters the indian version was a complete stereotype character and it felt too long they could easily cut 45 mins to an hour and it wouldn’t change anything disappointed overall,2023-06-05
"the more i think about this movie the less it makes any sense

the main conflict is between miguel who wants to allow miles dad to die and preserve the canon versus miles who wants to save his dad no matter what except every spiderman obviously tries to save their universes captain so miles trying to save his own universes captain wouldnt even be a problem hed just fail pavi tries to save captain singh and is going to fail it is the interference of other universe spidermen miles that breaks canon

so miguels plan to trap miles and make sure he cant be involved in his own universes canon event makes no sense maybe you could argue that miguel is either crazy or evil or has hidden motives etc but he also convinces hundreds of other spidermen to go along with this nonsense as shown in the intervention scene so that doesnt even work to fix the plot hole

also miguels plan must have been hatched sometime during the mumbattan section because directly before that gwen is explicitly told not to interfere with miles what about the intervening events changed things so dramatically i cant begin to guess and the movie certainly doesnt offer even a word of explanation

so those are the actual plot holes i would say there is also a huge storytelling problem because the main issue the canon breaking is completely abstract and imaginary its literally our computer models are telling us to do this this is just what the  incredibly weak storytelling imagine if instead of a big scary death star that we see blow up a whole planet in the first act star wars was all about our computer models show that the empire will win unless we follow the invisible way of the force which has no physical manifestation and is not spelled out clearly in any way",2023-06-04
anyone else not love it,2023-06-05
"watched it this afternoon and it was great…but…not as good as the first

visually it was stunning so many art styles in one movies including live action

storywise……meh took to long to get the to the actual plot of the movie and when it did it felt to short yes i know there’s a part two due next year

soundtrack…fantastic one of the highlights of the movie

i’m looking forward to the next one though and i’ll defo watch this again at some point",2023-06-05
"hmm so just want to vent abit here the movie is great animation and music wise however i have so many bones to pick with the story and the way it ended i feel like half of it is definitely due to the feeling the movie left me with the to be continue thing but i also just hate how they characterize every other spiderman in this movie like 2099 make sense he tried to break the so called canon event himself and suffer the consequences of it so it make sense that he have a personal feelings towards said issue but i cant for the life of me believed that the rest of the spidy least of all peter b parker and gwen would ever agreed to not try again when they could have save someone especially if that someone is miless father granted they make their own team in the end against the other spidy and all but they should have never even agreed with it to begin with also the idea of canon event in itself is  like we see how easily it can break just because gwen dad decided to not be a cop anymore and you cant tell me across an infinite universe that doesnt happen at all until gwen and miles turn on that topic if 2099 called miles an anomaly why would he even be so sure that miles would follow all other spider in their canon event also why would a multiverse be a thing if all event is supposed to playout the same anyway are all of them expected to go down the zombie path just because 1 zombieverse existed somewhere or maybe all universe will be destroyed by dr strange because he did it in multiple universe they even reference the mcu strange event so is the canon rule only applied to spidy or what

but again i guess im just feeling so mad at all these details mainly because of the to be continue thing and i would have overlooked alot of them without that thing so who knows",2023-06-06
"to be honest i found a lot of this movie kinda cringey after the first hour especially the spiderman india  i do appreciate the representation but it felt like the tiktok verison of what it meant to be indian

i really dislike the idea of spiderman being willing to sacrifice 1 person even for the whole universe at least without trying to save them before hand it goes against stories like no one dies which are all about that concept",2023-06-02
"something ive not seen mentioned when theyre going through the canon events one of the uncle ben deaths in the top right is from the  amazing spiderman 2 game

"every trailer before the movie was as awful as this was great

impressive",2023-06-04
"i loved this movie but had a hard time enjoying it at points because the audience was full of loud and annoying teenagers 

at the start of the movie group next to me starts screaming “are you all ready for this”  then someone behind us says “shut up” and the kid next to me says “f you loser” and i thought i was about to experience a full blown brawl 

at the end of the movie all i hear is disappointment and people throwing up their arms kid to the other side of me yells “i really paid 20 for that garbage” also i can’t forget how everyone around me was on their phone for what feels like half the movie 

i had such an incredible time other than that and would do anything to watch it again but with no one else in the theater i feel like the younger generation does not have a clue how to act in a theater or just simply doesn’t care",2023-06-04
the spot going from villain of the week committing low level theft to a multiversal eldritch  that probably not even an infinity gauntlet could take care of was a delight to watch,2023-06-04
literally didn’t feel like 2 hours at all now i’m going to spend my entire summer rewatching this movie and agonize over waiting for beyond the spiderverse that cliffhanger had me going insane,2023-06-04
"that was the best shot the best scored and the prettiest movie i have ever seen 

the only things it loses points on is the beginning fight with the vulture as much as i loved it did go on for a bit too long that and there were just a few like 35 too many jokes placed at bad moments the one that stuck out the most was when miguel was explaining all this heavy  to miles and spiderpunk cuts in with a oneliner that kills the mood ever so slightly

overall 9610",2023-06-05
"this movie proved that there is no superhero fatigue only bad movie fatigue

there are so many variants of so many characters and just as many locations yet all the same the movie remains concise and engaging the duration is the only element that i had an issue with granted its been a while since the first movie but all the same most character introductions and recaps were unnecessary and many dialogue scenes were far too long

edit spelling",2023-06-05
"late to the party but i just got out of the theater and wow overall i loved it

pros

 that was the most visually stunning movie i have ever seen you could take a still image of any moment in this movie and it would be just incredible art 

 the story was great it hit typical super hero beats while being its own thing 

 the music fit very well

 the different spidies were dope

cons

 the ending… what a tease people in my theater literally ’d out loud it was so abrupt 2 hours of build up for it to just end like that man… 

 the mixing was awful i thought it was just my theater but apparently it wasn’t that the dialogue was low the music not loud but louder than the dialogue they really need to do something about it because it was really distracting at first how quiet this movie was

 i’m torn on how i feel about the villain i like the on the nose theme of him and it was cool how he evolves throughout the movie but we never get to see that pay off which you can kind of blame the ending for

anyways solid 910 for me if this movie was 3 hours with the last 40 dedicated to the ending it would be been even better",2023-06-05
"utterly amazing film from beginning to end explored the tropes of being a superhero and the entire spiderman mythos while still being visually fantastic full of action and lots of fun 

its my favourite film of the year and if the finale is anything like the first two its going to be a classic cinema trilogy up there with star wars and lotr",2023-06-05
"well that was a  work of art gwen’s world is the most beautiful animation i have probably seen 

only small gripes for me is i felt the movie was a slight bit too long and i also felt like spot’s origin reminded me of jamie foxx’s electro in tasm 2 the nerdy guy who wants to be noticed or appreciated by spiderman to the villain who wants to destroy spiderman for casting him aside clearly spot is better but that parallel was weird for me",2023-06-05
"great movie got some criticisms i havent seen anybody mention though 

 sound mix i dont know if this is imax specific but the sound mix was the worst ive personally experienced in a movie theatre 

the music was booming the action fx were soft and the voices were even softer  it felt like my brain was an ai taking sentence fragments and formulating the rest 

 the first 14 of the movie with gwen really dragged for me again maybe because of the mix i wasnt as immersed but while it was interesting it felt wayy too slow

 specific nitpick but i thought the scene where gwen comes out of miles room was weird his parents really didnt react enough for me lol the girl just comes out of his room tells them she came through the window and miles is missing

 also i loathed every second of the dot he was just really annoying a cool villain idea but was so annoying and i was very happy his screen time was like 25",2023-06-07
"anyone else think that gwen will die in the next movie i feel like the movie foreshadowed that miles parents will be saved but gwen wont survive 

they gave her closure with her dad in this movie and added foreshadowing by telling us nothing good happens to gwen and spiderman also her telling her dad shell be right back kinda sealed it for me",2023-06-07
definitely enjoyed the first more could definitely tell this movie was made by a different director the third act pacing was abit all over the place and too long imo and i wish got more from 2099 but i loved everything else about this movie especially the soundtrack and visuals,2023-06-17
one thing i was confused about was miles not using his invisibility when he was getting chased by the spiderman army in nueva york did i miss a crucial piece of info here,2023-06-02
i think i like the 1st one more  there was too much family talk growing up bs and the 1st had plenty of that dont get me wrongi dunno it was alright not enough action in my opinion,2023-06-06
great film but disappointed with the music then again the first one set the standard so high it was impossible to match up especially with sunflower and whats up danger felt the film was missing that vibe song that went great with the story oh well hoping for that in the next film though,2023-06-06
"i loved most of movie

x200b

but seeing all the spidermen but miles go yea we just let them die and we are gunna stop you from trying was the most un spiderman thing i have seen in my life actually a bunch of spiderman teaming up together to do it even worse spidermen are supposed to do the right thing no matter what and find a way to fix the consequences cause thats who they work

i mean  even og spiderman tries to stop him for a bit the 

x200b

so anyways 

 hated that",2023-06-06
"the movie was good but not 910 good it was not as good as the first one


the visuals were again very good although at certain times there were far too many  happening in very little time which was annoying to watch other than that 1010 

the story however the story suffered a bit my best guess its because they made it into a two part series which i didnt knew about before going to see it 

it felt like often times we were dragging on and on without going anywhere miles has the same talk with his parents like 34 times and i seriously dont understand why he thinks that his parents will not love him if he tells them he is spiderman 

gwen is scared because her father hates spiderwoman and hunts her down but miles his dad and law enforcement have a good relationship with miles as spiderman and the previous spiderman has left a good legacy for the people so their struggle should be his parents worrying about his safety and wanting him to stop doing it 

the spider lady being very pregnant and on a bike should not have been on the main spiderman 2099 team but just another background spiderman it just looks so silly 

finally i cant help but notice that peter b parker is still kinda a joke sure he did get to fight his demons make up with mj and seemingly have a nice life but why does he have to walk around with a pink robe and have his kid with him cant mj look out for the kid while her husband is busy saving the multiverse 

feels like they try to keep the the one that looks the more like the og spiderman as a joke in fear of him stealing miles thunder if the team of spiderman was actually a small elite force as gwen first said thus no pregnant lady cmon i could understand our boy from 616 not being there but then we find out that literally every dimensions spiderman is over there so where is the og 

also the web stuff was kinda silly for me miguel was able to track 5he webbof destiny and see that miles father was bound to die in 2 days so you are telling me that dude can literally see the future how about going a bit past that point to see how events play out

also web of destine and  but madam web nowhere to be seen sad",2023-06-09
animation saved the movie pretty mid movie over all first one was significantly better,2023-06-11
"animation was great but i couldnt help but feel with all of the different spidermen it kind of cheapens the character itself  like why should i care about miles morales if theres another million universes with other spidermen the plot was also nothing special imo those saying this is the greatest superhero film of all time are sprouting hyperbole

overall rating for across the spiderverse 2023 710 amazing animation but personally wasnt invested in the characters",2023-06-11
i cant be the only one who saw the massive trans imagery in gwens entire universe,2023-06-03
"am i the only one who is of the opinion that miguel ohara was actually right all along and he really is the good guy and should be the leader 

because going through all these comments it looks like everyone is clearly on miles side even though hes risking the destruction of a whole universe 

it may just be me but i hate the trope of much loveydovey little feelings and emotions taking precedence over the perseverance of the universe

the story makes it very obvious that disrupting a canon event can easily snowball into destroying the universe eventually 

so at the cost of 1 single persons life we should risk all of existence what an awful idea another way of thinking about this is say that you know that you are about to approach a fork in the road 1 direction leads to a nonzero albeit an unquantified chance that the entire universe will eventually end at the end of this road meanwhile the other direction leads to a zero chance that this will happen but in order to take the second option you must pay the price of 1 life 

what a cheap and low price thats a steal almost literally

for sure its not fun and very sad for the immediate circle of the 1 life thats sacrificed but what you gain in return easily justifies the cost in such mind boggingly and nighincomprehensibly huge ways that this is a nobrainer 

also miles and nobody else here seems to realize that hes not actually saving his dadby stopping the spot from killing his dad he may very well guarantee that the whole universe dies the one where his dad dies with it and even his mom too lol so hes literally doing nothing actually 

dont know the name of this trope but it needs to die already",2023-06-07
"oh  donald glover is confirmed mcu prowler so the hypno hustler movie is  right it’s really a prowler movie 

uh yeah i’m fulfilled and happy and my life is wonderful and i still have another movie left just  visual splendor ramped up to 11 the vertical train sequence was a thing of beauty it’s the empire strikes back of spider man movies breaking everyone down to the lowest low straining the relationship between not just miles and gwen but peter b too a spiderdad figure mentor and now literally a spider dad mayday is adorable 

but the best part is really the imposter syndrome that’s dropped on miles pulling apart the confidence he built in into with the reveal that he’s the only miles in the spiderverse because the spider was an anomaly the recap sequence with him swinging through everything he’s gone though is a beauty with the confidence to end it on that with a dark mirror held up to miles of the fact that in earth42 jefferson’s death makes him the prowler balllsy very interesting can’t wait to see where we pick up 

and on a personal note it’ my heart so hard to see my guy miguel o’hara in this there was the joy in the first and this movie of seeing miles speak spanish and a little spanglish with his mom now i get that and the spiderman i grew up reading on the big screen being hilarious in spanish and straight up saying “ay coño” there’s power in representation and i just as elated as i was the first time around they even kept him as the 90’s edgelord

9510 but i’m confident it’ll be a 10 when combined with beyond this is two halves of a great story",2023-06-02
"i really wanted to love this movie but i just could not get on with it while i enjoyed the awesome art style and music even more than i did in the first one i felt the plot to be muddled the pacing was well out of whack and the writing was weak lots of trite repetitive dialogue and eyerolling quips and then the ending was the cherry on top for my  sundae

still tho looking forward to the next one as im really interested in the villains they set up and im expecting it to be more focussed",2023-06-05

this movie kinda ruins the principles of spiderman spiderman is meant to be someone that tries and save everyone no matter the consequences but then we see a group of spiderman that we do know insomniac spectacular the gang from the previous movie and they just let people die cause they ‘have to’ and they’re all ok with it i mean they got some slight conflicting feelings but they do it and do it often but it’s a good movie i just hope the next movie we see miles be a bit more aggressive to them and call their actions out and they don’t make a joke about it,2023-06-03

"i think the track of the second movie seems abundantly clear and that makes me even more excited miles defeats himself in a symbolic battle just in time for miles friends to arrive and see the outcome of this battle the two battling spiderpeople teams converge in miles universe as the spot begins his attack miles saves his father despite the other teams best effort to stop him and guess what  they were wrong the spiderpeople team up and take down the spot not without a couple casualties probably gwen and miles proclaim their love miles tells his parents the truth and the spider people are no longer dedicated to protecting the canon but protecting as many lives as they can no matter what something like that 

also one random prediction hobie is  the air of the love triangle is taken out when we realize that hobie is  and his support for gwen has nothing to do with any romantic feelings between them just seems like a weird joke theyd do on miles that hed been jealous for no reason",2023-06-02

"everyone be talking about hobie which is fair but  pavitr prabhakar stole the entire show for me when i was walking home after the film all i could think about was the sounds and colours of mumbaihattan hes just so fun and talky and witty and his design looks  sick i was so sad he wasnt as featured going on but

not as sad as the noticeable lack of a certain emissary from  ",2023-06-02
"what is that

its a metaphor for capitalism

spiderpunk was hilarious",2023-06-02
"as someone who was disappointed with spyderbyte and her being the only black woman spiderwoman in the comics  her depiction and backstory was much improved here

jessica drew was amazing too and it was quite the relief to see bw be an active nonvr spiderwoman with actual powers i feel the comics always dropped the ball on that the same way they never let miles and miguel interact

hobie was an absolute delight

and scarlet spider had be cackling i need a scene with him and spiderman noir in the next one

i really liked the callback to the glitching spider of the first film

the second film cant land fast enough eventhough ive got to rewatch this one at least another three times

this definitely deserves a second best animation oscar",2023-06-02
i quite liked the movie that aside i really think the story had more problems than spots spots so you are telling somehow miguel is the bad guy here every word he said aside from the angry you are a mistake was the absolute truth miles is acting like a total dumb teenager which is admiteddly fitting and the india scene where they act like saving the police officer was so important while the fallen alchemax building rips through several skyscrapers killing possibly thousands and they save what 2030 people could go on but dont want to sound overly negative,2023-06-02
did anyone else think the scene where gwen and miles keep thinking shoot while watching the hologram showing how spot gained further powers was an homage to the famous scene in the wire where the two detectives work a crime scene and only say ,2023-06-03
"really great overall though i preferred the first one the animation was just as good as the original as was the voice cast script direction and music i loved the spot he was a much more effective villain than kingpin and probably my favourite character in the film overall managing to strike a great balance between being humorous and being threatening i also really liked miguel spiderman india and peter b lots of great easter eggs and references as well

as for weaknesses i thought the sound mixing made dialogue quite hard to hear and the animation while beautiful was a bit too frenetic to follow during fight scenes though neither of these were a deal breaker my biggest issue with the film is its plot which is a substantial downgrade compared to the first putting aside that most of it is just setup and exposition for the next film resulting in pacing issues and flabbiness compared to the much tighter plot of the first film how the film handles the canon concept is a complete misunderstanding of spiderman as a character it was especially egregious to see peter essentially refer to uncle ben as a necessary sacrifice there is just no way peter or any other spiderman would just stand aside and let people die they would try and save everyone and even if they failed they would try again and again until they succeeded miles was the only one to act in character on that point which is pretty eyerolling if your plot requires you to character assassinate most of your main cast in order for it to work it needs a rethink and if the whole canon aspect turns out to be nonsense in the third film as i suspect it will then all but one of the spidermen in the multiverse have been made accessories to  abysmal

still as i said overall the ride was very enjoyable despite the plot issues im looking forward to the final instalment hopefully it will address some of the problems here",2023-06-03
"i watched this movie in motion activated seats and the cold open with gwen ramping up the intensity on the drums was incredible each time she slammed the drums the seat shook in response the audio of her monologue and the imagery on the screen paired with the motion from the seats made for a unforgettably gripping intro 

and that was just the first 3 minutes",2023-06-03
i found it interesting that a lot of talk from  comic book people is that miles m is not the real spiderman  in the movie the antagonist to miles is miguel o who argues that hes not a real spiderman and miles having to fight for himself,2023-06-03
i’m sorry but this may be the greatest movie i’ve ever seen,2023-06-03
"i really felt overloaded with all the references like it felt really dense at times which is my one and only major criticism of this

this had a lot of emotional heft to it and crescendo in a way that leaves me quite excited for the sequel

the end credits of this was magnificent maybe one of the best things ive visually seen

810",2023-06-03
"about halfway through the movie i was thinking to myself huh the pacing is kinda slow how are they going to fit a big fight scene and ending in

i guess the answer is they dont i feel like this really didnt need to be a twoparter and not knowing before hand seeing the to be continued crawl kinda soured my experience of the movie which sucks because the visuals were absolutely fantastic",2023-06-04
"as great as into the spiderverse was i went in with low expectations its a sequel after all
 
this is undoubtedly one of the best sequels ever executed if they stick the landing with beyond the spiderverse this will have reached peter jacksons lotr levels of masterpiece",2023-06-04
honestly i think i like the spiderverse movies more than most of the mcu spiderman stuff,2023-06-04
i did not realise this movie was a two parter i just feel a bit annoyed great movie i wanted a conclusion though,2023-06-04
"its been a long time since i was in awe of a movie genuinely i think since the first avatar this was on that level beautiful visuals and i love how they drew the spot after he was corrupted by dark matter like that was some junjo ito  and im all for it

seriosuly best movie ive seen in years",2023-06-04
"no one is talking about the soundtrack which is a total banger 

love how the themes merged when spiderpeople teamed up",2023-06-05
loved the movie but a minor criticism it felt kind of unbelievable that miles managed to evade what appeared to be literally hundreds of spiderpeople many of whom are surely far more experienced than him for so long and in territory they’re all familiar with the whole chase scene was incredibly cool and emotionally resonant so i don’t care that much but it felt a bit odd,2023-06-05
i cannot be the only one that had trouble understanding what spiderpunk was saying for a good chunk of his screen time  not bashing daniel kaluuya at all his performance was great and the movie is a 1010 but i just couldn’t handle his heavy accent now that i’m thinking about it…i probably am the only one who had trouble understanding him,2023-06-05
a year and four months has past i think it was four and gwens hair has grown but she has kept the buzz cut in it from her time with miles,2023-06-05
its so ,2023-06-05
has anyone else noticed the spot’s real name dr johnathan ohnn “johnny on the spot”,2023-06-05
we have to see supaidaman in beyond right they pretty much teasedconfirmed it was totally expecting him to appear in atsv,2023-06-06
"when the to be continued showed on screen someone yelled what the  and the entire theater erupted with laughter and shock 

this was the most ambitious animated film ive ever seen the amount of pure artistic style and passion poured into it blew me away",2023-06-06
"saw it two times noticed the second time that miguel is inserting spider venom in his bloodstream

makes you think if he really is spiderman 

also i miss the stan lee cameo so much",2023-06-06
"it was really good but the story made no sense 1 miles already had his canon deathofalovedone event 2 if hes an anomaly and not supposed to be spiderman why would there be a spiderman canon event that he could interrupt

also as long as the movie was i wouldve loved a more fleshed out intro peter pulls a vial out of nowhere and turns into the lizard for seemingly no reason",2023-06-07
just watched it a 2nd time  love this movie so much if the 3rd is just as good as the 2nd or 1st then this will be the greatest trilogy of all time,2023-06-07
"really good movie but didn’t really care for rio much though 

thought it was kinda weird that she was telling miles to basically go spread his wings and be sure to bring cake when he comes home don’t remember exactly what was said whenever miles is 15  

felt like a good speech whenever he’s about to leave for the adult world not whenever he’s 15 and supposed to be back in the house at night",2023-06-15
rio  miles mom was the hottest in the film do yall think arron was with 42 miles mom,2023-06-17
"absolutely loved this film my only complaints were the liveaction inserts which didnt fit donald glovers prowler or were out of place prior live action bits these are hard to do well in any film so i cant fault the effort they were jarring enough to take out of the film is all i also dislike jess drew as a character i loved her in the prologue but when she reappeared in the plot she lost all her charm and wlseemed like a different character

the worst to happen was i missed the end because i couldnt hold it in and not realizing how long it had been ran to the bathroom only to come back to credits",2023-06-19
"as a spidey fan im very disappointed nothing happens in this movie character assassinated peter parker to make miles look better as an indian the only cool part was pavitra prabhakar 

please please peter deserves better after all hes the og spiderman and stop making 2hr filler movies to set up the next one hollywood 

i get its a part of a franchise but even spiderman 2 2004 was able to stand on its own which is arguably the best of the spidey flicks",2023-08-11
so am i crazy or was this the best spiderman movie ever half made,2023-06-02
"i feel like im the only one who is holding back a rating or review until this story is complete  i guess one could argue if this was a tv series one would rate each episode  but this movie didnt make an attempt at telling you this was going to be multiple movies  i heard that in some news articles a few years ago it was mentioned but thats a long time ago and it wasnt highly advertised  i wish movies just put a part 1 or volume 1 at the beginning so we know what were in for  i have that feeling lied to feeling atm

i blame matrix reloaded for the trendcash grab  i think others are saying this is like empire strikes back  i also heard dune at least put a part 1 in their movie

great movie though  except the ending  cliffhanger was a bit melodramatic for my taste",2023-06-10
the slow start bored me but luckily it got a lot better i loved it and im  off i have to wait 10 more months for the ending i wasnt aware it was split in 2 parts,2023-06-02
"well that was certainly something

feel totally bombarded with sensory overload  not sure if i enjoyed it or not",2023-06-04
it’s pacing wasnt the best the beginning before miles goes through the portal went on for so long the chase scene the one with the spidermen felt like it lasted forever too,2023-06-04
i wish i had been warned about all the flashing lights and overly bright colorsquick image shifts  i love miles morales story line everything mcu and spiderman  but i was sick as a dog after the movie with a blistering migraine and almost vomiting  i had to go to bed which i never do  i don’t have epilepsy or any other disorders except i do get motion sickness  i wish the studio had not used so many visual effects  i could not even watch the movie hardly just peeking at times  thank goodness for reddit and videos that break down the movie so i can listen to the plot line and the things i just could not watch,2023-06-06
"i dont know if im misinterpreting it but i kind of fundamentally disagree with the core conflict of the movie

miguel wants to ensure that miles father dies as per it being a canon event miguel accepts the fact that spiderman always loses someone close to him and it should always happen no matter how bad it is otherwise the multiverse will unravel and everyone will die

obviously miles doesnt want that to happen and believes that its possible to save both his father and the multiverse thus miles attempts to do that

and what miles is doing is the most spiderman choice to ever be made so i dont understand how miguel or literally every other spiderman in the multiverse doesnt understand where miles is coming from every single spiderman should try and save everyone possible because thats what spiderman does even if that attempt is in vain spiderman wouldnt care and he would try anyways

it honestly really took me out of the movie so can someone explain to me why my reasoning is wrong",2023-06-07
not having a conclusion killed this movie for me ngl like i’m legit frustrated by it one of the worst endings in recent films,2023-06-07
"this film is nothing short of outstanding spectacular amazing etc you name it

but for me personally it pales in comparison to the second one the  first one is ingrained in my soul this one is just not as good as itsv",2023-06-08
idk i didn’t like this movie personally loved the first one though i just cant share the excitement with this one,2023-06-09
movie felt too long art was great,2023-06-11
"ending was very meh for me

i honestly hate when movies do a cut off ending like that nephew was pretty disappointed too kept asking when the movie was actually gonna finish  and i dont really see how they have another movies worth of stuff to do",2023-06-02
man i am going to be in the minority but i really dont like the slow pacing at times and how the movie cant stand on its own it just feels weak to me especially when we know most of the payoff i really loved the rest of it but it didnt feel like an actual movie more than half of a season of a show,2023-06-03
so was i supposed to know this was a part 1  that ending was jarring,2023-06-04
i’m just super confused how this is going to go into another two and half hour movie they literally ended during the rising action,2023-06-04
"i am very conflicted about this movie

on the one hand i agree with what most people have already said the animation is beautiful the jokes land hobie is great etc

on the other

1 gwen peter b and peni not to mention spectacular spiderman joining up with miguel seemed very out of character for them actually the fact that miguel had so many allies at all just didnt make sense to me miguel really has no concrete proof that him living in another universe caused that universe to collapse i just cant see most spiderpeople who tend to be scientifically inclined believing the theory of one guy based on one incident thats bad science the only spiderpeople i could see allying with him are young relatively inexperienced ones who had just been through one of the canon events where they lost a loved one and whose grief was clouding their senses miguels theory would at least make their losses mean something in their eyes
2 i just cant believe that after everything miles has been through with peter b and gwen that they would keep so much from him and think that his father dying is the right thing and that gwen was willing to let her own father die it bothered me so much that im seriously on the fence about whether or not that ruined their characters for me
3 there were references that you wouldnt understand if you hadnt seen the latest liveaction marvel movies from the mcu and sony i know the spiderverse movies are a celebration of spiderman and all his incarnations but to me theyre also a celebration of animation and its various styles and giving screen time to liveaction characters however brief felt like an insult we already got tobey and andrew in no way home we dont need to see them here im praying that they and tom dont show up in the sequel 
4 why in gods name did they have jessica drew participate in fight scenes while she was pregnant does miguel not allow maternity leave or what working while pregnant is one thing but if your work is inherently dangerous then doing so puts your baby in harms way i just cant believe that no one on the writing team thought that was a bad idea",2023-06-08
visually its a mess compared to the first one felt like every shot had 30 different things going on it gets genuinely exhausting after a while,2023-06-08
obviously the animation is beautiful but man by the end of this it felt like i watched the first act of a movie i couldn’t believe that was it and did anyone else keep getting that “this is the end of the movie” feeling multiple times during the last 20 minutes scene that ends in swelling music than another scene that ends in swelling music than another scene that ends in swelling music jesus idk the first movie is masterpiece to me but this is the most incomplete part 1 i’ve ever watched also where the  was supaidaman i thought i read a while ago that he was supposed to be in this,2023-06-09
"movie sucks





















in that it was too short",2023-06-11
this is peak cinema what a time to be a spiderman fan,2023-06-02
"a master class in story telling and animation once again

how do you follow up one of the most when’re defining character defining animated films of the last decade

somehow they did it you care about the characters behind the mask their plights give them more depth and elevate the personal stakes 

despite being a fantastical setting everything feels personal real and relatable 

banger soundtrack banger animation the perfect amount of spidey fan service 

 they did it again folks 

us spidey fans are eating good again with the ps5 game too

 i love this movie",2023-06-02
i was not expecting to love this more than the first but here we are only complaint is that we have to wait a year for part 2,2023-06-02
miguel is from the future right  so he took over the life of a technically past civilian version of himself ,2023-06-02
spectacular spiderman was the best part of the film and got way more than i expected him to getyes i have a huge bias,2023-06-02
"miles choosing to save everyone and not choose one over the other compared to how ohara and the spidersociety are subservient to that multiversal destiny is a great distinction in how he is a better superhero than the rest of them

reminded me of captain america saying we dont trade lives in endgame",2023-06-02
"amazing movie but i plan on reviewing it properly after my second viewing on saturday

mostly because there was a guy talking at full volume for the whole movie who didnt respond to people telling him to be quiet",2023-06-02
miles will be able to save his dad because he’s not supposed to be spiderman which means he can write his own future feels a little too simple though,2023-06-02
"fantastic movie overall i need to see it frame by frame because there is so many fun callbacks to all spidermen starting with the obvious 

 spiderman 2099 mentioning tom holland and dr strange’s almost universe ending incursion
 mrs chen from venom making a cameo
 donald glover as the prowleraaron davis which was established in homecoming
 spiderman ps4 cameo x 3 ganke playing it on his pc between the two other game ones point meme
 andrew garfield cameo to gwen stacey’s dad dying
 spectacular spiderman telling miles they all had to sacrifice something
 tobey maguire cameo with uncle ben just dead in the corner 
 alfred molina voice over the original doc ock comic design 
 jk simmons jjj voice for several news reports

and so so much more i am missing man these two movies do a really good job with miles whatever sony has planned for a live action movie has a really high bar to reach

personally i think they should just have him step into secret wars as a cameo but a lot of people don’t think that’ll make sense even if it is beyond the spiderverse we’ll see though",2023-06-02
the dimension that didn’t have a spiderman was it because the earth 42 spider didn’t bite a peter parker or didn’t bite miles morales so he became the prowler instead in that dimension,2023-06-02
loved the comic book cutup panel shots with different action going on,2023-06-02
that movie was  sick it just oozed cool i def need to see it again,2023-06-02
action packed  to be continued,2023-06-02
"the movie is magical script wise but what absolutely floored me was the style and choices in animation 

like how it just drastically changed from frame to frame within a dialogue scene what a killer choice to just “do their own thing” and it really made the style stand out

each character determined what animation style was needed 

especially the scenes with gwen and her father just wow absolutely love this movie",2023-06-02
i was just so happy to see lego spiderman lol gwen steals this movie the artwork and score are sensational ending was a bit anti climatic but it was known it was going to be a two part movie,2023-06-02
"holy  what an incredible experience

never have i look forward to watch a movie again in a week with friends",2023-06-02
miles talking to his mom at the end had me shook when i realized that wasnt his mom,2023-06-02
they actually topped the first one holy ,2023-06-02
"just came back from the cinema with the biggest smile i can have 

what an amazing movie full of tiny amazing details nods to almost every single spiderman character created to the mcu

the animation is even better than the first one i loved gwens universe style like a waterpaint that changed colors

schwartzmann stole the movie for me as the bad guy being a goofy normal guy turning into a thanos level menace guy

cant wait for part 2 1010",2023-06-02
"jk simmons as jjj is a nexus event confirmed

loved the movie feel like i need a 2nd and maybe 3rd viewing in order to determine if i like it as much or more than the 1st one

started off a bit slower and more backstory heavy than i wouldve prefered but once it got going holy  did it get going miles escape was probably the most exhilarating scene ive seen in years

the humor in this puts every other marvel property to shame imo and this is coming from a big mcu fan simply elite comedic writing",2023-06-02
i love how funny this movie is but at some point the jokes stopped and i didnt even notice because of how engrossed i was into the story,2023-06-02
how did hobie get his watch back when he tossed it on the ground after quitting the team and going back to his dimension,2023-06-02
the score for this thing kicks absolute ,2023-06-02
that’s a prowler not your prowler it’s rude to stare awesome donald easter egg,2023-06-02
miles is him,2023-06-02
i loved seeing donald glover as the prowler,2023-06-02
for once in my life the movie ending on a cliffhanger makes me really happy across the spiderverse is clearly a product of love and it surpassed into so i am certain that ending the story in beyond is mainly due to storytelling and not profit,2023-06-02
miguel o hara was a  menace truly a great movie,2023-06-02
as a spiderman fan that owns a lot of the early comics in omnibus format the easter egg containing a panel from the last page of the amazing spiderman 90 from november 1970 was incredible,2023-06-02
all the action was incredible the humor was on point and the animation was some of the best ive ever seen,2023-06-02
"this movie broke me in a way that needed to be broken 

i don’t know if i can speak for anyone else but i got very attached to the first movie and the characters within them but only as they existed there gwen and peter b weren’t entities merely engines to push miles forward never given a hard enough spotlight to expose their flaws it took me a good halfhour of sitting on the movie to realize the weird feeling in my gut was the same betrayal miles felt that two characters i love would hear miguel talk about miles in such a way and agree 

and it made sense they did it in a way that made sense the movie’s approach to nihilism how the inevitability of bad must also mean the embrace of bad is perfectly reflected in the two of them 

man what a needed gut punch",2023-06-02
honestly sony should stick to doing animated spiderman movies while marvel studios should stick to doing live action ones,2023-06-02
"it is a nearly perfect movie the only issue i have with it is that unlike every other movie that is split into two parts this one doesnt feel like a movie of its own 

it feels like it ends right after the seconds act

which i get it its a long movie with a long story but it feels like it ends halfway through",2023-06-02
"so i definitely remember this was announced as twoparter but i was still a bit underwhelmed by the end mostly unresolved but still found the entire movie thoroughly engaging and fun all the way whole theater definitely let out a resounding “mmmmmchttt”

the opener was a great contrast to itsv and gwen’s world and animation are strikingly gorgeous the layers of easter eggs were also something else sony have actually done a decent job at maintaining their canon here and seeing little nods here and there at both the venomverse and mcu among countless others were very gratifying and a bit of a relief to see the tying of the “canon moments” and seeing lines of spidermen from andrew and tobey down to gwen and miles it was fan service but fan service that literally ties the story together and couldn’t be done better the actual donald glover in prowler costume 

the new spider people were fantastic really i couldn’t get enough of them especially punk and india the implication of miles’ bite which in hindsight is brilliant when you look back at the spider in itsv all time stand out though for me is the lego marvel universe  “you’re one of our best” literally had me crying this movie is what multiverse of madness needed to be

for all the missteps sony have had this movie really gave me faith they have a better understanding of what fans want to see and fingers crossed they keep this momentum with madame webb and kraven i’d love to see them take the limitations of what they can or can’t work with and extend them into the stories ie if the spider society operates concurrent to the tva or not michael keaton’s vulture being another anomaly in the wind the symbiote “hivemind” etc",2023-06-02
i had no idea this was only part 1 and had no idea 2hrs flew by  the pacing in this movie was incredible was never bored and it felt so fast i still cant believe it was 2hrs,2023-06-02
honestly better than i couldve dreamed of it was somehow even more inventive than the first movie in all the right ways the visuals the emotions the characters it was all done so well it was just perfect and i wouldve been ready to rewatch it right away if i could,2023-06-02
this was one of my favorite theater experiences of all time,2023-06-02
what an amazing piece of art,2023-06-02
can someone tell me what gwen asked jessica drew to do to her in the vulture fight,2023-06-02
"just got out of the movie i am blown away as a lifelong spiderman fan this movie provided fan service in every way possible but fan service aside just like into the spiderverse it was a fresh story that had godly animation emotional arcs themes about identity and becoming your own spiderman as well as fantastic voice acting

when the movie was over i was in shock because i was ready to watch another two hours when the “to be continued” came up it caught me so off guard i cannot wait a 
year i feel like it’s hard to compare this movie to the first one because the overarching story is not over yet but what is on pace to accomplish can and i can confidently say will be incredible",2023-06-02
"so it looks like i’ll be in the minority here but i thought this movie had some serious pacing issues i keep asking myself if the movie really needed its slow first act to justify all the big big moments in the second half and the answer i keep reaching is… no not after a whole first movie to build the relationships we end up seeing 

i personally think the first half dragged a lot it felt too slow making the unadvertised tbc at the end all the more infuriating then again the fact that i was dying to see more means they did a  good job

overall a good movie but with frustrating pacing for what ultimately seems like a move to get more cash out of a third movie but i did still love it

also i don’t understand why miles has to have two awful life tragedies do they ever explain that it doesn’t make sense to me for him to have an extra canon event…",2023-06-02
the animators must have really liked that gwen ponytail look they made every excuse to have her be upside down,2023-06-02
if into the spiderverse was about anyone can wear the mask then across the spiderverse is about what it means to dawn the mask dare i say the responsibility of the mask what it means to be spiderman the responsibility of it all the mantle of spiderman weighs miles down the impact of it all is it too much across the spiderverse is a phenomenal movie not just a great spiderman movie but overall an amazing movie it asks if pain and loss is essential for ones character growth and if thats just a part of life we have to accept everyone is saying this and thats because its true but this movie blows the animation out of the water even compared the 1st one which is saying something its just jaw droppingly gorgeous and i need it to be surgically fueled into my bloodstream take everything out of art museums and replace it with screen caps of this film this is art and animation is cinema i think its easily got the 2023 oscar for best animated and should be nominated for best picture even this movie is about more than spiderman its about the human experience i love how much time we get to spend with miles not spiderman but miles himself it feels like something that wouldnt happen these days its a spiderman movie get on with the spidermaning but thats just it the character of milespeter  the human side of it is so ingrained into the character of spiderman it feels very akin to spiderman 2 in that way on the review end of it all it does start a bit slow but theres so much to set up its understandable it builds on the characters you know and loved from the first movie while introducing new characters that youll come to love it is the perfect sequel to into the spiderverse some might not love what this movie does  but it does what it needs to do to get us to where we need to be for beyond the spiderverse but once it starts going it doesnt stop the soundtrack by daniel pemberton is once again spectacular the music as well is great by metro booming and if you want easter eggs its got plenty and the big question of it all is it the best spiderman movie i really need to see it again but dare i say yes across the spiderverse understands the character of spiderman and the humanity of the characters on a core level the mortality of it this is the quintessential spiderman movie if this is the standard of quality i am over the moon excited for the finale beyond the spiderverse i highly highly recommend this movie and cannot wait to see it a million more times,2023-06-02
very good to great movie need to watch again to catch all the jokes obviously very visually impressive the story takes some twists but i’m excited for part 2 i definitely would’ve enjoyed this one more if i knew it was a part 1 also 25 minute prologue on a long  movie is not what’s up,2023-06-02
i think i spoiled myself on many of the jokes just by watching the sheer amount of trailers out there they unfortunately cut out the mario kart joke,2023-06-02
i was wondering why miles needs both his dad and his uncle to die but i guess tom hollands spiderman and the ps4 spidey also had two important people die in their canon events and of course i guess aunt may and gwen die in multiple other universes,2023-06-02
"saw it in imax yesterday and it was something else everything about  it was amazing and the visuals where the cherry on top 

haven’t been interested in the live action comic book movies for years so it’s great to still have an alternative with a lot of care and a lot of heart also great to that yuri lowenthal got a speaking cameo all be it very brief 

didn’t feel like it was over two hours at all and was my favourite theatre experience in a very long time",2023-06-02
my favorite part was when spiderpunk approved mayday was lit,2023-06-02
man i was so hyped that they brought back the same music for the opening title drop,2023-06-02
"loved the movie one of the best pieces of cinema ive ever seen the to be continued was some  though i am 100 fine with them deciding that they couldnt tell the story in one movie but call it across the spiderverse part 1 or something so i know its just gonna deadass stop in the absolute middle of the story just seems weird for a trilogy to basically be movie 1 then movie 2 parts 1  2 

still cant complain too much as it was truly fantastic during the massive chase scene i got a feeling of awesomeness overload that ive only ever gotten from 2 other films  mad max fury road and the first avengers film 

lego spider man was so  funny too much preferred this cast of alternative spiders to the first film still hate the  spiderpig thing",2023-06-02
i  love this movie all i hope considering this trilogy has been about multiverses and all is that we get symbiotes into the mix as well venom i feel is integral to spiderman like for example earth 42 has no spider man instead it has a prowler what if that earths peter finds the symbiote and uses it to be spiderman idk i just want to see a little bit of venom or maybe even a carnage easter egg,2023-06-02
"the magic of this movie is being able to flesh out multiple people in this ridiculously large cast of characters even with his limited runtime i’m so happy at how much they were able to get out of the spot and i’m thoroughly invested in seeing how that plot line plays out also the focus on gwen’s story throughout the film was a nice change of pace and felt much needed since she’s basically the secondary protagonist

the story also has an amazing set up that is super creative taking full advantage of this spiderverse premise it’s extremely compelling but it’s main conflict is introduced about halfway into the film which brings me to my biggest criticism

the only real issue i have with this movie is that it feels like a part 1 this is just not a complete movie and despite ending on such a high note it’s not a satisfying cliffhanger it’s like i just pressed pause halfway through a movie so that i could continue it later despite this i think it’s better than something like dune because i’m already invested in this world so i’m more than willing to deal with half a story for a payoff

it helps that this movie is so well paced i barely felt those 2 and a half hours fly by it was filled with engaging emotional beats great action and humor and some of the most stunning animation i’ve ever seen seriously this might be the most gorgeous movie i’ve ever seen in a theater

i guess a minor nitpick is some of the cameos specifically that store owner from venom it’s cute but reminded me of some cheap fan service from no way home instead of being natural additions to the film same with that donald glover cameo

overall this is a great  movie and i love it a lot but i do think it is weaker than the first movie but it’s also just half a movie mainly setup however if btsv is on the level of this movie then i think this might end up being a better film than itsv

while most of the characters didn’t reach the highs of the last movie spiderham spiderman noir the plot was so engaging i dint even notice the time so when it ended i was genuinely surprised that it was such a cliffhanger and tbh i don’t think we’ve had a good cliffhanger in a while,2023-06-02
"one thing i haven’t seen mentioned is that when miles gwen and hobie are going to see miguel for the first time hobie steals a piece of tech off the wall and puts it on as a ring

was this a possible foreshadowing to him building his own multiverse device for later on in the film",2023-06-02
"ok so this was a good part 1 it will be a great movie when part 2 comes out 

i feel like they struggled a bit to keep the pace going in the first half and i felt gwens storyline needed a little bit more development for it to be the emotional climax of the film it needed a scene in the middle of her dad because with everything going on i kind of forgot about him

there was a bit too much back and forth in the first half but the second half was great but maybe not as a great if youre not a spider nerd my girlfriend didnt understand most of the references and it started to grate on her a bit lol and shes a casual spider man fan too

i thought it was great not as good as the first but i dont think anyone thought it would be its busy but thats ok",2023-06-02

i could be wrong but was gwen’s hair color changing to reflect her mood from scene to scene i thought i noticed blue when she was reminiscing about her band and peter then to a more lighter blonde when she gave her dad a hug if so that’s a really cool touch,2023-06-02
this movie was so freakin good,2023-06-02

who wouldve thought an animated spiderman movie would be peak art,2023-06-02
"where to begin
for starters i absolutely loved this movie so much of course the animation is top tier i can go on and on about this so let me boil it down into dot points

 the spot was awesome from the start as a goofy villain but  dude went from a cow to a literal 

 the whole story telling with ohara explaining to miles he was the first anomaly and with the 
42 spider insane  and then going to the universe the spider was created without a spiderman

 i loved all the mcu references and seeing all the live action cinematography and spiderman scarlet and insomniacs spiderman wow what a sight to see

i know im missing so much but thats just how good this movie is",2023-06-02
we have two really great multiverse movies back to back with main villain associates with bagel coincidence i think not,2023-06-02
"no notes it was such a fantastic movie 
  
i didnt catch what they said about doctor strange though what was that about",2023-06-02
man walking out of the theater i felt like that meme where homelander is saying it’s perfect this movie was absolutely spectacular definitely buying the steel book when it comes out,2023-06-02
"the ending was a sopranos level cliffhanger

i didn’t see the first one and was bored yesterday so i figured i’d go see this movie i thought it was an excellent film with beautiful animation and colors — and i see why the animators of  in boots replicated it the part where gwen was talking to her father right before she leaves again was animated extremely well and the lines were very touching 

knowing what i’ve heard about the first movie i was able to piece together everything that was going on pretty quickly and enjoy the film

edit i’m reading a lot of comments on this post and i’m seeing more people had problems with the sound mixing in their theater i was wondering about that myself because the part where gwen was drumming at the beginning was hard to hear her lines over the drums i’m glad i wasn’t the only one hopefully sony can fix that real quick and send it back out to the theaters",2023-06-02
i haven’t watched this movie but without spoilers how is the soundtrack my favorite moment from the first movie is mile’s first web sling and how the music is used in that scene,2023-06-02
i for one am super glad they didn’t have an after credit scene  i think it’s absence really let that ending marinate in my brain and a quippy scene would have absolutely ruined that,2023-06-02
so many frames from this movie i want turned into paintings to put on my wall the first film was really good looking but this one was legitimately beautiful,2023-06-02
fantastic movie but if you didnt know there was a 3rd one coming out the ending was jarring at least 34 people said some variation of wait what are you serious etc after the movie ended i purposefully avoided any trailersinfo about this movie so i was blindsided by it too lol,2023-06-02
i looked at the time right before the movie ended and was wondering how they were going to wrap everything up as we were well past the 2 hour mark so  i have to wait for part 2 but  was that a fantastic movie,2023-06-02
at some point during the opening credits i think after the comics code authority thing there was a flash of blue and red in the bottom right corner did anyone catch what it said,2023-06-02
"spidey fans eating good

truly the only marvel movie i endlessly enjoyed after no way home

also rewatching into the spiderverse before going to the theatre was a correct choice",2023-06-02
"i was a bit hesitant going into the cinema watching into the spiderverse and i recall myself thinking why is everything so blurry then once the movie pacing pickup it didnt miss a beat

i thought it was the best spiderman story ever even more than the cartoon and movie i grew up with with such an incredible twist to the plot

and across the spiderverse topped the game in animation personally i think the first movie is slightly just ever so slightly better because the plot is more self contained but the larger universe with gwen taking a bigger role is very interesting as well

i absolutely cannot wait the next movie to come",2023-06-02
i love the film but i hope in the third movie peter b parker wont just be a glorified babysitter he was my favorite character in the first film and im a bit disappointed we dont get more of him here,2023-06-02
miguel having fangs being called vampire and go back machine remind me very much of comic spider verse run i hope final part will deliver same amount if not more emotions that i felt today,2023-06-02
"i honestly would be just fine with movies that take place in one universe at a time 

dont get me wrong these movies are perfection but miles and gwens solo parts of the films were top notch and id watch an entire two hours of them living their normal spider lives outside of the multiverse 

id watch a solo film of any of the spiders in this franchise",2023-06-02
is there any good samaritan out there know the song name at the end of the movie like the part where credits are playing thanks,2023-06-02
"there were a lot of cool scenes in this movie that chase sequence with hundreds of spidermen was even better than i expected

the story was quite interesting too and the spot is definitely one of the more interesting supervillains ive seen

i enjoyed this even more than the first one they really stepped up the visuals in this one",2023-06-02
"i enjoyed the movie but i was confused by the story why was miles’ world still fine if he was an anomaly that shouldn’t exist as spider man miguel said that his peter was not meant to die and the spider that bit miles came from earth 42 but no one asked why miles’ universe was not affected by the glitch did miguel stop it from getting worse did miles fix it in the first movie by shutting down the machine i dont remember it well i should go back to watch the first one again

also did miles have to become the prowler in every universe he was in or did he become prowler only because his world had no spiderman do the comics have any clues about this

i dont know what they want to do with the story in the next part but i think the idea of miles being a villain by default makes it so interesting it makes miles morales spiderman even more unique",2023-06-02

"the sound of the dialogue at my theater was a little lownot sure if others had that problem 

but anyways i think i understood miguels speech about the canon event what i didnt understand is why it was necessary to let miles father die didnt miles already have his canon event with his uncle even though he wasnt supposed to be spiderman since the spider that bit him wasnt from his universe",2023-06-02
"such a great movie and absolutely amazing animation all the scenes between gwen and her dad were just so beautifully animated the way the colors portrayed mood was amazing

but the movie being so good i think led me to a little disappointment with the cliffhanger ending",2023-06-02

can i see this without having seen the first one,2023-06-02
"super great film i had a blast end to end though i was a bit annoyed that it drops into a cliffhanger

cementing this film the mcu and every other side story including the videogames  in to a shared multiverse was really cool  rolling all of their shared backstory elements in to the canon events was a fun way to explain the similarities miles peter gwen other peter etc keep explaining this backstory that they all share in some form or another it keeps happening over and over maybe its time to break the cycle maybe its not it makes for a compelling conflict

every frame is made with such attention to detail and passion its incredible several times i got emotional thinking about the artistic and creative love put in to this project i was worried it would be a copy of the previous movie in terms of style but they took it to a whole new level mumbattan was so fun and unique gwens water color world was beautiful lego peter is a credit to the spiderbureau

i kinda wished for more of the multiversal details like how hammer space was one of vultures traits it made the fight seem like a videogame fight in a really cool way what other traits to other universes get we see a 2d spiderman so i guess thats one

somehow poe dameron managed to make it through the movie without becoming a fullon villain despite almost eating vulture for lunch he never really crossed the line at any point hes just very zealous",2023-06-02
this is one of the most beautiful movies i’ve ever seen just the opening 10 minutes with gwen and the renaissance vulture was breathtaking,2023-06-02
"this might seem like a dumb question but  


did the mcu spiderman just cause multiple canonical disruptions by saving all those villains in nwh considering their fate was to die cant imagine miguel would let a big event like that just slide would be very intresting if they could adress that in the sequel",2023-06-02
"love the movie just have a quick question because i’m confused and there was so much information to process on the first watch

how did spot know miles’ true identity and who his dad was i’m referring to the scene where spot goes to the next particle collider thing and gets even more powerful and miles had the vision of spot attacking and killing his father and spot kept saying something like “now i’m gonna destroy everything and everyone you love” and miles keeps seeing the vision of him showing up to  his dad

i definitely missed something because i don’t know how spot knew that spiderman was miles morales and thus knew which family members of miles he could target",2023-06-02
whats crazy to me is that this whole movie is a set up for what comes next but it doesnt feel like a set up they did such a good job of moving all the pieces of the story forward without making it boring,2023-06-02
great movie but the fact thats its a part 1 hurts it doesnt feel finished on its own no flaws other than that,2023-06-02
when gwen and miles start to realize that miles is in the original earth 42 spider and miles isnt on his earth was just crazy and when the scenes was cutting back and forth to their perspectives  i love this movie,2023-06-02
"after watching the movie i only have one question in my brain

what the  is that allowed",2023-06-02
"i think theres a very obvious setup that miguel is wrong about things he has to be because thats what miles is set out to prove i dont think it was merely changing the canon that destroyed his universe but something specific to how he did it  pulling a rick sanchez and taking the place of his counterpart something akin to what we heard of in multiverse of madness 

one potential issue with this is spiderindias universe being in danger but that might just be at least partly because of the spots presence  id have to rewatch the film which i plan to and probably wait for the sequel too so im waiting to see how things play out

we do know or its heavily implied that gwens dad didnt have to die he was saved indirectly by gwen revealing her identity and him subsequently quitting his job and the universe seems alright so if something like that works there has to be some way in which miguel is wrong  at least thats what i think 

maybe it wont be exactly how i envision it perhaps its a broader issue than what miguel specifically did  he does imply there have been multiple cases after all and i doubt they were all life swaps but i think you cant try to save these people even if you know whatll happen beforehand because their deaths have to happen will be flipped on its head i dont think the answer will be what miguel believes it is  the whole point is that uncle bens death was preventable it didnt have to happen and the film is very much set up as a you have to defy what others tell you story  the narrative is clearly on miles side 

but i also dont think its necessarily out of character that faced with the dilemma of letting one person die to save countless others peter…chooses to allow the individual to go if theres really no other option i think spiderman ps4 did this very well  of course he set out to save everyone but he got the cure too late and ultimately chose to let his aunt die which didnt strike me as out of character at all  instead it encapsulated it ben parker died because he didnt understand responsibility may parker died because he did 

given how high the stakes are what the cost could be and what miguel showed of his experiencei dont think its an unthinkable choice for their characters because even trying to defy that in the heat of the moment could as far as they know doom everyone in that universe thats a tremendous risk an understandable deterrent and pretty demotivational even to spiderman but most importantly to them it doesnt look like theres any winning play thats the crucial bit 

comparing that to green goblins bridge ultimatum in the first spiderman movie or peters choice to save the villains in no way homewhile both were gambles there was still a clear goal at the outset but here it looks like the options are mutually exclusive 

but even so i dont think miles is the first to go against it  openly or otherwise others were probably just sent home forcefully or like spiderpunk stayed a bit more discrete miles was just the first to openly defy it and actually escape we see some who are visibly uncomfortable with it hesitant or on the fence  especially when listening to miles arguments and accusations its their hearts going against what their heads are telling them 

but when it came down to it spiderindia wanted to do both just like miles and despite what gwen says i dont think shed let her dad die without a fight its much easier to say youre with miguel on this but in the moment the closer that decision is its much harder to follow through especially with those close to you even among those trying to catch him we see people hesitating like the woman working the dna teleporter plenty didnt of course but in fairness most probably didnt even know what was happening

and obviously we know gwen recruits people who switch over to help miles and i expect many more to follow in the future in any case i hope this idea is explored more in the sequel and that we see the perspectives of many more spiderfolk 

but again i think itll be revealed that the spiderpeople are operating under the wrong principle its not one or the other there is another way and miles will prove it to everyone",2023-06-02
anybody else think that miles might successfully save his parents but gwen dies instead as a part of his canon with her dad resigning from his job that captain storyline is bust for gwen,2023-06-02
this is what the  multiverse of madness shoud have been,2023-06-02
i just saw it holy  this is the best superhero movie ever straight up everything about it was great my only complaint is having to wait for nearly a year for the next one i cannot wait that ending was brutal i really loved gwens character here definitely the highlight imo she was great in the first one but here she was basically the main character her universe was incredible with the pastel colors and the mood based changes her relationship with her dad was complex and well written she kicks  she faces so much internal conflict throughout the movie and she comes out strong by the end miguel was also great i kinda feel for him and dont entirely disagree with his points the central conflicts in this film itself were really creative and interesting theyre complex issues where you cant really say one side is unequivocally wrong and even the main villain is somewhat sympathetic and slowly grows to become a proper supervillain we basically saw his origin story the writing for the parents was another standout there arent many other films that nail the character relationships and dynamics this well miles was also good but didnt really standout like he did in the first one he was very wellwritten and i like that the mom got more screentime here i cannot tell how the sequel is going to go and i wish i could skip ahead to it,2023-06-02
im not sure if it was just me but did anyone else notice the sound mixing was off i know sometimes its difficult to understand dialogue on home devices and systems because of the way the audio is mixed down but ive never had that happen in an imax theater with 40 different speakers before,2023-06-02

"couple of thoughts

 unreal film and a great watch

 definite audio mixing issues as a soon to be graduate film student it was quite noticeable and should have had a bit more polish before release

 gwen was a great colead and her art style was beautiful

 loved how they gave rio way more to do compared to ‘into’

 dunno if it’s just me but i hope we get way more peter b parker in ‘beyond’ cuz johnson is immaculate in that role and it felt like his smaller role in this film for obvious reasons of it being miles’ story now the whole point of ‘into’ just lost some of the magic of the first film",2023-06-02
"not sure what i laughed at harder lego spidey or the gambino cameo but  those were two of the hardest laughs i’ve gotten in a while

question does spider byte know that miles’ spider wasn’t from his dimension miguel peter and gwen all know so i’m not sure if the rest of the inner circle knew including byte when she had the chance to abort sending him to earth 42",2023-06-02
it’s the most  thing ever but when spidertrex shot his webs it was written as thwip lol love it,2023-06-03
"i’m really certain that it will be revealed that miguel is wrong about what causes that dimension he lived in to fall apart the whole canon thing doesn’t make sense to me the idea that spiderman’s uncle has to die or else the entire universe falls apart is just dumb i feel that dimension fell apart because miguel was from a different dimension and being there too long caused some paradox to happen

the only other example of a canon event causing a dimension to destabilise is when miles saves the captain when he was supposed to die but that doesn’t add up either for one that seemed clearly caused by the dot not what miles did and it also had immediate consequences unlike in miguel’s situation in which it seemed to take much longer to happen",2023-06-03

obviously since it ends on a cliffhanger and not a fully told story for now id say i like the 1st one better but  these spiderverse movies are just masterpieces man i dunno how sony animation did it

i think when the 3rd film comes out this is gonna be the best animated movie trilogy of all time i know toy story trilogy would still be rated higher by the general audience but for me this is the peak i struggle to imagine how animation can get better than this",2023-06-03

"movie was beautiful looking

my biggest gripe is that miguels orgin wasnt really spoken about which may have been intentional given how hes from a timeline where spiderman existed long ago and his entire plan is counter to what spiderman at his core believes

especially if you know the comics and you see ends of the earth spiderman in his armor thats like fresh off of his no one dies storyline even if the canon events already happened to them i dont believe these spider people would want to let someone die if they could prevent it 

im happy spectacular spiderman got the spotlight but at the same time he was pretty much saying this innocent person has to die so many can live and that just doesnt go right with me 

aside from gwens team i really hope they show off spider people who just flat out turned the guy down in thr next one",2023-06-03
"i never really liked the first spiderverse movie as much as other people did mainly because the stakes of the movie didnt felt like they were big enough for 5 spiders to be part of it it felt like something that 616 and miles could have handled on their own but more people just kept piling on to the plot

this movie however does feel like it requires the full attention of different spidermen and that makes it so much better

also 2099 was the best spiderman he stole every scene he was in and it was just because of how much of a presence he had i know the story wants me to side with miles but miguel has a very good point",2023-06-03

if miles got bit accidentlly by a spider from another universe42 shouldnt there still be a spider from his world 1610 that bites someone else so there should be 2 spidermen on miles world right,2023-06-03
"when you realize that maybe miguel gives wrong correlation to the whole events  
his new universe broke were actually because hes living in a universe were hes supposed to be dead there not because he broke the dead captain dad uncle canon",2023-06-03
"i loved the movie excellent visuals and the characters were on point i love the fact that miles is the original anomaly and that he was never supposed to be spiderman that could be his character arc in the next movie

though i wonder who was supposed to be spiderman in earth 42c was it the miles from that dimension or another peter parker they didn’t say who so i hope they state it in the sequel overall i put this movie over the first one i am pleasantly surprised that this movie was this great",2023-06-03
i loved this movie  gorgeous movie and amazing story  i was only a bit confused about canon events and how they worked  and lol yeah probably reading way too much into this  just curious  maybe they will explain canon events better in the next one  but why did they go to spiderman indias reality  yeah the spot is there but with miles they know way ahead of time a canon event is coming for miles shouldnt they also already know this for pavitr prabhakar  so risking stopping canon event would be way to risky even for going to after the spot i would think  though counter theory spot is creating new canon events that cant be predicted   while if i remember correctly we are not out right told why miles wasnt invited to the spidersociety i assumed because they knew the entire time a canon event was coming for him right  i thought maybe it is because he is an anomaly but that should result in the society going to him asap i would think  so if it is because of the canon event if they know all this stuff already shouldnt they have not invited spiderman india  and then this begs the question how many canon events happens to a spiderperson  because miles was shown to already have one with uncle aaron it would seem interacting with any other realities spiderperson would be way too dangerous  and lastly what i hope we could get more about  whos canon event did miguel interfere with  we saw what he did just not to whos canon event that 2099 spidey was already dead  whoever his replacement was going to be but yeah probably will never see that person,2023-06-03

"after seeing it again one of the things that i personally love about the film is how it revealed so much and yet so little 

by the time they enter the lobby and you really start learning about the spiderman multiverse concept there are only 50 minutes left in the movie it moves at such a breakneck pace that you dont even notice the runtime when movies have me wishing they were longer thats how i know it was a good film",2023-06-03
yall need to see this in imax laser screen oh boy what a ride beautiful,2023-06-03
when i saw the first trailer for the first film i thought oh that actually seems good i had no idea it would ascend to this level of film making and animation and screenwriting,2023-06-03
"theory i came across a tweet i will link it pointing out two colors during miles’s senses going from green and purple to red and blue indicating that he was supposed to be prowler all along but he was influenced to become spiderman 

it’s revealed in the film that miles was a mistake and that he wasn’t supposed to become spiderman the end of the film shows another universe where miles is the prowler so could that mean it was a butterfly effect when the miles we know ended up becoming spiderman then the other one ended up becoming prowler i feel like that could be a reason why the evil miles may want something to do with him just a theory ",2023-06-03
well the movie was an artistic statement,2023-06-03
does anyone understand what miles did to miguel oharas suit seems he was charging up to shock him then oharas suit gets all glitchy but was unclear what exactly happened there,2023-06-03

"i thought it was amazing visual wise i wish i had seen it on a better screen 

i also think 20 mins somehow someway shouldve been cut definitely feel like it ran long 

i loved the twist although i kind of saw it coming from the moment he got into his room also this further affirms my assumption that ant man did not end up in his dimension after the quantumania conclusion 

also loved the reverse gwenpeter death amazing bit of shadowing and animation to show him in a tattered spidey costume while she held him in her arms",2023-06-04
"so does across the spiderverse fix the plot holeargument from multiverse of madness where many people asked why cant wanda just go to a universe where that version of her is dead and the kids are alive

the black scratchy animation for the spot reminded me of another animated show or movie but i cant pinpoint which one it is,2023-06-04

"this movie was a straight 1110 best comic book movie ever dare i say better than raimis spider man 2 

the story had a very good emotional backbone and dont get me started on the art style each universe has such a distinct style which was done wonderfully especially gwens universe this movie was really amazing",2023-06-04

cerebral ballzy playing for spiderpunk’s intro was  awesome,2023-06-04
very enjoyable film like the last one i only had two gripes one i wasnt expecting there to be such a large cliffhanger at the end of the film two in a city of spiderfolk even one upholding multiversal law i find it very surprising that more didnt defendsupport miles i guess it was kind of a multiverse sized trolley problem but i think more of the spidermen women etc would of advocated for trying to save everyone other than that the movie was a blast,2023-06-04
gwen stacy and hobie brown is the best punk rock superhero duo we always needed  pistols references during spider punk intro was sick,2023-06-04
finally got to see it tonight and just wow my instant gut reaction is this is one of my favorite movies of all time the humor hit the emotions hit the music hit and the animation is easily the best looking i can remember i easily could have sat through 5 hours of this every voice actor nailed their roles,2023-06-04
"love this small detail during the credits

during the sequence where miles is trying to save his falling dad miguel2099 is shown to be chasing him then suddenly in few short bursts they change his color schemes to green and purple

i love how it subconsciously reminds you of the green goblin how it implies that 2099 could be the green goblin to miles gwen stacy his dad small details like these make this movie even better",2023-06-04
i feel like this movie came to us from 20 years in the future absokutely unreal and breathtaking,2023-06-04
this movie definitely winning best animated movie of the year it has so many easter egg that youll have to watch it a second time to find them all at least this movie has a better cliffhanger than a certain other movie cough cough fast x,2023-06-04
really enjoyed this movie the animation was phenomenal it had a lot of heart and i loved the characters indian spider man was a hoot maybe a touch too long in runtime and i could tell this would end in a cliffhanger as there was way too much to be resolved by the 2 hour mark cant wait until the next one,2023-06-04
"saw it for the second time 

my only lingering question is why isnt spot glitching out like other villains who have gone across dimensions vulture earlier showed that they have the same glitch out as spidermen without the wristwatches why is spot seemingly the exception",2023-06-04
that was the most beautifully animated movie i have ever seen,2023-06-04
i don’t care for mcu at all but gave this a shot tonight best experience i’ve had in a theater in a while the colors… the details… it feels like the product of spending an entire lifetime on little details especially considering the movie is 2 hours long,2023-06-04
this movie sounded and looked ridiculously good it was distractingly stunning at points,2023-06-04
"this movie was phenomenal looks great the story and writing i think are good succeeds the 1st movie imo also i wasn’t aware they stopped marketing this movie as 2 parts didn’t know many would be surprised by the ending 

i honestly think this movie  on mcu spiderman and everything post infinity war",2023-06-04
the spiderman pointing meme got a big pop in my theatre,2023-06-04

from miguel to spiderman india to spiderpunk to earth42 miles… man these characters have some serious drip,2023-06-04
indians living large right nowthey got a dunk on the brits,2023-06-04
"fantastic movie the visuals and art style were literally jaw dropping i was in awe the entire time the soundtrack and style was amazing too 

the only critique i had is that the ending really slowed down the pacing i knew there was a cliffhanger and i kept waiting for it to end…and it kept going don’t get me wrong i loved the reveals and twists at the end but the pacing in the last 15 minutes was surprisingly sluggish compared to the breakneck speed of the rest of the movie in any case can’t wait for part 2",2023-06-04
i never would have imagined a bagel could foreshadow a multidimensional conflict,2023-06-04
"watched this movie last night and  loved it i’m not a huge comic book person or anything i mostly just watch the marvel movies but i’ve loved the first spiderverse movie since i saw it when it came out especially gwen i finally cosplayed her last year and of course wore my suit to the theater i actually started reading her comics but realized it just wasn’t keeping my interest so i returned it to the library but luckily i had read far enough that the story with her dad and all that was familiar to me in this movie i’m so happy we got more backstory on gwen and just way more characterization this time around she’s seriously my favorite 

what else can be said that hasn’t already been said the movie is gorgeous the comic book art style is just as great as the first movie but the melding of art styles between the different spiderman’s and universes was even better all the new characters were amazing and i got so excited to see the old crew come back just to get hit with the “to be continued” it just shows how engaging this story is that i hadn’t even noticed we were at the end of the movie i will say the dialogue is so quick that i feel like i need to go back to catch everything and there are stretches of the movie where it feels like nonstop action for 30 minutes but overall just so good


my only issue with it is the plot kinda reminds me of loki which i hated the tva spends the whole show saying the timelines need to be put “right” to the way they were before and i never understood who got to make that call who says the story “has” to be that way in this movie it’s miguel saying these events uncle ben dying or the police captain dying are “canon” events that have to happen but he never explains who gets to decide that or even how he determined it’s required he just said he tried to replace a different version of him and he destroyed the universe i have faith the conclusion will follow miles’ line of thinking that he can “do both” but i’m not sure if that means it will negate the entire concept of canon events to get there or if something will change in the story to get there such as how gwen’s dad got “safe” by quitting his job or maybe some technicality that will allow captain morales to live 

which leads me to my questions about earth 42 if miles 42 is prowler does that mean uncle aaron was meant to be this universe’s spiderman that would be so cool 

but also i was thinking if miles wasn’t supposed to be spiderman at all and peter parker only died because the spider got in from the wrong universe through the collider doesn’t that mean captain morales isn’t supposed to die didn’t all the other captains have some connection to the spiderman in their universe but until miles was bit he had nothing to do with the peter parker in his world…idk i’m just spitballing here 

anyway amazing film can’t wait to see it again my theater nyc was packed and very vocal throughout as someone who only got into the mcu and marvel post endgame this was my first theatrical experience that was anything close to what people described infinity war and endgame in theaters also didn’t see nhw in theaters because i wasn’t caught up by then but i regret it cuz it looked sooo fun lots of exclamations and loud laughter",2023-06-04
"better than the first by miles
insane experience",2023-06-04
that ending was everything jesus what a movie cannot wait for beyond,2023-06-04
one thing i love about the movie is that despite the multiversal stakes where entire dimensions are threatened with destruction its very much a personal story for miles and gwen im sure the next film will more focus on the actual threat of the spot andor whether miguels paranoia is justified or not but the finale of this one is focused on gwens relationship with her dad and miles encountering the dark image of what he could have become if not for the people in his life his dad peter etc,2023-06-04
hope to  the miles prowler shoes are the jordan drop for the next movie,2023-06-04
such a visually and thematically beautiful movie,2023-06-04
anyone know what the song that was playing when miles is laying in bed and the portal opens,2023-06-04
does anybody know the song that was playing when gwen walked upside down,2023-06-04
"fun filled action for kids

instant acid trip for adults 

loved it i’m not very familiar with animation but this was by far the most beautiful animated movie i’ve ever seen one of my favorite highlights was near the end where the wallpaper in the room just starts dripping down like paint dripping down a canvas",2023-06-04
"the 3rd movie is going to be wild spot miguel and prowler miles as the 3 main bad guys im bummed about the cliff hanger but such a great way to set up the final in the trilogy

love to see the growth of miles and him not just going with the statusquo",2023-06-04
"i think we all are being to harsh on miguel because lets remember the things he has been through in a relatively short time besides his own traumas and destroying that universe

 the events of intro the spiderverse

 the scarlet witch got her hands on the darkholm and learned to dreamwalk which seems to be just as dangerous and destructive as trying to physically take the place of your counterpart

 sylvie killed the one who remains

 the events of no way home

 and now around a year later from intro there are the events of this movie

not having a break or at least a decent amount of sleep is getting to him",2023-06-04
"to me objectively the movie is a 1010 they stepped up their game in the visual department the actings good the storys good the sound and score are good its all good really

but i have one pet peeve with this movie that makes me subjectively torn between giving it a 9 or 85 and that is miguel ohara spiderman 2099

this is my favorite alternate version of spiderman i like his story his setting his look hes just cool and when i saw him teased at the end of the into the spiderverse i was absolutely hyped to see my favorite alternate spidey make his big screen debut and what i got is what i can only describe as a miguel ohara in name and looks only he is no stranger to aggression sure but never have i seen nor do i recall seeing him being this grim and aggressive

before you come in with but in the movie shut it i know i watched it too i understood the plot i understood it all my point is this its okay to take creative liberties with an adaptation in order to enhance and tell your story miles is an excellent example of this in the previous movie as his origin is very different from his comic book one yet manages to still hit the same story beats as the original even enhancing them too but you also have to watch out as to not change a character so much when doing an adaptation in order to make them fit a certain role which is what they did with 2099

him taking drugs which is counter to what his origin is as he became a spiderman due to the fact that he was trying to get rid of a drug addiction that was imposed on him him being so malicious towards miles saying hes a mistake that he is an anomaly that he doesnt deserve to be spiderman im sorry but this is not the character i love i was so excited to see him on the big screen and what i got was this

will he melow out in the next movie maybe will i be there to watch it next year yeah but im still saddened because of this i enjoyed the movie as a whole but this hit me deep",2023-06-04
"this a 1010 and i didnt they could but its improved on the 1st and probably better than any other spiderman movie or marvel imo the only scnee that couldve been better was the san francisco with the chinese lady i didnt know what was going on and i dont think anyone else did either

honestly cant wait to watch again needed to sit forward and try to absorb all the different spiderman and women when they all showed up 

but again imo the coolest one was malala windsor if only for her namesake thought it was a really nice easter egg im also assuming she was created for the movie

visually amazing gwens opening was just somethign else the art style and direction were phenomenal and the actioncomedy was always on point not many sequels are this good and beyond is going to have to be something special 

was also really hoping for tobey tom or andrew to have a proper cameo but we got to see a few of their scenes and glover which was a surprise",2023-06-04
i hope the animators made bank with this one cause ,2023-06-04
now that ive given the soundtrack from metro boost a listen a couple times im a little disappointed with it not as catchy as itsvs imo i think my favorite song so far is the credits one,2023-06-04
this movie was great so many cool references jokes and character moments my whole theater was eating it up until they realized it was only part 1,2023-06-04
what is the name of that shorty spiderman  lol,2023-06-04
i feel really weird i feel like they needed to get to the spiderverse nexus world a lot quicker i feel like this could have had a third of it on the cutting room floor and it would have been better i dont know im going to watch it again at some point but i was strangely bored some of the monologues had me looking at my watch i dont know like i said i feel really weird about my experience perhaps it was overyhyped so i went in with too many expectations,2023-06-04
gwen and miles hanging out sequence was magical the shot of gwen walking down as the camera rotates was beautiful,2023-06-04
gwen’s opening story could be its own short story and it would win an oscar,2023-06-04
fantastic movie i will say that even more than the first one not knowing spanish and watching across the spiderverse is missing out on a lot of funny lines luckily i know spanish fluently but its odd that they dont at least put subtitles for the nonspanish speaking people,2023-06-04
 that  cameo with donald hit when i got into the car at the start is oh cool cameo oh donald playing the prowler like the other movie but now its oh donald playing the prowler here in this movie ahhhhhhhhhh,2023-06-05
the fact that after 2 hours when the cliffhanger ending came up i was like what it ended already anyway  i love this movie,2023-06-05
"what were the different visions that vr spider cycles through   
i spotted heatvision infrared night vision there were two more that i dont know anyone",2023-06-05
im not going to lie the beginning had me tearing up unexpectedly the part in the guggenheim when the helicopter is falling and it overlays gwen banging on her drums as she starts webbing just made me emotional spiderwoman suffers we know that and i usually think of their ability to carry on and save the day as despite the suffering but that moment there made me realize that they do it by channeling it just as one channels their suffering into their art,2023-06-05
i gotta see this two more times,2023-06-05
what was the comment near the start of the movie about doctor strange,2023-06-05
to me i thought the fact that the 42 miles is evil shows that our miles was not a mistake he was supposed to become spiderman,2023-06-05
can someone explain why gwen has blue sneakers on in one universe but blue ballet slippers in another in this movie my daughter noticed that the toy line has the blue sneakers instead of the blue ballet slippers my 5 year old daughter does ballet and this is why she noticed,2023-06-05
what do you guys think of the paradox of miles from earth 42 i mean if the movie wanted to comment on the harms of the stagnancy of the spiderverses and storyline then how come miles is shown to have become a villianbad without the spider bite does that mean the world is only bad because there are no spiders to protect it,2023-06-05
please give us more donald glover some how some way,2023-06-05
good flic,2023-06-05
the talk between miguel and miles at the end of the chase scene on how miles doesnt belong there can very well be the start of villain spiderman i didnt expect him to take all that stay unhinged by that statement,2023-06-05
"someone help me out here  


spot is an anomaly because hes in the wrong dimension and can disrupt the canon however now hes contributing to the canon because hes supposed to be the person to  miles dad the response ive gotten so far is that this doesnt matter because miles dad is going to die anyway this implies that you can change the canon as long as you only change smaller details and the end result is unchanged right was this rule established or is this just an assumption also gwens dad is still going to die even though he retired",2023-06-05
somebody know who is the big blue spiderwoman the one with the nano armor and physic like zyra from overwatch,2023-06-05
"after spot goes into the collider and gets fully poweredup he gains a kind of textured painting effect that reminded me of loving vincent

does anyone know if they actually achieved that effect the same way they did on loving vincent  by physically oil painting each frame obviously they would have then had to composite it into the cg shots but im wondering if there was there an initial painting stage that they did physically

as for the other art and animation styles used in the movie

between renaissance vulture and spiderpunk paper cut outs were the flashiest new animation gimmick but i do feel like by giving us that vulture scene so early the film gave us its best visual idea right at the start of the film this meant that when hobie brown turned up he seemed like a variation on the same effect rather than something completely new",2023-06-05
the score is fantastic daniel pemberton outdid himself,2023-06-05

soo in into the spider verse did they all have watches did they all know who he was if they did have watches why didnt they wear them as to not glitch,2023-06-06
doesnt miles give away what will happen in the third movie when he says he can save his dad and the spiderverse i think that is whats gloing to happen with the help of the other spidermen especially gwen peter and migel who i believe will end up being convinced that miles can indeed save his dad without threatning the spiderverse,2023-06-06
random question when did jefferson davis become jefferson morales was that just a change made for these movies i dont remember that being the case in the first one,2023-06-06

i am thinking the writers are going with the hamlet route in the next storyline we see that his mother and uncle are still alive while miles is under the influence of uncle aaron while his dad is dead what if the reason for his fathers death is his uncle who also seems to having some sort of relationship with his mother and the next character arc will be prowlers miles figuring that all out with the help of our original miles",2023-06-07

there have been a lot of multiverse movies out there but with the use of various animation styles to give each universe its own distinct look it makes this entry the head of the pack  spiderman no way home and doctor strange in the multiverse of madness could only dream of being this inventive  but not only is this a visually stunning film its amazing how willing the producers of this film were to entrust its storytelling to its animation i loved how within a scene the style and palette could change to highlight the emotions of the characters which was just brilliant,2023-06-07

"i just wanted to riff on some theories on how some things work out in the 3rd film strap in

i think the spiderverse falling apart like in mumbattan is directly related to other spiderpeople being involved while preventing canon events i think miguel lost his family in his home world and found the alternate version of himself with a family where he went and killed himself this obviously messed heavily with canon  one spiderman killing another meaning miguel is the original anomaly

this would explain while mumbattan falls apart but not earth42 getting bitten by a spider is a canon event and with miles 42 not getting bitten because of a one in a million chance that his spider would be transported to another universe he and his world survived unfortunately this meant that his destiny changed hence his transformation into the prowler a role that “in canon” falls to his uncle aaron everyone’s destiny changes

so miles can save his father by himself but that might mean that his mother or someone else has to die in exchange who knows

as for gwen this would mean miles would probably to her go maybe in a pivotal scene where she she wants to give her life because that’s what destined to happen “in every universe it doesn’t end well”

this is where it gets hairy because miles would then have to fight the spot alone and i’m not sure how that happens i’m not a writer

i spent most of this 3rd viewing thinking about this stuff who knows if any of it’s true but just wanted to riff on it",2023-06-12
i barely found my doppelganger online before i watched this he really looks like me just from different country i said hello  he welcomed me warmly but then idk what to say after 1 day then i found out he has cut our contact im quite disappointed its like me from another universe dont want to keep contact with me we only said hello to each other,2023-06-12
movie was great but the sound mixing was awful i thought i saw that they fixed it this weekend so wasn’ expecting it to be that bad i could barley hear gwen’s intro over the drums and a couple other scenes were hard to hear like the first one better still but i think the third will be the best and this one will be better to me after i see the third similar to how watching all three of the lotr movies made each one better since it was one whole story,2023-06-12
i have a question…okay so if miles isn’t supposed to be spider man and isnt spider man as miguel said then why does it matter if his dad dies because it’s not a canon event for miles he isn’t an actual spiderman… please someone explain im so confused like if it is a canon event then that means he’s supposed to be spider man but they kept saying he isn’t…,2023-06-12
why didn’t dr strange “glitch” during multiverse of madness…or any of the spider villainsmen during no way home…,2023-06-13
"just watched this a second time as one wasnt enough

firstly i noticed prowler miles is an amputee missing his right hand i hope they dive a bit more into 42s backstory was it normal until the spider was yoinked or was it a hard left turn going from the end credits where they showed a younger version of miles being mirrored into both versions of miles gives me hope theyll pull a redemption story for the 42 universe

another the opening scene of gwen may be an intentional anachronism in it she is wrestling with not being able to tell miles about the others on the first viewing i thought it was just her coping with being forced back to her universe but on the second viewing i noticed she is referencing what miguel has told her about destiny while the timing of the scene seems like it happens before being recruited perhaps it happened while she was couch surfing maybe joining the band via hobie from the sound of her talk with her dad she quit bands regularly so the band quitting she refers to is another one",2023-06-13

"i am totally in love with this movie

 miguel considers miles the original anomaly but thats not true miles comes from a universe where they would otherwise be no spiderman the alchemax 42 spider ended up in his universe because of prespots actions and similarly because of kingpins decisions

 miles wasnt responsible for the spider escaping its original universe kingpin was the collider would never have been made if kingpin hadnt built it in the first place trying to disrupt a canon event kingpin becoming a criminal happens his wife and son learn of it and get themselves killed fleeing from him in sheer terror kingpin then uses his vast wealth and resources to make the collider because hes learned he can find his wife and son in another universe and go therebring them here i cant actually recall which one he specifically wanted to do

 how does mumbattan have a canon event caused by spot that is somehow still a canon event spot causes the building to collapse which imperils captain singh the canon event here is that singh is supposed to be crushed saving a child but miles stops it from happening and lyla informs gwen that the canon event has been disrupted spot cant both cause a canon event and also not be canon himself ergo miles is also canon despite what miguel seems to think

 miles was supposed to be bitten by the alchemax 42 spider and become his worlds spiderman because if he didnt then other actual canon events couldnt be canon if miles never becomes bitten then spot never happens and then the canon event wouldnt happen im not entirely sure how miguel doesnt see this

 we even see during the uncle bens scene as all the spiders are with their version of uncle ben the final one we see is miles with aaron that is a canon event if that is a canon event how can miles be an anomaly

 are they foreshadowing gwens death not only do they cheekily reenact her falling only to be saved by pavitir at the last second but at some point miguel has explainedshown gwen that most gwens die if they fall in love with spiderman the way she says this tells me that miguel mightve shown her this in an attempt to scare her straight as it were away from miles this is sneaky of miguel and more than a bit manipulative if true but considering how he feels about miles it could make some sense

 alternatively does miguel knowbelieve that gwen will die and is this partially why he is so reluctant to let her join spidersociety is he afraid people will get attached to her

 miguel mightve caused the collapse of his alternate selfs universe but not in the way he thinks and hes likely totally misunderstood canon events entirely i think he has the overall beats right for sure and we see actual evidence of this toobut that doesnt mean miguel is getting everything right about them either i firmly believe at this point that some canon isnt really canon but might seem like it who or what is determining what canon events are lyla someone else are they 100 without flaw or fault in their deductions of what is or isnt canon

 this movie ties in so beautifully with the first one and were getting so many callbacks to remind us of things in into the spiderverse and even being shown scenes from it again in this one so its clearly all very important 

basically all of this is to say i think most of this stuff will get explained in beyond but its really fun to think about how this will all tie up ive never read the comics these are based on or anything",2023-07-08
i really liked it probably more than the first one all though i did love the design of film noir spider man in the first one ,2023-07-08
i’m assuming these cannon events follow the story of the original spiderman who’s the captain in peter parker’s life that dies when he battles a nemesis,2023-07-10
those that say miguel is a villain should really rewatch the first 20mins of the movie and how he helped gwen when she was at her lowest,2023-07-10
"question about the whole canon event stuff 

cant miles technically save his father since its his universe that hes in 

he saved someone else from someone elses universe and that caused issues 

miguel saved someone from an alternate universe resulting in issues

if miles in his own universe saves his father then he should be fine ofc the only argument is that none of it wouldve happenedhe wouldnt be able to save his father if he wasnt spiderman or the bite didnt happen but then if thats the case then anything abnormal to happen as the result of him becoming spiderman shouldve triggered something with the character of spiderman any of them are technically brainsmart as  so how come no one has figured this out

one argument i can see working is that there exists a possibility that he would be able to save his father without finding out the exact way and date his father would die from some outsidehisuniverse information but the information alone could be what causes his universe to be destroyed if he saves him vs saving him without that information which wouldnt technically disrupt anything",2023-07-11
"lets understand what happened because a lot got thrown at me in this movie and i dont understand parts

there are two universes where miles morales and his family exist  in one universe miles is meant to be spider man in the other universe blond peter parker is meant to be spiderman and is spiderman  but the radioactive spider was sent to blond peter parkers universe and turned the wrong miles into spiderman  i remember the blond peter parker dying in the first movie so now there is only miles morales spiderman in that universe



each spider man universe adheres to mandatory canon events or else it cant exist any more so i feel like neither of these universes should be able to exist because theyve already messed stuff up but for some reason they continue to exist and in one of them miles goes on to be spider man while in the other one spider man doesnt exist at all isnt the fact that these universes continued ot exist proof that canon events can be disrupted without destroying the universe   in any case i dont get why that universes miles became a villain he was supposed to become spider man but for some reason miles inexplicably turns into an evil guy named prowler  maybe this is just because its been 5 years since the first movie and i dont even knowremember why uncle aaron became the prowler



why was the spider sent to another universe in the first place i think it has something to do with spot the villain who asserted that he made spiderman but what exactly is the explanation miles threw a bagel at him in the first movie but he was already spiderman at that point so idk what that has to do with spot",2023-07-12
rewatched the film and thought it was hilarious when rio is absolutely against princeton and miles is like new jersey is too far from new york which yeah miles youre right nj not that far but princeton is a rather long drive from brooklyn lol,2023-07-13
i cant explain it but miguel ohara would hate crt,2023-07-15
so i was looking at imbd and realized gwens father is played by shea whigham which means that hes also in mission impossible trying to arrest tom cruise and hes in two twoparters in the same year lol,2023-07-16
overall loved it but i did have some issue with the pacing and ending considering how long it might be til we get the sequel i wish it had a more solid ending like it feels like its building to the climax then it just ends very unsatisfying i think the way they chose to split it also lead to some pacing issues after the intro until we get to the meat it feels like they basically made a 4 hour movie that they just cut it into 2 rather beyond the spiderverse being a true sequel,2023-08-07

"not a frequent on reddit but lately ive been so glad that ive been able to find a community for literally anything and everything to an extent where the very first default reaction i had was to look up the subreddit for this movie as soon as the credits rolled and i couldn’t agree more that this was among the best animated movies ive seen all year heck it actually takes movie of the year award for me last year it was “everything everywhere all at once” i’m basically a sucker for unexpected heartfelt genuine plots and this one takes the cake i mean nothing was cheesy it was all well writtenscripted tremendously animated a treat for adhd peeps and plot twists got me on the edge throughout can’t wait for the trilogy finale dunno if it is the finale as i’m sure they’ll milk the concept further but happy to drink that koolaid

heck all in all just wanna say it was a blast of a movie and share appreciation for the makers y’all are champs 3",2023-09-29
i do think miguel is a hypocrite i mean even if hes right and miles dads death is a canon event that no one can stop but thats for miles to decide even if miles was wrong helping pav which is actually likely due to the spot what happens in his universe is his job to fail or succeed at by imprisoning miles the spiders are directly interfering with his universe which they should allegedly be against,2023-11-06

"im super late to the party but just finished the movie and oh boy was it absolutely fantastic between the story the visuals the music and the voices it was so so good easily one of my favorite movies by marvel

one question i have though is the general idea that because gwen reveals herself to be spiderwoman to her dad and he then quits the force meaning that he doesnt die in that universe",2023-11-21
i personally hated the art style i hope they just go back to just drawing the backgrounds versus making it look like a child colored it in i think they really dropped the ball when they introduced miguel he should have just smoked the vulture rather than him need gwen and another spider woman doesnt really establish him as a ba i mean i know he is a male and media has a real issue establishing any male character as a ba thats a job only for female characters now i also think they spent alot of the movie embarrassing miles that being said that end twist was sick i loved the canon premise spot was dope i hope the next one is better,2024-01-13
i thought the movie was great but not quite as great as the first one the animation writing and voiceacting were all superb but  and this may be a hot take  the whole tropes of hero having to restore the balance of the multiverse and hero fighting an evil version of himself from another universe have not only been done before but theyve been done recently ie multiverse of madness no way home what if etc that being said i did love the reveal that the spider that bit miles was from another universe and he was never supposed to be bitten and as a result the universe the spider came from doesnt have a spiderman i also loved the implication that evil miles wouldve become spiderman had the spider not been transported to good miless universe,2023-06-03
"i guess im add or whatever because i didnt have any trouble keeping up with the fast paced animation the story made little sense though miguel is basically spider thanos and all the other spidermen instantly back him up i dont think so theyre trying to shoehorn in infinity war where it isnt necessary how about making spot the sole threat hes more than enough to justify multiverse collapse

also the final twist really undermines the point that you choose your own fate apparently the only thing separating hero miles from villain miles is whether or not his uncle or father dies first",2023-06-06
i went to watch this with 3 mates 1 left early wasn’t enjoying it the other was on his phone i went to have a  came back had no idea what was happening and lost total interest in the movie are we missing something the rest aren’’s a 610 movie and i absolutely adore the first i might need to rewatch it on my own when i’m in a better headspace,2023-07-04
i’m going to be one of a billion saying this but the art style in gwen’s universe ,2023-06-02
"cool movie all in all but i just wish it was a little more concise and finished the plot in 1 film or if thats really not possible end it in a way similar to infinity war where theres a conclusion the heroes lose even if theres clearly a part 2

what i loved the most about the first film was that it simply tried to be a great film",2023-06-03
"i personally still love the movie 910 but im surprised that so many people are saying its better than the first i think theres clear things it did worse and it did better

i think the parental relationship animation and the dialogue during the slow scenes is much better as is the villain however i think the oneliner quips is way more annoying and the humor is worse if at best on par with the first one 

i think the pacing is worse too i feel many scenes couldve been shortened or cut and you actually couldve had a final act instead of a cliffhanger by chopping off some scenes and making it 20 minute longer or something i wouldve liked to see added scenes like maybe miles actually having a reaction to seeing his friends again instead of seeing others

overall i feel the movie has less emotion than the first one does uncle aaron dying in into the spiderverse actually got something out of me but i dont feel any very emotional scenes in this movie i think the gwen plotline with her dad is adequate but its no where near an emotional kick that the first one gives with prowlers death and though it may just be because the movie hasnt lasted in my memory enough i think scenes overall are less impactful and memorable you dont have a scene like miles jumping off the building in the first one i think the ending is also a poor thing im surprised that i dont see more people take issue with it as i think the ending is very akin to dune part one which many people had issues with  dune does still have a worse ending though

it may sound like i hate the movie but its still a great movie but im very surprised at the amount of people saying its better than the first i think its a combination of a bit of recency bias and people not seeing the first in a while",2023-06-03
"movie definetly felt a little long and it had the sequeltopopularmoviethatgot2sequelsgreenlitatonce problem aka the potc2 problem where it had to simultaneously tell its own story while building up for a sequel

okay i loved the movie but as somebody that went completely blind into it man that cliffhanger ending was disappointing to say the least,2023-06-06
i liked the part where miles said its spidering time and spidered all over everything,2023-06-06
good movie but i can’t help but think how boring of a protagonist miles is i mean sure he’s a good guy but the teen rebellion and trouble with parents is nothing new or groundbreaking if that makes sense i don’t find him as charismatic as tom hollands spiderman also the dialogue moved wayyy to fast at least for me i could barely even process what they said i wish they would let the dialogue marinate for a bit outside of these nitpicks i would rate the movie 810 amazing animation music and voice acting,2023-06-07

i didnt care for it  it started out well but turned dull and predictable  it was at least a half hour too long which led to pacing issues  definitely worse than the first but that wasnt all that good either  i liked the music that started it during gwens narration  was that the score,2023-06-25
"what a  movie 1010 imo

i never felt bored i never felt like it was long

i got more gwen than i thought

this was a good set up movie and the third movie will be fantastic sometimes the sequel movies are just tunneling on the romantic aspect of the characters but this one was a good dynamic since it caused a rift between the romantic pair

"what i appreciated the most in this movieespecially with recent events in the comics is miles standing against the premise that spiderman is defined by his suffering which seems to be the direction that were being pulled towards 

miguel and his all the spiderpeople he recruits are connected by not just the web of life but their own shared trauma miles spits in the face of all that simply by existing because he hasnt in their eyes crossed that canonevent to inherit the spiderman mantle theyre so fixated by this that theyre failing to grasp the very crux of what makes spiderman responsibility the responsibility to do what is right when you canwhich is what miles does at every crucial point in the movie he tries to save captain singh wants to save his father because what do you do with great power the multiversal spiders know what will happen in each universe and they have the power to stop it but theyre now taking a look at things from a greater good perspective instead of what makes spiderman truly a hero

 i just realized sth crazy the avatar girl who used the vr headset was in gwen’ at the end so gwen must have thought she’s on their side but wasn’t the reason she let miles go was because she knew the machine would take him to the wrong universe  maybe that would be the plot twist in the next part  idk seems really interesting to me,2023-06-08

i didnt catch this the first time around but miguel intervened in gwens canon event when they first met just before vulture flies out of the museum he says that a canon event is coming,2023-06-10
"for some reason and maybe its on porpoise the discussion about who is right or wrong is too focus in miles vs miguel dilemma but i think the movie plays us a little bit in a good way don’t get me wrong with the idea of responsibility which is the central core of spiderman as a character

and in that scenario we need to talk about gwen

first of all she struggles with his own reality  world with her father with her identity with the people around her and all because of her trauma she blames herself because of the peter parkers dead of her universe even when she says the opposite deep down it’s pretty clear that she doesn’t accept the fact that it was not fault it was a tragedy and in someway scaping her universe and from her own situation going to the spider society and being with miles besides the feelings she has about him is a way to scape from her trauma and own matters she is unable to confront the pain accepts the past and to carry on instead she is constantly lying and acting irresponsibly

first she uses the spider society and the spider woman’s trust to see miles instead of focusing the real threat and her original mission the spot one of the anomalies that kingpin’s collider created in the first movie and ironically for being selfish too kingpin didn’t care about the consequences of playing  with the machine the only one thing he cared about was meeting again with his family even if they were not from his reality just like miguel did

instead of focusing in her mission to track the spot for the spider society she is messing around with miles something miguel and spider woman told her not to do because earth1610 is indeed altered so at the end she is focusing in something important for her but not important for the others even if she is not fully aware once again responsibility issue here

this situation goes on with gwen lying to spider woman about how the spot situation is getting out of control because once again she is not able to take full responsibility on her actions at the point because of her constant oversights and exposure that pavitr’s universe gets involved too creating a overpower spot in the process

in fact i think miguel’s himself is not fully understanding the “canon” maybe it’s not about the trauma or the tragic movie every spiderman has to overcome is about what leads to that moment and how that makes the individual understand the real value of responsibility or duty

to me this is perfectly portrait in marvel’s spiderman videogame when peter desires to save his aunt but he knows he can’t even in range and crying

i hope the next and final movie will explore this idea in the right direction the consequences of the lack of responsibility and selfishness like the trigger of the real hero

i wouldn’t like to see a happy disney ending because miles is somekind of genius and solves everything with the power of friendship and love this saga doesn’t deserve that",2023-06-16
"i didnt understand why miles ending up in the wrong universe was supposed to be a twist it was telegraphed multiple times with spot talking about the spider and we saw the scanner come up with earth42 when it scanned miles

 still loving the art style as well would honestly like a tv show or videogame in this art style
 really like the soundtrack as well not the rap music but the actual music score soundtrack
 i hope the 3rd film is still slated for next year and not moved to 2025",2023-06-18
ive watched it four times in theaters and its so worth it but i dont know if anyones posted about this already is there a reason that spidermans life is predetermined,2023-06-23
does anyone else dare to call it the best spiderman movie ever,2023-06-02
"for me i was going into this expecting the scarlet spider to have a decent part but they made him a dumb comic relief character they could have utilised his back story for depth giving these canon events he could have been a juxtaposition with a unique alternate viewpoint given his tragic story surely the clone saga would’ve been a canon event or an anomaly so 2099 could’ve had beef with that i wanted ben to get some justice after recent comic runs like chasm but it was wishful thinking it’s such a shame because his design was so clean and the art style was nailed it’s so sad that this was all for nothing 

i enjoyed the cameos there were several to enjoy my favourite was spectacular spiderman that made me hope we could get christopher daniel barnes spidey in the next movie  

as another commenter said on another thread the characterisation of miguel felt more apt for someone like superior spidey also the characterisation of every other spidey that you know and love who was featured in the movie who agreed with miguel’s faction was character assassinated as this is something i don’t think any spidey would get behind especially the way it’s being done  

my absolute favourite thing about the movie was the art style for gwen’s world it’s straight from the spidergwen comics with the colourisation and the watercolours i also liked her suit update and miles suit looked sleek too the way they also incorporated some comic panels movie events and video game scenes in the explanation of canon events was so cool too 

hobie spidey was a good addition and a fun character with a few good one liners pavitr from what we seen of him was pretty cool and i enjoyed the scenes in his universe 

overall i think the plot could’ve been worked on and would’ve preferred something like the comics spiderverse storyline with all the spiders working together to defeat a threat instead of putting a couple of spidey’s down to raise up miles and gwen up i felt we spent too long with miles and his parents too the scene at the party was a bit boring i felt we accomplished everything we needed to understand about the dynamic at the school meeting and when miles spidey talks to his father after chasing the spot",2023-06-02
"this was the best movie i have ever seen the first one used to be that but this one somehow tops it in every way i love the emotions throughout the movie itsv focused more on becoming spiderman and learning how to be one whereas this one emphasized all the problems that come with being spiderman and the loneliness that miles and gwen go through theyre honestly some of if not the only characters that i sympathize that much with their lives are hard and not really fun seeing each other is the only thing that keeps them going but they know especially gwen they cant do that they have to keep their distance from one another the music vid for calling only makes it so much worse every line in that song talks about their situation its been almost a week since ive seen the movie and i still cant get over it it honestly hurts and im not even the most sympathetic person out there 

x200b

i havent even gotten to the visuals album villains rest of the plot but just seeing both miles and gwen going through it like that makes this movie a 1010 the colors in gwens world really showed her pain and seeing her problems with her dad made it so painful

if anyone is interested i did a more detailed breakdown of the greatness of this movie as i just couldnt get over it",2023-06-04

yeah so this is very much half a story,2023-06-03
so disappointed with the cliffhanger as it keeps it from being a 1010 for me by not being definitive enough to hold its own as it’s own story you can leave esb and infinity war with the sense that this could end here  and it would make sense this felt more like dune where there is clearly more that was shot and we just had no choice but to end it here,2023-06-04

they only ended it on a cliff hanger so they could setup a perfect trilogy smh my head,2023-06-05
"i loved the animation and i liked the story but i didnt like the whole gang up on miles bit of it all even when we found out that daddy peter and gwen who are supposed to be his friends were part of the set upif i were miles that would have been it for me  betrayal speaks louder than anything 

that being said it would have been much more satisfying if they actually explained how miles was the original anomaly sure he wasnt supposed to be bit and had he not been his peter parker would have been alivebut how did the anomaly occur who let it happen the entire movie from miguels perspective appears to have been centered around the idea that spidermen needed to come together prevent spidermen from generating more anomalieswell then how did the first one occur and who was responsible for it if it werent another spiderman who was responsible for it then his entire rhetoric of how spidermen need to sacrifice to keep thing in check falls apart without an explanation to this the entire philosophy that this should never have happened is invalid and it simply makes miguel an idiot i hope the creative team doesnt get lazy about this and tells a satisfactory story about this

overall great movie and im glad i saw it i cant wait for the next and perhaps they will explain in the next one but anyone else think something similar",2023-06-07
"was the entire captain stacy dies canonevent a major plot point in the spiderman mythos prior to this movie like yes it happened but ive never heard it put on par with uncle bens death or gwen stacys as a pivotal moment

i admittedly only know about spiderman through the 94 cartoon movies games and general pop cultural osmosis but considering 23 of the liveaction movies dont even foreground gwen stacy

it seems like a strawman premise i find it hard to believe that variations as diverse as spiderpunk 2099 silk spiderwoman etc can all have their character arc boiled down to a an uncle ben equivalent dies and b police captain dies without being guilty of the broadest generalization

even if im wrong and jessica drew miguel ohara gwen stacy etc are fundamentally just peter parkers by different names wouldnt a much cleaner way to show that spiderman doesnt need to be defined by trauma be to simply show a spiderman not being defined by trauma

getting bogged down with  the characters speaking the metanarrative is ceding ground to the obsessive gatekeeping nerds its criticizing by even stopping to acknowledge their gate which is no longer gating this movie is the smash hit sequel to a trendsetting critical darling the argument was won the second miles was protagonist and the movies was awesome it feels like endorsing cleanliness by unnecessarily splashing around in the very mud being slung by mudslingers",2023-06-07
okay not to point out the obvious here but that dude chasing spiderman into space on that train thingy the one who mysteriously doesnt crawl on stuff miguel ohara the only spiderman who uses claws to climb stuff i meanis it a spoiler if im predicting things cuz i cant find the tagthe guy is obvioulsy a prwoler11 he is the uncle in another universe the spooky meanie come back and thank me when the movie comes out i so genius i came up with this on my own dont listen to my homie who talks a lotta  i thougt of it me,2023-06-14

"the “empire strikes back” of animated comic book films the conclusion “beyond the spiderverse” is going to wipe the floor with whatever competition it has the year it releases

if the villains also spaz out when they are in a different universe how come that did not happen to anyone in spiderman no way home also if it’s a fixed point of losing someone wouldn’t pavitr prabhaker’s moment of loosing someone to spot still be an anomaly as spot is an anomaly due to miles being an anomaly,2023-06-02
well hobie is my new bias also was he giving basquiat vibes or was that just me the whole thing was incredible i already want to see it again the artist in me was in love with the different art styles animation quirks spiderpunk being the best i loved the collagestyle and visual storytelling especially with gwen’s world the paint dripping the broad strokes of color used for her dad… 1510,2023-06-02

"when the credits started to roll i just thought dude you cant end it like that i usually dont feel that way about films but overall id consider it a good sign that i wanted more 

the spectacular visuals almost go without saying i also enjoyed that we got a more fleshed out story for gwen humor wasnt as great as the first film but i think there was probably a greater ratio of seriousness to humor on purpose 

i have to qualify my praise a bit though theres a lot going on in this film and sometimes it feels like it could have afforded to take more of a breather im also not sure how to feel about the miles prowler storyline theyve introduced since the third film isnt out yet obviously but it could end up being thematically interesting

miguel didnt sugarcoat the truth at all to miles poor guy my sense is that the story might end up having a twelve angry men echo to it in the sense that miles starts off alone but gradually convinces others of his way of thinking that there might be a way to do both well with the people gwen recruited thats already starting to happen

i had a question with the whole canon idea and of miles status as an anomaly if going against the idea of what’s cannon how is it that earth 42 is still up we saw that going against the cannon part of the verse leads to destruction in that world from miguel o hara to pavitr prabhakar in the sense of that peter parker becoming spiderman should that have been cannon you can also say because the spider bit miles instead of not biting anyone at all yet when miles was bitten did that make his peter cannon to die as well,2023-06-02

"im concerned that beyond the spiderverse would create a solution for miless moral dilemma where both the multiverse and his father are saved  
  
the core question posed in across the spiderverse is whether a spiderperson needs to suffer loss and sacrifice in order to be spiderman the hero that pushes through all the pain and gets back up to do the right thing miles refusing to allow his father to die and striving to find a way to save both jefferson and the multiverse is a very spiderman thing to do but experiencing that loss and learning to move forward is an even more spiderman thing to do finding a loophole in miguels framing of miless moral dilemma like in the case of gwens father george stacy would reward or justify miless selfishness in spite of the consequences presented to him regardless of how understandable it is that hed want to save his father one of the two most important people in his life gwens dad being exempt from this canon rule is fine because its implied in the film that shes come to accept that shes needs to lose her father regardless of her love for him and chooses to embrace responsibility shes already figured out the lesson her role in the film isnt to help miles rescue is father its to help miles make his own decisions founded on his own experiences and his own feelings not miguels nor a spider societys  
  
i would love btsv to give a firm stance on the question it poses on what makes spiderman who he is or who they are and if the film chooses to state that being spiderman doesnt necessitate sacrifice and loss it then really really needs to address miless selfishness and find another way for him to learn the lesson that his world is going to crash around him all the time now and in the future that he cant save everyone not even his loved ones but he still needs to find a way to continue forward and be a hero for everyone else his uncle aarons death wasnt enough he didnt have the power nor the confidence to rescue or protect his uncle then this is an entirely new lesson where even equipped with great power and capability he needs to understand that hes going to lose people in trying to do the right thing  
  
earth42 miles entrance into the story adds layers to this moral dilemma as other posts on this subreddit have pointed out its implied that the spider that bit earth1610 miles was supposed to bite earth42 miles while our miles isnt at fault for the state of this other miless earth and his descent into villainy hes now who this other miles was supposed to be hes an anomaly that wasnt meant to be spiderman but he is so now hes responsible for helping this version of himself as well as this world his experience in earth42 could teach him that his life and decisions are no longer his own additionally while earth42 miles doesnt seem to care about his alternate universe father miguels backstory may foreshadow that this miles might try to replace our miles in earth1610 in doing so this miles may actively try to prevent losing another version of his father and this may break canon and begin to unravel earth1610 our miles may have to actively choose to sacrifice his father who as a morally righteous figure may want to sacrifice himself anyways to defeat his villainous self as well as spot  
  
atsv transitions miguel from a brooding tragic deterministic spiderman into one violently fixated on fate and destiny were given scenes and dialogue that would encourage us to disagree with miguel that hes the good guy despite his insistence that he is this pushes us to empathize and side with miles and his feelings more but if miguels presentation of the multiverse situation at hand is true which sets up an amazingly meta version of spidermans unending trolley problem i really dont want the filmmakers to wuss out and make loopholes then hes right regardless of how much of a  he is were faced with difficult decisions constantly in life often involving loss and sacrifice to varying degrees of severity to give miles an out of this dilemma makes this spiderman story less impactful and less relatable  spiderman and his world are fictitious but the experiences and ideas fundamental to his character are very real thats why i fell in love with the character were not insulated from loss hardship and the need to try to keep going  
  
i like that the movie ended on a cliffhanger it gives the audience time to really think about miless moral dilemma before the next film gives its own stance to the problem  
  
edit a really great sequence of events that really illustrates miless dilemma is him being confronted by his family and school counselor on trying to eat his cake and have it too miles asserts that hed just bake two cakes later for his dads promotion celebration party he does purchase two cakes both of which end up ruined",2023-06-02
i liked it i think the biggest issue with this movie is that it is split into two parts and so this movie really feels incomplete after leaving the theater and im not a fan of that at least infinity war is its own movie and can be watched in isolation this movie cannot and thats troubling it was a mistake to end it on a cliffhanger and thats bugging me quite a lot the more i sit on it otherwise i really enjoyed this move funnily enough i thought the first half was far stronger than the second half which is apparently an unpopular take here the first hour had me totally engaged loving every second of it the india mannahaten scene didnt really work for me as well overall id say a solid 7510 perhaps an 810 if i am to count how amazing it looked visually,2023-06-02
"i think its a great first half of a 4 hour movie only having half a story means youve got a few issues 

 no complete arcs for characters means im not as attached to them i dont care for hobie indian spider man etc like i do the guys in the first film part of that is that the guys in the first films had full arcs 

 a bit too decompressed the movie didnt need an hour before gwen met miles again spider verse 1 showed how you could tell a powerful story in such a short space of time gwens intro in 1 is so emotional and its like 40 seconds long 

 as a result of it being too long and having incomplete arcs its all setup and no payoff we spent the first hour with miles family but there was no payoff so it felt like a waste of time we learnt about spider society but didnt find out anything about 2099s true motivations so it felt like a waste a 2 parter needs payoffs in the first half 

like i say its a great first half of a film but it does not stand as a movie in itself

plus it doesnt have as many memorable moments as the first the only moment in this that sticks in my head is gwens intro in the first film you had peter bs intro leap of faith the alchemax break in a real highlight spider mans death so many moments",2023-06-02
no kidding as soon as it ended my immediate feeling was gratefulness  just gratefulness that im alive to bear witness to this  its a staggering achievement in animation in superhero storytelling in cinema in general  when i heard that around 1000 people worked on this movie it made sense  every time you think the superhero genre is oversaturated bloated upon repair but something like this comes along to pull me right back,2023-06-03
so if all the spidermen are at spiderman hq during all this whos protecting their universe,2023-06-03
this is one of those movies where i’m just there i’m just living in it and soaking up everything that’s going on i know that sounds super corny but there’s just nothing like these spiderverse movies animation is great story is great writing is great characters are all developed and great just a wonderful film where you can feel the passion oozing off of it spot is brilliant miguel is complex gwen got her time to shine and miles is still taking us on great lessons on how to be yourself i’m so excited to see the old gang more specifically spiderham back again and how they interact with punk who is fantastic but everyone has said enough about him and india who i was way more invested in than i thought i’d be i’d be lying if i said i wasn’t nervous because these films are two for two so far and they’ve got big shoes to fill but i am eager to see the conclusion to this epic trilogy truly awesome bravo to everyone involved all around,2023-06-03

i took this as the 42 spider was from miguels universe and was supposed to bite him but it got teleported  so miguel somehow figured out about the multiverse and his supposed role in it and made that chemical he injected himself with to become a spider person anyway  part of him hates miles for getting the powers he was supposed to have  therefore the universe we see miles in at the end is miguels

one thing i don’t think any of the reviews mentioned was that this movie pulled off an even greater version of narrative decoys than infinity war in that movie the avengers weren’t the protagonists of the story thanos was the protagonist as he’s the one going the proverbial hero’s journey in the film in across the spiderverse miles and the spot are both decoys as the protagonist and antagonist respectively as the true protagonist and antagonist of this film are gwen stacy and miguel o’hara,2023-06-04
a 1010 movie with beautiful and amazing animations styles and storytelling between miles and gwen a movie which i should have taken a picture near a poster or something for memory but i didn’t the excitement for the continuation is uncontrollable because of the cliffhanger and it’s gonna be a heck of a wait because i’m a teenager who like miles doesn’t know what to be and do in life last time i was this excited was with how to train you dragon the hidden world because that was one of my favorite animated movie as a child       really not sure how they will beat the expectations like this one but i’m confident in sony also did anyone notice how miguel said “we are” to all spider people to me it’s like he didn’t tell everything and is hiding something just a guess who thinks miles will make himself a new suit,2023-06-04
it all felt so uncompromoised it really felt as if everybody working on this were given the reigns and gave it their all to this movie,2023-06-04
is it fair to say that miguel o hara is basically a giant spiderman fanboy who’s mad that miles isn’t the perfect spiderman that he envisioned i see many comic fanboys who treat comic book miles the exact same way because he doesn’t go through enough tragedy or because he is black,2023-06-04

"my full spoilerheavy thoughts

gonna start with my main negatives first because i dont want to end on a negative this movie is quite possibly the clearest second in a trilogy ive ever seen the entire movie feels like a second act because it is the pacing suffers at times as a result and it was painfully clear from the beginning that it was going to end on a cliffhanger the entire movie essentially from opening to credits feels like buildup in four years apparently next year when the final movie is out i dont think ill look back on this as much of an issue in the moment its a bit unsatisfying the first movie worked much better as a standalone probably because they werent sure if it would become a trilogy yet

my other slightly more nitpicky complaint is that the side characters in this movie dont get enough time in the first movie spidernoir nicholas cages best role dont  me and the other side spider people got the perfect amount of screentime in this one i loved hobies character but they really just mostly used him as comic relief and only for a pretty short time other than peter b being back and still great pretty much all the other nonmain characters were very forgettable

however maybe thats forgiveable because the main characters in this movie have a lot going on miless plot is excellent but he stays moreorless the same person that he was at the end of the first movie throughout this one the two main emotional driving forces of this movie are miless relationship with his parents and gwen miles is still ostensibly the protagonist but gwens arc anchors the movie and is the emotional center the two scenes with her and her dad that bookend the film are for me the most emotional and powerful moments in the entire movie its incredible stuff as an aside as far as the whole trans gwen thing goes i think its a pretty clear metaphor but i think it would be even cooler if in the final film they just outright state it not as an easteregg or hidden detail but just make it a central part of her character will it happen prooooooobably not but i think its entirely possible and would be based as 

miless arc is also great and i like the way they focused more on his parents this time around it prevents the movie from just retreading the same ground i love that hes confident throughout the entire movie they didnt feel the need like many series do to take a step backwards and force him to go through the same arc as the first movie hes working through an entirely new set of problems now but he never loses the swagger he gained

the villains in this movie are also great i dont really have much to say here other than that the way it manages to have two completely distinct sets of villains with both being terrifying while being completely different and at odds with each other is excellent and im very interested to see what they do with them in the conclusion

speaking of things that are excellent lets talk about the animation in this movie i went in expecting it to be great but a part of me was worried that it wouldnt push any new ground compared to the first movie holy  am i glad to be wrong this movie is a visual masterpiece from start to finish takes the brilliant stylization of the first movie and plugs it directly into an amplifier the scene at the start with the davinci bird thing instantly dispelled any of my worries the way each dimension is clearly stylized differently while somehow all feeling cohesive and part of the same world well technically not but you get it is masterful every action sequence is jawdropping in style animation choreography its all just insane and an absolute visual spectacle and nonaction scenes look universally beautiful i love the story but this is comfortably the selling point of the movie and its an 1110

the soundtrack is great maybe not quite as originalfeeling as the first film but consistently excellent nonetheless

the glover cameo was completely out of nowhere and the whole theater gasped at it felt slightly out of place but that didnt really matter

the humor is excellent throughout there were a couple of misses but overall it was hilarious but knows when to step back for a proper tone

overall 8510 has the aforementioned pacing issues and i can nitpick other stuff but from start to finish its an exciting emotional stunningly beautiful rollercoaster ride",2023-06-06

just saw it yesterday and really enjoyed it but was lowkey disappointed that gwens universe wasnt 42 they made a big deal of how unique she is in the beginning being a gwen that doesnt fall for spiderman doesnt die tragically and even later in the film with her dad quitting meaning she doesnt have the police captain tragedy to worry about anymore or at least on the same level as before would have been an interesting twist if you found out that miles wasnt the first anomaly but gwen is maybe thats a twist in beyond,2023-06-07

i didn’t love this movie like i wanted to  huge fan of the first one i know people rave about the pacing but i did not like it felt it was a tad bit slow overall i think my expectations were way too high and it didn’t match them,2023-06-08
"just got out and still recovering from the to be continued 

btw across makes into the spiderverse mid in comparison
whats wrong with me",2023-06-08
"miguel is going to step down as leader of the spider society once he realizes miles is right and theyre going to appoint gwen as their new captain  


then she will die",2023-06-09
decent film great characters this is probably the best representation of the multiverse ive seen but im still not really into the concept im not as high on the animation as seemingly everyone else either at times its like im watching a 3d movie without wearing the glasses overall i did enjoy it mostly because of the comedy and family drama 710,2023-06-10
"the movie was insane so much detail and easter eggs that i might need to rewatch it two more times to catch them all

the premise of the movie is so ambitious but they made it all work truly the project is the best thing to come from the mcu",2023-06-11
absolutely perfect,2023-06-17
one thing is confusing me if the spot was the scientist who was hit by the bagel he would have always been in miles’ universe so why the spider that bit miles from earth 42 wouldn’ also be from the same universe as spot and miles,2023-06-19
"is anyone going to answer how morales didnt notice world 42 wasnt his world when it is in a totally different state  


i feel like they just lied to the spectators by not acknowledging it and givin us the trippy scene of morales coming back to his room instead  


the only unique spidermans are the indian vamipre and jacket ones every other spiderman is exactly the same and no other spiderman but the main ones even interact with morales  


so many spidermans had  as cakes literal cakes man i dont know who of the artists sneked that in but it is insane the level of cakes that they had  


i dont believe that the characters wouldnt visit morales sooner it just feels like you are changing the characters aroudn at will",2023-06-28
"i watched this with my kids yesterday very mixed bag we all groaned at the cliff hanger but enjoyed a lot the characters animation and performances i hated the opening 20 minutes in gwens dimension the color styling massive brush strokes and inconstancy of the shots hurt my eyes so much i wanted to leave i put my sunglasses on instead my eyes were happy when we went back to miles dimension 

spot was an odd villain no menace sort of goofy but clearly murderous by the end he didnt work for me the constant combination of styles and textures was very cluttered the vultures art style was so jarring along with spiderpunk that it feels more like sloppy collage than anything else the visual excess overwhelmed most of the action and humor all the best parts were with miles and his family and gwen",2023-07-04
one of the best trilogies of all time is being produced in real time masterpiece after masterpiece,2023-08-10
why is this my favorite spiderman… off all time ,2023-08-11
this movie was mid aka average at best,2023-08-31
that 2 hour 20 minute runtime felt way too short i never expected it would end like that,2023-06-02
"one of the greatest movies of all time miles morales is the greatest spiderman of all time

the pacing is perfect and not a single frame is wasted in this movie

go see this right now",2023-06-02
"i forgot that this film was going to be a trilogy so i was surprised at the ending i thought wed get our finale with miles spot and 2099 the ending with miles transporting into the spider that bit miles’ universe was a great twist which i didnt expect though i feel like it couldve completed itself if miles ended up in his universe they built up spot but he lives on to the next movie which is comical to have a dlist villain be the antagonist for two whole movies

i didnt like the art style of this film i felt like it was too much and there were too many different graphics that was going on its really difficult to immerse yourself in the movie when objects feel out of place it had way too many styles and visual jargon making it difficult to focus basically if everything stands out nothing does im also not a big fan of the environment of spidergwens and spiderindias world it looks like jackie chan adventures with filters on their universe does not look real


the characters were great oscar isaacs miguel ohara was menacing and the movie made spot a convincing villain after he takes his transformation the movie stays grounded with miles relationship with his parents and as well with gwen outside of the constant bombardment of visual animation style that could cause a mild seizure i thought the movie was great though i dont know if the movie is worthy of a sequel",2023-06-03
could you imagine seeing a clone of your nephew and your first instinct is to knock him out,2023-06-03
as jarring as it was im incredibly happy its part 1 that to me just mean we were able to get more stunning beautiful showstopping action scenes in both parts,2023-06-03
this needs to be nominated for best picture,2023-06-04
i absolutely loved this movie but i hope they come through in btsv with some explanation of miguel o’haras behavior cause he was a real controlling  in this movie and of all the 2099 comics i’ve read miguel is never an actual … he was a beast and bad  but i felt like they did him dirty a bit  maybe there’s a different version of miguel somewhere out there that isn’t an ,2023-06-05
best movie ive ever watched,2023-06-05
when miles got to nueva york and met vr spider chick i noticed gwen was always trying to get him to go if you look at her face while he was talking to cute vr spider i think gwen was jealous anyone notice that,2023-06-05
"my only two complaints is that i feel like miguel should have explained the idea of determinism a bit better and made it more universal instead of sounding like only spiderpeople are influenced by the deterministic nature of the multiverse or something the way it sounded is if other people are saved that arent related to spidermen then nothing happens only the universe collapses if an uncle ben is saved or something i think presenting the idea as universal determinism would sound a bit more mature and makes it sound like stopping miles would actually make sense because as it seems it sounds like miles would only doom his own universe if at that considering hes an anomoly to begin with and never doomed his universe

the other complaint i have is that they shouldnt have any references to live action movies i think this universe or multiverse should stay its own property and independent from the live action movies because the only thing it does is now bring scrutiny to the other propertieslike how technically nobody in tobys life died as a captain of a police force also i want to think as little about the  that is the mcu as possible so tying this universe in with that  just didnt bring anything positive to this movie imo

those are minor complaints and this movie is still incredible i just wanted to throw out the things i thought could be improved because everyone is already saying what it does so so well",2023-06-05
just saw it the audio was off bad it was hard to hear voice acting made it difficult to enjoy spoke to the manager at the cinema said the audio was released messed up and theyre awaiting a improved version got a refund,2023-06-10
and i never thought mass effect 3 would get unseated as the worst ending of all time,2023-06-21
i absolutely hated the ending,2023-07-08
is it okay to go if i havent seen the first one i wanted to see it in theaters back then but life got in the way im familiar with miles gwen miguel etc from the comics,2023-06-02
best picture 2024  and beyond will win in 2025  back to back calling it now,2023-06-10
my jaw was on the floor with every abstract stylistic flourish the animation is beyond unreal i didnt think they could top what they did in the first one but holy  this movie fires on all cylinders and just never stops i loved it,2023-06-02
this movie felt really bloated  given it was the first of two parts so that makes sense but there wasn’t a second of this movie that i didn’t enjoy watching,2023-06-02
"the way me and two people sitting next to me all blurted out what the  simultaneously at the end

but seriously this movie was incredible in a way few movies are from the art to the dialogue to the action to the art to the art to the art also the art

watch it in theaters and in imax if you can it is so worth it",2023-06-02
"i honestly think this might be one of my favourite films ever certainly my favourite sequel by a country mile pretty much every aspect of it just works amazingly well

the only complaint that i have is one id have to go back and watch again to see if it was me going in on an empty stomach or just how i felt about the movie but it felt a little too packed with stuff i feel this could easily have been two movies not that either was rushed or felt lessened by the first but i guess its like getting an all you can eat buffet from only michelin star chefs and theres a minimum amount you have to eat its amazing but after awhile you start to waver

a second viewing is absolutely necessary and something i cant wait for",2023-06-02

can someone identify the song spiderpunk uses in his intro is that original or an existing song,2023-06-03
what an amazing movie loved every second of it,2023-06-04
i have so many things to say and think about the movie but my main thing is was the spot 3d or 2d or did he constantly switch in between it was an amazing detail that i could never tell imo but i was curious,2023-06-04
what was the song playing during the introduction scene of miles it’s a classic rap song but i can’t remember the name of it and spotify or imdb isn’t helping me with this,2023-06-07
"the ending left me with goosebumps my arm hairs still standing

this movie could have benefited being shorter but it made the most out of the time to tell a very cohesive story

the only thing i can say is that this was absolutely awesome 

not only that but we were given very intimidating villains sure we are introduced to a guy named spot who debuts as a bit of a comedic villain he also ends up as one of the more dangerous villains in the spiderverse

then theres the vampire spiderman and the setup villain towards the end who honestly made me a bit fearful for miles",2023-06-09
so city in universe of spider 42 is in chaos because peter parker never became spiderman in this universe but why police captain died without any spiderman existing in any universe some police captain with daughter is destined to die,2023-06-09
am i the only one who expected the movie to actually come to a conclusion i thought it was phenomenal but the cliffhanger end ,2023-06-14
i was terrified that the ending was gonna be rushed cause i could feel that how long it had been and i felt the tension of the movie rising but somehow i felt they had already given some amount of closure to the story with the chase scene ending and miguel atleast making the descision to gell his mom he was spiderman then when gwens speech started my creeping suspicion that the ending was gonna be rushed faded into a no  way please no dont end it now feeling all in all  love this movie will rewatch it atleast 20x before part 2 comes out,2023-06-17
i had no idea this was going to be 2part movie prior to seeing this filmfelt like i got blue balled at the end,2023-07-09
okay i’m late to the party but am i crazy or was it implied that peter parker is spot miguel said he died the day of reactor explosion and we know from gwen’s world peter under the right circumstances becomes a villain ,2024-03-16
so wait isn’t the entire thing miguel’s fault if he knew that miles wasn’t supposed to be spiderman in his universe and how that event caused that whole issue with spot and the collider shouldn’t he have taken action way earlier,2024-03-18
"just got back home from the theaters without a doubt one of my favorite movies of all time and easily the best piece of animated media i’ve ever had the pleasure to watch

it sounds corny but it’s the kind of passion and love that goes into making something like this that actually gives me some sense of like direction and motivation in life such a beautifully made movie

i legit don’t have a single complaint about this the animation plot characters emotional moments comedic relief and whatever other qualitative aspects of movies one could list were all masterfully done in my opinion incredibly excited for part two left the theater  near tearing up",2023-06-03
honestly one of the best movies i have seen in my life,2023-06-02

one question why did the scarlet spider called miguel o hara as “father” am i missing something,2023-06-10
the best movie i’ve watched since inception i loved this movie,2023-06-02
im seeing this with some 8 and 10year olds who probably wont watch the first spiderverse film first is it enough if i just explain miles is a teen who got spiderpowers he helped spidermen from other universes get back to their universes and he has a crush on spidergwen,2023-06-02
i didnt know so many people werent aware that this was a two parter knowing before helped a lot since i was mentally prepared to not have a complete story,2023-06-02
gotta say lizard peter died like a chump,2023-06-02
so part of me is thinking that since miles was never supposed to be spiderman he also doesn’t have an official spidercanon so i feel like that’s how they’re gonna work around him saving his dad we already had him lose uncle aaron so i feel like another loss won’t be needed they’re gonna find some way around it,2023-06-02
i thought it was good the donglover cameo as prowler was great  peter b was good  i know theyre showing a lot more of gwens story but i would  for her origin story as a movie too  excited to see the ogs all coming to help miles at the end as well  i guess i kept the spoilers away well enough because i had no idea it was a part 1,2023-06-02
"the animation was insane and shouts out to metro boomin on the soundtrack

my audience gave a round of applause once credits hit 910 movie for me

i genuinely would like to peel the curtain back and really ask the editors animators and vfx teams how intensive and laboring this project was i couldn’t really believe what i was looking at at times it was so beautifully animated  pieced together,2023-06-02
i have nothing much to say except i was wondering where this was going curious how they were going to wrap up the movie with spot and then boom to be continued holy  my theater gasped and couldn’t believe we all got blue balled,2023-06-02
the ending proved i can watch a 4 hour spider verse movie goddamnit,2023-06-02
"does the spot actually know miles identity yet or does he have to figure it out in the third film before he can target his dad 

i was amused that the bagel guy from the first film ended up being this major villain",2023-06-02
i walked out feeling like i watched something amazing and that i should feel amazed…but i couldn’t help but be a bit unsatisfied and that the pacing was a weak point and then i realized…its the first 23 hours of a 45 hour movie literally felt like a complete film cut right down the middle infinity war was a gut punch but definitely stands on its own,2023-06-02
hoping paul shows up in beyond to make sure everything is set straight,2023-06-02

"great movie but its not as great as what made the first one a masterpiece the animation is absolutely amazing and phenomenal but the story is a lot weaker and leaning more towards mcu and more of a spectacle or an event film i dont want to say style over substance because there were great emotional beats but i cant quite place my finger on it yet im sure more comic book fans found this more epicer or whatever 

still really really enjoyed it though",2023-06-02
i dont understand how strong the prowlers motivation can be to hurt or  his doppelganger its insane that his and uncle aarons first instinct would be to  or torture miles,2023-06-02
spiderman across the spiderverse has a runtime of 139 minutes and 56 seconds making it around 20 minutes longer than its predecessor into the spiderverse the extended duration is expected to be worthwhile,2023-06-02
 that ending idc,2023-06-02
"stunning animation really a game changer these movies have done wonders for the genre the references to other spiderman properties are wonderfully done and i think its almost impossible to not enjoy this film i dont think its as good as the first one though for a couple of reasons  
  
firstly there are just too many scenes with the parents this film touches on many great themes but i just feel like they keep on hammering on the feelings of love and family just way too much some of these scenes are just too long  
  
the first film was about 2 hours but had an alt version which was 20 mins longer of unfinished scenes it feels to me like this film also should have been 2 hours but this time they fully developed the 20 mins of deleted scenes and put them in the base movie the pacing suffered as well with miles not even showing up until 20 minutes have passed at the beginning  
  
it also annoyed me how this is very much a part 1 and literally ends in the middle of a scene on a very abrupt cliffhanger we did know this already going into it but its still frustrating knowing theres a yearlong wait i also thought it was a bit lame that the main villain is just a minor underling from the first movie  
  
its also worth pointing out im not a fan of multiverse stuff in general so this film did go a little too far in terms of variants for my liking i liked seeing 4 or 5 in the first movie but when it gets to seeing thousands of spiderman it ruins the concept of the main character to me",2023-06-03
"incredible movie i can’t say a lot that others haven’t already said easy 1010 and best superhero film this year for me which is saying a lot because gotg vol 3 was also incredible

a couple of nitpicks

why didn’t miles turn invisible when he was running from all the other spiderpeople either he forgot or it’s hard to be invisible while also running and using all his other powers either explanation works for me i think i prefer if his invisibility isn’t used too much because it’s extremely overpowered it’s one of those abilities you kind of have to write around

it was a little silly that miles was able to tail gwen after talking to his mom for a couple of minutes she would’ve been long gone my headcanon is that she left a trail of webs we never see them because of movie magic but realistically a spiderperson always leaves a trail of danglies to follow",2023-06-03
ok people what would you do to someone who says they dont like the film or the 1st one and thinks they are terrible films in general,2023-06-03
really good movie not as good as the first tho and they could have fit the whole story in one no reason to have a part 2 tbh,2023-06-03
i’m gonna see this movie in a while…it’s so hard to avoid spoilers…hope no one spoils it for me,2023-06-03
i think this might be my new favorite movie of all time,2023-06-03
a masterpiece woooooow best superhero movie after infinity war and endgame ,2023-06-03
"im in the minority where i actually prefer the visual style of into the spiderverse across the spiderverse is undoubtedly more ambitious frame by frame but into the spiderverse edited together much more smoothly than the visual overload on display here less was more imo

but the different art style does make these movies feel even more like a comic book series specifically when a book switches artists but keeps the same writers",2023-06-03

i’m not sure what to make about the mixing with the larger mcu especially having “real” characters show up what do miles and the other animated characters think when they saw donald glover or videos of andrew garfield or tobey maguire do they know they’re animated now,2023-06-03
"imagine if 20 years ago someone told you there would be literally 100s of spidermen intl the same movie

"loved the movie the attention to detail and story were phenomenal 

but i have a question if peter b parker with baby is supposed to be from earth 616 but tom hollands is also from 616 was this intentional or a mistake miguel mentions the little nerd with dr strange so we can assume the animated one and tom are not the same",2023-06-03
"1000010 not just the greatest spiderman movie ever one of the greatest animated works ever created emotional powerful beautiful amazing character depth and realistic relationships the work they put into the different animation styles was insane

love how much focus on miles and his parents’ relationship we got as well as gwen and her dad the inclusion of tobey andrew and the mcu stuff… and the video game stuff everything was just perfect for me

movie really felt like a comic book brought to life and i love that they had the actual comics that certain storylines and events were borrowed from the easter egg video for this is going to be so fun to watch

metro soundtrack not only lives up to the original but surpasses it that ending scene with gwen putting her own team together and heading into the portal… goosebumps

i need part two now",2023-06-04
i liked it a lotcan’t wait for part 2 but something seemed to poke at meit was the part when miles was talking about why he should follow along with his dad dying just because they said so or somethingwhat i got from this was religion vibes i don’t know if they intended it to be like this or if i inserted this all by self but yeah i just wanted to give my two cents about that lol,2023-06-04
if miles is already an anomaly why would it matter if he loses his father or not,2023-06-04
why did they write miguel to say all that crazy  to miles on the train they made my boy a villain for no reason at all,2023-06-04
"the movie is great and the best spiderman film imo but the plot does have details i need a light on or need to rewatch at least

1 is the indian spiderman already part of the society when we first see him kinda weird if his canon event hasn’t happened yet

2 most of the society didn’t about canon events right cos why would most of them go along with it

3 why would a canon event need to happen for an anomaly like miles

4 isn’t one canon event enough for miles his uncle dying",2023-06-04
why wasnt nic cages spiderman in this film because he was too busy fighting a spider in another dimension ,2023-06-04
"thoughts on the movie


am i the only one who thinks that all of them acted out of emotions miles immediately starts to deny everything miguel said when he literally could destroy the whole multiverse if he breaks a canon event i get why but still man youre spiderman yknow the responsibilites miguel does not even try to find any other way and wants everything to go his way isnt being spiderman like not giving up gwen runs away from her problems rather than facing it which turns out to be the right decision btw to actually he honest

honesty was such a big theme in this movie a lot of things couldve been solved if they were all honest with each other


nitpicks

also loved the movie alot just felt like miles plot armor was off the charts on this one he outsmarted hundreds of spidermen who all have more experience than he does like bro he couldve gone to like a spiderprison or smth first then escape with his electric powers and just use his stealth to try and escape does that mean that if an electro anomaly gets caught he can easily get out like miles thats my only nitpick in this movie everything else was phenomenal",2023-06-04
miles morales ending up in the wrong dimension would’ve hit harder if they didn’t show earth42 on the screen before he teleported cheapened his reveal to his mom knowing that dimension didn’t have a spiderman to begin with,2023-06-04
i have no way of proving this but i predict that in the 3rd movie they’re going to turn earth 42’s miles into spiderman or if there’s no spider convince him to prowl for good either way we’ll get a comic book cover i hope,2023-06-04
after this movie i wish the entire mcu was just fully animated because that would be wild,2023-06-04
"meta commentary 
when writers try to go against the standard spiderman canon events like death of uncle or captain or gwen stacy after in an relationship to spiderman the story or production gets axed by the studios apparently the most powerful entity in the multiverse 

miles morales is an attempt by the writers by breaking those conventionsexpectations and making this a bigger success not just with the audience but also the studios who made tons of cash because of the success",2023-06-04
it was everything i wanted and everything i didnt know i needed masterpiece cant wait for part 2,2023-06-04
this thing was layered deeper than the lego movies i feel i could watch it through 10 times and get a different experience,2023-06-04
one thing i saw upon rewatch of the black and white scene with spot online was that when you see the radioactive spider disappear in one of the holes it was right next to a kid with 2 braids so i’m guessing prowler miles was supposed to be that universe’s spiderman,2023-06-05
the art and action sequences were beautiful loved all the small little references to other spiderman media but the film was let down by being a two parter it just dragged on and on introducing a character just to forget about them after 5 minutes and it felt it was always building up to something with no payoff the first third of the movie could of been cut with no real issue and more spot and spider civil war could have been added,2023-06-05

masterpiece greatest animated film ever made best superhero film ever made and my favorite film ever made breathtaking film and absolutely beautiful and i just cant rave about this movie enough captivating in every way and all that hype and acclaim is worth every word a true work of art and all time classic if they pull off the third one it will go down as the great superhero trilogy ever and imo the greatest film trilogy ever they did it again,2023-06-05

was expecting at least a moment of doctor strange based on his early mention in the movie but didn’t see or hear anything else did i miss something,2023-06-10
the way it ended wasn’t enough for me,2023-06-11
"great film but i have an incredibly small nitpick that really doesnt matter or affect how good the film is its just stuck in my head 
why does the spider have 42 on it does every spider have the number of universe it comes from on it if so how do the residents of a universe know the number of their universe without knowledge of other universes",2023-06-12
"i feel like im going crazy reading this thread i was extremely disappointed that the message seems to be miles is right stronger and more in control of destiny than hundreds of other spidermen and people are somehow agreeing with his edgy attitude


miguel was 100 right one life shouldnt be worth more than billions hopefully they find a smart way in the next movie to write that bad  happens and you cant do anything about it would be a very frustrating trilogy if the message was just oh try hard enough and you become omnipotent",2023-06-21
" miles morales mf knew that if he tried to save his dad the whole universe would get  up and destroyed 

but in the end i know miles morales will win because well its miles morales story miguel imho is the hero while miles is potraying the villian arc saving one person while the whole world gets sacrificed",2023-08-09
" movie first one was good for been original and faithful to source material with some flaws
but this one long clickbait movie star wars style the guy that is learning the tricks are the “best one” in a span of months also many plot holes and the cultural  taking over 

that is the problem with multiverse movies so much potential and never the balance with fresh and source 

the only thing that i must acknowledge is the style is lit and beautiful",2023-08-19
just got out of my second viewing how is hobie so cool couldnt be upset if the girl i had been pining over was shacking up with him,2023-06-03
so spider gwen is a trans girl,2023-06-05
to y’all upset about the cliff hanger i have to kno did y’all feel that way about empire strikes back infinity war or fellowship of the ring i personally loved the end and love how grand and epic this story is getting,2023-06-03
"i want spider man across the spider verse to be free 

right now because not everyone has cash or something fun too do and im not gonna let it slide that people wanna have a bad quality or a interupting sound or a text in the movie so thats my opinoin",2023-06-20
there’s no way they dropped this film in the beginning of pride month as a coincidence never in a million years did i think i would see being spiderman as a metaphor for being in the closet,2023-06-02
"i know to make the story work they had to make miguel an  but did they have to make him a straight up  it sucks this will be the first time a lot of people are introduced to spiderman 2099 and now everyone will think he’s just always a 


that’s my only small complaint i wouldn’t change a single frame of anything else i just feel they could have given miguel a bit more than the algorithm told me bro i’m just following orders i felt like he should have been more empathetic towards miles the way dr strange was to peter in “spiderman no way home” miguel was more like no bro   your dad that’s just the cost of being spiderman get over it 

as if anyone sane is supposed to just accept their father dying as a cost of doing business also i’m glad the addressed the obvious loophole of their dads simply quitting their jobs although it doesn’t solve the problem still by miguel’s logic they will still meet and get close to another cop who will have to die in order to please cannon",2023-06-05
"im i the only one hope miles get what he deserved his dad need to die
spiderman is not spiderman if theres no suffering",2023-06-03
haven’t seen any discussion about miguel possibly being a version of the prowler posing as a spiderman he has claws and even miles makes a comment at one point asking why he even has them if he’s a spiderman,2023-06-05
"who knew the  spot could be so terrifying man hes not even close to as terrifying as dr doom though that man remains no1 when it comes to lines and just being terrifying while also being absolutely hilarious 

you could no joke have an entire movie based on doom just roasting the  out of all the characters in marvel and itd be amazing",2023-06-14
the one thing i can’t get behind it’s a small thing but she was like my second favourite character from the first movie but  redesign like why,2023-06-02
only reason i voted that way is because of that ending not going to elaborate until the hardcore fans have had a chance to watch it,2023-06-02
did anyone feel like the motion was a little off than the first movie or is it just me ,2023-06-02
if there can only be one spiderman in each universe and the insomniac spiderman is canon then why is miles allowed to coexist in that universe,2023-06-04
a love story family superhero movie all packed into one,2023-06-04
imagine spiderverse getting a best picture nom at the oscars competing against scorseses flower moon ,2023-06-05
did anyone else notice that miless mom has the dead anime mom hairstyle,2023-06-05
wait so if gwens dad is no longer captain he doesnt have to die so then wouldnt gwen just tell miles to ask his dad not to be captain so that he doesnt have to die boom problem solved,2023-06-06
i didnt catch every cameo but oh whoa there was a lot did i miss donald glovers reaction to spider horse it felt like a reference to something but im not sure,2023-06-06
i liked it a lot not sure what i expected but it surprised me since i avoided most trailers and spoilers and went in almost blind  i liked miguel’s reasoning tbh and it always the teen who knows better trope lol idk miguel has a point i loved seeing all the other spiderman’s but indian spiderman with his yoyo allowing him to do cooler things like that was creative as  and giving the hundred others ones slightly cool variants must have taken forever not sure how miles got away like that outsmarting everyone when he still doesn’t come across as being that genius 4 steps ahead guy but idk it seemed almost east for him lots of copaganda oh i have to do what’s right it was like preaching proud of the dad that quit so that redeems it i guess overall fresh,2023-06-08
"i think if they cut gwens subplot and miles in the wrong universe then they would have had time to tell this story in one movie miles just goes straight to try to save his dad from the spot

hopefully the storylines they add in part 3 justify splitting this film into 2 parts gwens universe may be the most beautiful of any of the ones shown so it certainly may have been worth it to have more time to explore these characters",2023-06-08
wow so im really in a different opinion to most on this i thought it was ok at best but a big disappointment after the excellent first film it was so clustered over blown and long,2023-06-10
why does universe 42 not have a spiderman spot and the other scientists pulled a spider from that universe yes but its not like that was the only spider how did pulling one random spider stop spiderman from being created did they pull it from the exact second it was about to bite that peter parker or something,2023-06-12
really wish they weren’t in a rush to make spiderverse into the mcu marvel needs to let things to be standalone even if they are popular the live action things made me roll my eyes a bit and took me out of the move a tad,2023-06-12
so miguels still aware of what doctor strange did except he doesnt remember it was on earth616,2023-06-13
i have a random question what happened the gwanda that is originally in miles’ universe we see him meet her on the first day of school and rip her hair out but never again…,2023-06-15
so i loved the animation and some of the storytelling beats but boy do i feel let down by that ending i just cant imagine returning to this movie unless its to do a marathon of the im assuming trilogy and i think thats a shame really frustrated by the episodic nature of marvels storytelling these days a movie should be a complete idea it can be a part of a whole but it shouldnt feel like like an incomplete,2023-06-20
gwen is gonna die in the third one isnt she,2023-06-24
"1110 even better than the first
the opening scene with gwen is the best thing i have ever seen",2023-06-02
how does spiderman hq world peter know miles just because peter from our world was friends with him does not mean the other peter would know who he is,2023-06-05
"might have been the biggest crock of  i can remember sitting through at least the biggest since the star wars sequels 

i’d rather have sat through a 354 hour movie than have that nutless “to be continued” right before the climax of the movie how could anyone think ending the movie before the boss fight was a good idea",2023-06-04
comparing the spiderman mask to a police badge made me roll my eyes weird choice after all of the spider punk stuff,2023-06-18
"spiderman is a  cop any movie about a hero cop is copaganda whether or not theyre wearing an nypd uniform

the first time we see spidey in the movie is fighting the mutilated survivor of a horrible industrial accident which happened during the kingpin fight whos trying to steal from a detached atm inside a bodega the guy mentions all this and also points out that the atm belongs to the bank and is fully insured so its a victimless crime miles still goes full cop on him and extorts the bodega owner for free food

who the  cares that gwen thinks her dad is a good cop the entire movie is a cop movie",2023-06-08
 this movie was hot garbage,2023-06-04
why is the president of the confederacy in a spiderman movie,2023-06-02
are we going to see a potential bad version of gwen stacy on earth 42 hood rat street walker maybe the female kingpin version pulling the strings,2023-06-07
this cliffhanger has to be among the best of all time right,2023-06-02
"first whoever is here down voting everyone to 0 you might want to get a life you got nothing better to do with your time than downvoting all the posts what a pathetic loser 

anyway movie was great

but i am not buying into the hype that this is the greatest superhero movie ever that  nah

i prefer live action any day over animated movies

movie was really good though",2023-06-02
that might have been the best animated movie i ever watched it was so crazy but felt personal for miles and gwen at the same time excited to see where this is gonna go for the next movie,2023-06-02
its crazy how so many people didnt knew this was a two part story,2023-06-04
the movie was fantastic the movie experience terrible child on a literal tablet the entire film two seats over mom on phone thru the film kid next to my wife being absolutely obnoxious with straws even tried going to the 9 pm showing why in the digital age can we not just pay to watch these things at home,2023-06-02
 i don’t want to wait 10 months this movie was incredible  the animation was a step above the first movie and that’s saying a lot in this franchise,2023-06-02
"i went in with high expectations because of the early reviews and wow they were exceeded this movie was just fantastic i enjoyed the score of this movie more than the first the animation was out of this world as expected i thought this was funnier than the first and the story was just amazing its one of the rare movies that i think surpasses the original a legitimate 1010 for me

plus i popped hard hard at ben reilly  couldnt stop laughing at his lines too",2023-06-02
so in love with this movie absolute cinema will be seated for repeat viewings,2023-06-02
for all the greatness in this movie i think the thing that is sticking with me is the score i honestly cannot put into words how perfectly the visuals and audio played together  even the way they used colorstyle changes in sync with music shifts just perfect,2023-06-02
what was the song in the credits,2023-06-02
"all ill say is that this movie was absolutely  incredible

oh and ill be watching it at least two more times in theatres",2023-06-02
im so  happy,2023-06-02
it was actually better than the first one cant believe it but yep good job guys,2023-06-02
y’all need to watch this high as  15mg and some hits from the pen will take you across the spiderverse,2023-06-02
this movies the best animated adaptation of the matrix reloaded we never got,2023-06-02
i thought that there was a postcredit scene with tom holland,2023-06-02
i thought it was too long and didnt enjoy ending 610,2023-06-02
so theres a line when miles is being chased by miguel up the train and he asks are you sure youre spiderman my theory is that miguel is either a clone or some sort of robocyborg that is being controlled by some org that has yet to be introduced thoughts,2023-06-02
"probably an unpopular opinion but i dont see why they had to make this a 2 part movie

everything about this movie was great except closing it out",2023-06-02
i absolutely loved it it was amazing in 4dx only problem was i knew it had a part 2 and due to comparisons to empire strikes back i knew it would have a cliffhanger so i spent the last quarter of the movie wanting to see more and hoping we’d get more movie before the to be continued and i’m not a big fan of the cliffhanger tbh put the characters in mortal danger let them lose the battle sure no problem but it felt like the battle hadn’t even started and i have no worries miles would break out easily so it was a very abrupt and not a great place to end so i guess my main problem is i wanted more movie,2023-06-03
"just watched it a few hours ago amazing film have almost no negative comments about it besides it being a part 1 

not sure if anyone else saw but was the scene towards the end with miguel walking on the roof referencing the spiderman walking meme had the exact same angle and look ",2023-06-03
im gonna get  on but while i liked the movie a lot i hated the way they did the cliffhanger ending it would have worked better as a tv show but for a stand alone movie i think you need to resolve some sort of immediate conflict i was blown away that people clapped but im in the minority here so whatever,2023-06-03
miles films on screen have been much better written than peters only spiderman 2 almost as good,2023-06-03
random question but did anyone else get physically sick from this movie lol i feel there was a lot to see halfway through i got a headache and by the end of the movie i threw up as soon we got home,2023-06-04
"after watching this movie and hearing about the inevitable live action adaptation of miles surely this is the miles we get in the mcu

audiences already identify with this miles so redoing his origin story would be a hard sell and to top it off theyve essentially laid the groundwork to transport him to the mcu

call it wishful thinking but i believe beyond the spiderverse will result in this version of miles making it into the mcu its too perfect not to",2023-06-04
"really good except

comedic lines don’t hit the same with miles and parents

gwen voiced by hailee steinfeld voice is sort of annoying 

a lot of dizzying scenes

animation was very clunky and overloaded with different mediums verse the 1st movie

cliffhanger 

the other spidermen being such followers and unspectacular

downvotes i loved the movie and plan on seeing it a second time in theatres    the animation in the first movie was better there was too many mediums in this one",2023-06-04
on my first watch this movie was hard to look at too much going on animation looked unfinished too much flashiness and it was giving me a headache maybe on my second watch it’ll be better but yeah kind of overhyped imo first one was better,2023-06-06
 miles is much better written than hollands peter we know everything miles wants everything he enjoys his pass time what he will do next etc this gwen is likely trans she has a trans flag in her room her father has a trans flag too all her colors are trans colors things are not just put into films its always a reason it would make sense because miles would not care if she trans miles is a great person their relationship is more than  at least on miles side i didnt like gwen in the end because miles never lied to gwen sadly she lied to him hopefully she makes it up to miles big time what she did to miles was really messed up,2023-06-08
"imax countdown ends 
some dude “move aside disney”
crowd chuckles and applauds

same dude “disneys done”

what a mess of a story also why couldnt they just include subtitles for spanish parts and that spiderpunk i couldnt understand a single word he said,2023-06-18
"so many dialogues were fast paced to look cool 
that spiderpunk spidey was pain in the eyes and ears to concentrate 
i did not understand  he is saying 
dragged first 1hr 15min with no main plot 
spot villain does not get enough screen time and idk where he gone 
sometimes vfx gone bad that it feels like powerpoint presentation of comic sketch book 
they put more time on cringe fast paced unnecessary dialogues than to show main villain and canon points 
there were some rememberable scenes in first film 
now if u think about some rememberable scenes u will notice they dragged af 
even supermario bros movie is fantastic with cgi 
they should have made 3d animation",2023-06-04
kinda disappointed with metro boomin in this,2023-06-02
this film was much better than the first and that’s saying something as i liked the first the visuals were absolutely beautiful and i loved the story however the to be continued was ridiculous there was no need to make this a two parter,2023-06-02
 it was so good i was like a kid in a candy store seeing all those spidermen that glover cameo  the story was good too i kept thinking why miguel and them did not want miles in the spiderclub then i realized lol my  that reveal that he was in the wrong universe wow really liked hailees acting in this as well also sidebar but gwen is really hot i had a feeling there would be a cliffhanger and when they played that inspirational music during gwens speech i was like yup credits coming in 321 cannot wait for the third part in march,2023-06-02
" 1010
the movie was gorgeous from start to even the credits music was fantastic my only criticisms are that the audio for some of the characters seem off and the movement in the spider city was very frantic and i got a little dizzy
the story was well done gwen’s arc was amazing i did guess the twist that miles wasn’t at his home from the different color and the dialogue with his mom was very odd
i really like the meta criticism of canon
the soundtrack was amazing
i was surprised that the movie was 2 hours it felt like such a rush and the guy next to me at the end was  and said that beyond better be next year and i said it was",2023-06-02
anybody share the plot please,2023-06-02
i have to say as an anarchist that one spiderman thats supposed to be one made me facepalm a lot but he was cool even if he was the chichest and most stereotypical anarchist you could get i did enjoy the movie though,2023-06-03
"the movie ends with two big plot holes

spider punk droped his teleporter after he left so there is no way he could had left his own teleporter to gwen much less drop it and manage to leave her dimension",2023-06-03
earth 42 has the worst mom how could she not tell that wasnt her miles honestly the whole earth 42 sequence didnt make sense i sure hope they explain how uncle aaron and alt miles seem to already know about alternative universes they didnt seem phased at all about a whole other miles existing and how does alt miles knock out spiderman he doesnt have his spider senses anymore why does alt miles already hate this new miles so much so many questions,2023-06-03
what i would like to say is that gwen is such a baddie i’m similar age so it’s alright only thing  bad was the frame rate seemed kinda bad at some parts,2023-06-04
the biggest proof this movie shares universe with mcu is not even the reality tree its the fact 42 prowler opens his helmet like iron man and star lord,2023-06-05
"honestly as a father of two toddlers that has limited time and heavy arrangements to go to the movies and i had to go by myself pretty late on a sunday

i wished they would have finished the whole story in one movie if i knew it didn’t have an ending i would have waited for rental or free on streaming

i feel defrauded

will definitely skip theatrical release of beyond spiderverse

the movie was going great tho",2023-06-05

"miles morales proweler

miles tails proweler

did they just plunge sonic the hedgehog  into spiderman",2023-06-05
i dont think this movie had enough from the first movie to grant a sequel the donut guy is a super arching villain and its supposed to be convincing that the spider that bit him in the first movie was a mistake as well as how the original team members couldnt visit miles because the movie had more screentime about the multiverse and its implications etc this movie felt more about miguel and spot minus the actual build up to their backgrounds theres the parent and relationship drama but with them being teens and this movie clearly being part of the mcu there will be no real sacrifices to any of that drama i just cant root for young teen drama or villains that are angsty with paper thin reasoning looks cool tho,2023-06-12
"this was probably the worst movie ive seen in a theater

visuals were completely over the top and gave me a headache these styles could have worked well in small doses or even medium doses but it was just unrelenting

plot was a muddled mess is spot destroying the multiverse or does he need to  miles dad to save the multiverse what course of action are the different spiderfactions even trying to accomplish and why

the emotional side was just completely dead weight all these heavy emotional dialogues between people with no real sense of what their conflict even was or what was resolved

the animators did do an incredible job many stunning compositions",2023-06-03
jeez at least give it a week,2023-06-02
correct me if im wrong in this movie felt like they have done dirty for peter parkers character especially that chasing scene most of spiderpeople  couldnt catch up miles i get that hes the lead but in a way indirectly theyre saying peter parkers is nothing compared to miles,2023-06-07
literally every other spider is more interesting than miles,2023-06-03
the little mermaid  spiderverse,2023-06-02
i didnt really get the donald glover prowler cameo why is the first we see him as the prowler a cameo where hes acting like hes been in the role for years,2023-06-02
overall i enjoyed it but it felt like a mess compared the the first one the animation and visuals were obviously incredible but pacing was pretty weird and the plot lacked any real focus the family scenes were excruciatingly boring and could have been cut down,2023-06-03
cash grab ,2023-06-04
imagine thinking it’s a good idea to make  that in a whole universe full of spider people and peter ducking parker’s  that miles is the only one who’s like hey wait no lemme try to save mine,2023-06-15
idk if this is possible but if the third movie somehow ends with miles morales jumping to the real world changes to shameik moore  the voice actor  and meets up with tom hollands spidey i would  all the bricks,2023-06-06
after watching the movie and getting some postnut clarity in i feel like i can say thank  i didnt pay to see the movie cause its part 1 ill pay for part 2 cause itll be the whole movie at that point,2023-06-02
release the cut without the liveaction ,2023-06-03
"this is not sending the right message that was my main though while watching the movie miles trying to save his father although it will destroy his universe is such a generic trope about doing the opposite of what everyone tells you to do to follow your heart be individual for once they could have gone with sometimes it is wise to listen to the people who are more wise than you  and make a hard sacrifice

another thing i dont like about the story is that i cannot relate to miles and his life problems cause his life is just easy he is healthy lives in new your has rich supportive parents and is basicly setup for life moreover with his superpowers he can swing between skyscrappers and do some casual fights with bad guys that apparently dont do him much trouble miles main life problems are much forced let me list them
• parents are worried about him because it seems like he is out doing drugs and premature  and he cannot tell them he is a spiderman
• his friends from the spiderverse havent visited him because of procedures complaining about that makes him a total drama queen
• he is notthechoosenone because someone else was supposed to be bitten by a spider miquel ohara makes it into a big deal instead of just being reasonable  being bitten is not something miles had any influence on much like all the choosenone spidermen 

moreover miles doesnt seem to have any reedeming qualities the though to help cure spots and free him out of his misery hasnt crossed his mind he kicked his butt and he is  done this movie shows that without the cool spider powers and a dad he would quickly become a heartless prowler it takes so little

as stan lee said peter parker was such relatable superhero because he was a loser he had many faults but he kept trying to do better miles is probably relatable to the current young generation as they are much more wealthy has less responsibility and less concerns they dont need deep emotional scenes if you play them some sad music during a scene they will think it is deep and emotional this is not sending the right message",2023-06-03
typical cash grab gave us half a movie,2023-06-12
"it’s amazing how an ending can make or break a film until the last 2 minutes this was an incredible movie the animation was fantastic the action was cool and the story was interesting then to be continued…

those three words killed this movie instead of this being the best animated film of the year it is an incomplete waste of time and a huge cash grab i will be skipping part 2 and part 3 and part 4 and any other part they plan on making",2023-06-03

the art style is impeccable as always there is a lot of fan service here but none of it really feels out of place or too in your face heartfelt story with twists and turns love it,2023-06-02
i feel like donald glovers prowler cameo was a confirmation of a future appearance in live action why would they spend thousands of dollars to make him a prowler suit for a 10 second scene i cant see sony allowing them to have that cameo unless they already have plans for him to return,2023-06-02
"amazing movie but really dislike cliffhanger endings like that there’s a right way to do a part 1’ssee dune and wrong way i went in forgetting this was a part 1 and so that really threw me off 

love all the references though and how they did the pointing meme without it being cringey",2023-06-02
these movies really like killing peter parker,2023-06-02
i went into it completely blind i enjoyed the first ones art music and storytelling so i figured why not it was so good the references for casual fans all the way to comiccartoon fans it was so on point and idk if they marketed it as a 2parter but not knowing that and seeing the twist at the end had my jaw on the floor my theatre absolutely lost it at all the nwhesque scenes and when the credits rolled,2023-06-02
can anyone tell me why prowler miles wants to capture spiderman miles how can holding spiderman miles captive benefit him in anyway,2023-06-02

"the last 20ish minutes felt like they were all scenes to end on

the twist was so telegraphed in advance i was like get on with it same kind of feeling as the end of lotr

so many spider society people being so okay with not saving everyone due to canon felt a bit wrong to me other than that it was everything i wanted out of the sequel it maintained momentum at keeping things fresh and energetic

plus i now know how to pronounce ganke",2023-06-02
not knowing this movie was going to be apart of a trilogy made it even better so many emotions i can not express how  good this movie was,2023-06-02
 i was enthralled the whole time,2023-06-02
can’t remember the last time i was left on a to be continued of this magnitude,2023-06-02
"yeah for any doubters out there…

this isn’t lego movie part 2 it’s a great sequel that builds off the first movie and doesn’t just seem like a “oh the first one did well make another” mess because sony needs money go see it see it twice then see it another time when beyond the spiderverse comes out",2023-06-02

"“it looks like you’re bleeding from your armpits”

1010 sequel the bar was set impossibly high with into the spiderverse but this topped it for me the art style performances and story were all a soundtrack was great and daniel pemberton crushed it with the score once again the main theme really is one of my favourites

attention to detail great voice acting fluid animation beautiful colors humor and melancholy this should be seen in the theater,2023-06-02
"my one major flaw with this film is that it’s a part 1 without seeing the conclusions to these arcs it left me wanting which i’ll take as a good thing

otherwise i thoroughly enjoyed it the technical scale was immense the visuals phenomenal and i love how they took the uncle ben complaint and actively used it as a plot point for questioning the cost of being a spiderman

also spiderpunk steals the whole film and he’s not even trying",2023-06-02
j jonah jameson being a nexus being is one of my favorite spidercanons  jk simmons should be him forever,2023-06-02
"wow this was phenomenal 

not going to dwell on any spoilers for now but its outstanding how everybody involved was able to perfectly balance deep emotional storytelling with vibrant fastpaced visuals that exhaust the senses in the best way possible it also boasts some fantastic themes of canon a sense of belonging and willingness to chart your own story that i truly believe will resonate with a lot of black kids as well as the audience in general  dont get me wrong my only criticism is that its a part one which i fully knew going in and the cliffhanger was so welldone that the whole theater went bananas when it ended lol 

im still buzzing man its just a remarkable piece of work now the question isnt if its going to win an oscar or not its a question of when and how many",2023-06-02

i just seen this movie and it was  amazing from the art and animation that i could go on forver talking about how great and fluid it was but lets just say i dont think i have never seen an animated movie with so much moving parts and crazy detail to it the plot was also something i was not expecting idk what i was expecting but it wasnt that i knew going into the movie it was only the first part so i wasnt upset abou the ending i actually thought the ending was great tbh i loved everything about this movie also with all the little easter eggs about every single spider man thing that has been released since was so  cool i have given this movie a  it is in my top 5 favorite animated movie of all time i want to go again tomorrow,2023-06-02

if theres no spiderman in universe 42 why is officer jefferson dead and miles prowler in that universe,2023-06-02
the animation is absolutely top notch and beautiful those scenes with miles trying to get back home with his thoughts haunting him as the scenery changes all just perfect with the narrative,2023-06-02
the end credits animations were just beautiful,2023-06-02

i was so disappointed thinking we were going to wait another few years for the next movie but it actually comes out next year holy fk,2023-06-02
if miles truly is an anomaly that isnt supposed to exist and he wasnt meant to be spiderman its interesting that his universe still has the spiderman loses a police chief close to him angle youd think that wouldnt need to happen to him if hes not really supposed to exist unless peter was meant to get close with mr morales and he was still meant to die,2023-06-02
the gwen stacey opening was straight up one of the best movie scenes ive ever seen the visuals music and writing really elevated that scene and made me wish we had a fulllength spider gwen spinoff,2023-06-02
i hope we get more lego spiderman in the next one lol the live action parts mschen with spot and donald glover as the live action prowler actually blended to together seamlessly and didn’t look odd at all i honestly would mind a space jam mix of animated and live action spider men characters spiderverse movie gwen calling miguel names when she first met him like dark garfield lol,2023-06-02
if you pay close attention to detail when the machine scans miles it says earth 42 which kinda ruins the twist and then the earth 42 art style is different than earth 1610,2023-06-02

"theres so much to unpack in this wonderful movie but two scenes stick out in my mind 

first the scene where gwen and miles hang upside down and just look out at the reflected new york skyline was just beautiful the visual fidelity and creativity with the set piece the humor with miles hand movements and the emotional nature of seeing two people who truly recognize how special they are to each other

second renaissance vulture is incredibly valid for destroying a jeff koons piece based af",2023-06-02
"theres one aspect of the plot im not sure i understand so what was gwens actual reason for being sent to miles universe was she supposed to survey spot or capture him

its mentioned later she and peter b parker knew that miles father was supposed to die as a canon event but miguel wouldnt have approved her stopping the spot if he was supposed to fulfill said canon event unless they only knew that miles father was supposed to die and only later figured out that the spot was supposed to fulfill that prophecy",2023-06-02

"1010 movie i’m genuinely not sure how they top this one but then again i wasn’t sure they could top the first one and they proved me very wrong there very much setting themselves up to stand among the greatest trilogies in film period 

glad i’ve lived this long to see what peak animation could look like that plot twist of the alternate universe miles ends up in is ‘darth vader being luke’s father’ levels of legendary too i don’t know if there’s truly a flaw in this film between visuals storytelling and sound soundtrack was on fire too loved that ain’t no love in the heart of the city was being played in aaron’s apartment and the end credits song was so heat too",2023-06-02
"where do we think the next part is going
presumably miguel is wrong about the ‘constant events’ and in some way miles will be able to save his dad
can’t work out if miguel is wrong or knowingly lying maybe he killed himself in that other dimension so he could have his daughter back and that caused the glitch
also at some point doesn’t miles say “are you sure you’re a spiderman” which made me wonder…is he and if he’s not what is he",2023-06-02

hope genke will be on the gang for the next movie,2023-06-02
as awesome as the cameos are seeing spiderpeople from across the franchise coming after miles is also unsettling and sad because all of those iconic and lovable versions of the character are ultimately trying to force one of their own to experience the same tragedy they themselves did,2023-06-02
anyone know the song that plays when miles starts getting chased by the spider society it plays over the cat and trex scenes cant find it on either soundtrack,2023-06-02

i thought jessica drew spiderwoman was a bit dull personality wise but otherwise i really enjoyed all the other spider characters,2023-06-02
movie was amazing was a bit too close to the screen tho so it was a lot definitely missed some stuff cant wait to rewatch at home and take in all the little details maybe wont be as rewatchable as the 1st until part 2 comes out but still a worthy sequel that really upped the ante on a lot of things,2023-06-02
absolutely incredible movie but man there are some parts where the audio was bad and you need subtitles to understand what the characters are saying i need the best buy steelbook asap,2023-06-02
"i have a few questions

 is ben reilly dead gwen stole his bracelet and yeeted him into a portal so is he gonna glitch out and die
 if spiderpunk left his bracelet when he quit how did he go to gwens dimension and leave it with her dad
 i was gonna ask why didnt miles ever go invisible when trying to escape but i assume it was to make it easy to lure all the spidermen away",2023-06-02
did i miss something of the plot but if a universe gets destroyed when canon changes then why wasnt the spiders that bit miles original universe destroyed,2023-06-02
is there no other miles morale spiderman’s in the multiverse,2023-06-02
i haven’t watched the first one will i be lost ,2023-06-02
yes,2023-06-02
voice actor question i absolutely recognized one of the voices at the family party i assume it was rios sister but i couldnt place who it was so far theres not really a comprehensive list of vas but did anyone recognize who that was,2023-06-02

do we think gwen’s team is going to expand in beyond,2023-06-02
i badlucked at my showing into sitting next to a couple who wouldnt  and actively point things out on the screen and repeat lines they found funny there was a moment that i probably would have clued into on my own regarding the universe that miles morales escaped to but they took that away from me,2023-06-02
"where exactly is miguel and his team at the end of the movie earth42 or miles original dimension 

also miguel slaps hard in this movie the way he cuts open the portal in that last moments was sick",2023-06-02
and that was my favourite animated movie to date what a beautiful movie to watch there is so much going on in the background when feelings hit they did such a good job,2023-06-02
think its such a smart writing decision to end with miles in earth 42 so that we and him get to see the stakes of breaking canon,2023-06-02
is the release date for the third movie confirmed,2023-06-02
"watched this one in imax with laser my first time i felt picture was way sharper than normal imax and colours also felt vivid 

i liked first one way more than this one this one took way too long to come to interesting part and revelations and right when i got excited for climax to be continued flashed on screen to collective gasp of theater

it was always gonna be difficult to top the first part of any movie with such a fresh take in any movie series cause by second part you know what to expect either premise or here presentation which was still definitely top notch

enjoyed donald glover cameo as prowler but that probably kills him being live action black spiderman dreams",2023-06-02
how bad are the flashing lights in this i’ve got epilepsy but don’t mind looking away at the more intense parts the first one was pretty intense for me but manageable,2023-06-02
my prediction for the next movie is mayday will be the kid miles dad tries to save and after a dramatic pause theyll copy that comic panel where a baby mayday saves mary jane and aunt may from falling debris,2023-06-02
"im not super familiar with the source material but it doesnt it also have a metacommentary underpinning on the importance or the nature of stories and mythos that repeat themselves across cultures like you could find stories from greek and native american traditions that are similar to each other

also plug for hadestown besides banging tunes it also contextualizes tragic stories and the importance of retelling them",2023-06-02
"hear me out my theory is that miles1610 was meant to be the prowler and miles42 was meant to be spiderman but it got reversed after the spot took the radioactive spider42 to earth1610

there was a flashback scene where spot was narrating the origin of the spider and it showed braided miles42 at back of the spider 

if it werent for spot peter parker of 1610 would still be alive stopped green goblin kingpin and prowler at the collider 

miles1610 will probably have to figure out to explain the situation and get away maybe  find the reason why earth42 has no spiderman or what caused this miles fathers death

i suspect  get a new suit in beyond the spiderverse 

well probably have team miguel and team gwen fightoff and at the end will probably be a battle vs the spot 

its funny coz in my head itll be like the avengers endgame thing where every spiderpeople will portal to earth1610 to fight the spot then add in leopardon tobey andrew and tom

anyways this is just my theory im excited for the 3rd movie and i love the two movies already",2023-06-02
was it known that this was part 1 because i didnt know and went into this movie thinking i would see a story with a beginning and ending i got very disappointed,2023-06-02
this movie brings up some interesting ideas about “fixed” events within the multiverse and whether or not they can be safely changed but i feel like miguel is wrong simply because if miles’ really is an illegitimate spiderman it doesn’t make sense to hold his canon to the same standards as other spiderpeople,2023-06-02
this’ll probably get lost but does anyone else get the vibe that gwen was similar to gwenpool the pink ends on her hair are almost identical to poole’s and the story breaking the fourth wall is the exact same way it was done in the gp comic i don’t think it’s unlikely that we could see more of those parallels in beyond,2023-06-02
"saw it last night and am so moved this is the type of movie that genuinely inspires me to be more creative and dream 

i was simply blown away by the artwork and storytelling i was seeing on the big screen hats off to everyone involved",2023-06-02
"im curious how theyll make another film everything was in place for the climax miles dad was just promoted spot was coming back into miles verse miguel had the place staked out gwen was getting a band together to rescue miles etc seems like they could have just run another 30 minutes and probably had a good conclusion 

so i just wonder how theyll be able to make another 2 hour movie especially since both of these films have done a lot in their runtimes",2023-06-02
the spot ended up looking like the greatno expectations art from the first movie,2023-06-02
"big  cliffhanger but i really cant wait to see earth 42 peter

maybe hes his worst version with great power but no responsabilities maybe hes even prowler miles nemesis",2023-06-02
10 out of 10 loved everything about it it will win the oscar,2023-06-02
my theory with universe 42 is that peter parker died even though miles wasn’t bitten in that universe i think we’re going to find out that miguel was wrong about miles not being fated to become a spiderman that peter would have died regardless,2023-06-02
ending gave me halo 2 flashbacks,2023-06-02
i did not expect them to add childish gambino as prowler…i guess he’s from the mcu,2023-06-02
this movie was so fun,2023-06-02
i loved spider cat,2023-06-02
 that was so good personally i liked it more than the first but man i wasnt expecting them to impress me more than the first with the animation but gwens universe was so pretty also this film makes you love miles even more than you might have already and hobie too what a cliffhanger,2023-06-02
“i’m not proud” ,2023-06-02
damni was aware that this was a part 1 but i wasn’t sure if it was going to be the type where it’s like a season ending with a conclusion and sequel hook or literally one movie split into two like it was so the very direct cliffhanger really hit me like a truck as i did not think 2 and a half hours passed it is what it is but i can’t blame people who are  about it,2023-06-02
after it ended i was terrified that i would have to wait another 5 years  even then 2024 can’t come soon enough,2023-06-02
my theater evacuated before the last 30 minutes so sad and blue balled rn,2023-06-02
maybe its because i spent most of my time in jersey or im  or both but that whole nj is too far from ny joke went way over my head is this like a new yorker cultural thing because theres literally a direct amtrak line that goes from penn station to princeton junction throughout the day and its like an hour long trip,2023-06-02
what if the go home machine pulled the spider out and sent it back to its universe and miles back to his,2023-06-02
"maybe im thinking too far into this but i loved the response by ganke  its a slippery 

mostly because the voice actor of miles morales  shameik moore played in the movie dope 2015 which slippery slopes were the whole perspective of that movie lol",2023-06-02
the most visually dense movie since the first one,2023-06-02
"anyone else sit near someone just laughing any time pavitr prabhakar or anyone else with that accent talked or was that just me living in racist pennsyltucky

also the sound mixing was very nolanesque i was at an imax and the beginning monolog by gwen was drowned out by the drums ive never been to an imax so i thought it was just that but apparently i wasnt the only one",2023-06-02
yeah i am furious at that ending had no idea,2023-06-02
awesome movie but it felt like it was concluding like 5 different times in the final 30 minutes making it feel drug out,2023-06-02
heres the ending track with the orchestral rockband backing its the most epic pairing of the two since chris cornells bond theme,2023-06-02
"man the last part

when he gets in the machine you clearly see earth42 written on it and i thought ooooh he is going to his spider’s universe and then the movie tricks you into believing he is in his own universe that i was like huh nevermind and then yeaaah that happened",2023-06-02
 was that ending the movie was great i wish spot got more screen time though,2023-06-02
i was hyped from watching just the beginning intro studio logos alone lol,2023-06-03
miles’ mom got different eye color at the end or am i trippin if so that’s absolutely awesome,2023-06-03
i preordered the 4k blu ray before the credits even finished rolling one of the best movies i have seen in the last 3 years,2023-06-03
i enjoyed it a lot i liked the artwork and animation more than i thought didnt expect that they were going to set up for a third one of course they are going to make it since the movie is clearly going to be a hit,2023-06-03
 that ending the person i watched it with thought miguel had a pointor at least he was operating in a grey area i do not know how they wrap up so many story threads hit all the right notes though,2023-06-03
the look miles gave his counter self at the end  like so much to take in with only moments this miles was suppose to be spiderman uncle aaron lead him down a path his father would hate the reversing of ideals that look of fear to just a mirror understanding of what this situation is and knowing “yourself” well enough that one of you is probably not walking out this room alive,2023-06-03
oooo im so mad rn,2023-06-03
"this is a small knitpick of mine but i hate the whole concept of characters not being able to stay in another dimension long term especially since we see that this is rarely a problem in the comics there we see characters regularly living in other universes and timeliness and it is fine 

but i get why sony and disney are ignoring this for the film it makes things almost too easy",2023-06-03
the background paintings and color palettes changing as gwen and her dad talk at the beginning and end of the movie is up there with the best uses of color i’ve seen in a film  that movie was good,2023-06-03
what were the songs that played during the credits,2023-06-03
"the etsy girlies are going to go crazy making posters with scenes from this movie…and i can’t wait to buy them all

honestly i need a huge print of the scene where new york is upside down and gwen and miles are just hanging in the corner",2023-06-03
liked the movie didnt like that it was only half of the movie,2023-06-03
this end credits sequence is so beautiful,2023-06-03
wonderful film ,2023-06-03
"in my theater there was a group of middle school kids on my right and an older couple on my left and both had the same reactions of awe to past iterations of spidey that they recognized

spiderman is timeless this movie was beautiful",2023-06-03
best movie ever its irresponsible how beautiful this movie was how am i supposed to enjoy other movies after watching this theyll all seem so dull slow and anchored in reality,2023-06-03
i really liked spiderman across the spiderverse i liked that it was more mature than the first as the characters grew up and that it focused on heartfelt impactful character moments and interactionsinstead of just being comedic and quippy and relying on the amazing animation also the antagonists the spot spiderman 2099 and the prowler were layered and not just onenote characters you could see their point of view to an extent,2023-06-03
miles moralless,2023-06-03
so freaking goooooodddd,2023-06-03
this should have been in 3d but otherwise is almost perfect wow loved it basically like gwens own movie,2023-06-03
wow my expectations were high like impossibly high after the first film and it exceeded them wow,2023-06-03
i wasn’t expecting a movie with no true resolution at the end and i truly don’t care and am not upset about it it was that fun of a ride,2023-06-03
i loved seeing gwens backstory the animation for it was amazing,2023-06-03
saw it thursday i enjoyed it i had to step out twice for a couple minutes the second time was near the end and i dont think i missed anything super relevant as at this point it was gearing up for the sequel,2023-06-03
the cliffhanger disappointed me so much ngl,2023-06-03
"i feel like a lot of people agree but literally when gwen got the crew together i was about to lean over to the person i saw the movie with and say how much time has gone by because this feels like its only the halfway point i cant believe how long this is

only to be ruined by the to be continued

i could have watch another 25 hours with a quick intermission",2023-06-03
from the moment i finished the first one i knew that they were going to have big shoes to fill but this absolutely exceeded my expectations the creativity just blows my mind cant believe the cliffhanger though what a gut punch,2023-06-03

"one thing im wondering is if earth 1610 miles universe is full of anomalys the spider biting the wrong person peters death direct incursions from other realities the collider spot etc why is that universe stable 

in mumbhattan a single canon event was missed and the whole reality started falling apart miles earth has gone so far off the script and everything is still intact",2023-06-03
did anyone else notice gwens dad had loss on his face at the beginning,2023-06-03

" peak but that ending man

miles and gwen character arc and screen time felt more like peter and miles in the insomniac games where it seems to be mostly equal and you will be able to play as both,2023-06-03
"one aspect i have a problem with is miguels explanation that miles peter died saving him bit peter did t die saving miles he died when goblin threw him in the collider while he was attempting to put the goober into the device and the colliders rubble fell on him 

is miguel just overexaggerating or plot hole",2023-06-03

who is the spiderman in venom’s universe do we know,2023-06-03
bro the spot is such a sickkkk villain the art style changes for him had me freaked out,2023-06-03
"something i may have missed

miguel was the first to “verse jump” when he tried to get a family no wouldn’t  responsible for the anomaly and not miles

how did the spider that bit miles end up in another universe in the first place

isn’ actually miguel’s fault

also gwen’s dad deciding on his own to step down seems to have not caused any effect in her universe as he stopped the canon event they might not have everything figured out with how they think things work in the universes in terms of how it makes a sinking hole like in india spidermans universe",2023-06-03

"spiderpunk sure theres a lot more spiderpunks than there was four years earlier but there was also as many spider poseurs spider poseurs were people that looked like spider punks but they did it for fashion and they were spider fools they would say anarchy in the marvel universe you see spider poseurs anarchy in the marvel univerise what the  is that what good is that to those of us in utah america it was a guardians thing they were from space they were alien thats what they did they were allowed to go on about anarchy in the universe you dont live your life by lyrics  
i mean thats all you ever heard from these trendy spider  like uh did you hear the new spider gwen album its  terif kids walkin around utah sayin terif with a  little english twang see what i mean points to a jacket what the  up with the english  yeah i knew a girl a spider girl who would only have  with a spider guy if he only had a  accent can you think of anything more ludicrous in your life cuz every  in new york and let me tell ya plenty of assholes in this general region that wanna do a little a this will get her  and put on some kinda   accent like hey mistress i got bit by a spider dya fancy a  then she would  knees to the sky feet on the wall which was sad it made me really sad poor spider girl had no selfrespect see to me england was nothing more than a big  american state like north dakota or canada you gotta look at me and you gotta say hey spiderbuddy why are you so mad and ill tell ya cuz for all the following that went over to the english bands from the slc those  english chaps can only say  about us americans all we were to them was a bunch of hicks well you know what im not a  hick i dont wear cowboy boots i hate the  rodeo horses smell like  to me and i never  anyone in my own bloodline by definition i am not a redneck and  i aint no  hick oh the sun never sets on the british empire well the sun never sets on my   
another thing that  me off talking about who started punk rock music was it the  pistols in england was it the ramones and the velvet underground in new york it was the ramones it was the  pistols or spidergwen who cares who started it its music i dont know who started it i dont give a  the one thing i do know is that spiderpunks did it harder we did faster and we definitely did it with more love you cant take that away from us",2023-06-03
"spider punk the fight what does it mean and where does it come from an essay  
homosapien a man he is alone in the universe  spidermen still a man he is alone in the universe but he connects how they hit each other ooh no clearer way to evaluate whether or not youre alive now complications a reason to fight somebody different difference creates dispute dispute is a reason to fight to fight is a reason to feel pain life is pain so to fight with reason is to be alive with reason final analysis to fight a reason to live problems and contradictions i am a spider anarchist i believe that there should be no rules only chaos fighting appears to be chaos and when we slam in the pit a show it is but when we fight for a reason like rednecks theres a system we fight for what we stand for chaos but fighting is a structure to establish power power is government and government is not anarchy government is war and war is fighting the circle goes like this our redneck skirmishes are cheap perversions of conventional warfare war implies extreme government because wars are fought to enforce rules or ideals even freedom but other peoples ideals forced on someone else even if it is something like freedom is still a rule not anarchy this contradiction was becoming clear to me in the fall of 85 even as early as my first party why did i love to fight i framed it but still i dont understand it it goes against my beliefs as a true anarchist but there it was competition fighting capitalism government the system thats what we did its what we always did rednecks kicked the  out of punks punks kicked the  out of mods mods kicked the  out of skinheads skinheads took out the heavy metal guys and the heavy metal guys beat the living  out of new wavers and the new wavers didnt do anything they were the new hippies so what was the point final summation none",2023-06-03
"i absolutely loved the movie but there a few things rattling in my brain that i need to get out that maybe y’all can help with 

a right before miguel orders the spider society to hunt miles spider punk is seen taking off his dimension watch while walking back into his dimension how does he gift gwen another watch if he doesn’t have his anymore

b i started rewatching into the spider verse and noticed some possible inconsistencies all from when gwen briefly went over her backstory during the doc ock forest chase first she says she saved her dad from being killed who doesn’t look anything like her dad currently wouldn’t that conflict with how her father feels towards spider woman in their universe and also conflict with her canon and second she mentions that her peter dies and she couldn’t save him but his death looks different from the one in across the spider verse 

again none of this has been enough to change my opinion of the movies but it’s just some little things that have been nagging in the back of my mind since watching across the spider verse yesterday if anyone has any input i’d love to hear it",2023-06-03
"that ending threw everyone off lol

still so  good",2023-06-03
"loved this movie im so happy they did gwen justice i wonder what its like for the casual audience tho it could get kind of happy

also something stuck out to me about the spider society miguel kept saying miles shouldnt have been spiderman etc but i think something core to the spiderman story is that none of them should have been spiderman it was a seemingly random spider that bit them and it was their choice to use that power for good to be spiderman exactly like miles and likely unlike miles42

they were supposed to be the good guys because they chose to be the good guys because with great power comes great responsibility

i think with the spider sect breaking into gwens specialized task force this point will be tested in the next movie 

also also miguel seems like he was the only one who made himself spiderman by the backstory snippets with him injecting himself with the venom but im not terribly familiar with 2099s backstory

edit rwatching the movie mjs eulogy for peter is literally saying he was just a kid who happened to get bit and he chose to be spiderman",2023-06-03
great movie but quick question how did vulture get into gwen universe,2023-06-03
"incredible movie gorgeous animations and a surprisingly poignant story with some banger soundtracks thats going to be stuck in my head for days to come theres literally something going on in every frame and a little something for everyone  dedicated fans would love picking out the small spidey easter eggs the nonfans can marvel at the sheer variety in coloring styles and animations per different spidey and so on

all in all 010 where the  is my emissary from  wheres my  toku mech",2023-06-03
one cameo i mustve missed was spiderman from the 80s cartoon luckily ill be seeing it more times and hopefully will catch it if its there,2023-06-03
what song was playing when miles and gwen were swinging on their way to the vantage point towards the beginning of the movie,2023-06-03
"when miles was tied up to the punching bag they spent a good amount of time focusing on his jordans

if they don’t reveal that prowler miles morales wears black air forces it’s gonna take me out",2023-06-03
some lady like did an exaggerated yawn in the theater at the end and yelled this movie was  and then got booed,2023-06-03
"hobie brown spiderpunk is also one of the names of prowler in the comics so that prowler became a spiderman similar to how earth 42 milesspiderman became a prowler instead

another spidermanprowler connection if any of you didnt know",2023-06-03
the movie was super good  but i just can’t shake off how don’t 100 spidermen can’t catch miles yet the prowler knocks him out immediately,2023-06-03
was there a spoderman reference i could’ve sworn there was in one of the trailers,2023-06-03
anyone know what song is playing when morales gets captured by the uncle i really liked it but can’t find it,2023-06-03
am i the only one tripping up about miles’ dad being jefferson “morales” when davis is his family name and the one he was referred to in the first film only thing i can think of is he took his wife’s name there’s no way it’s an error by the editors,2023-06-03
"there was a gagreference i didn’t understand
while all the spideys were chasing miles there was a 2d cutout sort of spiderman that swung in looking like he was punching it didn’t have any animation and i have no idea what it was referencing any ideas",2023-06-03
so is miguel and the other spider people going to fix mcu vulture being in the morbiverse,2023-06-03
anyone remember what miles says when he’s pinned down and everyone is calling him kidtrying to calm him down i loved that quote something like “nah man ima be me” probably way off lol,2023-06-03
"there was one joke i didnt get during the principal scene the parents referenced how the dad had started a business with the uncle the dad then mentioned something about what the mom used to do but eas cut off 

was there something i missed",2023-06-03
they namedropped the sinister six on the news in the earth42 universe were definitely seeing them in the next movie right,2023-06-03
for some reason i really think cosmic spiderman will make an appearance next movie considering how powerful spot has become,2023-06-03
the watercolour background slowly dripping down when gwen is talking to her dad showing how she is crying on the inside and holding it back  this movies visuals are so good absolutely loved it,2023-06-03
dont have anything but praise for this movie didnt feel like 2hours gone by it was a treat all though out,2023-06-03
the soundtrack is phenomenal,2023-06-03
so legally was that a lego world as far as i know lego has exclusivity with warner bros and now universal,2023-06-03
great movie couldn’t hear anything l in my theatre except the sound of the other patrons audio mixing was terrible i don’t care if there’s special instructions for theatres that’s still making viewers gamble on how good their experience will be,2023-06-03
all stations stop what youre doing and stop spiderman,2023-06-03
i do find it hard to accept that pretty much every other spiderman has accepted the canon that certain things happen and certain people in their lives will die or maybe they tossed back the spidermen who dont accept it and actively prevent them from accessing their universes collider to find an interloper anamoly that can change their canon i cant imagine its compartmentalized as the spideys are all given free reign in earth 2099 but pavitr seemed to not know when he said he could save both,2023-06-03
unsure if it was just the theater or a stylistic choice but i found the movie distractingly blurry not talking about background elements but things that felt like they should have been in focus,2023-06-03
think well get schreiber kingpin in the next movie,2023-06-03
that was legitimately amazing,2023-06-03
its cool,2023-06-03
would you guys recommend it to kids under 7,2023-06-03
does anyone know why it looked like peter b was in miguels family universe that collapsed thats the only detail that i wasnt able to catch but just wondering if they explained that at some point,2023-06-03
i liked the tronesque music during the chase scenes that  got my heart racing,2023-06-03
need more spider noir,2023-06-03
does anyone know what reggaeton song that is playing when miles gets to his dad’s rooftop party like the hallway scene of him changing clothes,2023-06-03
wow the animation was insane the story line just as good honestly 2 hours or so flew by march 2024 cannot come soon enough,2023-06-03
"first of all outstanding 

but i do have a question when gwens dad retires does that prove that miguels theory of dimensional stability was wrong or was her dimension already safe because she lost her dimensions peter",2023-06-03
can anyone explain what miguel meant when he said he is the original anomaly,2023-06-03
does anyone know what happened to may in gwen’s universe,2023-06-03
i might have missed something but why did they spend the first half of the movie trying to stop spot if him killing miles’ dad is a canon event wouldn’t stopping him prior to the canon event be the opposite of what their mission is,2023-06-03
"which has more endings

this or return of the king",2023-06-03
these movies have some of the best animation and creative art style choices ive ever seen character progressions were great with spot and spider punk i didnt really like either of them at first but they grew on me i was surprised when it ended because it didnt feel like 2hr 20min,2023-06-03
"i believe there was a reference to neversoft rip as there was a copy of top skater in miles dorm i believe though looks like they used the cover of 12 as reference


they devd the first spiderman game on ps1 dont think i saw anything about techno pop they did the wickedly awesome genesis spiderman game


also when it was revealed he was in the wrong universe i thought oh thats she didnt reboot the machine she knew he was going somewhere else and semi sticks with miguels plan


but then there she is at the end i dunno",2023-06-03
"why you gotta hurt me in the meow meow  cries in water color

in all seriousness though great movie i dont usually watch a lotta emotional stuff and i didnt expect this one to be this emotional either but everything hit right in the spot

i slept on it for a whole day and can still feel the emotions from it

i especially related to miles while he struggled with not having anyone similar to share experiences with and then learning that there is a whole society of people like you that includes the girl you love as well and they just didnt invite you to it

and then my heart broke all over again when miles didnt realise what was going on and he thought they were finally letting him in instead of trying to punish  him for just existing 

also its really funny to me that miles knew he had a long fight ahead of him and he would be fighting it alone with very slim chances of the win but he still told miguel imma do it my way like i know the doom is coming but ill go out in style

i knew this was part 1 going into it and we got almost 3 hours of it but  if i cant wait to see the next installment march come fast  it",2023-06-03
i just need need to know when the sequel is coming out…i’m ready for it,2023-06-03

can anybody explain to me how miles spider sense didn’t kick in when his prowler variant sneak attacked him ,2023-06-03
when did they changed miles’ dads last name,2023-06-03
the only negative about this movie is how they did my fav spiderman ben reilly,2023-06-03
why no christopher daniel barnes,2023-06-03
what an incredible movie the character development the visual effects and the last 20 minutes had me in awe easily one of my favorite animated movies of all time bring on part 2,2023-06-04
did anyone notice that the ending of into spiderverse when gwen shows up miles is wearing a different shirt than in across the spiderverse,2023-06-04
sorry if i’m reading into something that may not be there  but was gwen’s peter in her dimension implied to be   i feel he may of represented that,2023-06-04
does anyone know the song used at the start of scene where all the spider people start chasing miles i couldn’t find it in the soundtrack and i do not believe it’s in the score because it had some lyrics in it it just had such good base thanks in advance,2023-06-04
the first movie made gwen’s relationship with peter seem different it was shown as a dead grown up peter rather than a teenage lizard right,2023-06-04
super confused with the ending why’s miles dad dead in earth 42 if there’s no spiderman nor spider is it supposed to be canon that miles is the prowler in every other universe was he supposed to be the prowler in his “original” universe,2023-06-04
if spot’s origin is the collider from the first movie what was he doing between then and attempting his first robbery months later,2023-06-04
can someone explain to me about gwen’s hair it was shaved when we had a flashback to the time she lost her peter however those events occurred prior to the first movie,2023-06-04
my theatre erupted twice when donald glover appeared and for some reason when gwen and miles shoulders touched lol,2023-06-04
the visuals were stunning loved the deeper story although i wish itd been clearer this was a  part i with a cliffhanger,2023-06-04
anyone know the name of the song after miles argument with his parents,2023-06-04
i’m curious do people think miles and gwen will get together in the third movie,2023-06-04
"if i had a nickel for every movie about a bugthemed superhero i’d seen in the last week i’d have two nickels the other was shin kamen rider

this film was an absolute spiderfeast i guess i knew this movie was supposed to directly lead into the next one but still when the ending hit i shouted “oh come on”",2023-06-04
absolutely loved it so beautiful cannot believe animation looks this good i do think the multiverse rules are unnecessarily convoluted and the beginning and end were both too long imo but everything else works miles and gwen were awesome,2023-06-04
donald glover,2023-06-04
so it was probably intentional but miguel said miles is an anomaly since he should have never been bit but if thats the case why should his life be effected by the web of the spiderverse also as others probably noticed the spidermen who have gotten happier endings have had close ties to miles coincidenc i think not,2023-06-04
the spot is the jerry anderson of the spiderverse,2023-06-04
if miles as spiderman isnt supposed to be in the same universe as a peter parker spiderman hes an anomaly how is ps4 spiderman there maybe i missed something in the explanation there fantastic movie though,2023-06-04
anyone else notice that miles jordan’s changed from his og ones to the newly released ones saw it when he was hanging from the punching bag,2023-06-04
i knew this was a two parter but damnit i didnt think it would end that way,2023-06-04
when the film flashbacked to show the universe that miguel cause to be destroyed and peter parker being included i thought the movie was implying that miguel ruined peter b parkers world leaving him a homeless widow and thats why peter is carrying around mayday through danger and why miguel puts up with his  out of guilt thankfully that wasnt the case and our mans just irresponsible,2023-06-04
did spot visit the venom universe i think that lady might have been the convenience shop owner but i’m not too sure,2023-06-04
of course gwen formerly in a punk band gets along with hobie,2023-06-04
hobie listens to arachnopunk,2023-06-04
anyone know what song or score was playing when spider man 2099 was shown,2023-06-04
i will bet on prowler morales turning good in the next movie,2023-06-04
my takeaway from this movie is that we need more thicc spiderladies the fact that we got not 1 but 2 of them is truly cultured,2023-06-04
i couldnt hear because of my noisy theater but can anyone tell me what the vulture said when he saw the curry,2023-06-04
"sometimes the universe stuff trips me up like movie miles is in the 1610 universe but the 1610 universe is its own thing in the comicultimate universe that’s pretty different from this one the main similarity being that it has a miles spider man but still it would make sense to make the movies their own universe like 1611 especially since they have so many references to the comics

then another thing is take insomniac spider man are we suppose to believe that he has a relationship with the multiverse as well so when i’m playing the games i should be thinking that this guy will eventually go to the spider verse 

it was the same problem when i read the original spider verse comic it kinda hurts some of the universes if you think about it too much i remember a lot of people getting mad that spoilers 1970s tv show spiderman suddenly got brutally killed and that was now his canon and how his story ends no thanks

i guess at the end of the day it’s just fansme  overthinking it and you should consider the movies in a vacuum to not let it destroy other interpretations of the character",2023-06-04
"man this movie is good

the dialogues not like it has been done 100 times by other media but it feels so grounded how",2023-06-04
it’s real good goofy in parts good spiderman goofy serious in others i went with kids and they were transfixed the entire time funny cute solid 910 go see it,2023-06-04
absolutely loved it not sure if it’s better than into the spiderverse yet but  both movies are absolute bangers,2023-06-04

we don’t have to follow a set path in life we can shake the table",2023-06-04

havent seen any talk of it yet so thought id bring it up the unmasked emo ben riley and masked edgelord ben riley are separate characters right the unmasked bens face looked a lot like the character designs in the mtv spiderman which would have been a weirdly appreciated reference but also to give that version of spidey an epilogue of sorts by revealing that he finds out hes a clone some time after the run of his show ended is pretty wild,2023-06-05
i need someone to agree with me if there was a reference to the ultimate spiderman games with the comic book transitions,2023-06-05
im glad i speak spanish during all the scenes with miles mom and family,2023-06-05
the movie doesnt make sense if miles shouldnt be spiderman then all nonpeter parker shouldnt be as well if what happened in doctor strange like incursion then 42 or 46 i forgot the number would be gone soon enough in the next movie the whole event is a paradox gwen spiderman universe and the indian spiderman universe are going to disappear too cause of the canon event stuff,2023-06-05
spot was the highlight of the movie for me i really wanted to see so much more of him,2023-06-05

"it’s been a few days since i watched this and even the first time watch wears off i gotta say this probably has the best animation in any film i’ve seen ever every shot is wallpaper worthy and i actually had people gasping in the audience i was with when certain sequences happened

what do people think about the blatant change to gwens backstory  the style of gwens peter changed from itsv to atsv and the scene in which he is killed changed as well this is really specific and changed literally nothing about the movies i personally like the change as it makes it more personal to gwen let me know what you think,2023-06-10
loved it although it felt strange to cliffhanger so hard when the narrative is saying they only have two days left and it wont release for nearly a year or strike delayed to more return of the jedi didnt take place the next starweek,2023-06-11
sheesh the audio was unbearably bad great animation and story but a real joke by sony to release this as is,2023-06-11
when in the timeline did miguel go to the universe with the dead version of himself we see peter b parker there when the world falls apart so does that mean all that happened in the past year and 12 between the movies or somehow happened before the 1st movie,2023-06-11
did anyone else feel like parts of the movie were similar to watch dogs legion,2023-06-11
what happened to gwen’s dimension after she left and joined the spider society wouldn’t that earth be left without a spiderperson,2023-06-11
"i just saw this film this morning and it was as gorgeous as into the spider verse and definitely more loredriven

although something about the lore and miguels motivations bug me and i hope the community can help answer that

miguel said miles wasnt supposed to be bitten by a spider and because he was there was some other universe we later find out its earth 42 where theres no spiderman  
but isnt that true for miles universe as well if everything had gone to plan miles lives in earth 1610 so if everything had gone to plan earth 42 would have had a spiderman but not earth 1610 why isnt this a problem why are the people on earth 42 more important than those on earth 1610 that miles brings this up while berating miles i know this is not his real motivation his real motivation being maintaining the status quo but its just a thought that came to mind",2023-06-11
maybe ive missed it somewhere but i havent seen anyone mention the fact that insomniac miles can be seen walking with insomniac peter in the scene where gween says welcome to spider society so what do we think about that especially since when miguel gave the order for the society to chase miles he said miles morales as if he was the only miles there really hope miles gets to meet other versions of himself that are also spiderman in beyond,2023-06-11
what does miguel say to miles when they first meet right after miles says que tal tio which i think means whats up uncle,2023-06-11
"miles being betrayed by the spiderpeople he admired most multiple times was sad

but this does mean when he pulls an avatar aang and saves the spiderverse on his own as the spot is making a multidimensional black hole prowlermiles is trying to pull a miguel and  our miles so that he can take his place with a dad thats alive and miguel is trying to send our miles into an interdimensional prison all that much cooler all of that is speculation and probably wont happen im just happy to see our miles be the strongest spiderman

he is the ultimate spiderman",2023-06-11
absolutely beautiful movie both stylistically and thematically its easy to see why it took them so long to make this i was unaware going in that it would be split into 2 movies though so that surprised me a bit,2023-06-11
"loved the movie i got lost in the middle section and could use some help questions

1 what did miles do to miguel to escape from being pinned against the train
2 miles snuck into gwens portal and eventually ended up at spidey hq as a result why were people acting like this was their plan all along to keep miles at hq",2023-06-12

if glitching is now an official thing why doesn’t doctor strange glitch in mom when he goes to different universes kinda makes sense that america doesn’t glitch because of her powers but doctor strange should right,2023-06-12
"so crazy theory but hear me out…

miguel is the one who killed uncle aaron i mean we never actually see kingpin pull the trigger this being after they left no ambiguity over him killing peter parker with miles not originally being part of the spiderman canon killing uncle aaron could have been miguel’s way of course correcting that universe before it could unravel due to miles breaking its canon and that world’s spiderman dying

miles being an anomaly who did break his universe by diverging from canon isn’t enough of a reason for miguel to have kept him away especially since studying miles could have lead to them understanding how to break canon and survive but if miguel is the reason that world’s canon was “patched” the guilt he feels toward miles would be a great reason he never brought him in we know he’s not above morally grey actions— allowing people to die for the sake of canon one death to save billions his overwhelming anger toward miles makes so much more sense if he’s using it to mask his guilt to convince himself that he is the good guy and miles by his very existence as an anomaly is the antagonist 

but that’s just a theory",2023-06-12
"genuine plot question

if disrupting the canon ends the universe and taking that earth42s was disrupted by peter parker never being bitten by his spider since the spider fled to earth1610 and earth1610s too since its peter parker died saving miles something that should have never happened how the  are both earths still there 

if miles was never meant to be shouldnt both worlds have ended already or was miguel perhaps wrong and miles was meant to be afterall",2023-06-14
hey so was the drawn vulture kind of a sam raimis spiderman 4 concept art cameo,2023-06-16
good movie the spectacle of the visuals are definitely the biggest draw feels like it carries the plot sometimes and i wish it felt a bit less like a part 1 infinity war still did that best,2023-06-18
what did miles say to miguel right before jake johnson peter says something along the lines of “he really does have a plan”,2023-06-18
spiderman theory you can only disrupt the canon of other verses meaning u can’t disrupt your own,2023-06-19
"i made a post about this earlier but somebody warned me about spoiling the movie so i would just drop my post here

across the spider verse missing character arc potential

across the spider verse was just released in my country and upon watching it and even though this thing has been praised to the heavens i can’t help but feel like the character arc of spider gwen was kinda stunted by the plot i get that the character is supposed to yearn for affection due to loneliness and yet simultaneously fears it due to her extreme guilt over her killing of her best friend so she spends the entirety of the movie running away from her father because she believes that she cannot be redeemed in the eyes of others that is until she realizes that her father understands her feelings and that makes her finally understand that she doesn’t have to suffer from fear of affection and guilt because there’s still people that love her regardless and it ties in with the movie’s theme of whether spiderman needs to suffer or not i get how each part of these elements are shown and explored in the film but for me something just feel… missing about this plot point i feel like this character arc could have been better than it is if we were shown more of her backstory with peter stuffs like how gwen suffered from loneliness but finally finds the affection she needs in peter peter became obsessed with becoming “unique” like her and finally her internal dialogue about how she feels guilty for killing peter i’m not just talking about how she literally kills him here but also how she was the reason for peter decided to turn into the lizard in the first place this way her guilt and pain would seem even more excruciating than it is shown in the actual film and maybe could add more depth to the arc and make it more compelling i’m not saying the arc is bad in fact i think it is really effective but i really think it could be way way better i don’t know maybe i’ve just been reading too much berserk lately so now my brain is just conditioned into being obsessed with extreme internal drama lol what do you guys think",2023-06-28
i wonder how gwen’s dad not going for captain anymore is going to affect the canon events and what their going to do with gwenmile’s dad theyre pretty clear that spiderman can’t do both without breaking canon mumbatan spiderman trying to save his girlfriend and the captain would have led to the captain dying so i wonder if miles will try to do both and lose both of them or have to choose,2023-06-29
i enjoyed how he wasn’t supposed to be in that universe but was able to out run the whole spider man squad ,2023-07-09

amazing movie but a question i have so miguel broke canon or whatever by slipping into his alts life and it seemed like that somehow resulted in that dimension being seemingly deleted so is that what is happening to pavitrs universe also if thats what happens why does gwen ask miguel if he even knows what would happen if miles broke canon it seems like he does know and i assume they all know is miles case gonna be different because  be fighting spot somehow,2023-08-14
i can not believe they used the word canon in the movie talk about breaking the 4th wall with bad writing,2023-08-14
i really like the art but cant consider it a great story  after 2 and a half hours story telling there is no climax in the movie,2023-08-15
i liked the first movie much better this one felt kinda like dunking on the first movie while trying to twist it into a two part movie was it good heck yeah but it doesnt hold a candle to the first movie,2023-08-19
im not sure if its been said anywhere but i think when theyre playing back the crime scene and theyre both saying shoot over and over again its a reference to that scene in the wire,2023-08-22
i have a question when gwen introduces miles to miguel there is another spider man in the back it looks like miguel is building him any idea of who that is,2023-08-22
am i the only one that wished the movie was about peter parker and not miles i mean we already had one with miles can we not close the chapter or put a pause on a story about him,2023-08-24
when all the spideys point at each other lol,2023-08-26
heres a disturbing thought  just how many canon events did gwen herself end up enforcing how many spiders did she stop from saving their police captains  possibly by force if she stopped even one that effectively makes her an indirect cosmic assassin this would be a dark contrast to her failed attempt at enforcing pavitrs which was only thwarted by miless presence and sheer determination to do the right thing,2023-09-04
so is this movie about miles or gwen,2023-09-14
i this might be the most visually arresting film i have ever seen i loved the first one but it didnt seem the online film people were super high on this so i didnt bother seeing it in theaters and did the amazon rental on a whim this is just insanely good,2023-09-22
so wheres the tva in all this,2023-09-22
so  i am not the only one  thinking  that  cannon events wont destroy the worlds but migules teleportation devices and them floping around with their webs out does  right  ,2023-10-02
to much happening imo couldnt really focus good movies tho 7510,2023-10-29
i bet spot was supposed to be spiderman in his universe thats why he is so mad at miles,2023-11-07
why is this so amazing one of the best movies ive ever watched certainly watched in a long time it was soo good and they took full advantage of the animated style im just baffled,2023-11-14
can’t wait 4 this,2023-11-15
its crazy how the multiverse was depicted the same way as in loki  how does miguels role not overlap with he who remains though,2023-11-17
can someone tell me why the spiderman with the baby wife had a picture face down and when arrived back she secretly put it back up…,2023-12-03
watched the movie today another success from the spiderverse at first i thought the animation was even more dazzling and over the top compared to the first movie such that it was a sensory overload at first but once you get into it it works very well the pace and tension picks up incredibly in the middle and never lets go it was on the edge of your seat stuff until the end when you see all the different spider peoplethings looking at you peter parkedcar it’s quite absurd but totally fun and brings some levity to a story that has deeply serious themes and a sinister ending with the spot becoming all powerful and the miles morales prowler turning the heat up on miles the spiderman another amazing film and looking forward to the next one,2023-12-10
"i think it had a lot of things going for it inevitably rendering technology gets better but the cel shading feels more subtle and less overdone  lots of spoilers obviously heads up 

i feel like the drama scenes were effective though i dont think its as progressive as id want it to be  im referring to drama progression and not social commentary  a good dramatic progression is star wars a new hope 

luke wants to attend the jedi academy but his aunt and uncle have essentially prevented him from doing so  so the ability to detect plans in the r2d2 droid is what creates dramatic tension because it involves a bigger and more dangerous world

but back to spider verse part 2 i think the logistical difficulty is that while there was interdimensional tv shows and books and maybe a few movies spiderverse 1 transformed it into a marketable gimmick

everyones not only trying to create their mcu but tie it with other franchises that they have license to and so i do think its a case of something working and working too well 

but no i dont get less ramblyi believe ii feels more thoughtfully put together then part one  but less entertaining

and so i do feel like part ii feels like its trying to splinter the plot just so that viewers cant guess it

the bracelet allows you to travel to your timeline but it can only work if the character is canon and not an accidental spider verse lab anomaly   im spitballing i didnt read wikipedia did watch the film

and so im not fond of this technique because it makes it easy for characters to not have to grow  im thinking about monsters inc but instead of an overarching plot is just the doorreturn scene if somethings wrong just go into another door

but also you have an audience of eight year olds so you know just stealing the doctor who playbook would shock pause 

i think the gwen stacy scenes with her dad work better than the miles morales scenes with mom someone who cares more about duty than domestic life would plausibly not handle the reveal than someone who is shown to be well tempered in the earlier scenes

im pretty meh on miles being able to outrun and out swing the entire city of the spiderman to me it makes the stakes feel smaller than they are

what i really dislike is peter b parker helping miguel the spider army i feel like that really undoes the character development he had in the last film my analogy would be if there were a sequel to indiana jones and the last crusade with sean connerys character still alive but going back to artifact obsession and calling his son junior all the time

and maybe nitpick to have is that filmmakers have is trying to make dont call me a kid into the dont call me junior of spiderman movies

also i think the ending should have just been morales in the wrong timeline with no visible way to get out  

i think the logical point that is established plot wise is that gwen think shes knocking a spider man villain what she thinks is a safe timeline but rather what seems to be his own stomping grounds 

i think the reveal with the evil parallel universe miles would probably cause quite a reaction for people under 20 but cant help but think of the 60s show the prisoner or think of a bajillion flash stories that involve alternate heroes turned evil

but i actually am curious about three because im trying to think of how theyre gonna resolve the spot  i feel like hes been both a sympathetic incrediboy archetype in the film and a force of nature but id like to see him as someone who is very much a villain and not this collider 20 nerfed if you will

ps i like the movie",2023-12-14
"finally got around to watching this and honestly i was pretty disappointed right off the bat the pacing was terrible it’s not until halfway through over and hour into the film that the multiverse aspect of the story even appears the whole first hour of the film is just miles and his parents bickering the second half was better but not by much there just wasn’t much substance to this story and it seems like they stretched one film’s story into two 

i also don’t really dig the message of the film miles is willing to risk literally every life in the universe just to save his dad i get it’s a hard choice but the fact that he doesn’t even seem to consider the consequences makes him come off as incredibly selfish and basically the exact opposite of how a spiderman or any hero would act 

i also thought the whole chase sequence with miles running away from the other spidermen was kind of dumb i know it’s a comic book film but it really strained my suspension of disbelief when literally hundreds of spidermen couldn’t catch one 15 year old spiderman 

overall the film just felt kind of hollow existing mostly to push cameos and easter eggs and what little substance is there is disappointing",2024-01-05

i’m calling it now the miguel we meet killed the alternate version of himself to try to take over his life and have his daughter back and lied about finding a universe where his alt was already dead that is what caused that world to collapse and he can’t accept it when miles stopped the cannon event and the black whole arrived it looked different to miguel’s memories   maybe that really was spot’s influence like miles says it is and he can save anyone and make his own story,2023-06-06

i don’t think miguel is a spider man  a few things were he’s the only spider man that doesn’t shoot webs he’s the only one that isn’t funny at all he’s the only one that isn’t all for good and i think the biggest one is miles made a comment about spiders not having claws  my prediction is he was a villain in his universe and his family died so he went over to a different universe call back to kingpin and killed miguel of that universe who was spider man in his own universe,2023-06-04
that line by gwen was my least favorite part of the movie which i otherwise thought was amazing just felt too on the nose and didn’t even really make sense makes it seem like a good vs evil battle when really all of the spiderpeople are good just different versions of it miguel is lawful good miles is somewhere between neutral and chaotic and the audience is aware of all of this cut gwen’s line and the scene works just as well,2023-06-03
i was also a bit confused was aaron not miles canon event or are there just multiple,2023-06-10
hes going to become the final villain in the next movie i think,2023-06-04
yeah an angry depressed hispanic i know im one of them,2023-06-24
omfg lmaoo i remember haha ithought miles died,2023-06-02
"that entire scene scared me so much felt like watching the prelude to someone about to get tortured terrifying

how does this loving uncle in a children’s movie manage to keep legitimately scaring the  out of me in two films",2023-06-08
i said to myself “invincible be like” imagining if that was actually the scenario,2023-06-05
dood same i gasped out loud at that part,2023-06-03
immediately thought of the stylized borderlands covers with the bandits shooting their heads with finger guns,2023-06-08
bro that was wild a kid in my theater immediately started crying and it felt like the air got  out of the room,2023-06-14
which scene are you talking about is it where prowler knocks miles out,2023-06-07
,2023-06-05
same,2023-06-06
i am sorry did you say childrens film  because i think thats gonna trigger more people than you think xd,2023-09-03
"wait so their job is to jump between dimensions and protect the multiverse…

the tools they use to do that are the wristbands…

he took equipment away from miguel’s lab and made his own free from miguel’s oversight…

did… did he seize the means of production",2023-06-02
the anarchist spiderman cookbook,2023-06-02
yep he dropped his when he quit so he had to have built the one he made for gwen himself,2023-06-04
he’s like rocket,2023-06-02
did he steal that much he must have made 2 1 for him and 1 to drop off for gwen didnt realize he nabbed that many items during the walk,2023-06-03
when the box was handed over to gwen’s dad and he handed it to her thought it was a trick from spot but then i saw the uk flag and realized all is well,2023-06-04
my   i didnt notice that thats so awesome,2023-06-06
"so many connections to so much stuff to both earlier in this movie and the first one

spot being the bagel guy

prowlermiles hanging spidermiles up like he did to peter in the first one

prowlermiles saying im miles morales in the same tone as the college lady at the start

the universe 42 actually being on the display when miles escapes ruining a bit of the twist for people who notice",2023-06-27
i feel like he might be the one to be revealed as the bad guy in the next movie as in earth 616 hobbie brown is the og prowler,2023-06-15
"yeah thats what i picked up on clearly in my second viewing  hobie isnt just a cool aloof dude  hes constantly pushing miles toward opposition stealing  working against the spider society  you just dont notice it until the end because hes cooler without his mask on  


i was this cool the whole time

hobie

oh  sorry mate",2023-06-27
palms was such a hype moment,2023-08-25
i live in india so this scene was particularly appreciated in my theatre,2023-06-04
the traffic line was hilarious considering both nyc and mumbai are known for their clogged roads,2023-06-04
that was brilliant writing that sequence was one of my favorites but it’s so hard to really pick one because it was all so good and flowed so well,2023-06-03
man i thought thats what he said but it was such a quiet line i couldnt tell for sure and no one else laughed so i thought id misheard,2023-06-03
banger line but were in britain so idk how many of my audience appreciated it,2023-06-02
the whole mumbattan sequence was so good the dialogue was funny as  the cityscape and little details were gorgeous,2023-06-26
i wasnt expecting that at all i was dying,2023-06-10
pointing with his middle fingers too,2023-06-19
haha i died at that one haha,2023-10-10
just reminds you of how many spiderman villains they showed us in homecoming and then never did anything with off the top of my head they also showed shocker and scorpion,2023-06-02
i didnt expect any of the live action bits i thought it would only be different animation styles but they incorporated live action as well,2023-06-02
it’s such a dope cameo considering that ep in community with gloved wearing the spiderman suit is part of the inspiration for miles as a character,2023-06-03
i thought maybe it would be a voice cameo since it was announced he would have a part somewhere in this movie live action was crazy,2023-06-02
so is the implication here is that he was in the wrong universe mcu and he was captured to be transported to his sony universe for their rumored miles morales solo film,2023-06-03
i would pay a lot to see glover as prowler in a full movie  make the next tom holland one or if they ever do another garfield,2023-06-03
donald glover as prowler was great foreshadowing to miles being the prowler,2023-06-03
donald glover had a cameo as a criminal that tom holland spiderman sticks to his car and interrogates he even gives him advice on doing a better job then ends up as prowler in a other universe maybe that spiderman averted his character from becoming prowler or guaranteed it because homie was looking for alien tech,2023-06-19
oh my  i didnt realize that thats so cute,2023-06-02
twhip might be the best sight gag in the entire movie ill fight anyone who says otherwise,2023-06-03
also when the film first starts theres a crunch action word or a word along those lines anyway in the bottom righthand corner or the screen as if the sound is coming from the audience brilliant,2023-06-05
and then shortly after when cowboy spiderman shot his gun it was “thwang”,2023-06-06
my gf thought that was the best part of the movie and honestly i agree,2023-06-08
this actually destroyed me in theaters,2023-06-14
i was at the movie with my mum and she let out an audible oh my  when spiderrex showed up,2023-06-27
the spots art style reminds me of the henchmen from the video game toonstruck feedback goggles and lugnut,2023-06-02
i noticed it on a miguel too maybe to show how villainous and transparent they are,2023-06-02
i saw it as he wasnt finished yet so still had sketch lines,2023-06-07
the first thing that i noticed with him and that i super really liked was how you can see the structural sketch lines through him,2023-07-01
was,2023-06-04
when the balloon dog got cut open and it was filled with smaller balloon dogs  oh neat,2023-06-02
i also liked how miles’ dad did the same walking down the stairs gag as miles did when he tried to do a leap of faith,2023-06-04
post malone is a multiversal constant,2023-06-02
miles’ roommate was also playing the video game,2023-06-04
"not just the spot but the entire ending scene with uncle aaron legit felt like a torture  room or something i know they wouldn’t do that and aaron probably wouldn’t ever consider torturing even an alternate version of his nephew… but  that entire scene gave me chills

especially when he started turning up the chill music over miles’ begging that man has for sure tortured people

that scene really scared me",2023-06-08
" its  insane how dark this movie feels for a pg movie

yeah because this movie actually earns its pg rating instead of getting hit with one over a  or  joke",2023-06-04
its the exact same one too,2023-06-03
that banksy callback was a miss for me the helicopter just landed in the webs and people on the ground were nearly crushed by it the fact that someone would just comment that its probably a banksy instead of just running for their lives was ridiculous,2023-06-12
that one doesnt make as much sense given all the ongoing actions and explosions,2023-06-08
yeah for a second but they really showed it twice which was surprising,2023-06-05
when the spot started getting really powerful i got big mr bloom from dc vibes from him just the way he moved,2023-06-15
wonder if we’ll see insomniac miles lol,2023-06-16
the animation for apocalyptic spot is fantastic now just hope they can match the expectation of his powers,2023-06-19
where was he,2023-06-05
thrice even the normal one walking around in the background a female version in another shot and then genki playing the upcoming game somehow,2023-06-27
pretty sure i quantum fractured  now exist in multiple timelines simultaneously  got out of my screening six hours ago  im still buzzing,2023-06-02
there were parts i genuinely was sitting with my chin in my hands in awe of what i was seeing,2023-06-04
deadass next viewing im definitely taking shrooms,2023-06-02
genuinely i think i have spiderwithdrawal now what an experience,2023-06-04
especially during the last segment when he went to earth 42,2023-06-03
same  i needed a minute before i drove home afterwards in broad daylight mind you,2023-06-05
especially during that last half hour just got back from the theatre man this movie looks incredible on the big screen,2023-06-07
sammmeee i could have sworn i astral projected and then died then came back to life at the cliffhanger,2023-06-06
i went to india and found myself,2023-07-18
same brother,2023-06-04
when peni showed up briefly i thought that was all we would get from the original squad but that shot of everyone gathered at the end goosebumps,2023-06-02
i was so unbelievably happy to see them both at the end this movie was sorely missing spiderman noir in particular and i really cant wait to see him get a hopefully expanded role in the sequel,2023-06-02
so hyped for nicolas cages return,2023-06-02
i love that nic cage said he wouldn’t be voicing noir in the movie but left it at that gotta be returning for btsv,2023-06-03
i just want to see the sub plot with noir and his rubric cube be completed,2023-06-02
i was waiting for a mulaney intervention reference in the spidey hq,2023-06-02
when i saw peni turn up it was all i could do to not beg for more peni shes adorable and i loved her in into the spiderverse sad we didnt get much of her but hoping to see more of her in beyond since she was in that final group shot,2023-06-06
the spot is noirs cousin,2023-06-03
i freaked out when i saw spiderham,2023-06-04
i was so  happy spider noir is back  yeah good guy spiders assemble,2023-08-08
welcome to gboard clipboard any text you copy will be saved herewelcome to gboard clipboard any text you copy will be saved here,2023-07-06
did anyone else find it real difficult to understand him not the accent but more is voice levels were very low,2023-06-02
"british spiderman from the ends of camden town

was def not on the bingo card

but my  it workedd

daniel kaluuya take a bow ",2023-06-02
"i thought he was okay 

then i saw how he helped miles on how to escape using his electricity and the full palm and made me like him

and then when miguel sends him away and he said that he quit

thats when i loved him

i knew he would be back for the story",2023-06-02
coolest dude in every room,2023-06-02
"i laughed out loud at whats that at the spot portal thing  its a metaphor for capitalism

his antiauthoritycapitalism hintofnihilism schtick was so brilliant",2023-06-06
my theater had zero reactions towards spider punk while my friends and i were practically his only fans there laughing at every time he spoke instead the theater was packed with young indianamericans who loved and freaked out at the mumbai scene and made that entire segment for me,2023-06-03
"i have become such a spiderpunk fan after this lol

he really did stick it to the man",2023-06-03
i was so ready to hate him when he seemed like he would be the romantic false lead in the end i wanted to watch an entire spiderpunk movie,2023-06-04
“i officially quit”,2023-06-03
the little bit of her putting her hair up before walking around the edge of the building was a nice  bit too,2023-06-02
i was grinning ear to ear every time miles and gwen had their little moments the amount of chemistry these two fictional animated characters have just oozes off the screen,2023-06-02
going upside down worked wonders during miles leap of faith in the first movie and it sure as  worked here wallpaper material,2023-06-02
its really hard to genuinely create a teen love scenario but they pulled it off 100 relatable,2023-06-02
"it was just stunning 

there was so much of the view to take in with them along with pitch perfect character writing 

didn’t want it to end",2023-06-02
weirdly considering how the shot is framed and the fact that film is animated that somehow set off my vertigo  which never happens in films like it was beautifully animated but gave me a sensation that i was about to fall,2023-06-02
a lot of times i’m too invested in the story and action of a movie the first time around to truly see how stunning some shots are until i go back and watch it but this is honestly one of the first times i sat there in the moment and went holy ,2023-06-02
it was gorgeous,2023-06-02
loved the movie slowing down and having two characters just talk to each other seeing mj and peter happy together is so nice,2023-06-02
saw this in imax  it was incredible  miles and gwen were tiny specs against this massive backdrop,2023-06-03
the whole world is upside down but at least we have each other,2023-06-02
that imagery evoked a reflection of a city in a lake at sunrisesunset which was gorgeous,2023-06-02
"its one of my favorite scenes as well
",2023-06-03
i told my husband i need that as a poster immediately  i don’t know where is put it tho,2023-06-03
i liked that we saw both angles with the city right side up and them upsidedown and then flipped,2023-06-04
i kinda wish instead of falling into his shoulder she kinda swung into it to fit the physics,2023-06-04
whole scene is pretty much one big opportunity for a framed painting andor a desktop wallpaperscreensaver just absolutely gorgeous film from a visual standpoint,2023-06-04
the soundtrack overall but especially during that scene was so awesome,2023-06-04
the transition of when she walked off the ledge to upside down was so smooth too,2023-06-07
you know this implied that their  are what made them stick onto the building upside down,2023-06-04
what a great reference to the tobey maguirekirsten dunst scene,2023-06-17
i was telling my friend the same thing i want a poster of this now,2023-06-13
i had weird sense of vertigo seeing the nyc skyline top of frame while the characters were normal,2023-06-26
planning to print that one in my room spectacular view both of them sitting in that tower clock while the city buildings are upside down,2023-08-15
idk if it was me but i feel like alt miles had a slightly stronger accent which kinda made sense because his dad wasn’t around so it’s more spanish with his mom,2023-06-03
what about exaggerated swagger,2023-06-02
bruh his braids was too clean,2023-06-02
idk how they were able to do this but somewhere in my gut i just knew it was jharrel jerome as that miles and when i looked it up it was indeed him that means two moonlight actors jharrel jerome and mahershala ali share a scene together in this film,2023-06-02
ai we’re they black i thought they were blue,2023-06-02
not gonna lie he scared the  out of me i forgot it he was animated and not real,2023-06-03
were those legit black air force ones im trying to figure out what shoes those were any idea,2023-06-02
who ja morant thinks he is,2023-06-05
a lot of people missed your cultural reference,2023-06-03
thought they were purple tbh,2023-06-02
i think he’s a good guyresistance fighter in a world with no spiderman the sinister six have taken over the way 42 uncle aaron says “bad guy” in reaction to miles saying it i dunno feels like it’s a big red herring,2023-06-18
he definitely had the exaggerated swagger of a black teen  ign ,2023-06-04
bully morales,2023-06-10
tims and yankee fitted energy,2023-06-03
black aj1s but yes excellent touch,2023-06-03
broooo you get a nice look at those kicks man what i wouldnt give to have a pair of those ,2023-06-04
major facts,2023-06-02
if you know you know,2023-06-05
darkest timeline miles morales,2023-06-09
he was kinda giving mumble rapper vibes it was cool hearing him speak from his moms influence though,2023-06-07
seeing miles 1610 and miles 42 reminded me of huey and riley from boondocks,2023-06-18
he appears near the start of the movie too during spots introduction to miles,2023-06-13
i hope we see him with black forces next movie in the same vein of our miles chicago 1s,2023-06-11
i also thought that  i was expecting it to be waayyyyy longer,2023-06-02
i was waiting for a postcredits scene and i was surprised how quickly the credits went by too,2023-06-02
it’s because they went with a slideshow looking credits instead of the usual scrolling credits in most movies bumblebee also had slideshow credits and it finishes up quickly too,2023-06-02
crew was over 1000 people which is a lot for an animated project someone below already said it but the slideshow credits made it much faster i had a few friends working on it and i didn’t have time to find their names,2023-06-02
probably as a way for people to not get mad at the lack of stinger but it felt so weird how short they were considering how long they were in the last one,2023-06-02
the movies budget was only 100m which i thought was surprisingly small which could explain the smaller number of crew involved contrast that with pixars elemental which has double the budget and a half hour shorter run time no doubt its crew was much larger,2023-06-04
they were setting up a sequel… the credits will be continued in beyond the spiderverse,2023-06-03
really feel for all the theater folks that will have to do the “there’s no post credit scene and we need to clean the theater” announcements this month,2023-06-04
it pobably helps keep such a stylistically complicated movie visually consistent if they have a relatively small team as opposed to multiple teams across different countries plus they probably figured out a lot of the production pipeline while making the first one,2023-06-02
love how they included production babies too,2023-06-12
they didnt scroll the credits maybe thats why,2023-06-04
well i remember them being 3 or 4 screens with multiple columns and lots of rows just for animators credits i estimate near 200 animators credited,2023-06-08
large numbers of staff  good look at any recent mcu movies the list is long and many of them are people from vfx mills in lowlaborcost countries,2023-06-02
scrolled through the cast and crew waaay too fast,2023-06-04
i loved how they werent scrolling credits more movies should do that,2023-06-08
yeah thats because they used gpt to make the movie s,2023-06-08
you didnt see the making off for the first one did you  the trained ai this time,2023-06-03
thats generally how it is for inhouse animated stuff it was basically just one studio working on this,2023-06-06
yeah but the credits animation was also gorgeous so theres that,2023-06-26
i also enjoyed his remark about having a museum for all the artifacts england stole,2023-06-02
dont eat pray love me bro,2023-06-02
could definitely be a ref to the darjeeling ltd but i took it as more of a joke about a lot of westerners going to south and se asia to find themselves  might be less of a thing in the us but its absolutely rife among young upper and uppermiddle class white kids in the uk,2023-06-02
"his quip where hes like and this is where the british stole all our stuff had me cackling but i was the only one in my theater to laugh

i wish we got more of him in the movie he was a fun character",2023-06-02
and the chai  tea redundancy also aligns with miles asking spot earlier why he says atm  machine,2023-06-02
the connection is definitely there but i took it more as a joke about westerners doing exactly this,2023-06-02
hah i didn’t make this connection that’s great,2023-06-02
i also loved the chai tea and naan bread jokes,2023-06-03
cant wait for adrien brody and owen wilson to show up in the sequel,2023-06-02
oh  i just got it,2023-06-02
i just watched the darjeeling limited for the first time recently so i made that connection a bit but didn’t realize shwartzman did the voice of the villain how great lol,2023-06-02
the chai tea annoyances cracked me up,2023-06-03
man i thought jason schwartzman‘s performance was so  funny his intonations during his lines were just great i feel like after scott pilgrim he really nails the nerdy villain  with power,2023-06-16
two of my indian friends laughed their  off during the chai and naan rant it mirrored their own rants perfectly,2023-06-05
oh spot is gman graves,2023-06-07
i was thinking more on the line where he gets upset about chai being called chai tea,2023-06-03
 the “i love chi tea” i love jason schwartzman,2023-06-09
i’m genuinely so proud of myself for getting that reference immediately haha,2023-06-04
im just sad i dont have anyone to share this reference with,2023-06-05
it’s also funny cause jason schwartzman was in the darjeeling limited which he also goes to india lol,2023-06-04
when british people watch movie oof,2023-06-02
where was the schwatzman joke,2023-06-11
it took me a moment to make the connections that jason schwartzmann voices spot,2023-06-19
in miles universe morbius is an unironically beloved movie series probably,2023-06-02
miles in morbius 2  confirmed,2023-06-02
morbes morales miles morbales,2023-06-02
 morbius memes aside for a second i thought we were going to see glimpses of morlun or maybe just namedrop the inheritors,2023-06-02
thank  morbius is only sony spidey property not to show up venom spiderman amazing spiderman spiderman homecoming insomniac spiderman spectacular spiderman all showed up,2023-06-02
i was expecting the meta joke to be miguel turns out to be good which we had all paid money to see in the theatre,2023-06-02
i was thinking about blade lol,2023-06-02
that line made me think miguel will be the actual big bad,2023-06-02
its vampire good guyin time,2023-06-02
"this is making morbillion dollars

also would love if atsv got a rerelease in theaters right before btsv comes out",2023-06-02
i thought it was a blade shoutout with mahershala ali voicing aaron and all,2023-06-02
this line got the biggest laugh at me since sony tried to rerelease morbius because they thought the internet loved it but actually they loved to hate it and they already had all the ammo that they needed i completely believe that they wrote this line as a dig on morbius at the same time i bet they knew that it was referencing blade also since blade has been experiencing serious production issues for a long time now so they got a two for one deal and it’s such a throwaway line,2023-06-05
wasnt morbius the villain of the original spiderverse comics or am i mistaken,2023-06-04
cant wait to see miles take inspiration from his fav mcu character and say its spider time and spider all over the spot,2023-06-03
thought that was a blade reference,2023-06-03
miles morbrales,2023-06-06
i thought they were referring to blade with that line,2023-06-06
bro i never even got that this was meant to be a morbius joke i thought it was about twilight for  sake,2023-06-18
i think the “to be continued” splash page gave my daughter her first real moment of nerd outrage she was angry on the walk all the way to the car,2023-06-02
"my theater lost it i think what blew my mind was listening to people who were like “i had no idea it had already been 2 hours”

i legit think a lot of them could’ve sat through 5 hours of this without complaint can’t blame them i could’ve too",2023-06-02
guy in my audience just went “” and that summed it up pretty well for all of us would’ve sat through another two hours happily,2023-06-02
"i avoid all spoilersnews so when it ended with to be continued i honestly thought it was a gagfakeout

the credits had been rolling a whole minute before i decided they werent just doing a bit",2023-06-02
my audience actually bood it was surprisingly loud,2023-06-02
my theatre was louder when gwen removed the action figure from the package ,2023-06-03
i knew this movie was a part 1 going into it and that to be continued still caught me off guard lol no  way that was 2 hours wheres the rest,2023-06-02
"i feel like the fact it ended where it did kind of made it not work for me i was thoroughly enjoying the movie and it was building up to a phenomenal third actbut ended 

it ended at the midpoint right into the rising action towards the climax it made me feel like i was watching a great movie that got shutoff halfway through and i left the theatre feeling empty there was no payoff 

i wish itd have ended on a bigger punch like having the final fight happen between the spider teams and then have them struggle against the spot while miles is held captive in another universe maybe gwen tries and fails to save miles dad in the resulting destruction and the spot breaks the multiverse right as the screen cuts off just spit balling but idk i felt a little bit like it was 20 mins away from a satisfying ending that couldve tied things up while setting the stage for the sequel",2023-06-02
our entire theater was in stunned disbelief until one gut went “seriously” haha,2023-06-02
about 5 minutes before it ended i thought to myself “how are they gonna wrap this up”,2023-06-02
it was just such an actual proper cliff hanger feeling like an episode of tv as opposed to a more “we assume there’s a sequel but this chapters pretty wrapped up”,2023-06-03
i could hear a kid having a meltdown a couple rows back and honestly i would have handled it the same way at his age,2023-06-02
it was met with stunned silence in mine understandably of course hitting right at such a pivotal moment but i kind of love it especially because while i may have to wait a while for the next part i get more of this,2023-06-02
that moment in a majorityblack theater in atlanta was the most fun ive had at the movies in years the place absolutely erupted xd,2023-06-03
i had no idea how much time passed by but i was so invested in the story and visuals that i was caught off guard i had no idea this movie had a cliffhanger like that even though i knew there would be a part 3,2023-06-02
pure rage everywhere tonight and i’m right there with them,2023-06-03
it was originally teasedannounced as a part one so i was prepared for it  especially as the cliffhanger tension built,2023-06-02
i walked out of that theater with the biggest case of blue balls in my  life,2023-06-03
"ehn  i hated that i avoid reading about movies ahead of time so i had no idea it was going to end on a cliffhanger like that additionally there are lots of good trilogies out there where you have to watch all 3 to get the full story but typically all the good ones give you sense of conclusion at the end of each movie this one did not the journey itself was pretty fantastic i laughed a lot and the artistry was mindblowingly good the amount of creativity they can do with this series is just off the charts but the way they ended it ya i dunno that aint it i have to give this movie a 1 thumb down because of the ending

i would recommend anyone whos on the fence about seeing it to wait til right before the next one is released so you can see the whole movie and not just half of it",2023-06-02
"agree loved the movie for everything up until literally that cliffhanger which i actively kinda hate i went in knowing this was gonna be a part 1 of 2 but you just cant cut it right before the thing the whole movie has been promising if it was just the earth42 stuff as the teaser thats okay because thats new info to show whats coming next but the whole movie was building up to gwen forming a renegade spider team to help miles cutting it off before letting us see them in action was not great

its like if infinity war cut to black right before thanos snaps would it get me interested in the next movie yeah of course but those last moments of seeing the aftermath made infinity war also be satisfying as its own story rather than just bring a part 1",2023-06-02
we had some guys collectively yell “bro” when that “to be continued” came up,2023-06-02
yeah holy  i was both hyped and also a bit  im 100 with them fleshing the rest of the story out but holy  i need to know what happens next now,2023-06-03
i knew it was coming and was constantly confused that the film kept going there were multiple points where i thought theyd pull the cliffhanger and when they eventually did i just sat there giggling,2023-06-02
"i was one of them but i enjoyed the movie so much and it left me so hyped for part 3 that i wasn’t even mad

i did think towards the ‘end’ of the movie ‘wow this movie feels super long and they still have the final fight to do’ but i thought because the pacing throughout was so fast it might have only been on for an hour and a half to be continued… 

i experienced so many emotions in the space of a few seconds… what noooo really that was awesome i can’t wait for the next one",2023-06-02
just happened to me too whole theater everyone was so engrossed phenomenal movie,2023-06-03
i mean it was pretty obvious when the movie refused to even start wrapping up in the last 30 minutes  i knew it was 2 hours and 15 minutes and im seeing at 145 that theres either the movie is just going to suddenly end leaving it up to interpretation or it has to be a two parter  but i never saw mention anywhere of this,2023-06-03
arguably a mistake that they stopped marketing it as part one or at least that they didn’t do a better job of letting general audiences know at least one more movie is on the way,2023-06-02
a girl behind me immediately said “i want my money back” ,2023-06-02
worked in both ways was so ready for the to be continued to drop the prowler reveal at the end completely caught me off guard,2023-06-02
that was me and the rest of the audience at my theater,2023-06-02
as i was watching i remember thinking man theyre gonna really rush the final act,2023-06-03
just got back from the movie there as a collective are you kidding me when this happened i was among them,2023-06-03
we were “infinity war” silentdisbelieving for at least a minute,2023-06-04
after a gasp and 2 seconds of silence one guy just went “ it” and everyone started laughing lol glad to see so many others had the same experience,2023-06-02
20 minutes from the end i was getting worried knowing they had no way to conclude in the time it had left,2023-06-03
"which is kinda strange it was known while i guess not as widely as it should have been according to these reactions that this was the first part of a two parter but when i think about it it was just dropped once and barely communicated at all from what i can remember and how i got to know about this but i am also an outlier and probably more informed than the majority of normal viewers

yet i had this fact mostly just in the back of my head during the movie and only remembered it in the last act that this movie will not resolve since it will have a sequel",2023-06-02
"i had no idea and neither did 95 of the theater i was in people stood up and yelled

it was great",2023-06-02
when gwen opened the collectors item,2023-06-03
i mean by that point they had already done several scenes that could have easily been the cutoff point i feel the ending was satisfying enough for a cliffhanger we knew was going to happen,2023-06-04
"i was not prepared for that 
i involuntarily yelled ‘aw ’",2023-06-02
"me at the start this better not end in a massive cliff hanger  
me at the end ",2023-06-02
"they must be casual fans

cause it was advertised as part 1 for 3 years 

e stop dming threats is just a joke wow ",2023-06-02
"i grabbed my friend and went i was thinking wow they setup the final act so well and then it ended

but i was also wondering how quick the finale would be we were all so happy we didnt know it was part one",2023-06-02
haha mine had a dude shouting oh mann at the end,2023-06-02
my buddy and the person sitting a few seats down from us had a good laugh over my reaction when to be continued popped up,2023-06-02
i think mine was fairly quiet it was packed,2023-06-03
"same thing happened in my theater it’s like somehow no one paid attention to the fact that this was announced as a part 1 of a movie

guess they really do have to spell this  out for people in the title if they want to hammer it home with people",2023-06-03
one guy in my theater threw his popcorn got a couple chuckling and some really unhappy people x,2023-06-04
once gwen started her speech i was like wait this is a part 1 isnt it man i could sit through hours of this they compared it to empires cliffhanger and i was doubtful but it was pretty effective,2023-06-02
,2023-06-04
one dude called out you gotta be kidding me in our theater,2023-06-04
i realized with about 25 minutes left that there was no way they could wrap it up in that time,2023-06-05
that happened at my theater too i think its a good sign that they would rather see even more of the film right then and there,2023-06-05
im kinda glad it ended like that i had to  really bad and was wondering how everything would get wrapped up so quickly,2023-06-05
just watched it and i knew it was coming because of the team forming and the music rising when the realisation hit me i was like oh no theyre doing a cliffhanger arent they the credits are about to hityep,2023-06-05
"for example when miles gets teleported to earth42 the world around him is in a different frame rate

and if i had to guess it’s probably around 42fps",2023-06-02
arcane on netflix is the only thing i’ve seen that comes close,2023-06-02
"the animation in this movie is staggeringly gorgeous  
  
i’m finding it hard to find anything remotely comparable no joke

i think this might be the most creative use of animation ever ive seen other anime use shifting styles before but it always feels kind of like it pulls me out this used shifting animation to tell the story gwens last moment with her dad could have been told entirely without the character models just voice over and the background color the super wide angles of new york help us see how beautiful and majestic the city is from the characters perspective in a way ive never seen",2023-06-03
"i’m an animator on feature films i know how everything is done i see a pixar movie and while i marvel at the craftsmanship nothing there is a mystery

this movie is a literal miracle the things they’ve accomplished however impressed you are you should be more i’ve worked on a bunch of movies and i don’t understand how this movie could have been made without like ten years of production time it’s an incredible achievement",2023-06-06
this movie and likely its sequel will inspire an entire generation of future aspiring animators for years to come,2023-06-02
agreed its great that other animation studios are finally catching on and trying out new approaches and art styles but dammit they still feel like baby steps the execs of these studios really need to let their artists cut loose and show what animation is truly capable of,2023-06-02
i dont think arcane gets to the level of spiderverse being a show vs movie and all but arcane definitely broke the barrier of what animation could be in their own way love it,2023-06-03
absolutely stunning that they did all this on a 100m budget  recent pixars cost twice as much and just look kinda average,2023-06-02
i was just in awe of nearly every frame of this movie the scene where miles changed clothes going up the stairs was insane on its own not to even touch on the rest,2023-06-02
"the animation in this movie is staggeringly gorgeous

i’m finding it hard to find anything remotely comparable no joke   


thats because theres nothing even close  


there are a lot of animated films which id strongly rate for their art style  the iron giant rango waltz with bashir persepolis soul the lego movies mitchells vs the machines some series too  eg bojack horseman love death  robots and there are some animations which were probably more influential most notably toy story  

but all of those were technically impressive or innovative in one or perhaps two ways or in the case of love death and robots one or two per episode  

the original spiderverse film was pretty unique in the extent to such it successfully innovated  it had the variable frame rate thing the shading style the comic book inserts the tactical use of colour and alternative styles as well as absolutely incredible art direction and cinematography  

and then that team decide that for the sequel theyre going to do the same thing but instead of one jawdropping artstyle theyre going to create four gwenverse milesverse mumbai nuevo york and layer in a whole bunch of extra ones situationally da vinci the spots visions the spot himself punk verse 42 as well as animating literally hundreds of distinct artstyles for various supporting characters  

its shockingly ambitious the first film was already out in front of the competition and this exceeds it in just about every way",2023-06-04
"mind game 2004 and redline 2009 have some absolutely gorgeous incredibly unique and certainly stylized animation id check them out 

edit akira 1988 is a mandatory watch and if you are into it fantastic planet 1973 is gorgeous",2023-06-02
"finding it hard to find anything remotely comparable no joke

id say arcane is just as good in animation not as creative though since it maintains a consistent art style most of the time",2023-06-05
which is saying alot because the first movie was gorgeous in its own right too theyve really outdone themselves,2023-06-04
"i love great kung fu  its my favorite cinema conceit and animation is right behind  

this movie made me rethink that  

the animation was stunning  brilliant  pristine  i could talk about this animation the way that i talk about the ex that  me up and came back years later and we became best friends

its at least that gorgeous",2023-06-02
 n boots 2 and this are the kings,2023-06-05
when the spot powers up it was very reminiscent of the anti spirals from ttgl for me,2023-06-05
at different points in the movie it reminded me of a ghost in the shell and aeon flux my two favorite animated projects ever,2023-06-04
they also combined liveaction characters with animation in a way that didn’t make them look out of place it just blended perfectly,2023-06-07
"agreed

there is one other thing ive seen recently that has somewhat comparable animationart entergalactic 

its a fairly straightforward but charming romcom on netflix with similarly gorgeous art it even mixes up the style when using a different perspective like spiderverse does with the universes",2023-06-11
comic book style frame cuts were breathtaking they did the same thing as the movie started just visually delicious,2023-06-04
arcane felt very similar in animation quality and also art styles definitely got that vibe while watching and also because hailee steinfield both voice female protagonists with cool hair,2023-06-12
if you want highly kinetic and fluid animation like this with a killer soundtrack i would recommend redline 2009,2023-06-03
"agree in  in boots it looked gratuitous same in the new teenage mutant ninja turtles trailer shown before this
its like people producing those movies is just a matter of copying the art style for the sake of it smh",2023-06-05
"wrt the animation i wish i had a better technical understanding of the sheer skill that went into this so much interesting info in this thread

",2023-06-07
watch enter galactic on netflix has a similar stuff of animation that is beautiful,2023-06-26
arcane from netflix is the only animation that i would say is on almost on par with spiderman across the spiderverse,2023-07-20
yeah i agree  words really dont do justice for how gorgeous this movie is  its seemed like every scene has jaw dropping visuals  the use of color in particular was so  good,2023-11-08
youre one of our best  ,2023-06-02
"i loved that bit it was actually animated by a 14 year old the same guy that did the lego trailer recreations 

also my lego spiderman minifig design was used you can see it in my animation here 

its the same custom printing and eye rig i made pretty happy to have a bit of my work on the movie the actual animator did an amazing job especially for being so young",2023-06-02

does anyone know if that was james arnold taylor love me some ratchet  clank,2023-06-02
a 14 yr old boy animated that scene,2023-06-06
are they legally allowed to call it lego in this i thought the lego film rights just got moved from warner bros to universal neither of which are sony,2023-06-03
that was so good,2023-06-02
what was the number for the lego dimension in reference to it’s not the set number for the daily bugle,2023-06-04
you know that payoff is gonna be amazing,2023-06-04
the only sad bit for me is that they didnt use the actual large lego daily bugle,2023-06-04
do you think he would be human sized or would  swinging around the other spiders as a one inch minifigure,2023-06-04

the lego was the most uncreative world they traveled to imo glad there wasnt more of it,2023-06-04
maybe he was in the big spiderman chase scene but he was still lego sized,2023-06-03
i love how it was identified as earth13122 which is the same universe used in the lego marvel superheroes games,2023-06-07
a 14 year old edited that scene actually,2023-06-18
i had no idea that was coming avoided all spoilers i could so that had me rolling,2023-06-26
the spot really went from goofily awkward in the trailer to giving me chills at full strength when your villain changes the entire visual setting of the scene it’s time to panic,2023-06-02
jk simmons is a nexus being,2023-06-02
"its absolutely an example of why i tell folks animation can allow for so much more than live action trying to do a movie like this as live action would be almost impossible without one of the largest budgets for a movie ever and all the action would almost feel too cartoon and fake but in an animated movie it fits perfectly and feels completely natural

also very excited that this franchise has reminded other animators making big movies they dont have to stick to the disney or pixar style to be successful not that those studios are bad but theyre not the keepers of the animation kingdom",2023-06-02
spot went from clist villain to the  antispiral real quick,2023-06-02
i cant help but feel like if they just let him have that  atm we could have avoided most of the disaster that takes place afterwards sometimes its better for the heroes to just step back and allow crime to work itself out rather than making everything 100x worse,2023-06-02
my eyes glitched and i read “beyond” as “beyoncé” and thought…true beyoncé has kept up the momentum but not sure that fits here,2023-06-02
"one of my favorite one sheets i own worked in a movie theater for a few years is spiderverse  its miles falling upwards towards manhattan  i cant look at it without hearing youve got this spark inside you and tink tink tink whats up danger

a pause and then the window breaks glass scatters freezing in slomo a moment later they fit perfectly

every single shot in that sequence is burned into my brain  

the sequel isnt quite as good a film in my opinion  its outstanding but has a lot on its plate  too much to do  that it didnt feel overstuffed is a minor miracle  the creative team really threaded a needle here  

the art team looked at a needle threaded it used it to sew leather on a baseball and then knocked said baseball off the  planet  this is one of the most beautiful anachronistic slices of cinema youll ever watch and it improves on the original in ways i didnt think possible",2023-06-02
there are always constants and variables,2023-06-02

" but holy  was this a gorgeous movie

i need someone to make a wallpaper of the scene where miles and gwen are sitting upside down with new york in the background",2023-06-03
the way spot evolved over just a couple of hours from a goofy villain of the week to an interdimensional frightening threat  despite a markedly lack of screen time  was very impressive storytelling,2023-06-04
i need them to go back to any spiderman media that had jjj and have jk dub over it,2023-06-02
" 
 
 i love how the one constant in the spiderverse is apparently jk simmons is always j jonah jameson

except for the 1990s cartoon spiderverse where ed asner is jjj rest in peace legend",2023-06-03
i’m wondering how the villain is going to progress i think threat and animation wise he’s perfect but i wasn’t very on board with his motivation hoping that gets explored more in the future,2023-06-02
i was thinking the same almost every shot was purposely made to be a still image i want the shot of miles and gwen upsidedown as my pc wallpaper,2023-06-03
it was my feeling come out of it too if beyond lands it this will easily be my favorite animated trilogy ever and will be in the discussion for overall as well,2023-06-03
i want to hang every frame of this movie in one gigantic room,2023-06-03
the soundtrack is incredible might win a grammy,2023-06-04
yep the idea that this might be one of the greatest trilogies ever was crossing my mind the whole time at the end i just sat in my chair dumbfounded at the greatness i had just seen,2023-06-04
" this will be one of best trilogies of all time

i think as a complete story sure especially if we are just talking superhero movies but across the spiderverse just literally being a build up for beyond will hurt it as a trilogy a good trilogy has movies that are connected but can also stand on its own",2023-06-05
honestly ive always thought spot to be terrifying since my first introduction to him was in a daredevil comic he became a human trafficker kept the peoples heads stuck in a closet while their bodies were sold off elsewhere,2023-06-07
best trilogy,2023-06-03
it really was every scene moment and sequence really came together seamlessly all these amazing ideas and details were incredible i didn’t expect this second movie to just absolutely  it from the first one but  they did,2023-06-03
no seriously i feel like my mind kept going “wait pause let me look at this frame for a few more seconds it’s too pretty” every few seconds  lol gotta go back and see it all again,2023-06-04

jameson must be a nexus being,2023-06-03
can’t ignore the sound design which was just as good,2023-06-04
the movie has such a unique visual style and then on top of that they manage to create a unique style for the different worlds to set them apart,2023-06-04
i literally said the same thing to my friends in the theatre every frame is a piece of art freeze frame whenever you want,2023-06-11
"i didnt think they could match the quality of the first movie but that was sheer bias because that became one of my favorite movies ever instantly

this one thoughthis one blew me away even more i cannot wait for beyond",2023-06-26

"i love many animated movies but ive never seen an animated movie go so beautifully off the rails as this one everything characters multiverses etc is simultaneously distinct unified fluid and rock solid it makes every other movie ive seen that uses the background to telegraph and enhance story beats look like amateur hour

i know vert little about animation but i have plenty of experience in longterm project management and how in the everloving  is something that was worked on by a small army of animators as visually playful as a don hertzfeldt short film and still make narrative sense

i honestly prefer into the spiderverse and it could never match the this changes everything feeling so many of us got walking out of it but they somehow took one of the most joyfully liberated visual achievements ive ever seen and leveled up",2023-06-02
dont want to be this  but im gonna it wasnt watercolor it was pastel chalk and it was  everything to me,2023-06-02

by far the best animation ive ever seen in a film",2023-06-02

the whole prologue with gwen is one of the most beautiful things ive ever seen its actually a perfect short film,2023-06-02
the way color tones were changing as emotions were developing to suit the scene was  beautiful just beautiful this movie was absolutely mindblowing from a visual standpoint might be one of the most beautiful ive seen,2023-06-02
when she walks into the apartment she’s upset and is literally a shade of blue it’s quick but is a really effective piece of visual storytelling so much of gwen and her dad’s scenes were just phenomenal visual storytelling,2023-06-03
my son 8 noticed this in the theatre and asked if the room is crying because shes sad,2023-06-04

"the conversation with her father had my jaw on the  floor  it was gorgeously animated  

the art direction in this film was absolutely stellar and i dont think there was a frame in the entire thing that wasnt dripping with style

they somehow managed to one up the incredibly high bar that was the first one",2023-06-03
her bgm was so amazing,2023-06-02
i really loved at the beginning how she and her room were designed using cold colors while her dad and the rest of the house was warm really made the two feel outofplace with each other and felt so much more rewarding when they resolved their differences,2023-06-03
"and in the later scene the color starts to run down the walls it’s so well done

in the scene with miles telling his mom about being spiderman the world starts to lose focus and blending in more like the water colors in gwen’s world as miles figures out he’s out of place thought it was a great way to show the characters not connecting with the world around them",2023-06-04
it really reminded me of disco elysium,2023-06-02
those were the color pallets from her comic book series that world was specifically ripped from the comics,2023-06-03
"the use of colour was amazing throughout

biggest moment for me was when he returns to his bedroom and rapidly dresses to hide his costume from his mum  in prowlers colours",2023-06-07
that scene was visually jawdropping which is insane for just a heartfelt conversation,2023-06-02
i adored gwens universe such a beautiful yet effective design,2023-06-02
yeah those scenes looked ripped straight from the spidergwen comic art it was incredible,2023-06-02
pulled straight from her comic covers it was incredible,2023-06-02
"along with whatever they did to pull off the design for spiderpunk what they did with gwens world was one of my favorite visual things ive seen with animation in years

such a beautiful movie",2023-06-05
those moments might have been my favorite animation wise they arent as flashy as like everything about spiderpunk but it was pretty beautiful,2023-06-03
its pulled straight from her original solo run the story is soso but the art is absolutely gorgeous in every panel,2023-06-10
it was pretty spot on regarding her comics loved it,2023-06-03
"the use of colour was amazing throughout

biggest moment for me was when he returns to his bedroom and rapidly dresses to hide his costume from his mum  in prowlers colours",2023-06-07
"i saw it as her emotions and how they matched it her dad is always depicted in bright colours inviting and warm whereas everything gwen is in is in dark colours she feels isolated from her world and her dad wanting nothing more than to go there but feeling like she cant 

the moment she hugs her dad and the colour bleeds together was so cathartic because she finally gets out of that isolation and into the warmth and love she deserves and always had

also the scene with her dad at the start was so good where you can tell just from the colours where her dads mental state is in struggling between being with his daughter sharing the red shes in and the justice side of him black and white blocks then when he finally tries to arrest her hes in all black and white fully succumbing 

the use of color in this movie is second to none so much just captured through that",2023-06-22
"the art style really grew on me during the dad reunion scene at the end but man did the first few minutes not land with me  my wife 

we both were like hmm i hope we get back to the more animated style soon",2023-06-02
its also very reminiscent of the art style of her comics,2023-06-02
depression and inner struggling metaphor so good,2023-06-05
the scene where gwen hugged her dad reminded so much of the game gris,2023-06-08
absolutely masterful animation here i felt all the anguish between them,2023-06-03
my first thought was the dripping colours were like tears,2023-06-04
love how they use spidergwen comics art style for her,2023-06-04
yes it’s just like her comic,2023-06-04
yea when things got emotional the walls become very water colored and minimalist amazing touch by the artists,2023-06-05
its bases off her comic art work,2023-06-05
yes that was beautiful,2023-06-05
it was like seeing the comic run of spider gwen on screen,2023-06-08
felt like i was on acid during that scene,2023-06-10
its robbies stuff from his run,2023-06-02
it was more impressionist than watercolour i thought,2023-06-02
i accidentally read villain when you said civilian and was like  did i miss in this movie,2023-06-06
just looked like mood coloring to me,2023-06-07
the artwork in her universe was just sublime,2023-06-11
 the visuals and way the scenery told its own stories was mind blowing,2023-06-26
ya i love how much these films experiment with animation in film,2023-07-21
the guy straight up was thin blue lined when he tried to arrest her,2023-08-08
i liked that her world has no identifying features or sharp images its all just a splash of warm pastel colors and the focal point is always around her and everything else is out of focus or blurred most likely signifying her loneliness and her need for friendship the attention to detail these animators are giving this movie continues to impress,2023-08-08
i am convinced that the scriptwriter wrote in mayday is a miracle baby as a line because its a miracle that a parker is allowed to be happy,2023-06-02
"in the center of a display of vital canon events you have peter b marrying mj

someone knew what they were doing",2023-06-02
"i think the sad and lonely status quo is well kinda obviously dumb but more the point in the context of the movie is that you cant focus on what you lose because you have to focus on what you can create peter b parker focuses on a new family and the relationships that matter 

i wonder if well get something along the lines in the sequel is with great power comes great responsibility but dont forget you also have a responsibility to yourself",2023-06-02
an eldritch horror plot hole,2023-06-02
i hope spot still gets to talk in the sequel and isnt just a humanoid black hole,2023-06-02
peter b is only happy because of an anomaly miles,2023-06-02
"having a central villain being a literal plot hole threatening spiderman canon is both hilarious and genius

i kinda got the sense that the writers were giving a big  middle finger to simpsons comic book guy types who think any deviation from the source material renders an adaptation obligatorily bad",2023-06-03
im convinced that the little girl his dad wants to save will be peters daughter,2023-06-03
just wait until mephisto shows up in part 3 to make peter b a deal,2023-06-02
maybe they use this trilogy as an excuse to finally undo one more day,2023-06-03
oh wow he is the plot hole haha,2023-06-02
" unless theyre peter b and impacted by miles

i think this is foreshadowing miles is the anomaly and the only one that can break the curse",2023-06-04
i thought that was the worst part of the movie the main lesson spiderpeople learn from their loss is that they cant save everyone but they still have to try and then to have thoundsands of spiders who have given up on that concept and have accepted that there are people they wont try to save is just too far off brand,2023-06-07
are they doomed to be sad and lonely or just to experience trauma in his life i dont think those are the same thing,2023-06-05
its definitely a great meta movie very aware of its own writing process,2023-06-07
wouldn’t say they’re doomed to be lonely just with uncle ben or someone close to them dead peter in mcu got the worse of it tho but uncle ben tony and aunt mae are gone,2023-06-03
i would love to see it take a dark turn not that dark miles shouldn’t exist so peter b’s daughter is an anomaly making her a target for 2099 forcing b to go all out,2023-06-04
ob wow now that you mention it miles can have an impact on everyone so they would not be miserable anymore see indian spidey for example,2023-06-04
the whole movie feels like a takedown on grimdark edgy proutilitarian writing i think its trying to make a point that spiderman is best as a lighthearted coming of age story,2023-06-07
"they went for the jugular with that tbh

marvel has literally just done the whole timecuck storyline with peter and then atsv dunks on editorial’s need to make pete miserable",2023-06-07
"same i really liked how the movie was a meta commentary on how spiderman needs to be miserable to be spiderman 

no he cannot be happy under any circumstances people around him need to die

makes me aaaaaalll kinds of worried about middle aged peters mayday and mj",2023-06-08
so then is miles enacting change is he allowing the spidermen he touches to become happy and break the cycle,2023-06-05
i think that’s done on purpose maybe peter b parker will show miguel and the other spider people that if it wasn’t for miles he wouldn’t be where he is and as happy as he is and that mile’s influence can actually save the other spider people from being fated to live sad and lonely superhero lives that he does belong as spiderman,2023-06-10
"i feel like i’m in the minority for not entirely loving the movie correct me at any point but they are mad with miles for saving dude on bridge because it’s the canon for that spidey’s universe but those events leading to the bridge only transpired because of spot coming through from miles’s original anomaly unless they were deliberately making real plot holes with him or it’s possible i totally missed something


all these varying responses is why i didn’t like the movie they weren’t clear about it whether that was on purpose or not felt like the pacing was rough the whole movie especially the very abrupt ending and jacked audio i miss 90 of hobie’s dialogue",2023-06-02
"also i just had a massive realisation the elite spider uh miguel team thingy right they all want miles to just let his dad die 

which is just like how peter originally he blithely ignores the chance to stop a fleeing thief

he let it happen and this indifference is what catches up with him when the same criminal later robs and kills his uncle ben causing him to take being spiderman seriously",2023-06-08
i truly enjoyed seeing scarlet spider animated  i was expecting just a tiny background cameo but he was in several scenes near the end  trash  90s stories but one of my favorite spiderman costumes,2023-06-02
the ok dad  response to miguel ,2023-06-02
heroes need to observe when walls are still there,2023-06-02
love love love that they made him brooding sad boy him and miguel had the 90’s edge as a throwback to their era in comics,2023-06-02
i didnt get his character can you eli5,2023-06-02
ahhh my painful memories,2023-06-02
did they even give andy samberg a script or did they just stick him in front of a microphone and say “ok go” lol,2023-06-03
he was also voiced by adam samberg i knew his voice was familiar but boy its freaking adam samberg haha,2023-06-02
andy samberg did a wonderful job voicing that character,2023-06-03
yeah i thought he was just going to be in there for a one off joke when we first saw him but then he kept being in the movie scene after scene it made me so happy,2023-06-07
bro went from funny soft spoken jason schwartzman to straight up an eldritch monstrosity at the end,2023-06-02
it was cool seeing him improve his powers from struggling to break into an atm and tripping on himself to casually warping the scientists out of the collider control room,2023-06-02
did you spot spot,2023-06-03
"miguel isnt really a villain but more of a victim 
that injection that he took during one scene in the movie either makes me think hes controlling venom unlikely or that hes secretly suppressing the lizard from coming out",2023-06-06
its not a villain origin story but a supervillain origin story,2023-07-03
"this must be a great movie for parents tbh

probably the most real theyve been portrayed in a superhero movie as wellmeaning but overbearing folks",2023-06-02
"lol i saw it with a buddy of mine who has a mexican mom and black dad 

he laughed the loudest at the b in spanish mom immediately starts speaking spanish joke",2023-06-02
mama morales and gwen is best girl,2023-06-02
"she made me tear up

 i care about miles’ family so much",2023-06-02
"that speech got me and the random dad sitting next to me the same no idea who that man was but we were both a crying mess 

it felt so genuine and felt like the same stuff that my mom struggled to tell me growing up it stemmed from anxiety but was full of love and trust in the end one of the most beautiful scenes ive ever seen",2023-06-02
"my father leaned over after her speech to miles and whispered  
everything she just said i want to reiterate it for you",2023-06-02
you used her first name,2023-06-02
i started tearing up at that speech hit hard and felt really real,2023-06-02
that speech hit me on so many different levels growing up and navigating the world as i’ve worked my way through my education and profession often one of few persons of color in the room i wish i had someone like her giving me advice and the reassurance to be confident i recently found out i’ll be be having a kid funny enough i’m rican and my girl black too so it had me thinking of the lessons i’ll be teaching them one day obv the film was super fun and visually amazing but it was those human moments that really stuck out to me,2023-06-03
im a father of a 6 months lil girl and if i had watched this last year it wouldnt mean as much as it did tonight to me,2023-06-03
that whole conversation emotionally killed me ,2023-06-02
"she said she worried she wouldnt always be around to make him feel like he belonged

ten minutes later and miguel is yelling you dont belong here",2023-06-03
"one of the main things i wanted to see was miles relationship with his mother after into focused on his relationship with his dad  

was not disappointed  i dont talk during movies  i leaned over and whispered i think everyone here wishes that was their mom and sam locked eyes with me nodding  

it was a nicely written and expertly delivered monologue",2023-06-02
"and now miles literally has run into another miles that needs helpaka her little boy that needs to be taken care of albeit from a different universe

i see people saying that she has death flags but i think she actually was foreshadowing the third movie",2023-06-07
i got the implicates she is very aware of who he is,2023-06-03
that line choked me up a tad so heartfelt such a great scene,2023-06-08
mj is anything but sincere and heart in spiderman 2 lol,2023-06-29
oh  if spider verse 3 ends up like spider man 3 i’m gonna cry,2023-06-03
i cried at this scene very touching and moving and relatable to me,2023-06-11
bruh i teared up in the first five minutes of gwen’s reintroduction,2023-06-13
i was a bit thrown off by all this he’s only 15 and they’re talking about letting him go like where your 15 year old just definitely be telling you where they are going…,2023-06-16
makes me think her words will reach him in universe 42 our miles will remember prowler miles is also her little boy she evens says remember even when he getsfeels lost,2023-06-19
i had no clue what tf that was supposed to be so i figured it had to be something from venom lol,2023-06-02
there was a subtle reference to morbius when miles talked about wanting to see a movie about a good guy vampire,2023-06-04
to be honest that felt really out of place but thats probably because im not a big fan of the venom films and her role in them seemed pretty small and nothing special,2023-06-06
"yeah gwens story is done so to speak 

now its miles turn",2023-06-02
id argue that the majority of gwens choices are what led the movie making her the protagonist,2023-06-02
i didn’t mention it in my review but i loved the opening with gwen the recap her band her dad… it was oh so so good,2023-06-02
the line that drove it home for me was when her dad said that he always taught her to play it by the book and the entire movie was her unlearning miguels book in favor of miles imma do my own thing approach,2023-06-02
"this

the film starts with gwen leaving her band and the fallout between her and her father

the middle of the film gwen has basically accepted her role in a group of spidermen shes not 100 on board with because the alternative is being sent back to her own dimension and being forced to confront her father

the film ends with gwen building bridges with her father and her leading her own band of spidermen

into the spiderverse is the story of miles across the spiderverse is the story of gwen i wouldnt be surprised if beyond put a spotlight on peter b as well as finishing miles two part story",2023-06-02
"one particular thing i noticed was her realization she knew that according to the canon her father was going to die because he was a police captain and every spiderman has to have a police captain close to spiderman die saving someone that they themselves cant save

but things changed her dad quit the force during his acceptance speech meaning the circumstances changed the intended canon changed so she realized things dont have to go the way that the spider ai what was her name says they have to go",2023-06-02
when the background started getting watery so did my eyes,2023-06-02
gwen was ready for her dad to die only for him to quit she was like in that moment thinking waityou can do that,2023-06-02
i loved everything but it definitely didnt feel like its own movie to me my girlfriend agreed so i didnt feel too crazy,2023-06-03
i still kind of disagree i say kind of because i agree they did the gwen stuff beautifully and i love your point of them starting and ending with gwen that said it’s still a miles morales movie and he’s clearly the protagonist so i still feel like this movie didn’t have a complete feel i’m torn because i loved it so much but like many others are saying i feel like they were so close to perfection bur feel short with that ending or lack thereof,2023-06-05
the movie starts with her out of synch with her band that same theme song starts playing at the end and instead of devolving into chaos like at the beginning it swirls up into a heroic crescendo as her band comes together loved it but it also has me very very very afraid for what comes next,2023-06-06
yeah the pacing is a bit wonky until you realize it’s meant to tell gwen’s story then you can recognize it’s beginning and why it ends where it ends instead of the other cliffhanger part where miles is revealed to be in earth42,2023-06-02
the movie literally begins with her ends with her and both scenes share the same music motif it is most definitly her movie even if its not made the most prevelant always,2023-06-03
and gwen telling her dad helped to avoid her police chief dying moment,2023-06-02
disagree it definitely doesn’t feel like it’s own movie and the ending is just unsatisfying,2023-06-02
i absolutely loved this too great choice,2023-06-02
i think this made the movie so much better that gwen got the attention to her story that it needed it would be a worse series if gwen doesnt get her arc and we just do miles perspective,2023-06-03
i was so excited for this movie that i completely lost track that entire first scene was just an opening credits scene i was fully prepared to watch a spidergwen movie feat miles morales,2023-06-05
i did not walk away from this movie feeling like it was a complete movie,2023-06-16
mhmm felt very mad max which is great because gwen as furiosa moving the plot along was awesome,2023-06-03
im glad she wasn’t just a side character in the movie they did a wonderful job weaving her into to the film i’m just bummed i have to wait for part 3,2023-06-04
man hailee steinfeld  killed it and the animators too everything about gwen was  well done,2023-06-07
i like intro with gwen and her backstory etc also relates with miles why gwen understands what mile going thru parallels etc,2023-06-02
even the watercolor backdrop was crying,2023-06-02
im glad she was a proper secondary lead this time but obviously itsv couldnt do that when it was an origin,2023-06-02
reporting from regal in ny the sound mixing was very poor in the opening with gwen and i could not hear anything during spider punks dialogue,2023-06-03
i love gwen,2023-06-05
miles is the lead of all 3 films spot is his villain thats the main story,2023-06-02
i wish i was more emotional haha,2023-06-03
i didnt think of it that way when i saw it thanks for that,2023-06-04
there was such emotional depth in this film at times which being an animation is something else,2023-06-06
ahhh yesssss after seeing the movie  i find it so hard to agree with the criticism that the movie didnt complete an arc it did its a different beat emotional and characterdriven,2023-06-07
 this changes the ending a lot for me thank you lol,2023-06-10
yeah she had a the whole arc that carried the narrative we start the film on her and end the film on her she has that resolution with her dad and she gets her band felt like an earned ending you know she cares deeply about miles so shes going to keep fighting so good,2023-06-26
my thoughts as well she bookended the movie theres a complete arc for her here with the reconciliation with her dad pretty much acting as the climax of the movie i mean if that isnt your protagonist of the story then what is,2023-08-08
theyre a circle and yet more and you can put so much on thembut also theyre kind of like a donut and sometimes there can be a smaller donut inside that donut,2023-06-03
well when you put everything on a bagel…,2023-06-04
bagel in a brita voice,2023-06-04
i think i liked this more than eeaao which even as a big fan of the first spiderverse i didn’t expect to be able to say,2023-06-05
"and also commentary about the difficulties and hardships that come with parenting 

the cold open with gwen and her dad straight up killed me i was like y’all can’t seriously be making me cry before the title screen has even been shown jfc ",2023-06-08
only the good ones,2023-06-10
second movies can be hit or miss lots of people say terminator 2 is the best sequel i would agree it’s way better than the first but this movie…holy  it was amazing they absolutely nailed this sequel,2023-06-03
" no into the spiderverse is a near perfect movie and it has a complete story a begging middle and an end across the spiderverse doesnt even have a real ending it just ends

like the movie all you want but enough with the hyperbole comparing it to absolute classics",2023-06-12
exactly what i’m thinking,2023-06-03
i think it’s my favorite marvel movie period,2023-07-09
this joke got a lot of laughs at my sf theater,2023-06-02
can you remind me whats happening here i remember the line but not the context,2023-06-02
after dealing with venom you are not surprised by anything anymore,2023-06-03
legendary fight with shia labeouf normally tuesday night for shia labeouf,2023-06-02
i love that the sky was just taken from the covers of spidergwen,2023-06-02
the score for those portions went so  hard too,2023-06-03
yes such a good run,2023-06-02
thank you i was clamoring for more,2023-06-02
too bad latour is a creep,2023-06-04
ill check it out,2023-06-02
schwartzman was so good watching him evolve from clumsy nobody to the most frightening character in the multiverse was a great arc of its own in this movie,2023-06-02
"i adored how spot paralleled miles

both of them werent taken seriously by the people around them until all of a sudden they became the nexus of the multiverses problems

plus the fact that theyre both anomalies in their own way",2023-06-02
"its funny cause the bagel was an easter egg for 2nd or 3rd time viewers

and for it to be the main villian is fantastic ",2023-06-02
you know if i had a dime every time there was a multiverse travelling villain who had ties to a bagel id have two dimes which is not much but it would still be strange that i would have two,2023-06-02
between this movie  everything everywhere all at once bagels are taking over the multiverse,2023-06-02
how is it retcon it just builds upon a small part of the original,2023-06-02
"i think my favourite is that miles spider isnt from his universe since in the first movie you can  see it do the glitching thing that people who arent of their home universe do

im convinced that was planned to some extent",2023-06-02
"its not a retcon because retcons apply to changing the understanding of plot points

spot and the scientists that worked on the multiversal machine were already established spot himself didnt have any impact on miles story in the first movie theres plenty of space for concurrent stories to happen in story b that arent relevant to story a even if story b is made after story a is finished 

like all the old or new canon for star wars that doesnt contradict the understanding of movies canon",2023-06-02
how were either of those a retcon,2023-06-02
really that moment was so forgettable miles throws so many foods at so many bad guys,2023-06-02
it reminded me of how in far from home the guy who stane shouted the infamous box of scraps line was in on mysterios scheme had that same energy,2023-06-02
yeah i’m glad he wasn’t a former employee of the tony stark from miles’ universe,2023-06-03
the bagel reference made me think of everything everywhere all at once,2023-06-02
funny how the first time we see him he was hit with a food item with a hole in it,2023-06-02
"lol at that one being one his listed grievances with miles

“i lost everything you threw a bagel at me”",2023-06-04
i recently rewatched the first movie but i really don’t remember what was significant about the bagel did something happen at the end when he destroys the collider,2023-06-02
the “rogue one explaining the death star design flaw” wasn’t a great retcon tho,2023-06-02
i loved that perfect villain origin story or part of it anyway,2023-06-02
a great detail not a retcon though,2023-06-03
,2023-06-02
has anyone gone back and watched that part in itsv to see if it’s him,2023-06-03
and is it just me or is his origin very mcu mysterioesque,2023-06-03
i must have missed this connection can you elaborate on it for me,2023-06-05
" rogue one explained the death star design flaw

as a person who doesnt watch starwars care to fill me in",2023-06-20
whats the explanation for the design flaw,2023-06-25
"i hate both of those retcons tbh

well maybe hate a strong word but i just feel like its really unnecessary to make him the bagel guy or to explain why a super weapon might have a weak spot like i dont think people were questioning that when they watch star wars in 1978",2023-06-04
is it possible the bagel guy is this universes peter parker that didnt get bit it would lend tohis whole not just being the villain of the week but being a main baddie someone to remember,2023-06-02
id consider it a retcon tbh,2023-06-05
and peter in gwen world sudenly turning 15 he was old peter in the original movie lol,2023-06-06
that scene has an entire new meaning,2023-06-02
i think he evolved too quickly wouldve been better to see him develop more imo,2023-06-02
retcon the bagel had a hole it was natural progression for him to become the spot ,2023-06-04
he got hit with a piece of bread with a hole in it ,2023-06-04
never forget the rogue one tie fighter in the trailer,2023-06-04
sat in the theater while the spot was going on and on just thinking please be the bagel guy,2023-06-07
"also what is it with bagels and multiverses

spot in this is basically jobu tupaki towards the end",2023-06-08
"you ran through the corridor you hit me with a bagel

cue overdramatic aaaaaaaaaaarggh

gets me every time",2023-06-09
the bagel he was hit with it mustve been and everything bagel,2023-06-12
i don’t think it counts as a retcon when they probably intended it from the start,2023-06-12
,2023-06-13
or if the stormtrooper who cracked their head in star wars had gone on to be some big bad,2023-06-20
the purple jacket under his puffer was such a good little detail his own is red,2023-06-02
as miles jumped into the go home machine you can see on one of the screens it says earth  42 instead of earth  6106,2023-06-02
" okay well i was feeling  before but now im feeling extremely  that it took me until uncle aaron walked in to realize he was in the wrong universe

i thought miles mom was just really caught up in her own stuff and spiderman was jeffs thing

in hindsight im an idiot",2023-06-02
"i got it the moment miles stood in his room because in his world his room is so detailed in earth42 it was rather bland less line work more washed out colors 

i was wondering why it looked that way and then it smacked me like a ton of bricks he is on the wrong earth",2023-06-02
"a couple subtle hints the purple jacket miles mom asking what happened to his hair total shock

i even talked to my friend how when the screen showed earth42 as his home dimension all it got out of me was a oh i didnt know that was his universe show dont tell hide your clues in plain sight

total banger of a movie probably gonna go see it again next week hope they can get the audio in check at my theater though",2023-06-02
right and as he was explaining to his mom he said “i wish dad was here” and obviously she gets it because his dad literally passed in that universe but that wasn’t what he meant super subtle dialogue,2023-06-02
they did a good job of laying the groundwork for that moment describing the dna machine and how his spider was from a different dimension helped set up the twist really well it made sense and didn’t just feel like a twist for the sake of it,2023-06-02
i thought she was going for a just joking i knew all along and was just waiting for you to tell me then it kept going,2023-06-02
i guessed he might be going to the wrong universe as he was leaving but i knew it as soon as i saw his mother’s eyes they were the wrong color,2023-06-02
i was soo confused for like 20 seconds like didn’t she watch the tv when peter died in the first movie lol,2023-06-02
i was laser  focused and i noticed the machine said 42 before he got zapped away kinda blew the surprise for myself ,2023-06-02
i didn’t even realise at that point i thought they were just playing on the idea that sometimes people that are really famous to a younger generation don’t register at all to older people,2023-06-02
i didnt even realize it i thought the mom was being a boomer and realized at the same time as miles,2023-06-02
my verbal oh  happened when i saw the prowlers jordans realizing it was miles,2023-06-03
my jaw was on the floor with that reveal all the signs were there but this was one of the best “oh ” moments i’ve ever felt at the movies,2023-06-02
that whole reveal was so good you could tell something was up but you couldn’t put your finger on it miles prowler reaveal was cool af,2023-06-04
"the frame rate of the world around miles is different too

if i had to guess it’s probably around 42 frames a second",2023-06-02
i immediately noticed he was in the wrong universe when i saw his and rio’s eyes go from hazelbrown to green i knew something was off,2023-06-02
"i caught on when she said what did you do to your hair  


and the screen said earth42 before miles was teleported",2023-06-02
"i just realized what her “what did you do to your hair” line meant 

this movie has been stuck on me for the last 84 hours",2023-06-05
i actually caught that he was being sent to the wrong earth because it lingered on the screen showing earth42 and the movie made a point earlier of his spider being from there but then i doubted myself because it all seemed like he was in the right place with the scenes before and his talk with his mum,2023-06-08
im  to the mcu style of interjecting serious moments with jokes i really thought they were gonna go the joke route where his mom didnt know who spiderman is i didnt remember miles parents talked about spiderman in the first movie,2023-06-08
oh shoot,2023-06-02
realized something is wrong when the 42 popped up on the computer screen,2023-06-02
"my daughter and i caught that right away 

when they show original miles it had a different number and we both whisperedi thought he was 42 weird

then when they scanned miles and it said 42 i was like is that a mistake or and then my daughter was about to blurt out and i had to shush her",2023-06-02
i noticed the mums eyes were green instead of brown but as we had the colorful scene in gwens universe i thought miles was going to have an emotional scene too,2023-06-03
she had different color eyes than his actual mom right like the universe42 mom had green eyes but miless moms eyes were brown i think,2023-06-04
i hadnt picked it up yet at that point but that line caught me and actually shocked me that slow unveiling of where miles actually was and what was happening was so incredibly tense just super well done overall every single sign was there and yet i still didnt pick them up,2023-06-02
for me i knew something was up when gwen was hovering outside miles1610s window and i was like how the  isnt the mom noticing her wait,2023-06-02
i realized because he quickly goes past a times square billboard that says sony but into established that all the major brands have different names in miles universe,2023-06-13
not trying to be rude but how they showed the 42 very clearly multiple times then show the dna scan as 42 too,2023-06-02
for some reason my first thought was it was the effects of the no way home spell at first lol,2023-06-02
its okay miles didnt pick up the hints either,2023-06-06
i feel like such an idiot for just thinking his moms oblivious and only noticing when we see gwen go into his real room,2023-06-08
riiiiiiiiiight i was like noooooooo,2023-06-11
probably way too late to the party but another hint i noticed on my second viewing is that the mom’s eye colour is different as well they’re green in 42 and just regular brown in 6106,2023-06-14
when he started glitching i was like  and then uncle aaron came in and i was like oh  when i realized he was in the wrong universe cant believe i was so dense that i didnt realize he was in the wrong universe right from when his mom said whos spiderman lol,2023-06-19
see i lauged likehaha what a busy mom and then i got the wholeoh noooo,2023-06-25
you can also see designs for the prowler gloves hanging on the wall,2023-06-26
i just thought she was ,2023-06-03
best editing rugpull since silence of the lambs imo,2023-06-03
when rio asked miles if he changed his hair my brain subconsciously did a wait a minute took me a few seconds to figure it out,2023-06-03
i was confused too,2023-06-04
who’s spiderman,2023-06-05
the hair was the first major hint,2023-06-08
it’s funny because i caught it but still missed it when miles was leaving i saw it was set to earth 42 and thought “wait i thought he wasn’t from earth42 maybe i’m confused…” only to be shocked by the reveal,2023-06-10
seeing the different word over the head of his bed milk crates and punching bag immediately got me,2023-06-10
shouldnt the mom have said something about his hair being different,2023-06-11
you would have noticed it when the dna machine read him as 42 when he came from 1610 as stated in the intro,2023-06-11
"i saw that the machine scanned him as universe 42 and i thought it was an actual plothole or that i was confused about why the radioactive spider was tagged that way i shouldve known better with these writers d

i think his moms eyes were a different color in 42 as well they looked green in that scene and i knew they were brown at the beginning",2023-06-11
her eyes were green vs wart 616 rio’s hazel,2023-06-17
had a lokimobius moment,2023-06-22
i honestly just thought she didnt know somehow at first,2023-08-14
i noticed the punching bag in the room next to the door behind his mom first and was like huh,2023-11-16
that art style was one of my favorite parts of her comic series loved that they brought it into this movie,2023-06-02
its the robbie art from her initial run,2023-06-02
between the bagel and the blackwhite theming im getting a lot of everything everywhere all at once vibes from spot,2023-06-02
also having gwen telling it in a different way than normal is very jazzpunk,2023-06-02
the music when theyre realizing miles is in the wrong dimension is so good too,2023-06-02
gwen’s opening and resolution is what makes the “to be continued” okay it’s still a complete story there’s just more to tell,2023-06-02
every time miles mentions his dad and his mom reacts ,2023-06-02
has a decent shot of being nominated for best picture  i highly doubt it  thatd be cool but the academy doesnt even watch the animated movies  they just pick the ones their kids like the most lol,2023-06-02
unfortunately miles going to earth42 was given away before he teleported it popped up on the computer screen after reading his dna so the big “reveal” fell flat on my end,2023-06-04
"has a decent shot of being nominated for best picture

i think people are getting a bit ahead of themselves with that assertion 

loved the film but i probably wouldnt immediately think to label it as a best picture plus theres another 7 months of film releases",2023-06-02
right just to me now thinking about it the movie is flawless 1010 it 100 percent deserves to be nominated for best picture,2023-06-04
best plot twist ever that they literally spelled out on screen,2023-06-03
it was 100 gwens story thats why the cliffhanger is when it is her conflict was resolved both with her dad and finally finding her band,2023-06-26
one of the directors comparing it to empire a month or two ago was babe ruth called grand slam levels of take,2023-06-04
best cliffhanger ive ever seen the movie has you so immersed that you dont even feel like its about to end,2023-06-10
was actually looking out when miles was in the machine since i realized he is technically from two universes the console even says earth42,2023-06-06
deserves best cinematography too imo,2023-06-02
gwen taking hobies converse could have foreshadowed her deviating from the stories spiderpeople are meant to follow and her choosing her own path choosing to grow rather than isolate and stay alone is what led to her dad choosing her too and changing his fate,2023-06-19
spectacular is my firefly the one i always question what if,2023-06-02
spectacular spiderman being like four feet tall was hilarious,2023-06-02
hearing josh keaton and yuri lowenthal had me uncontrollably hyped,2023-06-02
"when his cameo comes on

youre as beautiful as the moment we lost you",2023-06-02
im pretty sure they also showed spectacular with captain stacy dying,2023-06-02
i noticed spectacular in the uncle ben clips right away and i started slapping the armrest of my seat next to my friend so i wasnt disturbing a random person lol when he actually showed up,2023-06-02
"if clone high can get another season after appearing in spiderverse then maybe…

just maybe……",2023-06-02
between this and suzume he’s having a great year movie wise good for him,2023-06-02
they’ll stick the landing no doubt in my mind,2023-06-02
replaying ffx right now couldnt agree more,2023-06-03
that moment wasnt actually in the series its a totally new moment of his captain dying chris miller stated like its a moment he imagined to happen in a s3 we never saw,2023-06-04
it totally reminds me of the final fantasy vii remake too for reasons that are better left unsaid let’s hope in both these trilogies that fighting destiny turns out better for these heroes than a lot of greek ones…,2023-06-02
what’s really cool is that captain stacy’s death hadn’t happened in the show yet so we got a bit of a taste of the seasons we never got,2023-06-03
"seeing spectacular spiderman get the recognition is deserves love to see it they actually gave josh keaton some lines and used one it’s episodes during the uncle ben segment

ive been scrolling for ages looking for this spectacular remains one of the best iterations of spiderman ever and my only concrete hope going into this was that he would show up bot only did he but they gave him a full proper cameo  incredible",2023-06-05
final fantasy 10 and this is the 10th theatrical spiderman movie thats a cool coincidence,2023-06-03
i already like miles obviously but this movie endeared him even more having him go against all the spiders just for his father i guess that means they wont  him after all this right but what about the stability of the dimension,2023-06-02
was superior spiderman the only one missing if so i understand why,2023-06-02
of course they will stick the landing its spiderman,2023-06-04
when it was originally announced that sony was going to be making an animated spiderman movie my first thought went to hoping it was a spectacular spiderman sequel,2023-06-04
i did wish we got some ultimate spiderman too loved drake bell in that,2023-06-03
"actuallly to me that made me dislike miles its not like he was just told of something that could happen he was shown how billions of people were erased from reality because of interferance and then he has a tantrum while not wanting to be called a kid guy is 15 ffs i actually though he was in college like 1718 and his reaction is  it im doing my own thing because i will not be told what to do  after what he withnessed 

 i hope the twist is saving his dad causes his mom to die he auntie ben herself with that rooftop speech",2023-06-05
seeing my boy spectacular made my year i knew he was going to be in there but i still lit right the  when he appeared,2023-06-12
" ive never been to a movie before where a full theatre started screaming in pain at the same time
 
 ive always wondered what it would have been like to see empire strikes back its first night in theatres now i feel like i got a part of that

yeah we got a bit of that with infinity war but i think a lot more people realized that one was a part one of two then they did with this one",2023-06-02
yup empire strikes back is a great comparison i didnt realize this was planned as a part 1 but when the twist happened i knew we were likely ending on a cliffhanger,2023-06-02
an indian here the first time i experienced this was during baahubali the beginning in theatres there was such a loud what from the audience after it ended on a massive cliffhanger,2023-06-02
i must have been the only person excited by the cliffhanger i let out a quiet  yeah and it seemed like a lot of people laughed,2023-06-02
"my  theater handled it pretty well  a few people seemed shocked but most of the audience must have known this was part one of a twopart story

the bagel callback mrs chen andrew garfield donald glover and playstation spiderman caused eruptions from the crowd  tobey maguire surprisingly didnt get as much of a reaction",2023-06-03
i saw it in 1980 without knowing about “i am your father” and i remember being shocked when it ended that they didn’t win and get more medals melted my 9 year old brain,2023-06-04
i swear the only time i felt such a visceral reaction to an ending was for infinity war i wish i could have a time machine or fast forward button to march 2024,2023-06-03
last time i heard a similar reaction was one of my first viewings of fellowship of the ring there were several people in my cinema not familiar with the book and didnt know it was going to be a trilogy,2023-06-05
"its my earliest memory  i was two i know i know i shouldnt have any memory of that but i do  

it was like seeing a 30 foot tall probe droid burn itself onto your brain and being terrified 

i know thats not what you meant but there ya go",2023-06-02
i think its a great comparison itsv feels a lot like a new hope self contained basically perfect film while this felt like empire strikes back continues and build on story arguably superior in every way leads to the finale,2023-06-04
screaming in pain,2023-06-02
our cinema let out a collective sigh when the “to be continued” rolled followed quickly by a long round of applause which i haven’t seen in a cinema since maybe endgame,2023-06-03
"oh for esb wed all read the books and knew  yoda voice there was another yoda voice

still was fun thoughand it also ends kind of abruptly now that i think about it",2023-06-03
i was young at the time but i remember seeing empire with my dad and i remember the theater just going super quiet at that part,2023-06-11
if you liked this you should definitely check out irreversible,2023-06-12
i want to visit that place again,2023-06-04
everyone in my theater screamed “noooo” collectively,2023-06-02
i was looking for that collectible during the whole wrong universe reveal but didn’t see it,2023-06-04
i audibly gasped and winced that was painful to watch,2023-06-05
made me love gwen even more so  perfect,2023-06-05
oof that hurt,2023-06-04
j jonah jameson is a nexus being confirmed,2023-06-02
it’s genuinely hilarious how jk simmons is now pretty much the sole jjj,2023-06-02
jk simmons as jjj is the reference point from which all other universes diverge he is the constant,2023-06-02
the power of the multiverse in the palm of my hand,2023-06-02
i think i also heard his voice in earth 42 he is a multiversal constant,2023-06-02
jjj is the stan lee for the spiderverse,2023-06-02
"they correctly realized as have so many others that literally nobody else can ever play jjj  
  
you can recast tony stark easier than you can jsquared",2023-06-12
gonna be good for drinking games,2023-06-02
oh we happy,2023-06-03
they had mayor jameson in one of the universes iirc,2023-06-03
tomorrow spiderman on the front page with a decent picture this time love that callback to the original m,2023-06-04
"being spiderman makes canon events happen is my guess

it doesnt matter that miles wasnt supposed to be spiderman but the fact that he is does

his peter very likely had a canon event maybe even miles universes gwen",2023-06-02
while miles is the original anomaly it corrected itself peter parker dying and he started going through the same canon events every spiderman goes through however anomalies started happening afterwards anyway which was the whole point miguel starting the spider society miles is essentially trying to create another anomaly by saving his dad and breaking the canon which would probably destroy his universe and spread to the others the supervillain doing all of this also having dimension hopping powers also doesnt help,2023-06-02
"probably an anomaly that would open up more anomalies 

miguel might just be theorising and overthinking",2023-06-02
"miguel isnt right hes assuming a lot and theyre working on predictive algorithms for whats superbad and whats just maybe a problem

could be that its canon could be not they cant risk it or thats their logic anyway",2023-06-02
"i think thats purposefully ambigious
a big theme of the movie is trust in the system vs trying a new way

the system may not be the best to live it but it works for now though its getting worse and its a shame some people have to die and suffer but thats the cost of stability you could shelter a kid and control their life

or you can try something new what if people didnt have to die what if you let your kid go and explore and grow is it risky yes but the alternative is passively letting bad things happen when you have the power to stop them

it also plays into miguels questionable motives the 3 statements
miles isnt a spiderman because he is an anomaly
spidermen not having their canon events breaks reality
miles stopping what looks like his canon event will destroy his world because he is a spiderman
all of them cant all be 100 true",2023-06-03
i figured that he wouldn’t be able to stop his dad’s death which would be the canon event and so they didn’t want to invite him to the society to let everything happen naturally however once miles figured it all out at the society they had to keep him behind because otherwise he would go home and save his dad as he did in the movie so that’s why he wasn’t allowed to join but then wasn’t allowed to leave after that,2023-06-02
like mama rio says dont let anyone tell you you dont belong,2023-06-02
"a lot of poor logic in miguels part this was bugging me in the theater miguel showing miles the death of his uncle aaron in the line of canon events then showing that death of the captains are also canon events for some and finally implying that since miles dad is going to be captain he will die 

dont the spiderman gets one death of the closed one as a canon event 

was upset that it would not be explained but now there is a possibility that miguel is assuming a lot and we get next movie it could work out actually",2023-06-02
i kind of assumed that the main reason he wasnt allowed to join was because gwen and peter b wanted to spare him the foreknowledge of his dad dying,2023-06-02
it might be because his dad was always destined to become captain whether miles or peter was spiderman,2023-06-03
i assume because the canon events happen to whomever spiderman in that universe is,2023-06-02
miguel is overthinking,2023-06-03
he was not originally supposed to be spiderman but he is now him becoming spiderman is what killed his uncle and will in theory  his dad,2023-06-04
"loved the movie but can someone explain to me if miles was an anomaly how is his dad a canon level event or why did that matter that was the only thing that confused me he wasn’t allowed to join the society for that reason but then when he was there wasn’t allowed to leave  

its a contradiction and i suspect its because 99s interpretation of canon events will turn out to be wrong",2023-06-04
also if he is not a spiderman then why his father is a cop what sort of coincidence is this,2023-06-09
had the same question  i have a feeling this will be key in the next film honestly,2023-06-09
was that ever explicitly stated i think miles just assumed that,2023-06-02
i think that was lie as an excuse to contain the real problem was his existence,2023-06-04
i think that’s how it gets resolved in beyond  it’s not a canon event,2023-06-05
"he was never supposed to be spiderman since his world already has peter parker spot pulled the 42spider through which bit spiderman miles instead of prowler miles which leaves 42 without spiderman 

the whole deal with miles’s dad is that they tried to keep him there so he wouldn’t save his dad which is a canon event that every spiderman went through loss of a loved one which is  because miles has already gotten his canon moment aka aaron’s death in the last movie",2023-06-11
not sure you’re remembering two towers well which ended with the heroes in a huge victory giving them hope to actually save middle earth gollum turning evil again was very vague of a cliffhanger rather than the bluntness of spiderverse,2023-06-03
great comp first one was perfect second one somehow incredibly matched or exceeded third one best picture,2023-06-02
two towers didnt end so abruptly though least to me i never felt the sharp disappointment of a cliffhanger when it came out but i was also a lot younger in 2002 vs 2023,2023-06-02
two towers has one of the greatest climaxes in any movie and had a complete beginningmiddleend structure i dont think this movie really compares its more like deathly hallows part 1 or the hobbit part 1,2023-06-08
but ends like return of the king where it ends and then had another ending and then another ending,2023-06-03
in the end the lotr trilogy might be a good comp for overall trilogy quality assuming beyond is just as good,2023-06-04
this was more like deathly hallows part 1 it was still great,2023-06-04
yes,2023-06-26
i figured something live action was coming after that spot scene but donald glover prowler was at the bottom of my list,2023-06-02
this and the spiderman ps4 references were so  cool,2023-06-02
guess he was plucked straight from the hollandverse,2023-06-02
completely out of left field and a great cameo to have him with his nephew,2023-06-02
i got so excited in the theatre and i think i was the only one who showed a reaction ,2023-06-02
the way he stared at miles for a second was a really nice touch after the whole “donald for spiderman” thing back in the day plus him literally being the main inspiration for the miles morales character,2023-06-02
"donald for spid…

 it at least we’re got the 6 seasons and the movie",2023-06-02
"the layers behind this easter egg is just insane

the fact that donald glovers character in community the scene of him wearing a spiderman outfit was the inspiration for why brian michael bendis created miles morales years later donald glover then voiced miles morales in ultimate spiderman then even more years later donald glover was cast as aaron davis in the mcu but now in across the spiderverse he makes a cameo as the prowler and we even get a version of prowler thats miles morales 

its all connected literally full circle",2023-06-02
i didn’t get the reference can anyone eli5 why this is a big deal i have zero history on this or prowler or why donald glover showing up here was such a big deal,2023-06-02
hypo hustler movie hopefully confirmed  he’s gonna be prowler,2023-06-02
okay so since hes like the prowler are we to assume that like the miles in the mcu is probably about 13 idk if they say when aaron davis starts doing the prowler thing but is the implication there somehow am i just insane probably,2023-06-02
someone in the theater legit said  thats michael b jordan facepalm,2023-06-02
so many people in my audience audibly shocked i could not believe it come to the mcu please,2023-06-02
well mcu miles morales coming soon,2023-06-02
i didn’t understand that i knew i missed something from the audience reaction could you explain it please,2023-06-02
"my jaw dropped when he popped up on the screen 

some of the people around me didnt get the reference to my disappointment",2023-06-03
i wonder if hes the og from 199999 or a variant,2023-06-03
was so happy when he showed up man i love me some  lover,2023-06-04
i know right i feel like i was the only one in my theater who got the reference yeah i am the annoying dude that gasps loudly,2023-06-11
i just saw it today and a little girl maybe 8or9 behind me said out loud its post malone the entire theater lost it,2023-06-21
maybe i’m alone here but i hated the inclusion of the live action charactersshots completely took me out of it,2023-06-02
 i wish i didnt open this thread right before watching the movie,2023-06-02
just a full on  yeah,2023-06-02
its made even greater because its foreshadowing the twist in the end,2023-06-02
the live action stuff in this movie was so good,2023-06-02
could also be miles,2023-06-03
after all these years confirmed,2023-06-03
it felt like a spongebob squarepants episode with how surreal it was,2023-06-03
so the real question is is he 616s prowler after encountering tom,2023-06-03
i didn’t even realize this was an mcu connection holy  i forgot all about that,2023-06-03
 i didn’t realize until the end that glover actually is his universe’s miles and not aaron,2023-06-04
" donald glover 

 i was  shock when they showed him",2023-06-04
that venome universe lady too,2023-06-04
he was everything,2023-06-05
boooo,2023-06-18
thank  i had a digital copy because i watched and rewinded that so many times,2023-09-03
marvel’s phase 4 has been… unfortunate,2023-06-02
"if only marvel just went balls to wall with the
multiverse instead of saving it forthe avengers movie which comes out at the end…of the multiverse saga",2023-06-02
"i think there is very specifically a marvelcinematic universe fatigue that hasnt been helped out at all by the last year or two being pretty mid

its been 15 years of this paradigmformula and audiences just arent as excited",2023-06-02
"dcs best recent movie is joker so im told i havent yet seen it which is nothing like the mcu  sonys best spiderman movies have been the spiderverse ones which are nothing like the mcu  

theres a lesson there and while were at it sony pictures animation seems to do its best work when its not trying to make disneydreamworksstyle family films",2023-06-03
"i did have fun with it but i was just thinking that this last week

i think if the entire two movies were just his daily life as a drama theyd actually be more touching than a superhero story",2023-06-02
"watching gotg vol 3 and following that with across the spiderverse gave me the giddy happy feeling i had in phase 3

dc still feels the same tho unfortunately",2023-06-03
"theres such a thing as going out on a high note endgame should have been just that

you could bring back superhero movies in a decade or so with some fresh ideas but all the big stars are gone all the emotions are gone the story is told close the book and move on",2023-06-04
yep watching guardians 3 and atsv month after month has hammered down the fact that people myself included just have lazy crappy movie fatigue and not superhero fatigue,2023-06-05
"big agree i was done with mcu after how much i didnt care for end game the spiderverse movies give me a sense of wonder and joy i thought i had lost

if beyond the spiderverse knocks it out of the park this will hands down be the best trilogy of all time for me",2023-06-04
especially when they try something new i thought for sure that captain stacy or captain lieutenant morales were gonna die in the movie like in the opening action sequences or some point at the end but the fact that the movie was about that very fact that all these spiderman stories must play out the same way and that the plot of the movie was fighting that canon amazing,2023-06-08
" i am just sick of bad marvel and dc films

i dont have super hero movie fatigue i have marvel formula fatigue never changing the status quo except ironically in spiderman nwh another spiderman movie  anything post 2014 marvel the winter soldier guardians of the galaxy is alright and anything after infinity warendgame is really mah save for nwh  playing everything too safe status quo unchanged no repercussion no consequences really annoying and uninspired very sterile and too safe

nbsp

and dc well dc movies just  80 of the time cant wait for the full universe reboot",2023-06-12
marvel’s recent movies don’t even feel like superhero movies the characters aren’t heroic antman and thor are jokes doctor strange is a  this movie actually felt heroic,2023-06-10
ill support this take,2023-06-03
everyone else here is talking about how excited they are this this will be integrated into the mcu and i cannot express enough just how much i dont want that i gave up with mcu almost a decade ago and spiderverse had me so excited for a superhero film for the first time in years i just want the third one to be a good ending to a trilogy i dont want forced tie ins or mcu teases just make a kickass third act,2023-06-14
i don’t like super heroes in general like even the widely acclaimed insominac spiderman games doesn’t catch me but these movies however makes me hooked from start to finish,2023-06-11
same wasn’t really that interested in going to see this one but i’m glad i did pacing and story kept me interested for full 2 hours i can’t last live action superhero movie that did that,2023-06-03
that’s what my wife and i said after we left please do more of this type of stuff,2023-06-03
people like new stuff if you show em old beats they get bored usually,2023-06-04
i watched guardians and hated it lol,2023-06-10
 what an original comment we got over here,2023-06-03
here  the anti mcu circle  on rmovies  im surprised its down this far,2023-06-14
quite honestly going back i dont know how i missed that it wasnt miless universe,2023-07-01
missed that so many great little details,2023-06-29
yes i could especially barely understand anything during gwens opening section i also could barely understand spiderpunk because his levels were low,2023-06-02
i thought i was going crazy you could barely hear the dialogue hopefully its fixed soon for a rewatch,2023-06-02
yeah right from the opening with gwen narrating over her drumming i did a doubletake and was like uh why is she so quiet it was even worse during fight scenes it didnt necessarily impact my enjoyment of the movie all that much but i definitely look forward to rewatching it with subtitles,2023-06-02
i noticed that too from what i’m told there was a memo sent out to raise the audio for this specific movie that i guess our theatres didn’t get p,2023-06-02
yeah gwen’s opening monologue is pretty indecipherable not sure how that got approved,2023-06-02
i thought i needed to get my hearing checked at the beginning,2023-06-02
spiderpunk was the worst offender for me seemed like an awesome character but i heard like 3 of his lines,2023-06-02
yes but it seemed to improve as the movie went on the first scenes were definitely low though,2023-06-02
the movie was shipped with specific instructions to crank up to volume some projectionists might not be paying attention,2023-06-02
"yeah a lot of the times throughout the film for me


couldnt hear gwen at the start nor could i hear what the indian spiderman was sayingand it wasnt just because his accent his whole volume was almost nonexistent",2023-06-02
good to know it’s not my hearing going as soon as it was over i was saying how im buying it day 1 to rewatch at home with subtitles,2023-06-02
could not hear the majority of indian and british spiderman’s lines,2023-06-02
"yeah the sound mixing was extremely quiet everyone in the cinema had to be silent or you couldnt hear anything couldnt hear gwens speech either like you said 

multiple people complained afterwards and the cinema said they think its an issue with the mix 

gonna watch it in imax again on the weekend to see if thats any more audible",2023-06-02
it was so bad ruined the experience for me a bit needless to say i will watch it again with subs on,2023-06-02
our dialog was barely audible at the beginning a few minutes in i went out and found an usher and told him the sound was too low he said they’d fix it and that they’d been having issues with sound on this film it took a few minutes but eventually the volume did get louder still never a good mix though but at least i could hear what they were saying,2023-06-02
i did notice that the audio mix was a bit wonky and i even saw it in a dolby theater  it didnt take me out of the movie though i grew accustomed to it after a while,2023-06-02
yea mine was very quite too kinda made me a little upset because i thought the theatre was  up but it sounds like it was just the way it was made,2023-06-02
yep i went and told one of the employees my theater was too quiet haha,2023-06-02
the gwen drumming intro was especially bad with this but the rest of the movie sounded fine,2023-06-02
"watched in cinemark xd and had the same issues with dialogue volume straight up couldnt hear certain parts when the music was going at the same time 

nothing experience ruining but a mild annoyance at times absolutely beautiful movie all the way through otherwise",2023-06-02
"agreed about the sound mixing

i actually work at the cinema where i saw the film so i figured someone hadnt set the playlist up right and the dolby atmos hadnt kicked in making all the sound feel flat and omnidirectional went and checked the projector and the sound stack to realize its just the way the film had been mixed

but it made gwens opening monologue spiderpunk and a few scenes in the spider society really hard to hear  especially with a sold out screen of people munching on popcorn and slurping on drinks",2023-06-02
if there was ever a movie theater film that needed subtitles i feel it was definitely this one as soon as gwen started talking over those drums i had no idea what she was saying,2023-06-02
yes incredibly frustrating but i’m so glad it wasn’t just my  amc will be seeing it again,2023-06-02
"glad i found your comment my local movie theater isnt the best as theyve had a lot of audiovideo issues before i was totally blaming them my girlfriend was the first to notice even though she almost never notices audio issues

but we already noticed it during the trailers maybe that was just my theater",2023-06-02
saw it at the alamo and couldnt hear a  thing they were saying for most of the movie,2023-06-02
"wait thats so weird i thought the exact opposite it felt like the score was so quiet to the point that i thought an audio channel may have been broken in my dolby screening i expected more boom from the music 

im planning to see it again on a different screen i guess ill see if it was just my screen or not

update imax audio on my rewatch was much louder and better imo i really liked the movie on first viewing but loved it on the second viewing",2023-06-02
i didnt catch one thing that spiderpunk said to which miles responded what and was explained but that was about it,2023-06-02
wow thought it was just me,2023-06-02
i definitely noticed it too could barely make out the stuff spider punk was saying,2023-06-02
thank you for noticing too someone messed up on the mixing  not only in the beginning but a few more points throughout were very noticeable especially during high action scenes with one liners over the musicsound effects,2023-06-02
i actually went down to the theater workers and told them i think somethings wrong they didnt fix it,2023-06-02
wow i went to a new theater and thought it was them it was a huge screen but i wasnt being punched by the sound like it should have been sucks this might be how the film is mixed because you dont start a film off with drums bashing a beat and it sounding like it doesnt matter,2023-06-02
yeah i saw it in dolby and it was way too low only negative when seeing it,2023-06-02
bro yes thought it was my drummer ears finally getting to me glad it wasn’t just me the mixing was off as  music was way too loud,2023-06-02
spiderpunk was pretty hard to make out,2023-06-02
yeah the mixing was awful,2023-06-02
yes it was bad so bad that i was like “i think i loved it i’ll have to watch it at home with subtitles to be really sure”,2023-06-02
i thought it was just the cinema screen i was watching it on crazy to hear lots of others have had this issue with the movie the sound mixing was atrocious loud music muted explosions  almost monolike dialogue strange,2023-06-02
more attention needs to be drawn to this  everything about the movie was top tier except for the fact i could barely hear gwen or spiderpunk which was really distracting,2023-06-03
oh  my local amc dolby atmos theater showing had audio issues in the beginning sounded way too quiet for a theater experience,2023-06-02
yes the sound was really low but i thought it was just my theatre,2023-06-02
just the first scene with gwen narrating while drumming  got maybe half of her lines no problem at all with the rest of the movie,2023-06-02
i wasnt noticing it by the end  or even less than a halfhour in really  but the opening was absolutely much quieter than reasonable lasted all of gwens intro and much of reintro to miles as well,2023-06-02
definitely it was harder to hear the characters with thick accents will have to watch it again with subtitles in the future,2023-06-02
yup i was thinking why tf is it so hard to hear what gwen was saying in the opening scene it got better but it sounds like it was poor mixing in production,2023-06-02
yes and once again with most modern movies the audio mixing in general is bad for actually hearing dialogue hopefully they can patch the movie cant believe that is thing that happens now so that the audio is better,2023-06-02
saw it in dolby and the volume was very low in the beginning which is super weird for dolby stepped out and asked guest services if volume could be raised and when i sat back down it sounded much better,2023-06-02
"yea  my theater is actually usually pretty good for audio but for some reason it was tough to pick out the dialogue i’m wondering if it’s actually the movie maybe it was just mixed for imax and sent to everyone 


i don’t know",2023-06-03
bruhhh same with methought i my ears are bad when gwen started narrating over the drums in the opening i was like raise the volume,2023-06-03
i could not hear the ben reilly dialogue in his first appearance,2023-06-03
saw this in imax and thought the same great movie but i had trouble understanding some of the characters not just spiderpunk,2023-06-03
yes thought it was just me,2023-06-02
i did too i thought it was exclusive to my cinema i’m friends with one of the managers at my local cinema and they came in to check and asked me if the audio was okay it got boosted a couple minutes later,2023-06-02
the entire movie gwen at the beginning punk throughout miles on 2099 universe super annoying,2023-06-02
okay it wasnt just me dialogue was super low under the music,2023-06-03
i saw it in dolby atmos with subtitles and it was awesome i didnt notice anything,2023-06-09
i saw it in dolby atmos with subtitles and it was awesome i didnt notice anything,2023-06-09
"im starting to think there is an epidemic of poor hearing 

every single time i have gone to see a movie people say this about i have not had that problem yes this is anecdotal yes there are countless reasons why 

but i have a hard time believing that these movies mixing from the studios are being released in such a broken manner why good question its not like there arent examples all over of poor decisions by businesses so its definitely possible its negligence 

but especially in an animated film where the production has complete control over it

not trying to say you are wrong or anything its certainly not your fault",2023-06-02
same odd sound mixing choices must’ve been in the movie then,2023-06-02
sometimes this happens depending on where youre sitting in the theater this time i was close to the front and felt like the voices were too low in other movies when i sit more centered and further back the sound mixing isnt as noticeable,2023-06-02
same here,2023-06-02
weirdly mine did as well more so to begin with as it went on thankfully it stopped being an issue,2023-06-02
for sure i think it got a little better after the start but it would dip,2023-06-02
same here,2023-06-02
was quiet in mine super wejrd,2023-06-02
oh   i complained to my cinema and got my money back for this i thought they had  up the audio,2023-06-02
went to an imax screening and it was slightly blurry and had the same issue as you unfortunately,2023-06-02
glad it wasn’t just me i’m planning to rewatch in imax now hah,2023-06-02
ohh i thought it was just my cinema i missed half of what she was saying,2023-06-02
yes this was my only complaint i missed some of gwen’s dialogue because of the mixing,2023-06-02
my only issue with the film the audio was a little too low sometimes and some characters spoke a little too fast during action sequences not helped by the loud clashing of buildings tearing apart and and people screaming but like other than that it was perfect,2023-06-02
yup,2023-06-02
yeah i was wondering if it was a cinema problem or a movie problem but it didnt affect my enjoyment,2023-06-02
dolby cinema was great today,2023-06-02
i couldn’t hear most of the beginning over the guy next to me chewing so loud on his popcorn,2023-06-02
yes but good thing i work in a movie theater so i knew where to make it louder,2023-06-02
mine definitely did particularly and unfortunately during the intro gwen lines and the run up to the end also gwen lines,2023-06-03
yeah i experienced the same i thought it was just our theater  up,2023-06-03
it was mainly just miguel who was doing the blaming and the biggest reason was that he blamed miles for the supercollider fracturing the multiverse in the first place ie in miguels eyes blondepeter died because he was distracted trying to save miles instead of destroying the device,2023-06-02
yeah miguel was being such a  did he not realise that miles was just an innocent kid who was at the right place at the right time if anything they should be blaming the spot for bringing the spider there in the first place,2023-06-02
i sorta think that but also i think its more that they realize that now that he is an anomaly him not understanding the gravity of his choices affects them all and since they all suffered similar fates they all want to save what little they have left,2023-06-02
because from their point of view miles is an anomaly responsibility has nothing to do with it its more of a your whole existence is a mistake its not your fault but you better listen to us kid or ill slam you into a train to the moon,2023-06-02
"i adored this movie but it definitely did a thing i hate in movies where two characters have a misunderstnding and instead of explainig or asking questions they just fight

when spot first revealed how miles created him no one asks why he was even there everyone else had evacuated how was miles supposed to know no one pointed that out

or no one explained why they didnt tell miles he was an anamoly maybe dont mention the dad but if they had explained to him the spiderverse maybe he wouldnt have recklesly followed gwen

theres a few moments that dont break the film but they bother me",2023-06-06
i dont think they blame him for being bitten by a spider from another dimension or else they wouldnt let him continue on in his own world while they clean up all the anomaly mess themselves it wasnt until miles entered into their hq that he heard about the canon events and refused to go along with it for miguel to really lay into miles personally for being the original anomaly no one blamed miles for being the original anomaly but he was threatening everything they all were working so hard for so long for which is an understandable reason to be upset,2023-06-06
my theory is that the spider that bit miles was supposed to bite miguel who is not actually a spiderman the whole “blame miles” bs is just a cover,2023-06-03
it caused so many problems they do not care lol,2023-06-02
the beginning was weirdly quiet for me volume seemed to ramp up after the opening but gwens opening definitely seemed quiet for a movie in a theater,2023-06-02
every single line spiderpunk had gonna have to rewatch with subtitles when the 4k comes out,2023-06-03
not just you others here including myself had the same experience,2023-06-02
had this experience as well my daughter and i both looked at each other confused it was so quiet,2023-06-03
it was muddled but a part of me wants to believe they mixed it rhat way on purpose to show how the music is so loud its over her own thoughts,2023-06-02
apparently this is an issue with a lot of peoples theaters so youre not alone,2023-06-05
tons of people here have mentioned weird audio levels i could barely hear it too,2023-06-10
"yeah i was at the alamo drafthouse in la and they didn’t even get it right i was really hoping after this movie had been out for a week they would do it right i heard the responsibility falls on the theater

and if that movie theater made for cinefiles in a city made for cinefiles can’t get it right i can’t even imagine what it must sound like another theaters across the nation",2023-06-16
happened to my theater as well,2023-07-16
the colors changing in the background between her and her dad to reflect the tension and mood was impeccable,2023-06-02
and you could see drips in the background as she was getting emotional at the dad hug holy  the level of detail was amazing,2023-06-03
also how they merged into pinkishpurple after they figured things out was a nice touch,2023-06-22
i genuinely think the stuff he was stealing was to build the watch he gave gwen at the end but i could also be mistaken i never saw the one he had originally but as far as i can tell miguel made them standard design for everyone but it played so nicely into his character he could have just been rebelling against the system,2023-06-02
im waiting for those youtube videos that point out all the tiny details because theres no way i can catch everything even in a second watch lol,2023-06-02
"i actually saw a little black kid taking a super proud picture in front of the spiderman poster and telling his dad “i wanna be like spiderman” and it was so  cute to see a real life example of what representation in a super hero universe means

it was really cool to see",2023-06-03
‘puerto rican’ pls say sike ,2023-06-06
yeah as soon as i saw it i knew i would have to watch in theatres again and then the minute it is streaming im gonna watch it so carefully it will take me forever with how much i wanna pause and just look at frame after frame,2023-06-02
one of the details i noticed was that in mumbattan the onomatopoeia was in hindi,2023-06-10
"i have seen the movie 3 times and what i love about spiderpunk stealing stuff you can see one scene where miles actually takes one of the pieces spiderpunk was stealing from his hands and places it on the table and immediately spiderpunk swipes it back and pockets it

loved spiderpunk so much",2023-06-18
hobie and rocket need to team up and start an anarchist weapons collective,2023-06-03
"oh its entirely that criticism

 its a critique of the whole superhero genre and its refusal to change the status quo",2023-06-02
"what i find funny about this message is that out of eight live action films only one of them explored peters greatest tragedy outside of uncle ben gwens death  and altered it so much that it didnt have the impact it was meant to on his character 

im a big fan of miles new storyline and the fight against a pattern but a small part of me will always want that bridge scene to be faithfully adapted",2023-06-02
miguel might as well have said hey miles have you ever heard of spider totems morlun the inheritors well that  was in the comics and that means its sacred,2023-06-02
"felt more like a criticism of the fandom to me people wanting spiderman to be one thing one type of guy 

considering how many chuds refuse to even acknowledge miles as spiderman because of his ethnicity and background this felt like a direct attack against that thinking 

and then the main spiderpeople featured in this being an english black man a hispanic man an indian teen a white woman and then a black woman peter b parker was the only main spiderpersom to fall into the archetypal parker",2023-06-03
i think reading it as a critique is a mistake it’s metafiction it’s acknowledging how things are structured and deconstructing it but that doesn’t mean the message is that the structure is poor,2023-06-02
of course if you look closely it was in one of the pictures during the exposition the movie also implied that one of the canon events was peter marrying mary jane,2023-06-02
"your post just triggered something in my brain

the cabin in the woods is to horror movies as across the spiderverse is to spiderman stories",2023-06-03
the only difference here is that miguels motivation is due to seeing a whole world cease to exist watching his daughter die in his arms made his path for him,2023-06-02
"when miguel was telling miles how the spider that bit him was from another universe and he wasn’t supposed to be spiderman and was in fact depriving earth 42 of their own spiderman i couldn’t help but wonder if this was the writers way of touching on the racist criticism people had of miles morales when he first premiered in the comics

just so many mentions of miguel saying “you’re not supposed to be here you don’t belong here” kind of gave off that vibe to me i’m probably reading more into this than i should but i wonder if anybody else got that interpretation",2023-06-04
"i would not be surprised if this is also a reflection of what happens to a spiderman comic when the publisher cancels that serialization it is not just the fault of the writers that many of those comics have the same story beats the readers also expect that kind of dramatic origin story and if they dont get it they stop buying the comics destroying that universe

it is a bit of a fourthwall breaking slap to the audience who were also looking forward to the same canon events in the previous movie but after seeing what phil lord and christopher miller did in the lego movie i would not put it past them",2023-06-03
feels super apt for a miles morales story too,2023-06-02
they absolutely cooking,2023-06-02
mayday is a miracle baby the miracle that peter can have a happy timeline,2023-06-04
"when the superior spiderman was a thing i thought to myself imagine if peter parker was dead and otto was spiderman from now on imagine if spiderman was a villain in the comics from this day forward comic books can actually have a drastic effect on american pop culture with that one move after a while if they stick with it

that wouldve been really interesting because itd start in the comics and eventually be in tv shows then movies etc",2023-06-03
taking into account how the current comics are going it couldnt have come at a better time,2023-06-03
" spiderman must never change you have to follow the same beats” is a direct reflection of the writers who keep dragging peter back from anything different new and exciting

and it works doubly well because even though these are miles movies the middleaged burnout peter b parker is both the most relatable and the most admirable peter parker i can remember though ive only dabbled in the comics largely because hes so different from previous portrayals and that difference is largely whats a logical place for this decenthearted superpowered basket case to end up at if we ever let him stop being a wisecracking youth",2023-06-14
"it is clear as day that this entire trilogy is miles variant of the traditional spiderman story

miles makes this clear by saying he is tired of everyone telling him what his story needs to be and hops off into earth42",2023-06-02
oh that’s 100 it when miguel is talking about canon moments it shows the wedding issue that’s a big middle finger consider it’s reverse i’d consider the worstcontroversial spidey story ever,2023-06-04
i’m not even comic reader and i’m waiting on those cowards to undo one more day…,2023-06-04
i had taken it as a critique of foamer fans who get outraged at those few adaptations that do deviate from the canon but your take is way better,2023-06-03
we don’t spend any significant time with even one person named peter parker for at least the first hour of the movie if not more they’re definitely trying to emphasize the nonpeter spidermen or to your point the ones who don’t completely follow the same beats,2023-06-05
"even the mcu spiderman went for the backdoor with the aunt may version of exactly the same storyline

plus the spidershrink deadpanning let me guess your uncle ben died",2023-06-08
the fact they have mayday in the movie makes that clear,2023-06-02
this is a nice interpretation,2023-06-05
dont forget ben reillys whole thing of digging in to his angsty memories chasm,2023-06-07
mind blown,2023-06-03
very cabin in the woods,2023-06-03
maybe its just a good movie why does everything have to be a criticism of something else,2023-06-18
i see how you see that but i always view it as rules for time travel in which there are certain events that need to happen for a world to exist you can try and change the event from happening but time will fight back and correct itself sorta like steins gate,2023-06-03
"irony is they still have the peter parker in miles verse die along with his uncle basically giving him his own speech so o actually can’t take it that seriously considering they flopped at this regardless because there is still clearly a “cannon” moment that allows him to be spiderman funny commentary but an arguably failed one and this isn’t even a spidey thing all heroes all have some “cannon” event that has to happen in order for them to become who they are

so if they technically wanted to tell a message to make future spiderman films move for the “better” they failed because they retold that same story in the first one still a solid movie tho just don’t think any comic book writer is gonna take this meta commentary seriously nor would i blame them tbh",2023-06-03
its soooo meta,2023-06-05
"it really did feel like south park in terms of how it made fun of both sides of the spiderman “editorial vs fandom” clash through the canon events and miles being classified as an “anomaly” but instead of wringing the most humor that it can out of this concept like south park does they use that information to add more nuance to the actions of the main characters and to the overall concept of spiderman it also feels more subtle

tldr matt and trey walked so that lord and miller could run",2023-06-06
reminds me of the cabin in the woods,2023-06-06
i remember when they made peter forget about mj like for real it was reported in the newspaper lol spidey can’t catch a break,2023-06-07
hah  i was focused on miguel telling miles he didnt belong and got his peter killed and how it was probably a metacommentary on fan reception when miles morales was first introduced but the rest you brought up is so obvious in hindsight,2023-06-10
"just watched the film yesterday and it may be my favorite movie in 40 years of cinema but i have a question and i cant find the answer so im just going to ask you random internet stranger

why did miles have to lose his dad or gwen hers didnt miles  already lose his uncle and prowler miles lost his father gwen lost peter why was that a canon event seemed like they all already sacrificed someone of import

im sure im missing the obvious but i need someone to clear this up so this film can be the perfect masterpiece for me it clearly is",2023-06-25
they even showed the wedding that led to one of the most hated comics of all time didnt they when they had that little triplepicture and showed spiderpunk leaving his outfit in the dumpster,2023-06-27
paul hasn’t arrived in peter b’s universe to cuck him yet,2023-06-04
cucked by paul is crazy,2023-06-05
maybe you know the answer to this question didnt peter b and mary jane were divorced as shown in the previous movie so we should assume they got back together,2023-06-05
why are you acting like peter didnt marry to mj before one more day happened did you ever read comics before dude lol,2023-06-04
"it felt long but not in a bad way 

i really didnt want it to stop at all",2023-06-04
when the major plot gets revealed near the end i was dreading the to be continued text and hoping they reveal more before cutting the movie,2023-06-03
felt long to me but i was fine with it and still need more,2023-06-05
"it felt long to me still loved it

knowing that it was a part 1 there were so many points at which i thought “so this is the cliffhanger” and then it just kept going with even more lol",2023-06-05
it felt long in the final act there were three different scenes that couldve been the ending,2023-06-11
in hindsight i think the amount of hype about the length was totally done to help pull off the cliffhanger twist they knew they had a 2 and a half hour movie that breezed by so they played it up when they flashed the “miles morales vs the prowler” comic my internal clock said “oh here’s the big conclusion in the last half hour,2023-06-08
i definitely felt it it was good but i wouldnt have minded it ending a bit earlier at other key points,2023-07-03
" what an absolute rug pull at the end there

its funny because looking back the twist is so obvious because of the unique art style of every universe the colours and lighting of earth 42 look nothing like miles universe and yet it still got me",2023-06-02
fun fact orginally spiderverse 2 and 3 were called across the spiderverse part 1 and part 2,2023-06-02
"i knew it was going to be “to be continued” but man a lot of people in my theater didn’t lol

heard a lot of swearing and also a “i wasn’t ready for that but i’m glad it’s not longer because i have to  so bad” directly behind me 

same girl… same",2023-06-02
the tension in the last 10 minutes of the movie was absolutely palpable there was this sense of somethings not right all over but i didnt clue into what was happening until the movie clocked me over the head with it between this and the dr olivia octavius scene in the first movie these writers know how to pull off a good plot twist,2023-06-02
im just glad we dont have to wait another 5 years to see the next one,2023-06-02
like i figured it would be a wrong universe deal with the classic “fake out” thing they were pulling with gwen “earth 42 miles is the prowler” was a huge twist for me especially  now they established there’s only one miles spiderman doing esb in this day and age and selling is top notch,2023-06-02
i thought the twist was pretty well telegraphed when the mothers first comment to miles is that his hair looks different i had a feeling this was the universe where his father died instead of his uncle,2023-06-02
i hated the to be continued and i think the movie is worse because of it call me crazy but i believe each movie should tell a complete satisfying story in its own right even if it is just a part of series what was there was incredible but i dont want to watch a 4 hour movie which is ostensibly what theyre doing i think they couldve kept most of it the same but reworked it to make this movie more satisfying,2023-06-05
my theatre was not happy,2023-06-02
"several people in the screening i was in seemed annoyed by the cliffhanger a lady behind me muttered oh come on and when the tag promising that miles will return showed up someone in the row in front of me said yeah return to rip us off

i knew going in that it was a cliffhanger so i was ready for it but i dont know how well it will go over generally",2023-06-02
"what an absolute rug pull at the end there had no idea this was only a part 1

it was always a part 1 they just stopped advertising it and changed the titles so people wouldnt be mad and not go see it in theaters",2023-06-02
this movie is the empire strikes back for the next generation,2023-06-02
i knew there was going to be some sort of twist when the dudes came on at the beginning telling us not to go ratting on twitter afterwards,2023-06-02
definetly got an audible motherfur out of me gwens ending monolouge started and i was confused because there was still so much not wrapped up,2023-06-02
id somehow heard there was going to a third one basically the only knowledge i had about across going in so the whole last hour felt like it was going to drop into a cliffhanger,2023-06-02
am i crazy or did nobody ever see the first teaser trailer when they called it across the spiderverse part 1,2023-06-05
part 2 was announced awhile ago,2023-06-02
wait you thought earth 42 was a twist did you pay attention,2023-06-02
i really wish we won’t have to wait a year for this,2023-06-02
theres 3 actually,2023-06-03
tell me about it ngl gotta say the way it ended gives me a hard time trying to figure out if i like this more than the first one as well low key mess with the 1st more tho,2023-06-03
i accidentally looked at my watch 2 hours in and it was then when i vaguely remembered that the original title of this movie had part 1 in it,2023-06-04
honestly i put it together as miles was firing up the machine because they had mentioned so many times and made such a big deal about how the spider that bit him came from a different universe they said that the machine scans your dna to send you back to the corresponding dimension but what they dont mention that context clues give is which dna its scanning for and theres only one true constant with everyone in the lobby its the spiderdna so if miles is expecting that the machine is going to scan for his human dna i figured that almost right then and there kinda felt like a doctor who cliffhanger to be honest in a good way to have something go correctly would deflate the story and theres only one logical place for miles to go the origin of his spiderdna,2023-06-04
when the send home machine scanned him it showed 42 so i immediately thought he was going to the wrong place but they took so long to reveal it i was second and third guessing myself,2023-06-04
it blows my mind how this is a thing its been known for years,2023-06-07
it’s been quite a while since a movie has done the to be continued bit without it being widely known,2023-06-11
it didn’t even feel like 2 hours  i couldn’t believe that was the end,2023-06-14
as furious as i am over the fact it was a rug pullit was a really really beautiful rug,2023-06-20
peter parker running oscorp in earth42 and helps miles make the movie 3 goober,2023-06-02
"why cant miguel go to earth42 and give peter some tech or serum to make him a spiderman its almost like he has ulterior motives and maybe isnt a good guy

but with how spider totems work that peter parker would have become spiderman one way or another if he was supposed to be",2023-06-02
"peter parker will be dead 

we are getting uncle ben spiderman 100",2023-06-02
theres supposed to be a spiderman in that universe but miles got bit by the spider from that universe,2023-06-02
voiced by chris pine,2023-06-02
would be an incredible way to bring back chris pine as peter for as short as his performance was in the first film it was really great and this would be a great way to reintroduce him,2023-06-11
peter parker is dead or is morbius,2023-06-02
remindme april 2024,2023-06-03
"that‘d go so hard

i imagine miles would break down and apologize and he‘d tell him it‘s okay and everything happens for a reason therefore giving miles the strength to go on",2023-06-02
nah prowler miles becomes that worlds spidey,2023-06-02
no spider  peter like no watch ben in ben10 helping save the multiverse,2023-06-02
remindme 2 years,2024-04-03
if hes still alive,2023-06-09
" i wasn’t 100 sure but was that mahershala voicing earth 43 aaron

he voiced him in the first movie",2023-06-02
"was that mahershala voicing earth 43 aaron  


yes exactly the cast was stacked",2023-06-02
he voiced him in the first movie too,2023-06-02
it was him but i also kinda felt like miles sounded like him too it didn’t really sound like shameik to me but idk,2023-06-02
oh neat,2023-06-04
i cracked up when the baby was crawling around and he said “she’s an anarchist”,2023-06-02
"and he gave miles the idea to break out by using his powers

gwen was right we do like him",2023-06-02
i was shocked by how much he propelled the movie’s plot forward too,2023-06-02
voiced by daniel kaluuya too,2023-06-02
taking a  on the establishment,2023-06-02
he was one of the best parts of the movie,2023-06-02
hes super cool but if my girl was crashing in his universe id def be thinking all is lost,2023-06-02
kinda worried that all the antiauthoritarian talk was just talk but no spiderpunk walks the walk,2023-06-02
man only has a few scenes and just dips but casually has an absolutely huge impact to the storyline,2023-06-02
"spiderpunk reminds me of jimi hendrix in wolfenstein new order

hes so  cool",2023-06-02
“taking a  on the establishment i can respect that” this line had me laughing so hard,2023-06-02
someone in my theatre said quite loudly “can anyone understand what he is saying”,2023-06-02
"and indian spiderman saying

this is where the british stole all our stuff

based spidey movie",2023-06-03
glad hes returning with the ateam also holy  so many spiderthings,2023-06-02
hobie lived up to what i hoped he would be  great daniel kaluuya killed it,2023-06-02
he was one of the biggest highlights in a movie full of highlights i was in stitches at nearly all of his lines and his willingness to burn everything down and saying little baby parker will make for a great anarchist,2023-06-02
the lack of recognition this line got from my audience makes me a bit upset,2023-06-02
"fight the power

i didn’t realize the voice was daniel kaluuya until the end",2023-06-02
he was amazing probably my favorite out of the new spiderpeople,2023-06-02
loved his design both with and without the mask,2023-06-02
he was riding that line between pretentiously annoying and so  cool so hard it ended up being super cool,2023-06-03
punk needs his own film he was amazing,2023-06-02
he was such a great character but that accent was so incredibly thick and the speakers at my theater werent exactly perfect it was hard to understand him sometimes,2023-06-02
"he was the goat

not even miles could have a beef with him he always supported his claim against ohara radical approach of canon what a lad",2023-06-03
every line of his that i could understand was a banger,2023-06-03
"maybe it was just the theater i was in but i didn’t understand more than like two or three lines he said he sounded sort of muffled on top of having the accent gonna have to rewatch with subtitles when the movie becomes available at home

edit seems like it wasn’t just my theater from the looks of it",2023-06-05
"how cool is spider punk he showed up and immediately started helping miles his tip for miles to use his palms during his venom blasts was so important then he kept asking miles questions to try and get him to not blindly follow the group and then he made the new portal wrist bands to help gwen and the rest link up to try to save miles 
i hope they make more content with him",2023-06-07
"spiderpunk was great 

but am i the only comic book nerd twitching at the fact that versions of both hobie brown and the prowler exist in this multiverse but apparently never the two shall cross im just a big og prowler fan",2023-06-02
spiderpunk was my favorite animation in the movie overall was incredible but i loved his and absolutely no fs given toward rules authority or  conformity,2023-06-03
,2023-06-05
as a leftist i thought he made fun of us hilariously,2023-06-02
this went so unappreciated in my theater but i was dying,2023-06-02
idk if i was the only one but i could only hearunderstand like 13 of his lines,2023-06-02
he was such a fun character but so many of his lines got buried by the audio mix they were worth straining for though,2023-06-08
having spiderpunk and spidernoir together in the next one should be fun,2023-06-04
my favourite new character might be miguel or spider punk i really like inside lewin davis and oscar isacc is a great actor but i also liked the indian spider man,2023-07-08
i remember loving the line but cannot for the life of me remember what it was referring to,2023-06-02
i was dying at that line and his one to mayday,2023-06-02
spiderpunk was by far my favorite of the spidermens,2023-06-04
i was the only person in my theater who laughed at that but thats ok,2023-06-04
i thought he was really pretentious at first but he really came through for miles,2023-06-12
"he was hilarious and my fav animations style 

but i do think its weird they decided in this movie that the alternate universesspidermans theyd introduce are just different cultures so theres a british universe and an indian universe and if manhattan becomes mumbaihattan whats their mumbai like mumbaimumbai",2023-06-25
you mean super cringey,2023-06-07
pretty sure i was the only person in my theater to laugh at that,2023-06-10
was getting annoyed by him mid way all the propoganda references and too cool for you and i dont listen to you build your own that but he did come through with his words hes alright,2023-06-03
nah it was  they were jerking off their basementdwelling fanbase and it was obvious the spiderpunk was just every communist redditors wet dream and their catering obviously worked you are a living example a classic anarchist would be great but they had to ruin the character with the propaganda,2023-06-03
he should watch documentaries about communist times in poland he would change his mind immediately,2023-06-03
thought he said it was a miracle of capitalism but same difference,2023-06-03
biggest laugh in the movie for me,2023-06-04
only me laughed at my theater not ashamed at all,2023-06-13
spider punk is gg allin,2023-06-19
how is he so cool even without the mask though,2023-06-26
"so we’re just gonna pretend this wasn’t coming from a movie that’s part of the mechanism that’s completely subsuming the movie business and in some ways narrative storytelling and itself is the worst version of capitalism destroying a good thing

i loved the movie and spider punk got a kick out of me but this line was eye rolling at best and genuinely insulting given the movie it was in at worst",2023-06-28
i think yaaa men the spider pank was so  good,2023-12-22
im not gonna lie to you miles had to give up on gwen after meeting hobie you got a toothbrush in his dimension and leaving cardigans lost the game before i ever hit the court,2023-06-02
miles and hobbie have some real chemistry thats all im gonna say,2023-06-02
when i heard that there is going to be a love triangle in the movie i expected miles and hobie fighting over gwen and not hobie and gwen fighting over miles,2023-06-02
if they give me bisexual black spider man im gonna explode with joy lol,2023-06-02
"kinda disappointed they never addressed any of that after hobie comes to screen like suddenly miles is no longer jealous

it was a cool dynamic to have",2023-06-16
miguel isn’t letting the cops die to disrupt the system he’s doing it to uphold yet another establishment albeit an inter dimensional one rather than a governmental one,2023-06-03
within the first 3 minutes of the movie i contemplated going outside and asking someone to turn the volume up you aren’t alone,2023-06-02
youre not alone i just posted a similar comment about the sound mixing is your theater in montreal,2023-06-02
i saw it in dolby at an amc totally had this problem,2023-06-02
same for me i could barely understand anything during gwens whole opening and it was really difficult to hear anything spiderpunk said,2023-06-02
yeah sound mixing was particularly bad in the beginning and end everything else was fine dialogue was missed in the drumming parts,2023-06-02
i thought there was something wrong at the beginning and saw someone get up no clue if he was going to ask or something else likely but then throughout the movie there were parts i felt i needed to lean forward to hear better it’s wasn’t very surround sound seemed to come all from the front,2023-06-02
during the opening with gwen and her thing i legit thought my theaters audio was  or something then we got the title card and everything was a lot better,2023-06-02
the movie was shipped with specific instructions to crank up to volume some projectionists might not be paying attention,2023-06-02
felt the same at sf metreon had a hard time hearing gwen most of the movie really,2023-06-02
and was is echoing when anyone was explaining their back story this is up there with tenet for great movies with bad sound editing,2023-06-02
yup i definitely missed out on some sm india and spiderpunk dialog ,2023-06-02
that was my experience as well the beginning was very quiet but as the movie went on the sound mixing seemed to improve even though i still missed a chunk of the dialogue mostly from the british spider man,2023-06-02
we had the exact opposite problem  we could barely hear the music but higher ranged sounds and dialog were fine  sucks because the first movie great loud music but we missed out because our theaters sound system is scuffed,2023-06-02
nolan and his damned dialogue mixi wait thats not right,2023-06-02
i already watched it twice and had that issue with the first theater it wasn’t nearly as bad for the second i couldn’t understand spiderman india or spider punk at my first showing at all so i think the issue can be mitigated depending on the theater my second viewing i  heard and understood all of the dialogue i couldn’t at the first but that was an atmos theater so that’s probably why,2023-06-02
minneapolis amc reporting in couldn’t hear ,2023-06-02
"i just commented the same thing before seeing this

its not just youyour theater there were multiple parts where i could barely understand the dialogue including that opening monologue",2023-06-02
absolutely had the same experience super weird audio mixing felt like i missed a lot of dialogue,2023-06-02
noticed this too it definitely seemed quieter in gwens opening and then either it got louder or i got used to it there were some other hard to hear moments too,2023-06-02
agreed completely while i’d love to call this movie perfect it’s hard to call a part 1 perfect and the sound mixing was noticable in enough instances to be an issue i can’t wait to watch this with subtitles for those moments but overall it doesn’t take away from my overall impression of the film as the visuals and score were the more incredible parts of this film  in that order,2023-06-02
my sound was also so low,2023-06-02
it was also very quiet at the imax in portland,2023-06-02
i didnt hear a work that spiderpunk said,2023-06-02
"the sound cut out in my theater right when they got to the spiderhub didnt come back on for about 30 min most people walked to the lobby to avoid spoilerslet the staff know so they rewound it back to the mumbattan scene 

frustrating to lose an hour of my life but didnt mind rewatching that sequence such a beautiful film",2023-06-02
interesting i didnt have this problem in my theater but im definitely watching this movie a few more times to be sure,2023-06-02
no spot on i knew i wasnt crazy maybe i need to watch it in imax lol,2023-06-02
yes the dialogue track was absolutely buried from the start,2023-06-02
i thought i was just unlucky and picked a bad seat in my theater the sound mixing was horrible i couldnt understand almost half the movie unless the music was dead silent or people were yelling,2023-06-02
we had the same issue in charlotte nc  the manager at our amc said it’s been a nationwide issue with the surround sound on this movie we left and went to a dolby screening at another theater and the sound was amazing there,2023-06-02
holy  it was like that in my theater too i guess it was the mix itself nolan would be proud,2023-06-02
australia herethe narration parts were some of the worst audio mixing ive ever heard,2023-06-02
it was bad in my theater too  near impossible to hear what was being said at some points and at others there was a bad echo,2023-06-02
i hate when the sound is too low in movies it happened to me a few times and it usually drives me up the wall luckily it didnt happen to me in this case but im pretty sure the right side speakers were off for some reason lol,2023-06-02
i was at an imax and the beginning monolog by gwen was drowned out by the drums ive never been to an imax so i thought it was just an imax thing,2023-06-02
"people around me were reacting to the dialogue and i honestly thought i needed to book an appointment with an audiologist i couldn’t make out half of what was said

followup  contacted my theatre chain’s customer service department and received a refund i’ll do a rewatch when i have access to subtitles",2023-06-09
definitely had an issue for the opening i felt that the way the dialog track was mixed in the last movie was pretty rough too,2023-06-02
i had this problem as well it was bizarre how much i had to strain to hear certain bits of dialogue,2023-06-02
yep had this problem as well,2023-06-02
i thought i was going crazy the audio felt so off,2023-06-02
i hadthe opposite problem thought the music wasnt loud enough the whole first section didnt hit for me because the music was so quiet to me,2023-06-02
same issue in an imax showing in ohio couldn’t understand gwen during the opening and missed the majority of dialogue from spiderpunk and indian spiderman,2023-06-02
same exact experience at a an amc prime theater in california  seems like it’s less a theater thing and more a mixing thing,2023-06-02
it was super quiet in my theater too,2023-06-02
"same issue

im from argentina lol",2023-06-02
i could not hear gwen’s opening at all then when the title happened audio sounded fine,2023-06-02
i could barely hear as well and it didnt help when half of the audience was laughing their  off while theyre talking,2023-06-02
same issue in my theater,2023-06-02
thought this was just me saw it in imax and had the same problem,2023-06-02
regular theater or dolby cinema theater i had problems hearing dialog watching in a dolby cinema theater,2023-06-02
same at cinemark in colorado the entire mix for the entirely movie sounded really off still was incredible  it’s just that the first movie has such an incredible soundtrackmixing it threw me off,2023-06-02
no problems with cinemark xd tonight,2023-06-02
yes it was very noticeable for the first 10 minutes hoping they fix it for future showings,2023-06-02
wasnt just you i was wondering if the sound was off because i opted for a regular theater showing and not the big fancy sound system one,2023-06-02
went to the first showing here in brisbane australia music was loud but definitely not so loud that i couldnt catch the dialogue although i did go to one of the better cinemas event,2023-06-02
i don’t even live in your country and it was the same for me,2023-06-02
i noticed the same went to see it at a new theaters grand opening it had dolby atmos  and i thought maybe they still needed to tweak their audio a bit for the dialogue  sounds like their audio system is probably fine,2023-06-02
did you go to a cinemark,2023-06-02
yea my theatre in dallas tx was definitely low as well,2023-06-02
i’m glad i’m not the only one i legit thought i might’ve gone deaf or need to get my hearing checked,2023-06-02
im glad i wasn’t the only one who noticed it even when the movie began with gwen playing her drums then after that the dialogue seemed super low,2023-06-02
im from argentina had to watch it with the spanish dub and this was also an issue,2023-06-02
 i assumed it was my theatre the whole first like 10 minutes was mixed so badly how on earth did this pass screenings,2023-06-03
totally had the same issue at an alamo drafthouse seems like there was something up with the mix for sure,2023-06-03
yeah the spider people do a lot of quipping and talking while in the middle of fighting will have to watch this again with subtitles,2023-06-03
yup i though the sound mixing was off aswell,2023-06-03
i rewatched into the spiderverse last night and i thought the same thing i was hoping it wouldn’t happen in this one too but it definitely did going to have to wait for home release with subtitles,2023-06-03
i can confirm that the audio in my theatre was mad quiet as well,2023-06-04
saw it in dolby and it was not bad and my left ear sucks i don’t do imax,2023-06-07
sounded really good in dolby,2023-06-08
the movie just came out this weekend in japan and i watched it in english with japanese subtitles and the diolouge audio was surprisingly loud over the action,2023-06-18
same here in a mi theater audio was definitely high enough cause some of the peaks hurt my ears but i still couldnt hear gwen at the beginning over the music i think the music was just mixed too loud compared to the voices on the final cut sent to theaters,2023-07-10
real in a very pretty movie she was one of the prettiest parts of it,2023-06-02
jefferson is one lucky  man for sure ,2023-06-03
i thought all spidermen are supposed to be funny why arent you funny miguel that got a laugh from me great movie so well done,2023-06-03
i really think itll overtake nolans trilogy the thing about nolans is that we never saw the real 3rd movie but a weaker version instead this spiderverse trilogy wont suffer from that and will likely stick the landing,2023-06-05
i like that theyre very careful for the most part to not have a whedonesque quip completely derail or undermine serious or dramatic moments spiderman famously wont shut up so its neat to see a tasteful balance of jokes and stakes especially in this ip,2023-06-06
i kind lost my mind when the vulture battle concluded and i realized that entire sequence was just the opening this movie was a feast,2023-06-03
he absolutely stole the show for me him constantly changing colors to never conform with any universes’ style was just the cherry on top,2023-06-02
capitalism will get him,2023-06-02
why would you say that hobie will live forever,2023-06-02
he reminded me of lenny kravitz looks wise,2023-06-02
nahhh i dont think hes gonna be a spider person who dies its gonna be pavitr dude is very chill about being spiderman and an event that would have likely made him take the job more seriously and knock him down a peg didnt happen hes gonna get too confident and pay for it,2023-06-03
im thinking theyll have a fakeout death for gwen they sort of set it up with her saying that in basically every dimension but hers gwen falls in love with spiderman but doesnt have it end well for her i can totally see it seem like a canon moment asm121 presumably is about to happen make it appear that gwen has died and then pull the rug out to show shes alive and the universe is fine and that the stuff eating away at the multiverse actually isnt due to what miguel thinks,2023-06-03
death is just a capitalist concept to sell you caskets,2023-06-03
nah  just say no,2023-06-03
no i don’t want him to get killed off,2023-06-02
hes miles too right they specifically didnt mention his identity and he knew about the shock miles had,2023-06-03
spiderman 2 at that it’s the first time we’ve seen peters spider claw things at work,2023-06-02
thought the spiderman with the leg cramp was him,2023-06-03
james blake song was my favorite one too,2023-06-14
james blake doesnt miss,2023-06-17
i was pleasantly surprised like yes i will take this over the post malone from the first one thank you,2023-06-04
this whole film needs posters of like every scene lol,2023-06-02
i’m gonna have so so many new wallpapers when the 4k drops holy  mumbatten alone,2023-06-02
"i like that one but captured this one from the trailer for myself

are you talking about the super wide shot where theyre on the right side of frame that was my favorite shot of that scene,2023-06-02
"for me its gotta be these two shots

1 miguel ohara standing alone in front of the red light in the rain

2 almost at the end of the painting like credits when miless prowler and miless spiderman stand opposing each other",2023-06-02
"the wallpaper rule of animation always applies

if you can pause anywhere and get a sick wallpaper then its a gorgeous movie",2023-06-02

the laws of the internet say someone has already made it i went searching and found this redditor that made a wallpaper of the exact scene you mentioned,2023-06-02
yeeeeaaaaah the second it popped up i knew i needed it,2023-06-02
just  give me the highest def file you can give me so i can screenshot every single frame i promise i will still buy the bluray i just want all those wallpapers holy  ,2023-06-02
not a true substitute but heres something with a little filter over it to hide the pixelation to tide you over in the meantime,2023-06-02
"i thought that was one of the first shots released

",2023-06-02
hoping that happens remember when some guy on twitter asked james gunn to release the ending group photo from gotg3 and he followed through,2023-06-03
" a nonletterboxed 4k image

the whole movie was in 2351 so i doubt youll get an expanded image",2023-06-03
i audibly said thats an amazing shot it gives me vibes of when miles is falling inverted in the first movie,2023-06-03
hopefully someone ends up commenting here with a screen rip,2023-06-02
i saw that in imax and i was happy to see it go up for a second time so i could appreciate it more,2023-06-03
i swear this entire movie needs to be framed on my wall,2023-06-03
this entire movie deserves to be made a poster holy  i dont think ive ever seen an animated movie this beautiful,2023-06-03
theres a music video,2023-06-05
had the exact same thought while watching,2023-06-05
"is there a poster or shot on a white back ground where miles is being chased by the other spider people i swear ive seen one but cant for the life of me find it

what a beautiful movie heres mega high hopes part 2 completes this trilogy in the highest regard well done sony animation beautiful work",2023-07-01
"this shot specifically

uhhh is there a 4k version of this yet",2023-09-10
i loved that genke says hes not gonna be the guy in the chair in contrast to ned wanting to be tom hollands guy in the chair,2023-06-02
"the donald glovermiles morales history is fun but a little more complicated

in 2010 sony announced they were rebooting the spiderman movies people on twitter campaigned for donald glover to play peter donald4spiderman andrew garfield got cast but as a reference community season 2 opens with glovers character in spiderman pajamas

brian michael bendis the writer of ultimate spiderman saw that episode of community and it was part of the inspiration for him to create miles morales included in the comic origin is that his uncle aaron davis is the ultimate universes version of the prowler

then seven years later glover is cast in spiderman homecoming as aaron davis with his prowler codename referenced he mentions a nephew and in a deleted postcredits gag calls him miles by name over the phone

now here we are with donald glover as mcu aaron davis sharing a screen with the oscarwinning animated version of miles morales a character inspired by him",2023-06-02
ive seen both venom movies but i completely forgot about mrs chen was so confused when she appeared thought it was just some random oddball thing,2023-06-02
i was a little confused because i thought it was very clear that he was going to earth 42 so i thought the whole reveal took way too long as soon as they showed it on the computer i told my friend he’s going to the wrong earth and they got mad at me for pointing it out so early on lol,2023-06-02
the son heungmin poster out a huge smile on my face hopefully the player in that universe racked up the club silverware his talent deserves,2023-06-02
funny enough the movie does tell you when miles gets scanned that he’s going to universe 42 and not 1610 but i was still surprised because the movie and it’s pacing made me forget in that moment,2023-06-02
"	tom holland is a tottenham fan

well no one’s life can be totally perfect",2023-06-02
as someone who considers the venom films as a huge guilty pleasure mrs chens appearance was a nice surprise,2023-06-02
i loved the song heung min poster,2023-06-03
" chekov’s gun

thats definitely not what a chekovs gun is and his name in mcu is literally aaron davis its not a reveal at all lol",2023-06-03
dude the tasm 2 tie in game spidey was in it too they had him when they were showcasing dead bens,2023-06-02
gooners wont be happy but as a fan of neither spurs actually make so much sense as the team spiderman would support,2023-06-02
who thought glover would play miles in the mcu i thought it was pretty clear from the start that he was too old at that point and he was always aaron he even mentions his nephew in homecoming and calls him miles on the phone in a deleted scene,2023-06-02
unless it was a mistype he very clearly mentions his nephew so miles in homecoming so people werent assuming miles they were assuming he was his uncle,2023-06-02
why would people think he would play mcu miles when he is explicitly miles uncle in homecoming,2023-06-02
wait what why would anyone think glover would play live action miles when he was very clearly meant to be his uncle,2023-06-02
my money is on jabari banks as miles,2023-06-02
don’t forget spectacular spiderman,2023-06-02
i personally didn’t really like the live action inclusions because they felt so separated from the animation i hope if they have it in beyond it’s done more roger rabbit style with physical interaction back and forth even if it’s still cameos,2023-06-02
its entirely possible that was broll from one of the venom movies and they didnt even have to shoot anything new i dont think mrs chen says anything specific for the spot,2023-06-02
"this comment has been edited and the account purged in protest to reddits api policy changes and the awful response from reddit management to valid concerns from the communities of developers people with disabilities and moderators the fact that reddit decided to implement these changes in the first place without thinking of how it would negatively affect these communities which provide a lot of value to reddit is even more worrying

pretty sure he was playing spiderman too when he’s wearing miles jordan’s,2023-06-03
when i saw that poster genke was dead to me now i have to hate holland too dark times,2023-06-04
i didnt watch venom nor everything everywhere all at once but i thought that was a eeaao reference cause the only thing i know about that movie is that theres an asian lady going through multiverses lol,2023-06-03
you think mrs chen was still w venom during this interaction only reason i see her not being confused by the spot,2023-06-02
watching it twice now an interesting thing was during spots exposition flashback about the spider coming from dimenson 42 the spider is shown behind someone who has braids matching prowler miles maybe prowler miles was supposed to be spiderman all along just in a different universe,2023-06-03
donald glover was the prowler in the mcu though,2023-06-03
"didnt we already know he was aaron davis in the mcu

im pretty sure he mentions a nephew when peter busts him trying to sell the guns out of the trunk of his car",2023-06-04
i mean aaron davis donald glover already exists in the mcu he was in spiderman homecoming,2023-06-04
i dont understand why people thought donald glover would play mcu miles hes way too old there were rumors of a miles morales movie before tasm which wouldve been a good idea then unfortunately that time has long since passed,2023-06-04
glover wasn’t miles in the mcu he was always aaron he even mentioned having a nephew in their scene together,2023-06-04
aw man i missed the son heung min poster thats super dope,2023-06-06
why is nobody talking about the spectacular spiderman,2023-06-06
ton hollands spiderman stops donald gloves character as hes looking to secure alien tech stops his hand and sticks it to his car the hand that would hold the prowlers glove,2023-06-19
"zhuuuuuuuooooooooo

does anyone know what instrument that is",2023-06-02
the character design being so similar is a good parallel,2023-06-02
"oh man and he gets two cakes for his fathers party

plus they made him promise to be on time and bring cake sounds like a setup for him to bring two cakes next film too",2023-06-03
she might be a genius and is probably right,2023-06-04
i had that very thought too glad im not alone in this,2023-06-05
"this exactly 

miguel is majorly projecting his unprocessed grief in the form of anger at miles superficially blaming him for being an anomaly when hes angry that his anomalous status might mean he gets to keep his family intact when miguel lost an entire universe trying at the same thing",2023-06-04
"late to the party but i think its pretty clear that the whole canon event thing is bs anyway at least the idea that destroying one unwravels the multiverse or something

weve seen two canon event disruptions but they look nothing alike  miguels disruption had the rainbow triangles associated with the alchemax collider whereas pavitrs had the black splotches associated with the spot  ive got to assume that neither of these things had anything to do with the canon event or i would expect to them to look at least somewhat similar",2023-06-20
i think the point he was making was the canon event not happening would crumble the universe and by extension put the multiverse in danger how that event affects the spiderman involved is irrelevant so imprisoning miles means nothing his claimed target is protecting the universe to maintain the multiverse not mile’s character development,2023-06-04
tbh why would she be doing any of this while pregnant does miguel not believe in maternity leave,2023-06-02
she definitely already had her baby right like she was pretty pregnant when she met gwen and then we skip to a few months later,2023-06-02
"what if spot uses his power to pull out the unborn fetus from her 

that would be evil i think",2023-06-02
id say less than 10  likely just be named gerry like in the comics,2023-06-02
she already gave birth she was very pregnant when first meeting gwen and then she was with them for several months,2023-06-02
her son should be gerry spiderman never dies,2023-06-04
i want a baby fight with her kid and may day two lil spider babies slapping each other would be hilarious,2023-06-06
and just to add on the opening monologue  begins with her not having friends aside from lizardpeter and miles then ends with her realizing she was wrong and recruiting the gang from the first one  a few more really nice way to tie the intro and end together while emphasizing the nofriends thing was just her warped perspective from her trauma,2023-06-02
"completely agree gwen gets a satisfying resolution with her dad 

i also knew this was pt1 before going in which really allowed me to accept it before watching giving miles and gang the extended runtime to slow down and give those big character moments was a great choice 

under a year till the next one too i’m all in",2023-06-02
"agreed just a very wellcrafted film from the bones out lord and miller have their prankster make it up as we go reputation but everything ive seen from them gives me the impression that the thing they value most is solidity and sound structure

it also helps that everyone except gwen has amazing character animation while gwen has i didnt realize this was possible character animation just incredible stuff",2023-06-02
"i agree that the cliffhanger feels like were just getting more miles and gwen both had full arcs about growing as a person accepting who and what they are and the choices theyre going to have to make and had to grow up a bit but instead of miguel just seeing he could be wrong and miles is right were set up for even more of the series in a way that felt built up to and earned

weve seen miles at his start at his lowest so far at his highest so far and now we get to see the darkest version of him and him have to confront that he could be that",2023-06-03
it felt like part 2 of 3 for me,2023-06-02
yeah for a movie that ended on a cliffhanger it felt strangely complete i wish the next part was coming out sooner than next year lol but i dont feel disappointed in how this one flowed from beginning to end and gwen kinda being the deuteragonist definitely helped,2023-06-03
i feel like it would’ve been better if they bookended the movie on both sides with gwen’s resolution but i can see how that would be narratively clunky,2023-06-04
i think another thing that helped make it not feel cheap too is that this movie oozes with love and passion so i personally did not tire of it and only wanted more because of that and its ending felt more like a please give us time for a little more we cant have you in here for 5 hours,2023-06-07
probably one of the best explanations of how this really can be seen as a movie with a full story arc despite the tbc thanks for putting it into words,2023-06-04
" i didnt feel unsatisfied or cheated out of an ending

 fast x",2023-06-05
i don’t really like how not being the chief makes it okay for her to love her father i kinda wish she got past the whole canon event thing but i guess thats for miles to do in part two,2023-06-04
he was cool but idk maybe it’s just me but most of his lines where kinda hard to hear luckily i caught that one lol,2023-06-02
lord and miller really have an impressive track record at this point makes me wonder what their version of solo would have been like,2023-06-03
loved how hobie thinks of spiderpunk as his secret identity lol,2023-06-02
i definitely missed that line when did he say that,2023-06-02
i laughed at that joke for a solid minute i don’t think anyone else around me was,2023-06-02
when did he say the metaphor for capitalism line found some of his dialogue hard to catch,2023-06-03
 it hit like a truck at my theater 2000 people were dying,2023-06-02
i think that joke got the biggest laugh of the movie in my theater,2023-06-02
that was easily the joke that got the most laughs out of my screening,2023-06-05
my fav joke in the movie mostly because i believed him,2023-06-05
"hobie was probably my favorite character in a packed theater i don’t think anyone else caught that “it’s a metaphor for capitalism” but i could not stop laughing

we took our son to see it and me and his mom looked at each other and burst out laughing i think people were annoyed at us lol",2023-06-26
didnt catch it cuz i couldnt hear it the mixing in this movie  me off,2023-06-03
"same when i heard hobie say that line im the only one who laughed

probably because they couldnt hear him that well lol",2023-06-04
not necessarily he becomes prowler because there isnt a spiderman in his universe peter dies because miles distracts him but if miles was never bitten peter would have never died so there would still be a spiderman,2023-06-02
we arent 100 sure miles prowler is a villain aaron talks about bypassing security but bad guys have security too could be that this miles is still a good guy or an antihero but since he didnt have the spider he had to find a different way to help i also dont remember his spidey sense ever going off during any of this,2023-06-02
"also miguel is the massive hypocrite he himself is a walking anomaly and what he did in his backstory was exactly the same as what kingpin was trying to do

i get that the whole thing is him trying to fixatone but he was being a massive  projectingtrauma dumping on miles",2023-06-03
"the spider was taken from earth42 meaning peter never got bit so no spiderman in that universe

miles got bit in his universe which caused his peter to die by saving him if miles never got  bit he would have never went back underground to check on the spider that bit him",2023-06-02
it’s a really interesting twist on the “evil spiderman”symbiote storylines we’ve seen in the past with a true alternate trajectory for miles in earth42 cannot wait to see how it plays out,2023-06-02
it kinda confirmed majority miles morales are probably villains in multiverse and miles being 1st anomaly is deja vu he also technically made spot canon event u cant change inverrisable damage done,2023-06-02
do we know for sure the prowler is bad im still half expecting to find out that hes a  that universe just a darker character overall bc of the timeline the sinister six cartels in the background also made it seem like he might be battling them,2023-06-04
"i think his take points to miguel leading the spider society and thats why theyre like the bad guys because miguel is miguel is the original anomaly he was the prowler in his universe and requires injections to prevent glitching and points miles out as a scapegoat to keep everyone from seeing its all him he killed spiderman and lied about being him

parallel to that the spot thinks miles is the bad guy for taking everything from him he blames miles for becoming spiderman except miles is not responsible for the spider finding and biting him

the spot is peter parker in universe 42 and blames mile morales because miguel went to that universe to replace his family and stopped peter from becoming spiderman and found out he doesnt exist as the prowler there destroys the collider so he can go to another universe and try again and creates the spot framing miles maybe even kills his dad sealing miles42 as prowler",2023-06-19
"im not really sure prowlermiles is a villain

im getting more gritty antihero vibes from him",2023-06-09

yeah like 23 of my theater got super upset lol,2023-06-02
i mean i knew it was a part 1 and i still wasnt happy about that either,2023-06-02
i had no idea first time avoiding seeing anything about a movie to avoid spoilers kinda hurt me in the end,2023-06-02
i knew it going in forgot about it around the point gwen and her dad made up and then got smacked in the face with rios confusion,2023-06-02
im usually pretty clued up with movies and yet started to fear a to be continued was about to pop up obviously disappointed now but i am sure in a year ill be happy,2023-06-02
my friends didnt even know oscar isaac was in it,2023-06-02
"i went to the last showing of the night so we only had maybe a dozen people so the whole theater could hear one guy shouted what the f i think we all laughed

i had no idea until around 10 minutes left and i realized that there was no way they could finish the movie in that time",2023-06-02
i went to see fast x and didn’t realize that was a part 1 immediately after that i saw spiderverse which i also didn’t know was a part 1  it’s been a mildly inconvenient day,2023-06-03
everyone keeps calling it part 1 but from the very first few scenes it felt like part 2 of 3 it builds on the first movie so succinctly,2023-06-02
"had no clue this was a part one around the time just before miles escapes to earth42 i realised they werent going to wrap things up and that it was likely a setup for the next part great movie but this was definitely a bummer most of the theatre gasped at the to be continued  one preteen kid called it a scam which is relatable tbh 

beautiful movie in both story and visuals no doubt they did a great job of world building for beyond the spiderverse and gave the developments needed but oh man it just left me wanting more",2023-06-04
i didn’t know but after the initial rage and shock i loved it,2023-06-02
i didn’t know but my theatre seemed to really enjoy the reveal instant loud applause  the guys behind me were super stoked and if they were upset it was because they don’t have a time machine,2023-06-03
i didn’t and i was pretty disappointed but now i’m excited for more,2023-06-02
"i had no idea its not like its explicit or alluded to anywhere in the trailers or title

i usually dont google movies to avoid spoilers so without goolging it i dont think one would know",2023-06-05
i’m “not happy” but not in a bad way in the intended way i’ll be there opening night for beyond is what i’m saying,2023-06-12
i totally forgot that this is part 1 since ive been avoiding searching anything about the movie so i can enjoy it im surprised but it didnt bother me i just have to wait a few more months for beyond,2023-06-02
i had no idea i could feel it coming though,2023-06-03
i didn’t know going in,2023-06-03
i had no idea and wish that i had known i would’ve saved the money and skipped this,2023-06-07
"i had no idea but getting towards the end i was thinking there had to be at least 30 minutes left if and how could they possibly squeeze a satisfying ending in because surely there wasnt another hour left  
  
then it ended and i was bummed to not have more but happy to get a full movie more but then bummed again to have to wait",2023-06-12
i was told by a friend it had a crazy cliff hanger and had the part 1 spoiled on me i knew there’d be a third movie just not a continuation of this one in that sense,2023-06-02
i only remembered during gwens speech and i was like it has been a while huh,2023-06-02
i had forgotten i was so engaged with the movie i lost track of time was initially surprised with the cliffhanger until i though “ oh yea”,2023-06-03
i remember hearing that they changed the name of the next one from part 2 to beyond but id completely forgotten about it since,2023-06-03
i didn’t know it was a part 1 at first but towards the end i realized that it was since the movie was almost ending and the main conflict still wasn’t resolved then i remembered that beyond the spiderverse comes out next year,2023-06-03
i didnt know because i purposely avoided every trailer content and article related to this so i had fresh eyes and could enjoy all the scenessurprises,2023-06-04
i went with three people and none of us knew,2023-06-04
i remember hearing it’s supposed to be a trilogy but not a pt1pt2,2023-06-04
i heard there was a cliffhanger but i didnt know it was a straight up part 1 fuuck that,2023-06-05
i forgot i remember being so excited when it was announced that we were getting two more movies but they never played it up i think they kinda wanted people to forget frankly,2023-06-05
im surprised by the number of people upset about it being part 1 of 2 it just gets me excited for the next movie,2023-06-10
i didnt know neither did my friends it made it better for me most of us were laughing about it,2023-06-02
i mean its not a part 1 though its a unique standalone movie they changed the title empire wasn’t called part 1 just because it ended on a cliff hanger,2023-06-02
most people arent tappedtoo deep into ,2023-06-04
no idea but i loved it,2023-06-06
people without the internet and people who havent watched a movie before how many is that,2023-06-07
i didnt know but i didnt mind it i was starting to think how the  were they going to close the final act,2023-06-10
i only knew because a friend mentioned to me that it was when telling me to go see it it was their one spoiler because they thought it was better to know that going into it,2023-07-10
is it really babysitting if youre the parent wouldnt that just be parenting,2023-06-02

"this will absolutely win best animated picture 

the original spiderverse won and that was when no one trusted the academy to even actually pay attention to it

this time everyones paying attention unless elemental winds up being as good as casablanca this sequel has it in the bag",2023-06-02
it should this is unironically one of the best if not the best film thus far this year,2023-06-02
if impact on the medium is the metric by which we should pick best picture then absolutely this series has had a profound impact on the animation world and has clearly changed the creative choices of a few studios now,2023-06-02
"i was pleasantly shocked i liked this as much as the first if not more i never thought it would be bad sure but i also kind of figured it wouldnt hit that a mark again and the reviews were typical this movie has fanbase now we need to give the sequel a good rating no matter what that is so common nowadays

nope phenomenal film in the same league as the first",2023-06-02
yep anything else winning best animated movie of the year would be criminal this movie tried so much and experimented with a lot of different visual styles all at once and all of it worked,2023-06-02
the way they incorporated all of the different animation styles was amazing but how they incorporated the live action characters,2023-06-02
in the last couple months ive seen dd gotg and across the spiderverse which have all been phenomenal and each movie has topped the last its been a long time since i had this much fun at the movies,2023-06-02
bet the house on this movie winning best animated it’s a for sure lock,2023-06-02

idk  in boots was  fire don’t get me wrong i loved atsv but it wasn’t as good as the first one to be fair that’s an impossibly high bar,2023-06-04
best picture nomination i dont know about that especially when its not even a complete story i super enjoyed this movie but no way was this better than guardians of the galaxy 3,2023-06-02
is it eligible for that oscar with the live action scenes i could be misremembering but i recall the lego movie not being eligible for a nomination because of that movies’ live action scenes,2023-06-02
as much as i love the live action stuff part of me is terrified that’s going to disqualify it but then again marcel the shell was nominated so maybe not or maybe they already got one for into that they don’t care and just want to make a good  movie,2023-06-03
only dune 2 has potential to rival this movie for the spot of movie of the year,2023-06-03

it would be criminal if this doesn’t get a best picture nomination i would actually get mad,2023-06-02
itll get a best picture nomination now that they have 10 slots for that i dont think the academy has the selfrespect to actually give it a win though they get too hung up on their own sense of what movies should be,2023-06-04
unfortunately the academy does not like sequels or animated movies or superhero movies i would love to be proven wrong though i loved the movie,2023-06-08

i would bet a lot of money it will definitely not get that",2023-06-05
"it had less than half a plot i straight up don’t understand how people are saying this

it was half a movie with literally no ending how can half a movie win best picture",2023-06-02
it has to get a best picture nod this film is leaps and bounds beyond almost anything weve seen in cinemas over the last few years,2023-06-02
i know the year isn’t over but i don’t see how any other film can top this qualitywise it legit deserves best picture,2023-06-02
i think itll get just get a best animated film win again but if the third one is as good it might get the return of the king treatment,2023-06-02
"its this or suzume 

but we knew the academy never gives japanese animation its due",2023-06-04
when it doesn’t get a best picture nomination and i’m very sure it won’t i’m gonna be so ,2023-06-04
it’s 100 a lock for best animated pixar for sure isn’t winning let’s see if it can get a best picture nomination,2023-06-04
best animated movie in a long long time,2023-06-07
so good and delivered a fantastic story that still felt authentic  granted im a grown  man but spider verse navigating a coming of age story where the character has to own their story and step up to the plate metaphorically vs mermaids bs kraken or elementals meant to be an empowerment story the later looks like absolute corporate shill,2023-06-08
id love for it to win best animated but i just have a feeling that the mario movie will grab that title,2023-06-10
we’ve come a long way since roger rabbit…,2023-06-14
plus i don’t think it’s a love triangle in the struggling punk scene crashing on couches is totally normal and a lot of band members get super close without  around gwen literally didn’t have a universe to go to,2023-06-03
what love triangle,2023-06-06
i did notice that the animation looked different it looked like video game cutscenes from a telltale game,2023-06-11
good call,2023-06-02
"i didnt know why but i immediately felt that something was off it didnt line up perfectly at first i suspected the colors but the art direction was so similiar i wasnt sure thank you for pointing out what exactly

on that note i found out that its the wrong universe the same time miles did my   that reveal was so good i got goosebumps and couldnt sit still totally shook",2023-07-19
"outside of references his universe isn’t tom holland the only live action spider man not shown on screen

i found that every interesting after the events of no way home almost like even the spider society has no idea what the identity of that spiderman is anymore",2023-06-03
"despite tobeys and andrew cameos being clips this movie effectively used them to explain important plot point  lore of canon events its  brilliant 



family member will die to drove us into doing good as spiderman  show tobey others are shown but tobey is the one that takes up most of the screen audience associates that with uncle aaron



police captain will die  andrew front and center audience makes the connection either miles father



its all just shown so well its the best possible way to explain canon events to the general audience because weve seen those movies",2023-06-05
relax he’s too pointy,2023-06-03
i did a double take when i saw him listed in the credits he sounds so rough and sharp that i didnt even hear isaac in that,2023-06-03
i feel like they have to live after all this otherwise the commentary especially is redundant,2023-06-02
i wish spiderpunks appearance wasnt shifting so erratically loved his look but it never stayed the same for more than a couple seconds,2023-06-02
my theatre had a disclaimer for flashing lights for this movie so i’m assuming sensitive people can probably have seizures it’s unfortunate but this was a gorgeous film to look at every frame from this movie could be a painting,2023-06-03
i never got to see into the spiderverse in the theatre so ever since the second movie was announced i’ve been planning to see it in the theatre and i just did today it looks fantastic on the big screen,2023-06-07
this trilogys main theme will ultimately be about family whether that be actual family miles parents gwens dad kingpins family in the first movie or adopted family spider society gwens peter parker etc,2023-06-04
for  real,2023-06-02
between this and arcane hailee steinfeld is absolutely killing it in the voice acting front,2023-06-02
her voice slightly breaking when she says it doesnt ends well while hanging upside down with miles shes great in this,2023-06-02

" you could hear the disappointment from the audience i was with when that “to be continued” title card showed up

id say i still think the first film is the stronger more succinct of the two and i prefer it but im all in for part 3 this one was larger more confident but a bit ramshackle for me i thought it was great but the first one is  near perfect,2023-06-02

right after i got out of the theater around midnight i threw the soundtrack on for the ride home amazing stuff metro is too good,2023-06-02
"i loved the first movie’s soundtrack but i went back and listened to it and it honestly has not aged great there’s some standouts like sunflower hide and what’s up danger but i found myself skipping more than i remembered the dckwrth and jaden songs are just straight up annoying

i really hope they dont have holland as an actual live action character in the next movie the live action easter eggs were nice as fun references but the visual difference between them and all the animated stuff really threw me out of the movie honestly hoping they got all the live action stuff out of their system and beyond will be 100 animated,2023-06-02
"while i definitely think sony and disney are in a great spot right now i think the only tangible thing here is the visual representation of the multiverse which definitely is directly from the mcu so wonder how that worked out 

as for some of the other stuff sony doesn’t need a lot of permission to do what they did here they have full and final creative control over spiderman 

one of the directors mentioned previously that the doctor strange reference is just a fun easter egg in name only it’s likely they didn’t need their permission to name drop him in that instance probably similar to how deadpool 2 kept name dropping marveldc characters eternals named dropped batman and superman or how they say captain marvel in shazam 2 if it’s just a small thing they can just say it 

for donald glover they definitely don’t need marvel’s permission to bring him back and use him how they see fit they didn’t need marvel’s permission to teleport keaton’s adrian toomes to the morbiverse 

besides the direct visual reference to the branching timeline i’d say the biggest thing to take comfort in regarding their relationship is the multiyear deal that’s finally active that brings sony content to disney",2023-06-02

"	expect a liveaction tom holland in ‘beyond the spiderverse’

i was honestly expecting this so much after the garfieldmaguire clips that i just assumed he was a voice actor for some character and i just missed it

they didn’t “really” use any marvel studios ip unless you count  lover’s prowler though so maybe the link isn’t that strong here",2023-06-02
they also announced that miles will be getting a live action movie i bet you that we get mcu spiderman 4 it introduces miles and he gets bit by the end of the movie then  get his own solo movie perhaps also as a coproduction between marvel studios and sony honestly if were lucky the spiderverse could become a staple part of the mcu the possibilities are endless,2023-06-02

and this is coming from someone who had seen every mcu content",2023-06-05

cute but spiderman is still sonys baby this is nothing new granted this is an unprecedented cooperation from two studios but when sony is ready to take spidey back away from marveldisney i’m personally not gonna be surprised but as a fan definitely would say we had been won along time ago since civil war but i acknowledge that they’re definitely not a married couple or at least not the good kind fans need to remember they’re doing whatever makes money and right now that is connectivity and multiverse sharing but like a couple that stay for the money when it’s gone they get a divorce,2023-06-03
"eternals makes references to batman and superman  guardians holiday special also references batman  if i remember correctly even this movie made a caped crusader batman reference although i suppose in this one they didnt quite do it by name the same way those other things did

just saying the name of a character is going to be completely fair use sony wouldnt need it for saying doctor strange and marvel wouldnt need it to say spiderman if its just a quick reference and theyre never actually using the likeness of the characters",2023-06-02
spiderman was referenced in multiverse of madness so quantumania definitely isn’t the first name drop outside of a spiderman movie,2023-06-02
didnt venom already cross from the sony verse into the mcu back in no way home they were already part of the same multiverse,2023-06-02

"fyi sony doesn’t need marvels permission to use donald glover as prowler 

sony owns the movie rights to all spidey characters and those actors are all on sony deals not marvel that’s why amy pascal is the one who gets questions about tom holland coming back and not feige 

they can do what they want when they want without marvels say so hence keaton showing up as vulture in morbius 

i wouldn’t take anything in a sony movie as gospel for the mcu lol",2023-06-09

 sure i expect a cameoany remote idea of putting him in action gonna make him a disabled toddler compared to animation no matter how much training he did irl",2023-06-05
i didnt understand why glover made an appearance whats his connection outside this film to the rest of it all,2023-06-05
"this is the biggest thing that is making feel weird about it i really enjoyed the film but the pacing and story structure kept distracting me 

i really thought the film was going to end right when miles teleports to earth42 and i was almost upset because they showed a lot of the spidersociety stuff in the trailers honestly wish i avoided them for this one because they gave away too much imo but they played it at every movie i went to for months lol

yes there are complete arcs and a second viewing will probably help but i agree that it kind of just ends ends with a good hook for sure though it didn’t feel like a standalone film to me which i know it isn’t but i don’t know if i can really judge this fully until beyond comes out and i don’t know how i feel about that",2023-06-02
it’s been said elsewhere here but if you view this as gwen’s movie as well there is a full story arc,2023-06-02
"by splitting it in half they are giving it a 2act structure and now we just have a looooong intermission if they cut it at the midpoint properly weve seen the intro and half of it climbing action back time we get the climax and resolution

2act structure generally ends the first act with a false victory and a change in status quo before leading into a different in tone act 2 usually darker bc thats where the climax happens that fits in here which makes sense considering it was originally one big movie that got split in half during development this movie will definitely be elevated even further with a double screening with beyond",2023-06-02
"movie had a whole first act before the title card then had another first act

i loved the film but the pacing at the end dragged on and on i feel like it could have ended at earth 42 to go straight into a to be continued",2023-06-03
they definitely could have done a little better to integrate her story so it felt like a conclusion just like thors story in infinity wars she book ended miles story more than had a true duetoragonist role they should have fully committed to that,2023-06-02
i think if you only look at miles the movie just kind of ends but if you look at gwen she has a concluded story with her dad because of her experiences with miles,2023-06-02
hes out there smelling crime then hes back in the lab,2023-06-02
atleast we dont have to wait another 4 years or so it comes out next year,2023-06-02
"miles and gwen both had emotional arcs that felt complete but in terms of the narrative  ive never been angrier at seeing to be continued

its one thing to end the movie on a scene that makes you say oh  whats going to happen and another thing to end the movie in the middle of a scene it seriously feels like they made a four hour movie and cut it randomly down the middle with no regard for how that would affect the viewing experience",2023-06-05
i completely agree other than gwen getting some character development and spot’s backstorymotivations both of which probably take a combined 2030 minutes if that the story had a very weird structure it’s clear the movie’s writers and animators had the same passion and skill but it almost feels like this movie only exists as a bridge to the third one,2023-06-11
in hindsight i think the space elevator chase is the climax of the movie and all the setup after is the denouement from that,2023-06-03
disappointment i find it refreshing af,2023-06-05
i agree this movie was phenomenal but my only critique was that the plot lacked structure like the first movie,2023-06-07
i dont know if im biased but just watch fast x if you want to see a movie that truly just ends i think spiderverse tried to end it well and set up for the next movie at least,2023-06-05
it felt like episodes of a series more than a movie,2023-06-14
it an anime episode,2023-06-02
felt to me like they wrote enough that it could have been a season then decided to cut it down enough to be two movies were just in the midseason break,2023-06-02
it actually felt episodic for me in a way,2023-06-04
also strangely the music ramped up at about 3 moments at the end that felt like it was meant to be the end of a climax,2023-06-04
im excited to watch across and beyond back to back one day,2023-06-02
it definitely felt like seeing luke and liea staring off into space at the end of empire,2023-06-02
same my biggest problem with the movie is that it ended lol,2023-06-03
theres also this preconception among audiences that animated movies should be for kids and therefore its alright if the story is bad see the mario movie every lord and miller animated movie reminds us that animated movies can be for everyone and that even kids deserve to enjoy good stories,2023-06-02
also they even managed to put in some swear words i didnt think that was allowed for pg,2023-06-02
felt like the most adult pg movie i’ve ever seen,2023-06-04
"it felt like an animated indie art house movie especially the scenes with gwen and her dad

normally you can’t get that level of experimentation in a film in a hollywood blockbuster just look at the concept art books for any disney film vs the final product but i’m very glad sony animation is the exception",2023-06-04
yup i can’t relate to how well received that recent  n boots movie was it wasn’t funny only used very childish humor and the villain was pretty good but overall the movie was like a 6510 it was ok the writing in this movie tho was just so  good the emotional story arcs the subtle jokes the clever visual jokes the voice acting this was some top shelf animation,2023-06-13
i definitely didn’t like how many times characters were interrupted from talking about backstory stuff i like hearing origins and for them to kick it aside like a joke i just wasn’t a big fan of,2023-06-02
"not to come off as a  but this movie isn’t reinventing the wheel here theirs plenty of movie’s that have done this proved to the audience that animation isn’t simply geared toward children movie’s like up shrek trilogy ice age madagascar all silly movies that come off as childish but have clear adult jokes and themes that adults get a kick out of and this isn’t even including more mature animation films like buddy below me said anything from miller or lord make that clear enough and plenty more 

no hate nor a dig just trying to say this movie isn’t doing anything special as far as that medium just seems to be this thing that anytime an animated film that comes out that is mature always have people coming out the wood work saying things like this when it’s like “bro we get it it’s been done” 

give credit to the ogs that already did it",2023-06-03
"this movie didnt have any of those corny child jokes you see in animated movies or make things more childish

it was a more mature storyline with proper character arcs

do you mean like in real movies",2023-06-02

guy in the row in front of me shouted holy  when that happened and again at the end when the to be continued showed up i also think he might have been autistic though as it looked like he was stimming constantly throughout the movie so im not mad that he shouted in the screening,2023-06-02

agreed with everything you said here but one small note the characters dont seem to move at different framerates they actually do its one of the cornerstones of spiderverses style and one of the best things it does for a long time people questioned 3d animations ability to do heavy stylization and spiderverse playing with different framerates is part of that one of my favorite examples from the first movie is that when miles and peter are swinging away from the alchemax facility peter is moving at 24fps on 1s and is smoother than miles who moves at 12fps on 2s to show his inexperience compared to peter,2023-06-02
i love that miles may be the one to break the patterns such as having a good relationship with gwen because even in the multiverse he is truly unique,2023-06-02

jefferson davis is also notoriously the name of the onetime president of the confederacy when the character was originally created for the comics somehow none of the editors caught that a few years ago in the comics jefferson changed his name to morales and made a big speech to miles about how he wanted to move away from being associated with such a disgusting historical figure i guess in movies they figured they didnt have time to get too deep with it and just changed his name,2023-06-02
it was davis he legally changed it to morales in the comics because well jefferson davis might as well be adolf  to black people,2023-06-02

"miles throws out are you actually a spiderman or something along those lines because he isnt trying to save everyone

i thought that was notable",2023-06-02
miguel had venomous fangs in the comics,2023-06-02
i have my doubts about him too but im probably biased my daughter got the 12 days of spiderman socks for christmas last year and when she opened his socks she said ahh a villain 3 year olds see the world differently,2023-06-02
miguel in comics use to bite people to stun them his venom is paralysis not lethal but it be cooler if poison was lethal lol or had brain washing ability also they removed his mind reading spidey senses that why he does not have tingle also he has special eyes,2023-06-02
my thought is that this is a miguel who was not spiderman but is faking his powers with the drugs so he could take the place of the other miguel who died,2023-06-02
glad im not the only one thinking this like could it be possible that hes some sort of inheritor,2023-06-02
i dont know the comics but i agree dude didnt even have spider powers his suit was all tech,2023-06-02
"the fangs are a spiderman 2099 trademark


also morlun doesnt have variants theres only one from earth001",2023-06-03
i personally doubt it this movie already has so many threads to tie up its gonna need every second of the sequel to do it if they introduced the inheritors as well id think it was a little much but if anyone can pull it off in a good way these movies can,2023-06-02
i keep hoping they somehow introduce the inheritorsone day my spidertotem devourer lord and savior will get to shine on the big screen,2023-06-02
its morlun time,2023-06-02
im with a morlun twist 100 it just makes the most narrative sense and it feels like they teased just enough to leave you wondering,2023-06-02
he spidey just different comic miguel has fangs,2023-06-03
i mean in the film they literally describe him as a vampire,2023-06-03
"he has fangs and a temporarily paralyzing venom just like the comics  the one thing i do not remember from comics is the injection he gave himself in this movie

nbsp

feels like hes really some vampire hybrid in this one but he wasnt in the comics",2023-06-12
“claws are you sure you’re spiderman”,2023-06-04
which is definitely addressed as uncomfortable in the movies,2023-06-02
"	a definite nono generally

is this a cultural thing beyond the ethnic angle i mean in australia its totally normal and it would be weird to call a friends dad mr smith or whatever",2023-06-06
maybe it isnt a nono in gwens dimension at least thats what i assume because she clearly wasnt trying to be rude and didnt even seem to see it as abnormal at all  no oh  i shouldnt have said that recoil or anything,2023-06-05
im in my late 30s and last year i said anna referring to my aunt and my mom scolded me so hard and oh yeah were mexican american,2023-06-06
right this movie is aggresively cool legit couldnt look away out of fear of missing a cool shot or detail,2023-06-02
they feel way more comfortable committing to what they want in this one,2023-06-02
ending caught me off guard but boi you ain’t wrong they low key caught lightning in a bottle with this one tho i low key prefer the first one and can’t wait for the 3rd,2023-06-03
more like we won an oscar and made a ton of money now we can really go all out,2023-06-05
from the start my whole theater knew “we’re staying quiet for the entirety of this thing”  this was a fantastic theater experience,2023-06-05
"this movie did the same “remember that nondescript background character he’s now the main villain” and “massive cliffhanger ending” concepts that fast x just attempted and stumbled on and did them both fantastically

also that spiderman far from home did",2023-06-02
miguels theme was amazing ive got it playing repeatedly on spotify,2023-06-02
annihilate is the best track  ,2023-06-03
pemberton is my favorite working composer he’s been crushing it for years,2023-06-04
saw two screenings—in the first the audio bothered me too in the second it wasnt bad even despite me trying to listen for what bothered me the first time go see it again in another theater ,2023-06-02
"“terrible spot”

miles when he sees spot",2023-06-03
try to find a theater who shows it with closed captions mine did so and the experience was all the more enjoyable,2023-06-03
"the audio mix was bad though did anyone else experience that it was really quiet for some reason and i struggled to hear dialogue

i saw it again today in a smaller theater without dolby surround sound and i figured it out they have all the voiceover dialogue coming from straight ahead in the soundscape that is if you were wearing quality headphones the dialogue would sound like its coming from the direction of the screen 

consequently in the theater only the very front speakers above and below the screen play the audio since most of the seating is closer to the big surround sound speakers along the sides the centerfront gets drowned out

in the smaller theater without dolby i could hear the dialogue just fine and once it comes out digitally itll be a really cool stylistic choice for the audio design bummer that it had that effect in the theater though",2023-06-07
"yeah i think thats right the mans driven by demons  

i was expecting there be a twist about his character to end this and set up for part 2",2023-06-02
i agree why would he care about a universe that isn’t his if he wanted a family he could’ve done it in his universe,2023-06-04
"we are definitely not getting the full story with him 

his canon event might be losing his daughter maybe thats why he imitated spidermans powerset maybe spiderman was his daughters favourite hero",2023-06-04
yeah i also think the same spot gone 200,2023-06-02
"mob psychos a good connection
i couldn’t stop thinking of tekkonkinkreet and the slow burn of power this was such a good build of spots potential coming to fruition",2023-06-15

what’s the video,2023-06-18
its great that pixar pushed cg animation to nearphotorealism but at a point theres no room to improve upon that im glad studios seem to be shifting back to more stylized animation even if they are all kind of chasing this particular aesthetic,2023-06-04
say it louder for the people in the back bro you’re spittin big facts here,2023-06-04
pixar movies have looked polished but plain to me for years now the first spiderverse really pushed the concept of giving cgi a handdrawn quality and less so peanuts by blue sky also showed that you can do 2d in 3d,2023-06-05
i think its because spiderverse does what its supposed to do theyre spiderman movies not mcu movies its not trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator its appealing to actual fans of spiderman,2023-06-02
what did you like about jw4 i was pretty underwhelmed by it,2023-06-02
"yeah whole movie for me really hard to decipher i barely had any idea what they were saying

accidentally went to go see it in spanish instead of english though so",2023-06-02
yes the sound mixing is nolanstyle,2023-06-02
yes 100 saw it in imax,2023-06-05
love this comment,2023-06-19
"miguel is wrong about the need of canon events to occur for the health and continued existence of the multiverse
its not the death its the lessons learned from that and miles is going to learn them in a different way

thats just your comment slightly rearranged what youre describing is exactly the point theyre trying to make but miguel is not gonna be proven right in part 2 theres a line midway through the movie where gwen asks are you sure breaking the canon will destroy the spiderverse and rather than saying yes he replies do you want to find out

the whole point of miles morales is that anyone can be spiderman and canon events arent what make him spiderman",2023-06-07
such a great detail,2023-06-06
just the way he said morales,2023-06-07
this deserves its own post maybe on the spider man sub thank you,2023-06-07
you’re doing the lord’s work may your days forever prosperous from this moment onwards,2023-06-07
bro awesome post thank you,2023-06-07
this movie reminded me why i love animation so much,2023-06-04
loved miles dodging a dozen portal punches,2023-06-06
it’s a reference to the fact that it made 1 morbillion dollars that’s why he says he’d pay good money to see it,2023-06-04
i thought it was a blade one but its probably both,2023-06-04
"i didnt expect it to be this amazing i cannot describe how spectacular this movie is

its the ultimate lol

i saw it 4 hours ago and cant sleep it was just so much more than i even hoped for cant wait to see it many more times",2023-06-03
yup i love that they focused on socialization so much in this movie family dynamics being minorities being told you don’t belong what’s like to happen when you’re in a single family household etc,2023-06-03
plus side to luckily having an alamo drafthouse in my city no talk or texting allowed,2023-06-02
"james blake hit so  hard  my biggest fear was that the soundtrack wouldnt be as amazing like wakanda forever then they just went and upped the ante at every turn giving us more sonic emotion and true plot connection than before

amazing",2023-06-02
i think talking in movie theater or texting is ,2023-06-05
is it common for people to talk in american theatres that sounds so ,2023-06-03
i love how they used the animation to help tell the story i honestly think if you took gwen and her dads last scene together removed the character models and just left the voiceover and backgrounds youd get the exact same impact,2023-06-03
what does that mean,2023-06-03
"

",2023-06-02
,2023-06-02
my arcane withdrawals have started after reading this hopefully we get a trailer at worlds this year,2023-06-02
" hot take the chase scene with all the spider people was underwhelming they went full on ready player one with trying to fit in as many easter eggs as possible instead of doing a better more interesting sequence

wow this is the best description of what held back that sequence for me its fine but just an explosion of cameo appearances that goes by so fast its hard to keep track",2023-06-03
i didnt even notice the green eyes,2023-06-02
i just realized that miles not realizing his moms eye color was different is a huge plot point,2023-06-04
"speaking of gwen i liked her expanded role in this she was a proper secondary protagonist cant wait until hailee steinfeld comes back for her other character who is also a cold socially dejected fighter with shaved sides riot please

she was the main protag for this film which is why  


plot structure was weaker than spiderverse 1 this was clearly written as one long movie that got split in two parts the ending was very abrupt and miles character didnt really evolve much compared to the start of the movie

miles will be the protagonist for the 2nd part",2023-06-06
the lego batman movie came out of nowhere its entirely possible to get a lego spiderman one,2023-06-04
immediately,2023-06-04
apparently the lego scene was animated by a 14 yo youtuber that is obsessed with legos and has his own channel if what i heard is correct the team saw it loved it and asked if he would do it for the movie which is pretty cool imo,2023-06-19
the movie seemed very quiet at my amc dolby screening today,2023-06-04
i’m betting that movie will suffer at the box office,2023-06-04
it was definitely hard to keep up with sometimes just following what exactly was happening,2023-06-02
"
also unpopular opinion but i thought the animation got a little too frantic and and made the movie feel unnecessary chaotic at certain points

this was a consistent criticism of one and a lot of us eventually got past it with the first movie  curious what multiple watches will be like imax here i come",2023-06-02
yes ive been looking for this comment staggering achievement visually but they could have exercised a little restraint and gotten significantly better results i think,2023-06-02
i think the walked the line just right like comic panels come to life,2023-06-02
i can understand that there truly is a lot going on i think early on with the fight with vulture and the 3 other spider people there were soo many styles of animation blended together that it was a little hard to keep track of sometimes even if it did look incredible,2023-06-02
yeah it was sensory overload compared to the first one,2023-06-03
"its an aggressive over abundance of style first one had just the right amount but this one is definitely too much at a lot of points 

i loved the design of spiderpunk if i could see him in a consistent colour for more than a second or two",2023-06-02
" like some parts of the opening battle there is just a lot going on

they are fighting in the guggenheim",2023-06-02
"to me it felt like this probably hot fast and chaotic things would look like if you were indeed a spiderperson fighting a villain 
like this is the action and agility the live action movies can’t depict without overblown cgi",2023-06-02
the first one made me feel like i was learning how to watch it as it unfolded liked it in the theater grew to love it on many rewatches  and across is into on crack  loved this one from the first frame cant wait to see how much better it plays going forward  this movie is art and art generally has to be studied  appreciated the more you look at a beautiful painting the better it gets  theres so much going on here its impossible to get it all on opening night,2023-06-02
agreed i mainly noticed it during the first fight with vulture after that though everything flowed pretty seamlessly,2023-06-02
"the animation got a little too frantic and and made the movie feel unnecessary chaotic at certain points

yes

and the nolanist crescendo nonending music",2023-06-02
she’s drumming for the first battle though it complements a frantic fight,2023-06-02
i thought this as well and i loved the movie just too much going on to even focus on in that first 20 minutes felt a bit dizzy,2023-06-02
they definitely dialed up the stylization to 11 on this one like in the first one they would have a halftone texture on the left 18th and a cross hatch texture on the right 18th of a characters face but here everything gets a special texture or stylization i dont necessarily think thats a good or bad thing but i was thinking it might get to be too much for some viewers,2023-06-03
i love spider punk but man is hard to look at sometimes,2023-06-21
"it’s easy to get lost in the sauce there is consistently so much happening on the screen it works most of the time but there are definitely a few scenes where there is just so much to look at

the heart to heart between gwen and her dad was probably the worst offender of this it’s supposed to be this intimate moment between them and the backgrounds are just popping off with constantly changing colours and designs it was a bit distracting",2023-06-02
it definitely was chaotic i loved it but i was pretty exhausted after it was all over,2023-06-10
yea made me feel old the pacing is perfect for adhd really dug it but some of it seemed unnecessary the vulture design felt too sloppy couldnt make out what was happening always like it was a close up jason bourne “action” thing the first film was perfect in its animation changes,2023-06-02
" also unpopular opinion but i thought the animation got a little too frantic and and made the movie feel unnecessary chaotic at certain points like some parts of the opening battle there is just a lot going on

i saw some of my acquaintance in my circle also said about this i can understand where it came from though especially for people who wear glasses

but they said it is a minor complaint and nitpicky",2023-06-02
i actually think if it wasn’t like that then kids might be bored with the story which was definitely a little more mature than the kind of thing that’d interest the age group at my screening,2023-06-02
yeah i felt like i was missing a lot of cool sequences especially during the spot fights because they were too frenetic to comfortably keep up with,2023-06-06
if we dont get emissary of  spiderman and leopardon we riot,2023-06-04
i can’t tell if s or not but what are you talking about with miguel being the only straight man spiderman,2023-06-02
"miles even gets a full arc in this movie the entire end where they set up the next part is basically one long stinger building it up they didnt just smash cut to spiderpeople will return they gave us time to learn about the next situation got the teams set up got the stakes set

the first movie was about coming to terms with your power this movie was about parentchild relationships while growing into your own person and the cost of power and  say it with me  the great responsibility that comes with power the next movie is going to be about embracing who you are",2023-06-03
no yeah it’s definitely a great ending and a great cliffhanger the reaction people are giving is because it’s a cliff hanger they have to wait for also despite it being online it wasn’t widely known that this was going to be a 2 parter to be honest this is the same reaction that empire strikes back got too when it released in theaters which is what the team behind atsv was going for,2023-06-02
its not gwens film she the colead but miles is the main lead of all 3 films thats why his arc is not done yet her arc is done like peter b arc was done in part 1,2023-06-02
"liveaction pandering

i meanthis is a story about the spiderman multiverse where even earth616 makes an appearance

while it caught me off guard of course youre gonna see glimpses of the liveaction films too i dont get how thats pandering to each their own",2023-06-02
 mech here is more like it was in the comics my guess is that the team wanted a more original design in the first movie instead of something clearly derivative of an eva either that or this is their way of showing things getting more serious by having peni upgrade to a lesscutesy robot,2023-06-04
man im just hoping peni parker doesnt end up in a hospital,2023-06-05
"i really hope gwen will have a lot of focus in beyond too 
i think she will considering she was the second mc here and the 3rd movie was meant to be part of across the spiderverse 
she stole the show a lot of times at the movie and they finally did her justice",2023-06-02
" honestly didnt expect gwen to essentially be the protagonist here i wonder if thatll also carry over to beyond

i feel like well get miguel as the protagonist in beyond i reckon  get a redemption arc with spot  other spiderman villains as the true antagonists and  be framed as a protagonist so we can go on that journey with him",2023-06-03
and they make a joke about it,2023-06-04
does every movie have to have endless representation,2023-06-02
"apparently audiomixing in general has been a widespread issue w this movie in theatres for some reason pairing that with him already talking a lot lower and with an accent and yeah he was hard to follow 

shame because he was one of my fav parts in the movie i’m hoping there’s some sort of resolve to whatever caused the audio issue before my next rewatch",2023-06-02
i stopped trying to understand him after like a minute of his screen time i accepted i didnt know what he was saying and just tuned it out lol,2023-06-02
ha no ive seen plenty of kaluuya and this is the only time i struggled to understand him,2023-06-03
there were some showings near me that had closed captioning and i left the theater really wishing i had picked one of those screenings,2023-06-02
sooo miguel saying doctor strange and some nerd in 19999 means tom hollands peter parker doesnt exist in that universe and the multiverse acknowledge it whoa,2023-06-02
agreed i cant call it a masterpiece because its an incomplete story right now,2023-06-02
probably the bluest my balls have ever been at the end of a movie got ,2023-06-05
yeah ive had to warn everyone i know because otherwise i loved it,2023-06-05
wakanda forever next to all that garbage is a sin i dont care if you werent amazed or anything it has far more heart and emotion than the rest of those,2023-06-02
you didn’t like black panther i thought it was great mom was fine the rest yeah fair,2023-06-02
did you catch the morbius joke,2023-06-02
i cant believe some people actually think the flash has a chance in  to be good on any level,2023-06-14
"yeah but the flash will be forever tainted because of ezra millers 

also most of those mcu movies you listed aint even that bad not perfect but theyre not the abominations the internet tries to make you believe",2023-06-04
come on now dont lump mom in with all that trash,2023-06-02
doctor strange 2 was great,2023-06-02
"wakanda forever and to a lesser extent lt were both great imo

but i agree about guardians 3 and this this is probably the best comic book movie ever though how well the second half goes will greatly affect that",2023-06-02
black panther wasn’t bad it just wasn’t remarkable the rest is… yeah,2023-06-04
honestly yeah after all the memes seeing that was pure comedy rather than emotional,2023-06-07
yeah i hate when they show long text on screen that you obviously cant read in the split second its shown unless you were looking directly at that spot already,2023-06-04
absolutely buying this when it hits digital cant wait to frame by frame it,2023-06-03
some people have theorized he killed his alternate reality self of maybe he was the uncle ben type figure who died as part of the canon event,2023-06-04
i genuinely thought he was injecting himself to keep his vampirism at bay,2023-06-05
"that’s so cool

this is why going to the movies rules",2023-06-10
"nah not weird at all this series did literally say anyone can wear the mask 

sorry about the job hope you find a better one soon",2023-06-19
"that movie impacted me emotionally that no other movie has before

vittorio de sica just got sadder",2023-06-02
i think the computer girl tricked him or he’s hiding something else because he seems pretty sinister,2023-06-04
"i think beyond will show the story of how they met

actually cant wait show much i hope they cover",2023-06-04
i’ll say i wasnt extremely happy with his use in this film and i was someone who has staunchly said peter b is my favorite peter portrayal since into the spiderverse came out hopefully we get more in the sequel to justifyexplain him cause having him be ok with miles’ dad having to die and not trying to save him cause of a “this is how it has to be” just feels kinda weak,2023-06-05
the baby powder apology was funny too some great dark humor,2023-06-04
i made a mistake,2023-06-05
but why did peter and the rest of the spiders for that matter switchup now hes trying to save the whole world by letting one person die without trying to find a way to do both feels very unlike spiderman imo the movie was freakin incredible btw this is my only real gripe with it,2023-06-04
they barely showed this years ones,2023-06-05
someone mentioned that miguel refers to him as that skinny nerd because no one remembers who he is,2023-06-04
"just watched it again in the first scene we see him with a cape remember spiderman doesnt wear capes in the original and he gets attacked by the vulture gwens spider sense warns her but he has no idea

i never put it together with the claws but youre exactly right hes definitely the prowler and you might have even got this motivation right 

i think him and prowler miles might team up  

also peter says look this will  miguel when showing baby pictures the wording feels like foreshadowing",2023-06-07
"i noticed that he had a ton of creepy spider traits — he has fangs and his webs are red and when they were talking about the spider verse he explained how they’re all connected by a big web aka trapped hello

but then we saw him injecting himself with spider venom to keep his powers and one of those powers is trapping people in those red cage things 

i’m not saying miguel is a literal spider who is feeding off of all the spider people but something is definitely up",2023-06-07
who are you the writer dont be spoiling such obvious details for the next film,2023-06-08
the movie opened up with gwen and focused on her within the first 2030 mins of the movie for a reason this was pretty much her movie was miles was a side character her arc was wrapped up by the end with her and her dad making up,2023-06-02
"only the minority on reddit general audiences arent gonna be as willing to give this a pass

i was absolutely loving this film even tho im not as enamored by multiverse stuff as many on here seem to be the cliffhanger soured my experience immediately  comprehensively 

i went into this pretty much completely blind had i known this was meant as the first part of a whole my viewing experience wouldve been immensely different",2023-06-02
the sound mix and my american brain having a hard time with strong cockney accents doesnt help,2023-06-06
the sound mix is a problem,2023-06-06
the dialogue wasnt loud enough im british so i understood what he was saying when i could hear it i had trouble hearing some of gwens and pavitrs lines as well,2023-06-18
i caught that and my friend didnt really thought that would come back into play,2023-06-08
yh this is what mom should have been like,2023-06-11
"maybe its just part of them seeing miles as independent still though yeah youd think the cop dad would get the police looking for him 

i think the scene would have made more sense if gwen revealed she was spider woman but then that robs miles of telling his parents about himself which is no doubt going to be important in 3",2023-06-10
it’s like that in all super hero movies we understandable give the characters a lot of leeway since we know they’re off doing super hero stuff l but it doesn’t  work if you really put yourself in the viewpoint of the  characters around our hero like why would his mother even unground him because he’s talking about himself in these weird metaphors about how he has stuff to figure out with “people” obviously he’s out doing drugs,2023-06-09
i mean what are they gonna do to gwen to make her answer,2023-06-10
right to be a spiderperson is to suffer while still trying to make life better for others its such a selfless and miserable life,2023-06-11
"a few things i noticed on my third viewing

on earth 1610 jeff rio and miles al have brownishorange eyes on earth 42 rio’s eyes are green while miles has a mix of brown and green

this may have been pointed out but there was a good parallel when miles catches gwen when he gets to mumbattan and when gwen catches miles during the chase there’re essentially the same shot",2023-06-12
that opening confused me with the flashforwards as it showed events from the movie cant tell if its just a teaser for the film that means nothing or if its actually set after beyond but that doesnt make sense,2023-06-11
i like how both parents went out of their way to mention they were well off and american but the guidance counselor still insisted they portray themselves as struggling immigrants,2023-06-16
well technically mcu peter also tried this the universe also almost imploded there as well if not for strange which is canon to this film,2023-06-02
"you are telling me that no one else tried to avoid the lose lose situation and succeed

i think part of the point is that every single spiderman tries but without exception they all fail because spiderman can never have it all

of course miles will be the exception because hes the anomaly hes writing his own story and inspiring others to do the same and thats what his whole arc has been so far",2023-06-02
"that no one else tried to avoid the lose lose situation and succeed


did anyone else find out about it ahead of time",2023-06-02
the multiverse is infinite right i didn’t see an infinite amount of spiderpeople my theory is that miguel only had the people that would let the canon events happen into the spidersociety that would also explain why he’s so picky about who gets in and who doesn’t,2023-06-02
i mentioned this in another thread but every spidey with the exception of miles and hobie was really disappointing was sad to see the original film’s cast reduced to little or ignored completely,2023-06-02
i thought miguel explaining that loselose situation was just a fake out to actually killing miles because his existence as spiderman is an anomaly,2023-06-02
i think the point is that theyve all effectively convinced themselves that that was the way it had to be as a way of dealing with the trauma,2023-06-05
“it’s rude to stare”,2023-06-03
which was similar to giving birth right right,2023-06-03
i understand i would garner so much hate too if i got hit like that,2023-06-02
gwen confronting her dad was the main climax miles admitting who he was to his mom was the secondary climax but we get robbed of the catharsis of it by the ending,2023-06-03
yeah i don’t necessarily need every plot thread to be wrapped up but i prefer it when movies have some kind of conclusion infinity war is a good example that’s clearly part one of a two part movie but that movie still feels like it has an ending fundamentally the plot of infinity war is thanos is trying to collect the infinity stones so he can  half the universe and at the end of the movie he does that so it feels like at least that part of the plot was wrapped up,2023-06-03

" maybe its the superior medium to tell these stories in 

kinda feeling thats the case my brain hasnt really accepted mr fantastic from the fantastic four and his powers looking good in any of his multiple liveaction depictions but my brain would probably accept it in animated its easier to tap into and accept the silliness of superheroing and really have fun with it in a way i think",2023-06-07

"someone in the audience yelled out  

 on pride month too",2023-06-03
i enjoyed it but narratively it didnt live up to the first one visually stunning but i felt it dragging on at times,2023-06-05
that moment is clearly part of miles character arc in finding his confidence and carving his own path he is unable to tell his mom the truth in that moment so he backs off but later in the film after running from the spider society he completed it and reveals to rio that he is spiderman even if that ends up being not his mom i dont get how you can say its not a real moment,2023-06-02
"the issue all stems from it being too decompressed imo if sony gave them a fixed 25 hour run time and 1 movie this whole plot could have been condensed into 15 hours and would be much tighter 

they were given free reign here and while its great in some aspects you can tell they were having so much fun showing off all the cool animation and they should have left some things on the cutting room floor",2023-06-03
man i’m totally with you this movie was fun but just had so much going on and the pacing was clunky as  maybe my opinion will change seeing it in tandem with beyond but right now my first impression is it’s not as tightly written as the first,2023-06-03
"and miles says mom im and someone in the audience yelled out  and people laughed because its not a real moment it had no gravity

that was definitely not the vibe in my theater and you could tell people loved the twist as soon as they figured it out with miles",2023-06-03
i have no problem with people not liking the movie i loved it but if your best example of a moment not working is because a  in your audience yelled something out that speaks pretty highly of the movie,2023-06-05
that moment didnt have gravity and the homophobia toward it helped justify that for you what on earth,2023-06-03
yup same thing happened in my theater every kid was not remotely attached to any of those scenes because they were hack ,2023-06-05
it really sounded like he was about to come out lol,2023-07-03
why did it not have any gravity,2023-06-03
people can have conversations about emotions in film its how filmmakers can get their audiences to empathize and connect with characters which is what the purpose of that scene was it also illustrates the conflict miles has with family which is one of bigger motifs of the film l i dont feel it killed any pacing,2023-06-02

pib 2 and the new tmnt are clearly spiderverse inspired literally revolutionizing the industry with a 100m budget that blows away the monstrously bloated budgets weve been seeing recently,2023-06-03
plus why miles being left in the unspiderman universe at the end is a shock too now hes in a world where theres not even a spider man,2023-06-02
normally i hate the meta stuff but they actually use the concepts of meta and canon pretty  well,2023-06-03

it was actually my favorite part of the movie surprisingly enough some people complained of her dialogue in the beginning being hard to hear so sony has actually sent out an updated version to all theaters its the perfect chance to watch it again,2023-06-10
im sorry to say that it was the best part of the film ,2023-06-10

"agreed  like you say all thats left for part 2 is the climax im worried it will just be a few action set pieces then over 

they should have added 10 more mins to this to at least resolve the danger with miles dad then leave miguel and spot as the villains to deal with for the sequel",2023-06-02

sorry if it’s not cohesive this is my first time trying to like explain something i noticed in a movie,2023-06-10
i couldnt understand everything but the few bits i heard were gold,2023-06-13

when you can see hes about to spark the chain yeah hes not just going to be fazed by these guys anymore   i cant wait til the next one,2023-06-25
"i don’t like how all of the spiderpeople are so quick to side with miguel spiderman is a hero that standsup for the little guy and always tries to save every person it doesn’t make sense to me that miles is the only spiderperson to hold this ideology

lots of spoilers ahead so even though this is a spoilers allowed thread ill spoiler tag some of it

first off theres selection bias these are the spiders who were chosen to be part of miguels strike force across literally infinite universes there may have been plenty who were never recruited or quit because they wouldnt go along with his plan

and several of them do side with miles gwen gets together a whole little gang at the end to back him up the one spider lady could have stopped miles escape by rebooting the system like miguel asked her to when the robot was sending him home but she refused spiderpunk peaced out early peter b parker refused to help catch miles and i dont know how seriously a lot of the other spidermen were really trying to catch him they seemed suspiciously unmotivatedunable to keep up with miles than youd expect for superpowered spidermen

also keep in mind that in universe this is literally 15 minutes after miles stopped a canon event to save captain singh and a universe devouring quantum black hole appeared that definitely makes miguels case way more credible that hes not just being paranoid or controlling when youve seen billions of innocents die like these spidermen are implied to have you have to take it seriously 

finally none of the spidermen were watching civilians die at that moment they were just letting miguel imprison miles i would wager many of them wanted to confront spot themselves as a group and see how things unfold before deciding their course and miles was a dangerous anomaly wildcard  hes literally a spiderman thats not supposed to exist in any dimension  they wanted off the table so they could handle the situation 

that doesnt prove all the spiderman would have been willing to just let the civilians die when the time came for spots attack after all they were all furiously fighting to take spot down in pavitrs universe and stop him absorbing collider energy not just miles 

given all the circumstances i could see why its not ooc for many of the spider men refusing to free miles in the situation and i dont think theres necessarily as many of them unreservedly on miguels side as it appears at first either",2023-06-04
feel like they’re saving it for the conclusion,2023-06-11
"im with you as an art form its an absolute masterpiece but i was gonna puke by the end if i heard anything more about being a parent i dont mind emotional scenes but jeez it was getting a bit too much every other scene being a confrontation with parents or something like that

incredibles 2 did the same thing and completely lost the vibe of their first movies overall i liked the first movie better i felt like this movie reallly slowed down after the first fight scene until the hq scene",2023-06-04
" sony knew the audio mixing was bad

so i didnt imagine it  i had a little trouble with hearing some of the initial spidergwen narration but otherwise everything afterwards seemed fine",2023-06-03
"the pacing was very odd the film perfectly set up the climax everyone converging on the spot in miles earth to defeat himpotentially save miles dad

thenmiles is kidnapped by altmiles the film makes it clear miles isnt in danger gwen  forms a team boom movie over come back for the third act next year feels like the writingideas got out of control on this one but we shall see how the next one plays out i guess",2023-06-05
agreed dont see how people are saying this is better than the first when that one had pitch perfect pacing and a great story,2023-06-03
i dont necessarily agree that a three plot structure is needed the movie opens with gwen narrating miles story and ends with her recruiting spiderpeople to help save him the whole movie kind of acts like gwen telling miles story both to her new band and the audience as it wrestles with what canon is and what it does for spiderman as a character miles not wanting to conform to the canon was a nice continuation of his struggle with living up to the spiderman he wants to be instead of doing his own thing,2023-06-03
"i agree with you regarding plot graphics is fine… it’s a pretty movie with lots of eye candy the core story is the same old one man against the world story and you know miles will win at the end because he’s got plot armour and not because he’s right — as audience we are not given enough information yet to determine if he’s right but you know there’ll be a plot twist somewhere in the next movie … just when everything seems lost and miles start doubting if his decision was too selfish or  something miraculous would happen and save the day i feel almost tired just thinking about watching the next movie 

if this wasn’t a movie miles’ quest would have likely been questioned and tested numerous times are all the other spider entities zombies and proven impossible maybe he could still try but at what cost the whole spiderman thing is about power and responsibility 

i imagine if i had liked the characters enough i’d be interested to find out “how” they accomplish the impossible none of the interactions between the characters seem real to me as breathtaking as some of the scenes are in the end the characters’ speeches are just a collection of cliches including the parents you have some nice stereotypes who are funny cute and very visually appealing but that doesn’t make them human",2023-06-11
"the only fanservice was all the cameos when miles first went to the spider society and some more when they explain canon i watched the films back to back and i think this one has more poses because miles and peter b parker only got their  together at the end of the first film the skilled characters posed all the time

i agree about the three act structure not being there the movie basically opens with a short film about gwen too didnt bother me though",2023-06-03
"i mean a major plot point is a pretty blatant critique of repetitive unimaginative storytelling with the whole breaking canon aspect so kind of makes sense for the movie to subvert standard 3 act structure now i understand that being different to just be different isnt always good in the end this movie did follow pretty standard 2nd movie of a trilogy ending the ending is very similar in style to the empire strikes back


and if you look at the movie as gwens movie it has a more typical ark the movie even starts in gwen she has conflict with her father runs away from home and finds a new family when miles comes into the fold she has to choose between her new family and her friend she is able to find her way make amends with her father and realizes she chooses miles",2023-08-10
"iirc miguels universe was a one off and didnt affect other realities 

im miless case his being bitten led to his peter parker dying which led to kingpin activating his collider which is what led to the sudden spike in anomalies if miles wasnt there its assumed that peter stops kingpin that first night

of course we dont know if miguel is being upfront about all of his intentions but thats how its presented",2023-06-02
"as a life long spiderman fan i am truly sick of spiderman unable to grow and get his life together i have no idea why marvel is so insistent that spiderman always needs to be reset and always lose im as sick of always loses spiderman as i am of highschool spiderman

just let my boy have his hot modelactress wife and some stability its not fun or funny anymore to see a genuinely good person constantly lose",2023-06-02
but since they showed the timeline like in loki i think its along the same lines as that show  because his peter died it created an alternate timeline where miles is the new spiderman and needs to experience his uncle ben dying to become what spiderman is in the movies  in another universe 42 spider was never sent to earth 1610 and miles wasnt saved by peter therefore defeating green goblin and not being killed by kingpin,2023-06-04
every film is not going to be this good dont get you hopes up,2023-06-04

"miles walks in when the guidance counselor tells his parents that you can’t have your cake and eat it too with miles saying something like “unless you bake two cakes”

later miles has to get two cakes for his dads party 

the crux of the canon event is that you cannot save everyone you have to choose whether you want to have your cake or whether you want to eat it unless the end result is that you bake two cakes receive help from other spidermen",2023-06-07

how was the mix as a whole i thought the old mix was fine as long as the cinema played it loud otherwise it was too quiet

they just gotta recreate the  fighting scene in the spider verse,2023-06-25
what did you just say,2023-06-25
great points,2023-07-10
im with you the last third of the movie after miles was told he was the anomaly was so stretched out id be happier with this if they put part 1 in the title and cut this down to two hours,2023-06-03
have to partly agree to be continued movies usually never sit right with me and this one definitely didnt the whole plot was fairly straight forward and i dont think it warrants an entire movie to fighting the spot or i dont see how they can drag it out for another 2 hours but well see i guess,2023-06-05
"i thought gwen was done well but miles was annoying
 even though they were similar tired of this rebellious my parents dont get it annoying teenager thing",2023-06-03
yeah i felt the character development was pretty not great either i dont really care about any of the new miles and co affiliates because all they got was  one liners,2023-06-14
its just not feasible to put it all into one movie without losing every that makes it good wed all be wishing it was longer if it was,2023-06-04
the climax was gwens conversation with her father climax doesnt have to mean action scene,2023-06-04
this movie is anything but a cash grab sony basically gave endless leash to phil lors and chris miller to make this movie including a 100m budget for this first part and like 5 years to make it i think they truly wanted this to be too parts frankly i cant think of more than like 10 minutes id want cut from this movie if they had to cut stuff and that would make it feel rushed so its the right choice cramming too much into one movie makes a bad movie,2023-06-03
i think youre kind of missing the point on miles for lack of a better term coming out to his mom  the emotional character arc wasnt about his parents knowing or not knowing that was more gwens arc it was about him growing into the confidence and self assuredness to own his identity as spiderman and not need to keep it a secret  it was a person vs self style conflict that was resolved before the rug was pulled out from under him  he got the emotional payoff because the conflict wasnt about what his parents were going to say it was a self acceptance conflict which was in contrast with gwen where she didnt have much of a choice to tell her father  her emotional arc was in learning to confront that with him  miles was resolving something within himself gwen was resolving something with another person  theyre contextually similar conflicts but different in a storytelling sense,2023-06-02
do you really expect marvel fans to have any sense of maturity,2023-06-02
the melodrama is indeed drawn out it felt like just a big exposition for the next movie first one was myles better ,2023-06-05
it reminded me of the end of the 2nd hobbit movie like it felt padded to get it the length it was then to be continue’d when it felt like it could have wrapped up in 20 more minutes,2023-06-05
this my  it was a joke also i really do not give a monkey  about on screen romances and thats all this movie was at its core,2023-06-04
hard disagree,2023-06-03
disagree too i think those were the best part,2023-06-03
see a lot of people echoing your sentiment it will be interesting to see how the movie ages on people the empire strikes back had very similar responses from audiences when it first came out and now is regarded as possibly the best of the trilogy,2023-08-10
let me just grab some cash from the atm machine and i’ll join you,2023-06-02
"extremely boring for half the film

start and end of the movie were alright but the middle 50 was bad",2023-06-07
yea the first movie was dense in content every line seemed to matter it feels like this movies spends too much time on fanservice and nothing got resolved,2023-06-07
thank  i’m not alone in some bizarro world  it was interesting and had some cool details but this cliffhanger sequel is not touching the first,2023-06-07
this all set up and no pay off perhaps with the next film it will all come together but as a standalone film it was mid,2023-06-20
nah,2023-06-07
mine also clapped,2023-06-03
"could also be that they had those heroes but without spiderman filling his unique niche of way outclassing his rogues gallery in pure power and ability nyc simply had villains that were too powerful for local heroes and the big heroes were distracted until the damage was done 


spiderman is pretty unique in being a very powerful hero that largely focuses on just his home area and in doing so he might be making comicsnyc appear much safer than it would be with anyone else trying to fill his role",2023-06-07
i felt this too lol,2023-06-03
"also most of the anomalies have been people from other universes stopping canon events from happening or popping into another universe but what happens if someone from their own universe stops a canon event from happening i don’t think it would break the web

gwen’s actions made her dad quit the force and that didn’t have any lasting consequences on her world so i think there are more options miguel isn’t seeing because he’s been blinded by his grief of losing his daughter from another universe",2023-06-04
"wow thats a great way of putting it and actually your comment actually made me rethink some of gwens lines and her perspective through the film i brain dumped it here maybe this was obvious to others but your line about you think you know the rest made it click for me

in her opening monologue gwen says you think you know the rest i thought i knew the rest and at the end she says to miles parents one thing ive learned from miles its all possible at first these seem like trite cliches but in fact they make sense in the context of what she discovers throughout the film from miles

at the beginning of the film gwen leaves her father after she reveals her identity and he fails to accept her she feels hopeless i dont know how to fix this and runs away after joining the spider society she evidently comes to accept that she needs to let her father die when he becomes a police captain when the spider verse is being explained to miles he asks her what about your father isnt he about to be captain and she cannot manage to say anything but  yeah

why would she accept this well all the other spiders have resigned to it including those she looks up to and counts as her friends in the same scene we see that peter was with miguel when miguel failed to save his new world and his daughter disappeared in his arms if you break enough cannon save enough captains you could lose it all isnt that right peter again peter cannot bring himself to say anything but yeah he must have said the same thing to gwen at some point all the other spiders seem resigned in their own way even hobie the anarchists response is evasion and denial what of it what else was gwen supposed to do

so what changes when miles arrives he cant give up you cant ask me not to save my own father  im not asking at first even gwen is not on his side although she argues against locking him up by force only hobie is use the palms we see her confliction in the chase sequence jess says i know hes your friend but its the only way  but my gut says  then use your head this conflict also explains even better why gwen couldnt explain things to miles you knew you all knew  i didnt know how to explain it to you on top of not being allowed to and not even being allowed to visit him she could barely admit it to herself so how could she explain it to him

and finally when miles escapes gwen begins to come around to his perspective do you know what happens if you break the cannon  do you want to find out even when the others dont back her up peter wanna back me up on this one  well ok as the father of a daughter and the son of a mother  and youre wrong jess tell him hes wrong  hes not  are you serious right now she is resolved well im not coming  youre right  what

and what specifically happened that made her realise its all possible when she came out fully to her father i tried so hard to wear this mask like you would want me too and her father decides to quit then arrest me dad  i cant  why not  because i quit and importantly he hadnt decided to quit while gwen was missing what when gwen appears confused because this is not how things are meant to go its not how the cannon is meant to go  about half way through your big speech between gwen and her father this is the moment when they reconcile but for gwen specifically its one more thing she realises that she doesnt have to give up on her father dying and she never did

this is what miles gave her that no one else did in the spider society her finally sticking up for miles is in a bit of a round about way what got her sent home and what got her to reconcile with her father and by reconciling with her father and him quitting she realises she can save him after all thanks to miles conviction  no super powers or super strength required like she said at the beginning of the film you think you know the rest i thought i knew the rest but she doesnt and no one does",2023-06-06
they had her section of the frame painted in cool tones and her dads end at the door in an inviting warm light and when they hugged the colors bled through into both spaces and during their ending reconciliation when gwen was giving her meltdown speech to her dad the background colors started dripping a la wet paint visual storytelling o7,2023-06-06
its actually a snippet of the upcoming spidey game,2023-06-06
"i noticed that instantly but what is more interesting is in that game miles morales also exists as a playable character   


which means anyone else playing the game in miles universe will know hes spiderman",2023-06-06

yep  you could take any given frame and hang it on the wall,2023-06-12
just had my 4th watch today lol,2023-06-15
i see your point but i think theres no way miles would have agreed to be a bystander while his father dies,2023-06-18
apparently this sub deletes any extraneous comicbook movie content you probably saw the post in the morning when the mods hadnt waken up yet its bummer that they dont make exceptions for posts that have a lot of discussion and upvotes,2023-06-24
i didn’t even think of that and i love the wire… so many details in this movie,2023-06-25
i would freakin love if hes got a decent part in the beyond being the spiderman that beat the spot and being suspiciously absent from across it just has to happen,2023-06-25
supposedly they got more spideys in the tank for beyond we didnt see some of the ones from posters etc like japanese spiderman with the other showsgames spideys present i can easily imagine them throwing in even more fanservice for the finale,2023-06-27
"im with you brother

and i want to preemptively say that this is the best animated trilogy ever beating toy story kung fu panda and httyd",2023-06-03
as someone who solidly rated into the spiderverse as a top 5 movie of all time for me personally esp considering i’m not a big comic book guy and was reluctantly dragged to the theatre to see the first one i rate across the spiderverse as a top 3 movie all time the animation the storyline the emotions i felt through this movie as someone whose parents are very similar to miles’s totally blew me away even with incredibly high expectations and the day i can eat a  edible and rail the spiderverse trilogy back to back will be the day i am a complete man,2023-06-03
"also miles is just an anomaly i’m calling it

they literally said that in the movie",2023-06-02
"yea pretty easy to see since miles is anomaly he doesn’t have to fit in the cannon of spiderman so he can save his father and not break reality

i wonder if spiderman 2099 has something to hide",2023-06-02
not to mention he already had one canon event why does he have to endure a second tragic family death feel like they should explain that,2023-06-02
yeah and his uncle already died his peter already died and theyre gonna  off his father too,2023-06-02
there are at least 3 miles out there game one comic one movie one so hes not alone i walked out and told the gf there will be multiple miles,2023-06-02
but his father is not in earth 42,2023-06-03
could also just be that his is the “canon” captain in his universe instead of captain stacy,2023-06-02
the general probalem with that entire plot point is that he was meant to be spiderman because that is exactly what happened,2023-06-04
"the thing is the circumstances of his dads death in the vision spot gives him dying saving a collapsing child from rubble is too much of a coincidence to the point it would heavily suggest its a canon thing

as one of the other spidermen points out they dont know it would destroy the canon but miguel doesnt want to find out",2023-06-05
audio was a problem in mine as well,2023-06-02
im with you there it feels like i cant judge this film as a whole because we didnt get a whole film,2023-06-02
"i do not think these elements came together for me in a coherent way as a movie

i hate that i have to say i agree it did so much right but it just didnt fit together for me either",2023-06-03
sure but the spiderverse 1 ran so spiderverse 2 could jump into outer  space and do a backflip,2023-06-02
really surprised to hear that,2023-06-07
totally agree i think you summed up my issues with this movie as well the first movie is better just by virtue of being a full and complete story if this movie had followed that trend it would be better than the first but instead we only got to see act i and ii of a good movie not a satisfying feeling at all,2023-06-02
sure but the flashpoint paradox is a preexisting comic and animated movie,2023-06-02
they did say it back in 2021 but i was still mad at the to be continued ,2023-06-02
"i mean the first trailer did have “part one” in the title 

it seems they decided to drop the part onetwo titles some point further down the line similar to infinity warendgame",2023-06-02
"i mean as long as you enjoyed the movie does it really matter a good cliff hanger can be good if you went in knowing the movie would have a cliffhanger then you go in expecting nothing to matter as theres more coming 

rather get a great story spread over 2 films  then rushing and ending here",2023-06-11
i agree to be continued is a horrible way to end this at least with infinity war thanos won yeah its not what we wanted to see but thats a valid conclusion to the story,2023-06-04
"thats kinda how actual comic book stories end itd be meaningless to end it post that specific fight the fight of the 3rd act was miles vs all the spidermen 

i do agree with the animation piece it did lose itself a bit but it was still an awesome visual spectacle in my opinion",2023-06-02
i watched it thinking it would be more of the first and i think i still have to warm up to the fact that its a very different movie with a very different style it didnt meet my expectations but i dont know if thats good or bad yet,2023-06-06
"not even close into the spiderverse is a perfect movie

i was enjoying across the spiderverse for most of its run except for some overt fanservice but the ending alone should automatically disqualify the argument that its a better movie thanks the first it literally just cuts out before the final climax
that put a real sour taste in my mouth",2023-06-12
it’s better,2023-06-03
the first movie was written without real plans for a sequel hence why it was a cohesive story a majority of people didnt see the twist coming and this sub confirms that good on you for seeing it but i think how they did it was for the 99 of people,2023-06-04
definitely feels like they stretched a second act out so they could spin the third into a whole movie,2023-06-05
good movie but def overhyped,2023-06-05
facts,2023-06-04
let them cook,2023-06-02
" the  spider therapy scene was in bad taste and mocks something many of us who are either in or need therapy it wasnt funny it was insulting

i think its mocking the fact that everyone is so overly familiar with the spiderman origin story by now rather than people in therapy in general as someone whos used therapy before and seen it help others im really struggling to see the personal attack",2023-06-05
"definitely not bloated with fanservice if you were to say that for no way home i could somewhat see your point but even then “bloated” is a strong and wrong word choice 

i don’t really see what u can trim down in the movie maybe some gwen solo scenes to make it more concise but i thought the pacing was masterful the movie didn’t drag at all and the 2hr 20min runtime went by like a breeze 

i don’t really think there was that much exposition dumping some parts sure because it’s necessary sometimes but for the most part they balanced show don’t tell well enough only part they didn’t was the beginning mom and miles rooftop scene but that was still a touching mom and son moment 

the cliffhanger ending was much better than i thought it sucks it had to end there but it could have ended at a way more blue balls spot they could have ended it right when miles and the audience realized that the earth miles went to wasn’t his home and that would have been an even more cliffhanger ending 

“if you can’t tell a complete story in three hours you’re doing it wrong” i’m sorry but prior to this i was at least able to respect ur opinions but this is probably the dumbest opinion i’ve seen on rmovies 

yes because all directorsfilmmakers aim to do  similarly all the time and always s if you want a self contained movie just go watch the first one again if they did another self contained story again people would compare it way more critically against the first since it would appear similar to the first this was the best course of action for a sequel it doesn’t detract or take away from the first one it builds upon the universe and continues the story in logical ways that make sense to all the characters motivations 

were you just not aware this is a part 1 movie infinity war is one of the greatest superhero movies of all time and is a golden standard for superhero storytelling and is also a part 1 i’m tired of the 95 of superhero films building up the villain and killingdefeating them within the same single film it’s lazy and predictable and completely waters down the respective stories 


you say it’s a mess but it was pretty easy to follow in terms of story and narrative it’s pretty obvious considering the start of the film that this movie is about gwen’s character development as much as it is the new conflicts and miles it didn’t just jump around each scene transition made logical sense relative to the story and the settings 

i’m depressed and have been to therapy it was a lighthearted scene and you’ve got to be really embedded in cognitive distortions such as black and white thinking to think that it was in bad taste 


idk the only real solid critique you offered was the sound mixing unlike with reddit’s opinion on tenet’s sound design and mixing this movie actually had poor mixing which was the only real flaw 

i think you’ve got to learn how to have fun in life 
the funny thing is hearing your remark about “if you can’t tell a complete story in three hours you’re doing it wrong” makes me think you’re like miguel spiderman 2088 because he tries to conform to “societal in this case multiversal rules” in filmmaking there are no rules only decisions and planning this movie is art nothing less",2023-06-05
what was insulting about spider therapy even if you are in therapy,2023-07-03
i think it gets a nom but there’s some bangers coming down the pipe later this year that will probably get more best picture buzz killers of the flower moon and oppenheimer come to mind of course we don’t actually know who’s in line for what till the end of the year this should totally win best animated for sure though,2023-06-05
interesting choice of language,2023-06-02
i believe it’s metro boomin  aap rocky roisee  am i dreaming ,2023-06-02
punk is at the end going to find miles he will be back hope he has a bigger role,2023-06-03
miles 69 was my first thought and i hate myself for it,2023-06-03
"i can save my father and the multiverse

the 2 cakes",2023-06-04
2 miles to save the multiverse,2023-06-04
the first one had a complete story whereas this one felt like the setup to part 3,2023-06-07
i’m guessing the computer wasn’t programmed to detect dna with a different dimension than the spider who bit them so since he had both dna in him maybe jt picked at random or maybe it was only trained to detect the spider bite dna,2023-06-04
"i think the machine is made for spider people and recognised that the spider part of his dna is from earth 42

i wonder what miguel will show as as my theory is he was never bitten by a spider and isnt actually spider man",2023-06-05
the fact that the big chase scene is basically the end of the movie when everyone was expecting it to be in the first 20 minutes really gets me,2023-06-04
i actually had the opposite experience  as much as i enjoyed the multiverse stuff the family stuff was the real meat of the film for me as that’s what generates all of its heart i’m a sucker for character focusedsol style stuff though so very much a personal taste haha,2023-06-05
that was 100 an issue with the theater i would have talked to the manager and gotten your money back because something wasn’t right,2023-06-05
i’m not completely against cliffhangers but i will say i prefer to do it in the infinity war or back to the future ii style… they both give you a full movie and emotional arc but leave you wanting to know what happens next,2023-06-05
interestingly it’s usually the opposite for me i feel like people are usually fairly quiet and respectful during movies on opening weekend wherever i go like maybe being in a completely packed theater full of excited fans creates some peer pressure to not be a tool and maybe people who do talk are shut down by people who really want to see the movie there are always a few whispers and such but usually nothing too bad my worst experiences have always been when there are just a few groups of people in the theater weeks after release and a few morons apparently feel like that makes it okay to yak it up throughout the whole thing,2023-06-05
he’s hot too ,2023-06-06
hummingbird  james blakemetro boomin,2023-06-07
yes,2023-06-08
 someone watched nope,2023-06-08
"i just started thinking the exact same thing today we kind of just assume that miles from 42 is a villain because we always assume that prowler is a villain

im starting to hope that universe 42 is just a what would happen if we have someone who was destined to be spiderman miles from 42 that never got the superpowers but still went through all of the spiderman canon events",2023-06-08
we dont actually get that many genuinely evil spiderpeople so that would be fun,2023-06-08
that was wild cus even if you don’t understand collecting who tf opens someone else’s ,2023-06-08
to be fair she appears to have powers so a normal babysitter isnt really an option mj likely has a real job which pays enough for him to stay home with their daughter and peter b is an idiot,2023-06-08
because its fun i guess,2023-06-08
it’s pretty clear by now that peter b parker isn’t the wisest of all the spidermen,2023-06-10
yep,2023-06-08
i gasped when i saw donald glover i think nobody else in my theater got the reference,2023-06-11
will he ever acknowledge the events of the movie in the game,2023-06-11
very possibly  i think its also possible that it was just their only chance in the story to show off that miguel has fangs,2023-06-12
i thought he was going to eat him  im thinking hes eating the villains and not sending them home,2023-06-11
miguel has fangs and can release a venom through biting that paralyzes enemies,2023-06-14
"gwen does mention that most of the spider society are just part timers  i imagine they show up for the occasional crossover event but spend 99 of their time in their own universe

i think the idea is that canon events are inevitable aside from interference from other universes  even if pavitr was told in advance he wouldnt have been able to stop it by himself

since miles very existence breaks canon i think they treat his events differently  other than that they know spot is a multiversal threat and will need to get involved anyways  i suppose miguel thought that miles would get in the way trying to save his dad while they dealt with spot",2023-06-12
my guess is that now that he knows about the event in a meta sense he could possibly prevent it by just locking his dad away somewhere safe for the duration of the attack,2023-06-12
the first one was way better tho lol,2023-06-19
so far no cannon event was stopped by a person from their own universe so we dont even know if miguels hypothesis is correct,2023-06-18
he was wrong if his dad doesn’t become captain then his dad doesn’t have to die that’s the twist,2023-06-19
i think thats why miguel didnt want to accept gwen before her time these spidermens tragic events already happened so there nothing much to do for them,2023-06-22
if you havent seen it yet apparently theres an article that came out today confirming that there are multiple versions of the film i think just two theyre very minor changes and i think its kinda cool almost keeping with the multiverse theme if the movie having an alternate version if the film with minor changes,2023-06-24
yes he is,2023-06-23
i seriously recommend watching it again i just came out from my second watch this time in imax and oh man it was even better this time,2023-06-27
same bro i adored the first movie this one had me wanting to leave,2023-07-04
i just deleted my comment because this was exactly my feelings but expressed better this needed a part 1 slapped on it movies need to continue to let the audience know there wont be resolution im not sure why theyre moving away from that i just saw a movie released last month that did this as well im perfectly fine with stories spanning multiple movies but imo expectations should be set ahead of time,2023-06-09
i think even infinity war and endgame that were announced as two parts of one movie were both more complete than this one yes infinity war had a huge cliffhanger but it still had a proper finale and the story payoff of thanos doing exactly what he said hed do for the entire movie,2023-06-09
" while all the above has to do with miles i found gwens arc weirdly disappointing in that her fathers reversal from wanting to arrest her at the beginning to turning in his badge was not adequately explored and i do feel they should have spent more time there establishing how that reversal came about as we see gwen rounding out her ragtag team of spiderpeople at the end instead of feeling like this was a tightknit team that had each others back and will pose a considerable challenge to miles foes it did not sit well with me the great characters we see in into the spiderverse are only revisited at the very end here which seems like a lost opportunity to have had a few scenes with them early on in this movie as well so that we see them interact with each other and get the sense that the closing teamup is earned

i agree gwens arc was rushed from her band arc to her father arc people seem to love it but its seems they only care about how pretty her world colors look but not thinking about how her arc writing was rushed im happy the main arc with miles with his mom dad villains and gwen was not rushed we will get the right character development for miles with his villains family and possible lover gwen",2023-06-09
i had the same thought about miles’ age he seemed 15 in the first movie with his height and demeanor they easily could’ve made him 17 and not changed anything else there’s a huge difference between the two ages most 15 year olds are not mature enough to handle the issues he was trying to handle,2023-06-03
"miguel ohara isnt a spiderman is he they allude to that when they say he isnt funny and spiderman is supposed to be funny im guessing that hes a manspider and the injections are to keep him from turning i would have liked to have seen more from him because i totally identified with his frustration theyre trying to save worlds and people are bringing children with them going offmission and doing random  and acting like little jackasses

yeah i hate to be a contrarian seeing as everyone is gushing about the movie but even after the reveal that miles needs to let his fcking father die to preserve a timeline peter from the first movie still treats the whole thing like its no big deal and is quipping it up with his baby cracking jokes to miles like its no big deal etc and all the other spidermen are like uhh why is this kid so bothered that his father is gonna die in 2 days jeez was strange",2023-06-05
"right on

my eyes hurt like literal physical pain about the halfway mark i knew it was going to be bad and i had to start closing them for 1020 seconds every now and then im prone to eye strain and this was brutal

it looked visually like i forgot to get my 3d glasses at the door  but it wasnt a 3d showing  like everything had a subtle leftanglerightangle effect",2023-06-04
i thought i was the only one whose eyes hurt,2023-06-04
"haha i dont know why you keep calling him miguel rojas but spiderman 2099 is called miguel ohara also he is a spiderman in his world he was trying to recreate spiderman and has an accident mixing his dna with a spiders

so he didnt get bit if i remember correctly which i guess would explain his more vampire like attitude dude was probably trying to paralyze davinci vulture with that bite",2023-06-03
"the beginning of the film miles says make 2 cakes

i think the story here is that tragedy doesnt have to define a person that they can make their own choices and have the freedom to do so if they have a good support system and community

spidey has always been the friendly neighborhood spiderman but hes also been a loner

here hes got friends who know him and can help him",2023-06-02
i agree — story was empty they dropped the ball on the narrative in this one recycled a lot of emotional beats from the last film way too meta as well,2023-06-07
"i still think it was a cool movie they really have a good style and insane technical abilities you can tell they had fun and experimented which is rare nowadays but yes i agree it wasnt great writing its not that the ideas are bad its just told in a clunky way

 why did i watch the university conflicts between miles and his family does that contribute to the movie

very good point the plot is kinda all over the place theres no real central conflict the real conflict actually arrives in the last minutes of the movie which is insane when you think about it this is why i think youre spot on when you say that you felt like watching a 25hourlong trailer the pacing is weird whenever it starts to pick up some momentum it slows down in very long exposition where the characters just tell you whats going on so many of these plot points could have been shown and not told",2023-06-07
the film felt extremely long to me how many drawn out silent pauses were there in this movie every time there was a serious conversation there was a 1234 pause of silence and i thought the convo between miles and his mom on top of the building was taking forever,2023-06-18
i think they had a solid outline for a single movie and it spiralled and has been split into two i didnt dislike it but im struggling to agree with the overwhelming praise its getting it felt very disjointed,2023-06-06
"respectfully i feel like you werent paying much attention to the movie

off the top of my head the spot decided to become a major villain because he wasnt being treated seriously by someone he wrongly assumed to be his arch nemesis miles didnt go invisible during the chase because he wanted to be chased thereby drawing the other spiders away from the go back machine spot needed another particle collider specifically because it was a collider that gave him his powers and he wanted to get stronger the spiders tried to stop the falling building and when they couldnt went into overdrive mode to save as many people as they could a lot of these points were explicitly explained in the film itself

as to the central conflict everyone knows that changing established history is badthat isnt the problem miguel is telling miles that he cant or shouldnt stop something that hasnt happened yet which of course miles disagrees with

likenone of this is subtext the movie outright says these things clearly",2023-06-06
i think you simultanesounly understood what the movie was going for but it went over your head completely,2023-06-06
hes a 15 year old angsty teen tho,2023-06-06
some parts really did drag like the mom talk after then meet gwen it really felt like she was just repeating herself after some time,2023-06-11
i agree that the story structure was weird it had a weird pace tons of exposition always interrupting action for some reason maybe its due to the fact that its a part 1 though,2023-06-07
i get what you mean it feels paced more like a tv show because of the decompression,2023-06-06
yeah my wife said the same thing like a string of tv episodes i didnt fully feel that but i can for sure respect the viewpoint,2023-06-11
yes this 100 it felt like too much setup with no pay off each segment set up something new and we are left waiting for the next 6 episodes with an 8 month break,2023-06-20
why disney ,2023-06-06
gwens story doesnt conclude per se but it fulfills its emotional arc so theres that at least but you cant make part two of three too conclusive without taking away from the finales build,2023-06-02
its been done since like empire strikes back lol,2023-06-03
i actually really disliked the pregnancy thing snd the second part of peter b having his baby there the first its like oh no shes already with him and its bad timing but come on,2023-06-04
"ill give you the part about turning scarlet spider into a joke but they only had so much screentime to give spectacular spidey

plus unless i saw it incorrectly i think we saw his version of peter holding a dead captain stacy

that was super powerful maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me but i know i saw that",2023-06-02
its a movie meant for children bro what do you expect,2023-06-02
that was my issue with having all of the various petersspiderpeople just seemingly go along with miguels plan completely despite the constant losses he endures peter is supposed to be an optimist we see this in nwh when toms peter fused to be content with allowing the villains to go back to their universe so they could die,2024-02-17
the live action stuff was really corny as  i wish we got a real donald glover prowler in the mcu instead of that awkward as lets pause the scene so the audience can clap at the glump  the scenes of tobey and garfield looked awful mixed in with the rest of the animation too,2023-06-02
" if they don’t  the third one up this will be the best super hero trilogy of all time please be nice rraimimemes

you dont really need the subtitles for the spanish to understand the general idea of what theyre saying,2023-06-02
" i liked that they didn’t subtitle the spanish lines i didn’t understand most of them as a monolingual but it worked because it felt like “yeah only bilinguals will get this” 

you didnt lost anything it was barely spanish anyway",2023-06-02
what hyundai product placements i can’t even remember when someone used a car in this movie,2023-06-18
there are a lot of criticisms in this thread but these ones line up with mine the most im just not a fan of them introducing the concepts of canon as a universal force bc it doesnt flow as seamlessly into its allegory as i think it wants to,2023-06-13
i very strongly disagree with every single one of your points but i can see where you came to some of those conclusions,2023-06-07
i kind of feel like an  too but my gut feeling is that they took a potentially solid movie and let it get out of control and split it in half third act was set up perfectly but were left with come back later because as you pointed out they worked in an evil miles for some reason instead of using it later down the road for its own story,2023-06-05
whoa this is wild i had given it a 610 for like the exact opposite reasons the first 45 minutes to me were a draaaaag reintroducing a bunch of characters we were wellaware of already and reintroducing the morales family dynamics we were also well aware of already like this just in mom and dad love miles are are concerned about him jeez louise i get it i wouldnt have minded if this movie had been a oneoff but the fact they had the audacity to make this a part one and they had these longass conversations reiterating a bunch of the stuff from the first movie in the first half got me a little steamed but i found that after the jump to the spider nexus or whatever things picked up considerably and i felt like i was actually watching a sequel its just so interesting to me that we both lowscored it but for almost diametrically opposed reasons,2023-06-05
said it pretty well im with you,2023-06-19
in the next film sadly,2023-06-03
hopefully we get to see prowler miles meet spiderman miles’s father,2023-06-20
"why miles parents want to ground him 

because he kept lying to them even when he was pretty directly confronted about it",2023-06-02
think it will be mentioned in the sequel but i have a feeling she also broke a canon event and that her universe might collapse which essentially forces her and miles together in the same universe they can go in so many different ways  but i love the twist overall of captain stacy likely surviving,2023-06-02
"listening to it right now and im just so in awe

edit nueva york train chase from the ost is incredible",2023-06-02
yeah he was aaron davis in homecoming,2023-06-02
i think so,2023-06-02
yo no joke when the movie started with gwens monolouge i could not hear what she was saying the person sitting behind me shot out of his seat and went to go to tell the people working at the theater to turn it up and they did and the rest of the movie was fine it was weird though,2023-06-02
haha nice callback to the first movie too,2023-06-05
one of the best trilogies period if they stick the landing like right alongside lord of the rings which is wild,2023-06-02
but then insomniac spiderman showed up at the spider society with a callout balloon and everything tearing the hole open again,2023-06-03
spiderman 2 actually,2023-06-05
he said that in response to whether he spoke italian,2023-06-02
for me i think the best joke was the call back joke to the first where after all  breaks loose you just hear some passerby go yeah i think its a banksy ,2023-06-02
i dont like how fires look like in elemental just look weird,2023-06-02
"the reveal that miles was never supposed to be spiderman threw me out of a loop

i think theres layered meaning to this or at least it hit me this way iirc when miles morales spiderman was first published there was a lot of push back for having a black spiderman that makes miguels words so much more impactful in a meta sense",2023-06-02
he isn’t he  up another universe learnt from his mistake and came back to his universe to prevent it from happening how does that make him an anomaly,2023-06-03
same dude i saw it yesterday booked in for another viewing early next week and might see it once more after i watch transformers next week too the next few weeks are going to be fun,2023-06-03

mona lisa by dominic fike is playing when they’re swinging through the city,2023-06-03
been looking for the song playing when miles is reintroduced but cant find it,2023-06-03
"i think it was more of a butterfly effect than anything

if spider42 hadnt gotten into 1606 universe miles wouldnt have gotten bitten and if miles wouldnt have gotten bit he wouldnt have been where he was and so on and so on resulting in spideys death

obviously it wasnt miles fault but if you look at the order in which the dominoes fall one could interpret it that way",2023-06-03
i think the idea is that if miles were not there so many variables would have been different different enough that 1610 peter would not have died,2023-06-03
no 1610 is still the ultimate universe here but 1610 miles was never meant to be 1610 spiderman… it was supposed to be 42 peter,2023-06-03
how’d u know,2023-06-03

that was a pretty big plot point yes",2023-06-03
wonder if theyre going to fix the audio for the home release i spoke to my cinema and they said the actual sound mix of the film has the issues,2023-06-03
"technically this first spiderverse movie was about miles and peter b because of the mentor relationship and encouraging peter to care about his spiderman role again

this second is more about miles and gwen",2023-06-04
all the films are about miles with coleads,2023-06-04

the canon event is that a police captain close to spiderman is destined to die miles dad jefferson is being promoted to captain and in the film they had 2 days before he dies when he gets promoted to captain i believe thats the canon event regardless if it was his dad or not,2023-06-04
"while its a century later the marvel 1602 series is all about if marvels heroes lived in the elizabethan era spidey included

then he disappeared ,2023-06-04
it was my favorite before just looks so  cool this movie definitely made me want to replay the game though,2023-06-04

yes the fix 15 mins of the film the sound mixing was terrible then in the last 35 mins the sound mixing was incredible the directors and whoever work on this project will hopefully fix this for the blue ray and digital versions,2023-06-05
if the quality holds up this will be one of the best trilogies ever not just one of the best animated ones these movies are operating on a different level,2023-06-05
there’s tons of different satisfying ways to end the film i miles will either have to give up his spider powers since he is the anomaly or the spot is actually the solution to the problem somehow i think the proof that determinism is wrong will be when our miles convinces miles 42 he is not meant to be the prowler and instead he because a metal suit powered spiderman,2023-06-05
"the exact rules of canon events arent strongly defined yet i think thats by design

like does preventing canon events directly cause reality to unravel itself like miguels explanation kind of implies it does but miles said the event was caused by the spot so i have a feeling the explanation will end up being that every prevention of a canon event happened to be accompanied by a cataclysmic event and one doesnt necessitate the other

also the spot causes the canon event for indian spiderman which is then prevented but the spot itself is an anomaly resulting from the anomalous existence of miles so clearly anomalies can play a part in producing canon events

but at the end of the day we can speculate about the details of the lore but what actually matters is the themes expressed through the story i feel like this idea of canon events that have to happen as well as the obvious interpretation about fate and selfdetermination is also a meta commentary of the comic book industryfandom that insists certain things have to always be true and there can be no permanent change in the status quo",2023-06-05
it seems like each universe tries to be self correcting miles was bit by a spider so now his universe has to  off the other spiderman and create the canon events for miles it also explains why people glitch universe doesn’t like having people who don’t belong in it so it treats them like a virus and attacks them instead of stabilizing the person the watches might just mask their presence or make them seem like they belong to whatever universe they’re in,2023-06-05
"did i miss something 


",2023-06-05
"re the spider society specifically

its heavily implied that while theres multiple universes time itself still doesnt stand still and that as one of the newest spidermen he has yet to complete much of his canon that pavitrs canon moment was interrupted because of saving his version of the captain and that gwens leaving breaks canon by saving her father without creating another event implies that the other spidermen may have had their canons run their course already easier to grieve than to fight",2023-06-05
they were already working on the collider so it may have been set off that same day regardless of the spot singh would have died and there wouldn’t be a black hole in the center of the city,2023-06-05
spiderman 2099 is saying that captain singh would have died one way or the other it’s a dangerous job,2023-06-05
it was cough lord and miller have hidden a cough sound at the beginning of all of their movies since 22 jump street but they actually gave it a little graphic for this one,2023-06-05
i believe it was “ain’t no love in the heart of the city”,2023-06-06
aint no love in the heart of the city  bobby bland youtube,2023-06-07
think it is more likely gwen dies if anyone,2023-06-06
thats a  thing pirates 2  everyone up lol,2023-06-07
if you read comics you know miles beat the main 616 peter at 13 yeah miles would get out there easily,2023-06-08
"i dont think any of those spiders see miles as a real threath and went easy on him there is no actual physical harm from them

i felt that miguel was also in a imposing my reasoning mode more than  this kid mode

him being an anomaly might help in being less predictable too i guess",2023-06-08
"three things all possibly bs 
1 spider man takes things lightly and jokes around makes things fun like that but it has definitely led to reckless mistakes and villains temporarily getting away the hundreds of spider people may have just not cared that much whereas miles was literally fighting for his and his dads life 
2 showing the impact flawed and outrageous hive mindbrainwashing by miguel these spider people are mindless and deluded shells of themselves who allow miguel to think for them follow his orders blindly and are not reflective of what an actual peter parker would be 
3 miguel and miles were clearly the premier spider people betterstrongersmarter meaning either latinx people are superior or more likely they are both anomalies and “better” than a regular spider person",2023-06-07
i might be wrong on this but the canon event is simply the captain dying doesn’t matter how it happens he just has to die the bridge falling and killing the captain is just one way it happens and miguel is probably anxious to let it happen sooner than later because securing the canon event ensures stability for that universetimeline,2023-06-07
so in the comics people hop between dimensions all the time and it doesnt necessarily hurt anything in loki the tfa is more about giving a kang the future he wants which might be part of the point here,2023-06-08
the doc ock voice wasnt from a prisoner it was in a training simulation,2023-06-08
there was even a clip from tasm 2 game for the uncle ben death scene,2023-06-08
the way i see it miles and miguel were the only goings trying 100 everyone else was kind of going with the flow,2023-06-10
you could argue that because he’s an anomaly he has the advantage over all of them by being one step ahead of them bc of how he’s different,2023-06-10
i kinda just suspended disbelief for that part theres actually no real reason he didnt get caught there,2023-06-11
"it seemed like all the other spiders werent trying to fight or hurt him

literally just trying to capture him with webs and stuff and with his spidersense ofcourse hed dodge stuff like that

like the cowboy spidermanwhen miles jumps on his horse he could have just tried to overpower him or whatever but to him its like a joke or not that serious and does draw in 3 thing 

also so many spider people are there at first most of them probably dont even know what he looks like",2023-06-12
miles best main 616 peter at 13 yeah he would beat all of them,2023-06-12
"also one for spider noir

spiderman fighting nazis would be really fun",2023-06-11
if he never got bit by a spider maybe his uncle ben is even still around,2023-06-14
well we know there are since hes been in comicsshows but those other ones may not be multiversal threats,2023-06-14
yep and if you watched miles swinging through the city on the way home you can see adverts about companies that has related names to sinister 6 memebers,2023-06-15
hummingbird by metro boomin i think,2023-06-16
inverse for me i heard the going home line on some of my first viewings but it wasnt there in the last one,2023-06-17
yeah more like an anti hero kinda vibe who has to resortr to dobsome crimes to try and stop the sinister 6 cartel,2023-06-18
i really hate how they did this  its like all the amazing visuals of this movie were thrown in the trash because of that ending the movie was 23 hours long and they couldnt finish it,2023-06-23
bc its not just one event peter parker lost ben gwen harry all these tragedies are canon events,2023-06-22
honestly he shouldn’t have even told miles about his father until after it happened dude was happy as a clam to follow gwen around,2023-06-24
sometimes i feel like super hero movies just leave me with a mind  effect of every think to consider that its too much for me especially this movie,2023-06-23
nah when spiderman2099 was created prowler didnt even exists yet,2023-06-26
nah those teeths are his fangs which he always had hes not like every other spiderman since he didnt get bit but got his genes spliced with a spiders one so one could argue hes the actual spiderman since hes genes is 50 spider,2023-06-29
"well gwen coming to 1610 is a bit of a time paradox actually it was the same collider explosion that pulled the other spideys through that transported her as well though for some reason only she was pulled back a week in time so if the collider was truly destined to be destroyed she wouldnt be in 1610 in the first place

there seems to be some kind of connection between gwen and miles in terms of their spidersenses her sensing when miles goes off even though hes on a completely different earth so that could be the explanation to her knowing to go to miles school well have to see if theres a proper explanation for some of that stuff in btsv as you said the whole deal with gwen going back in time and somehow knowing to go to visions academy is somewhat of a plot hole at the moment",2023-08-28
"i think theres something more about miguels backstory

feel like it was extremely glossed over  for example the whole  im just going to plug and play in another universe to have a family schtick is weird i imagine he lost his family in his own universe and that there is going to be more of a backstory to him in the future movies idk if that means hes going to be a fake spiderman  i hope not  thats such a animated movie trope from frozen and zootopia that is no longer original imo but i do think theres a lot more to him",2023-06-02
610 first one was better,2023-06-04
"im going with 7

the art was fantastic the different styles they used were all really interesting it was all well drawnrendered the animation was great the cinematography was great

i also really liked the audio both music and sound design were brilliant and fit the movie so well 

the comedy was fun the characters were interesting i enjoyed a lot of the plot

the ending was just a massive dissapointment complete letdown too much was left unconcluded and the things that were just didnt make up for it

the pacing felt off to me we spent a lot of time on things that didnt seem to matter and lots of it felt stretched out i wouldnt have minded this as much if the movie had concluded wholly but as is it feels like sand in the wound

some of the characters really ground my gears the obsurd and whacky characters took a back seat in the previous film and that worked so well in this one they take more of a mainstage and i felt it undercut a lot of the stakes early on i also just found their personalities a bit abrasive 

overall very pretty and great sounding film underwhelming plot that doesnt complete a full arc for the main character a mix of good and underwhelming characters",2023-06-12
so brave,2023-06-02
i thought it was just me… so many times i heard quips but couldn’t hear  they were saying,2023-06-04
agreed they easily could have just ended it on the first movie and id have been happy then if they want another one maybe start of a whole new adventure with different people thats not to do with multiverse it feels overdone and stale,2023-06-04
thank you so much i really needed this i felt empty after watching this and you brought up every point i wanted to make this movie isnt really noteworthy im having a hard time finding a favourite moment i was apathetic towards the parents because they seemed like plot devices only there to be an obstacle to miles,2023-06-04
you tried it you learned it isnt for you you know not to waste your money on future films no shame in that guess you can skip the upcoming third movie and spidergwen movie,2023-06-05
yeah i hated the cliffhanger i even expressed that u didnt sign up for a movie with a cliffhanger,2023-06-11
"i guess the proper ending point is him ecaping to earth42

im guessing they covered more ground to balance the run time of both films",2023-06-11
the very first teaser for atsv showed that it was part 1 they had planned on the sequel just being one movie but there was so much stuff that it had to get split up i figured it was common knowledge that this was a part 1 but i guess they really didnt do a good job demonstrating that after the teaser,2023-06-14
your thoughts are very similar to mine i am glad to have found this comment because the vast amount of extremely high praise this movie is getting made me feel like i was alone in my opinion,2023-06-03
mate you were messaging on reddit while watching the movie the heck,2023-06-03
"picks up at the spider society hub and the chase is cool
agree with everything miguel said miles shouldnt get to change fate 
but this movie is so boring man so much talking the movie went nowhere for half the runtime also stop with the miles gwen romance its weird",2023-06-03
how is it boring they had two fights before the halfway mark vs the vulture and spot,2023-06-03
yeah very  coded,2023-06-04
i completely agree the multiverse is such a terrible gimmick concept it takes away all stakes and just feels like filmmakers can make up whatever they want i enjoyed this movie and multiverse of madness but as a concept im already sick of it,2023-06-03
exactly how i felt,2023-06-06
i agree with a lot of what you said the movie just failed to help me appreciate it for some reason i understand how much effort went into it i liked it and thats it,2023-06-07
i agree as well but even though the animation was good there was a little too much going on at times i think they should restrain a bit the first one had the perfect balance in my opinion,2023-06-08
"peter parker saying random  stuff to say that he was inspired by miles to have a kid really may be i need to watch the first movie again because i dont havent the slightest recollection of that ever being happeningor being implied

you need to watch the first movie again i agree with most of what you said but this stuck out to me it was basically his entire arc in the last movie 

he started out being incredibly annoyed by miles and wanting to get rid of him as quickly as possible but slowly started to take pride in mentoring him and teaching him the ropes of being spiderman near the beginning he says this is why i didnt have kids when miles was trying to guilt him into taking him with him for the trip then at the end he tells miles im so proud of you do i want kids its a big thing for him because its the reason he divorced mj in his universe",2023-06-29
"but i found that the film stayed uncomfortably long on scenes that didnt seem to move the plot forward

dude for real during the scene when miles talks to his mom on top of the building i couldnt shake the sense that my entire theater was snoozing",2023-06-18
"gwen finished her arc miles finished his arc of not letting others decide for him

also it literally was announced as a 2 parter",2023-06-07
"i couldnt agree more there are plenty of examples of part 1 movies that have satisfying stories 

infinity war is a very good example dune part 1 is another one even harry potter and the deathly hallows part 1 felt like it gave us enough substance to be okay with the first part these movies did it well because even though they left the story up in the air they left off at a natural stopping point

across the spiderverse didnt end at a natural stopping point it ended in the middle of a bunch of plot points and robbed the movie of a real climax i feel like they made this movie worse for the sake of the next movie

when i think about what makes a good cliffhanger and what makes a bad cliffhanger a good one gives you a little bit of closure but then also gives you some mystery to look forward to a bad cliffhanger takes what would have been the normal ending and makes that the carrot on the stick to get you to come back and i feel like this movie was more the latter

this movies ending felt more akin to that of the hobbit the desolation of smaug to me which is not a favourable comparison",2023-06-07
actually the film and its sequel were announced as across the spiderverse part 1 and across the spiderverse part 2 but later on they decided to retitle the third film beyond the spiderverse,2023-06-07
this was also announced as part 1,2023-06-07
but it was promoted as part one it has always been promoted as a part one of a two part movie,2023-06-07
i have never forgotten that this was a part 1 because i kept thinking about how we were getting two more of these movies confirmed,2023-06-05
" the trailers had me expecting this angry and authoritative figure

hes definitely still exactly that",2023-06-04
you should watch the first one its got even more humour and just as much heart the animation isnt as varied but its still exceptional,2023-06-07
"song from upside down scene with miles and gwen is “another dimension” by pop money

the self love song is from the beginning",2023-06-07
i agree with most of what you’ve said here although i will defend them showing the prowler’s death along the others i didn’t get a good look at the others’ events but i believe that was describing the “uncle ben death” event which is a separate canon event from the “police captain dies” event definitely still kinda odd tonally tho,2023-06-02
"i think the reaction of most people in this sub show that it didn’t undo the reveal most people don’t keep track of what universes people belong to and the moment is so quick that most people won’t catch it until the rewatch 

you may have caught it but the vast majority of people didn’’s fine if it didn’t work for you but to say it doesn’t work at all is kinda disingenuous",2023-06-02
did they number which universe was miles in the first moviei barely remember it definitely has less memorable moments,2023-06-03
it was so televised that he was going to the wrong universe but still most people didnt see it coming myself included,2023-06-04
"it wasnt spoiled 

i clearly saw that it said earth42 and during the excitement of the moment it just never registered that miles morales isnt from earth42 and was being sent to the wrong universe 

its a rather small detail that isnt going to be picked up by most people",2023-06-07
my criticisms are with pacing and the ending as well this movie has an incomplete story,2023-06-02
he was actually playing spider man 2 2023 believe it or not,2023-06-05
thats probably why they kept it on the down low that it was a part 1 ,2023-06-03
you should always watch and support animation in the theater especially if you want to see the movie,2023-06-05
agreed the visuals are great but it feels less tightly written than the first i was watching this scene from itsv and was like wow were there any moments in atsv where they slowed down the pacing like that most of the heartfelt scenes felt a little forced except for maybe gwen and her father the action in this one feels a bit over the top,2023-06-07
the tension doesnt come from the plot it comes from gwen and miles relationship,2023-06-07
"the film is just 90 spidermen chasing other spidermen around

you didnt even watch the movie it takes well over half the movie to even get to miguel",2023-06-06
" the film is just 90 spidermen chasing other spidermen around

yea that scene went on about 3x longer than needed it got seriously tiring other parts dragged and didnt add to the movie as well which was time that couldve better been used to make a complete movie instead it was written more like a tv series trying to pad itself out",2023-06-07
i think its obvious miles can escape that room but that universe was kinda built up as this lawlesshellish type version of nyc its not as much about him getting out of that trap but what is going to happen to him afterwards because i dont think anyone knows what universe he is in he is lost,2023-06-02
"i think the twist is much deeper than that miles learned in this film in an awful way that he is truly on his own he has no community or family other than his parents and himself the other spider folk couldnt be counted on thats why he worked up the courage to tell his mom his big secret at the end 

but the twist is he sees this fun house mirror tormented version of himself in the universe his own super spider came from this means he can no longer necessarily even trust himself i think what hes going to learn is what he could become if he goes alone and doesnt build a true community with other heroes 

so the stakes arent about the physical battle with miles prowler its about evolving the lesson he learned from this film into knitting together a web with fallible other people to become the best version of himself",2023-06-02
thats a cliffhanger   ,2023-06-02
yeah i feel like he could escape prowler and uncle aron easily but not escape the dimension which is why they set up gwen building a team but it still felt shorthanded imo,2023-06-02
i just bought this comic book and i have to buy another issue to see the story continue what’s the deal,2023-06-04
did you  about infinity war too or no,2023-06-04
agreed i love this film to bits but i feel like if it ended right after miles got home it wouldve felt less frustrating,2023-06-04
i thought this one was at least on par,2023-06-08
"even ignoring the whole “it’s the first half of a two part movie” thing there is a complete story told in the relationship between gwen and miles and their parents 

it might also be a metaphor for coming out but i haven’t thought too much about it",2023-06-09
i agree there’s no falling action whatsoever except for maybe gwen recruiting the other spiderpeople,2023-06-10
"gwen has a complete arc and miles has an arc about learning to be himself and not try to follow others

really what the last few scenes do is start act 1 for the next movie",2023-06-10
there is a part 2 to this movie…,2023-06-09
youre the first person ive heard mention that,2023-06-11
because they announced it as a 2parter in the first place beyond the spiderverse releases in march,2023-06-03
seriously most people exiting were very vocal about not liking the movie generallyeveryone loves the visuals but rotten tomatoes reddit metacritic are all lighting it up with high scores,2023-06-04
i was super  off at the time but the animals is good enough that i forgive it,2023-06-03
legitimate thoughtful criticism downvoted on reddit,2023-06-08
 family guy gag ,2023-06-02
i rarely feel this way about a movie when its done so well but yes its almost like it ends once the plot starts ramping up i cant understand people giving this a 1010 for that reason the first one felt so well paced and complete,2023-06-02
"youve got to consider that this is only the first part of a 45 hour story in that context the relatively slowpaced intro to the movie feels more appropriate 

i actually appreciated the slower pacing though it was nice to spend a bit of time catching up with miles and gwen and learning about their current struggles without it i think that gwens arc probably doesnt work as well as it does",2023-06-04
the captain promotion party is where i caught myself working not to space out pacing afterwards worked for me i hope the sequel justifies this,2023-06-04
i didn’t watch a single trailer for this film hahaha,2023-06-05
everyone learns the lesson at some point never ever watch trailers watch the initial teaser to sell you and ignore everything else you come out so much more ahead that way,2023-06-05
just watch the first teaser and possibly the first main trailer if you must and ignore anything else,2023-06-05
a lot of people were expecting that chase scene to be very early in the movie,2023-06-05
"id argue it did have a certain degree of conclusion in that gwen reconciled with her father and spared him from his dying fate 

these movies were originally going to be one film from what i understand but they had to segment it as the scope continued to grow i dont have a source for this on hand though so grain of salt 

at any rate 

i liked that the movie started with gwen and ended with her saving her dad im glad theyre giving certain scenes and plotlines the time they need but the wait for march will definitely be agonizing lol",2023-06-05
"the movie does have a conclusion with gwen’s arc which bookends the start and close of the movie 

i think this film is very comparable to empire strikes back which is one of the most celebrated sequels of all time and is very much so an incomplete ending which sets up for the third movie",2023-06-05
the people next to me brought a  infant thankfully when it started crying they took it out of the theater,2023-06-06
it is becoming more common in movie theaters at least from what i’ve experienced it’s so frustrating i feel you tbh at this point i think i’m gonna wait until the movie has been in theaters for a couple of weeks and watch it on a monday morningnight when it’s less busy,2023-06-07
i absolutely agree with you the visuals were amazing but besides that i dont think anything else about it was,2023-06-09
was it in 12fps in parts like the first,2023-06-03
"i dont think he is in fact miguel is basically the cause of miles hinderance of fate most spiderman are never briefed on their destiny they dont know the necessity of sacrifice until after it already happens

miles was given the chance to learn fate before it happens and with that he was also given the opportunity to act ahead of it if miguel just sent miles home fate probably wouldve played out as it does normally 

universes seem to collapse when someone from a different universe interferes with canon events like miguel stepping into another universes place but if a spiderman only affects his own fate theres not a great reason to suspect that would destroy his own universe",2023-06-03
its going to be revealed that miguel is not a spiderman and is lying about canon events and anomalies,2023-09-05
he was actually playing spiderman 2 2023,2023-06-05
i think the peter b parker universe is our universe in the first movie you see that the brand names in times square are the same as in our universe in peters flashback whereas theyre different in miles,2023-06-02
"did miguel and co go to earth 42 or miles earth

they went to earth1610 you can tell because thats where gwen was and we had two of miguels team interact with her",2023-06-03
comparing nuclear to firework this is fan fest done right,2023-06-02

dominic fike  mona lisa ,2023-06-02
i much enjoyed when it was used as a jumpscare in the scene where all the spideys fell but miguel was able to catch up to miles from the other side,2023-06-02
pretty sure he took his wifes last name,2023-06-02
you mean crocheted,2023-06-05
i think if they can handle the original they can handle this,2023-06-02
"spoiler for probably the worst part happens earlythey show in full the moment when gwen kills her universes peter

a little scary and definitely emotionally heavy ive got kids younger than yours that im not going to bring but maybe at five i would its so so spectacular in theaters though if youre borderline it may be worth it",2023-06-02
yeah this should have just been a 2030 minute longer single movie hate that they split it up,2023-06-02
my head cannon is its a stackhouse jersey,2023-06-04
i’d recommend her comic run run that prologue esque was ripped straight out of it almost,2023-06-03
"this really felt like it might have started as that spinoff film that was rumored after into the spiderverse did so well and just snowballed into a huge all encompassing story

i can’t wait to see it again",2023-06-04
i would not say they are evil the only ones that backing miles are the one that have met him before when it comes down to it many spiderman maybe ok with capturing this one spiderman or letting miguel deal with him if it means he can’t hurt their dimensions,2023-06-03
hopefully being saved for the next film,2023-06-04
supaidaman,2023-06-04
nope i was keeping my eye out for him the whole movie and i didnt see him either,2023-06-04
i just watched the movie when miles was in his bedroom i noticed that him and his mom had different colored eyes when they were at his dad’s cookout i noticed that miles and his mom had the same color eyes it took me a minute to figure out what was going on,2023-06-04
"my issue is with how many spidermenspiderwomen were okay with that fact
  
im under the impression that not every spiderperson was aware of what miguel was trying to prevent sure many knew any that were in the room when miguel was establishing what canon events were for instance like jess ben gwen and peter b but i think theres probably a misinformation campaign or at the very least a brushing over specifics    
   
they probably know that certain actions can cause a universe collapse and some might have even seen it but not necessarily what they are   
   
for example spiderman india seems very specifically kept in the dark he probably would never have been told that the inspectors death is necessary or hed try to do what miles did",2023-06-05
wasn’t the entire resolution of ps4 spiderman’s plot line saving the cure for the disease and letting aunt may die in the process i get the general sentiment of your post but of all the spidermen you could’ve mentioned not being ok with it ps4 spiderman seems like the most likely to be ok with it,2023-06-05
plasma or blood,2023-06-05
if i had to watch a ripped miles switch in and out of his spidey costume every day i too would be motivated to work out,2023-06-05
her new mech i think,2023-06-05
wouldn’t she be much older peter was 26 when he died she’d be a similar age,2023-06-05
"1610b gwen like most gwens is probably dead even if she wasn’t she’d be about a decade older assuming she’s the same age as 1610b peter

and assuming the multiverse’s aging is off by the same amount for everyone the miles in gwen’s world would be like five years old",2023-06-05
allgood  you’ll catch it on the second watch so the scientist who is now known as spot was working for doc ock  kingpin in the first film specifically on the collider that is the main central point of the first film he was testing the collider’s power and brought a radioactive spider from universe 42 into miles’ timeline watch into the spiderverse again  you’ll notice the spider glitches like people do when they are in the wrong timeline that is a dead giveaway it was never supposed to be there,2023-06-05
yeah the movie doesn’t say much kinda relies you having knowledge on the comics miguel is a lot darker and more brooding he also doesn’t shy from killing when he has to the future of 2099 is utter  and a lot of his villains are deadlier and stronger than when pete faced them so he’s not funny and is more about having to do what is necessary to ensure safety,2023-06-05
"he was  i believe its that the character was invented in 2011  my thinking is the same people who named him back in 2011  would now think of their past selves as being villains for the crime of naming him that  jefferson davis  first and only president of the confederate states of america  


it wasnt the directors of this film personally who named him but they have done something similar recently  they directed the first and second lego movie  and it felt like they treated the directors of the first lego movie as being wrongheaded judging by the subtext in the second film",2023-06-05
i dont even understand the motive of holding good miles hostage like what did they even have to gain what reason do they have to not trust him it was so weird,2023-06-05
you peep the wu poster,2023-06-05
he transported that spider from earth42 to earth1610 where it bit miles that spider probably wasnt going to bite miles in earth42 probably another peter parker who knows,2023-06-06
absolutely,2023-06-06
yuuuuup go while you still can,2023-06-06
no question its worth it,2023-06-06
yes its far better i saw it on a small screen for £5 then a imax screen for £18 and i dont regret it at all,2023-06-08
im thinking canon events happen regardless of the cause so captain singhs death will always happen one way or another and miguel doesnt want to disrupt those events which is exactly what miles is attempting,2023-06-06
"miguel is trying  to stop miles because he knows the consequeences of changing the canon events   


miguel believes that if miles does save his dad then their universe will collapse because thats what happened to miguel",2023-06-06
" you cant save everyone and then the entire plot is i can save everyone though

we have to see how the 3rd film resolves miles trying to save his dad before we conclude theres a contradiction to the message the fact that this film is only 23rds of the story might be its only weakness but its a masterpiece otherwise",2023-06-06
"thatwasnt the message in the first movie 

in the first one spiderham and the others are saying that youre going to lose people but youve got to keep going anyway at no point did they recommend allowing people to die",2023-06-06
well they need to rescue miles get him back to his universe deal with miguel and crew deal with spotsave miles father and resolve any aftermath of breaking the canon as well as make room for characters like miles and gwen to resolve their issues and potentially get together needless to say plenty of content,2023-06-06

"my first assumption was that he was injecting spider venom from different universes into himself to make himself the perfect weapon thats why he has so many powers both biological and technological miguel has a martyr complex he sees himself as the only spiderman capable of saving the multiverse so hes therefore the most deserving of more power to justify the level of responsibility that he has given himself

may not be true seeing at how angry he got at miles for stealing another universes spider but then again we have no idea how truthful he was being about any of the  he called out miles for and he could have very easily been lying",2023-06-07
in the comics he became spiderman because someone spiked him with a drug named rapture and miguel performed an experiment on himself to try and break free of the addiction some part of that origin may be remixed here maybe that liquid is him still being addicted maybe he has to take doses of that to renew his powers or it may be a future plot point,2023-06-07
post got one in the first movie too,2023-06-07
care to make it 5 in 7 kandi man,2023-06-07
yes,2023-06-08
thats cyborg spiderwoman shes not from the comics as far as i know they put out an action figure before the movie released so i expected her to have a bigger role,2023-06-09
that is just how 2099 spidermen fet their powers but it already tells you that the multiverse rules are not nearly as strict as miguel is making them out to be,2023-06-09
they’re meant to experience more than one canon event their uncle dying is one the tragic death of a police captain is another it’s just in this case it happens to be miles’ dad,2023-06-10
just making fun of the fangs he has more spider related characteristics due to him becoming spiderman by getting his genes spliced with a spiders genes instead of being bit,2023-06-11
"i think theyd need to find a way to introduce the character and explain his origin story in addition to resolving the current plot threads  not impossible if beyond is going to be over 2 hours but i dont think theyll go that route

i think beyond will focus on miles dealing with his counterpart while team gwen and the spider society face off against each other while dealing with the spot",2023-06-12
my guess is tva is full of  they control the variations of their sacred timeline but there are a lot of timelines outside of their control from before or after they existed,2023-06-12
"its a case where there are different multiverse films but they may not take place in the same multiverse  sony keeps trying to push a few thread into connecting to the mcu but theyre loose connections at best  the only time disney actually responded was when tom hardy appeared in the post credit scene for no way home

id say each group is off in their own corner of the larger multiverse and theyre only cross paths if the studios allow it",2023-06-12
it helps to look at the movie with gwen as the protagonist since it starts and ends with her she completes her arc finding acceptance from her father and realizing that she couldnt just find a band to fit into she had to make her own,2023-06-14
dont forget its just a first part of a duology and i honestly found the cliffhanger pretty excellent and got me on edged not everything needed with a climatic final battle which they obviously is saving for the last movie,2023-06-14
"earth42 aaron has been working with prowlermiles whos the same age as our miles aaron is definitely confused by miles having a different hairstyle hugging him and generally acting different but its not like he would have any reason to suspect that this is actually an alternate version of his nephew from another dimension 

its the moment that they get to the rooftop and aaron sees a text from prowlermiles when his suspicions that something is up are confirmed",2023-06-15
i dont think he is younger and believe that aaron thought he was miles42 at least momentarily,2023-06-15
probably dead if i remember correctly in the original comics she was killed after she fell and peter caught her with a web but accidentally broke her neck,2023-06-15
miles universe already had a peter parker who got killed he must have also had a gwen in his early spidering days so shes gone by the time miles shows up,2023-06-16
very much like rick and morty which borrowed the idea from comic books to begin with  council of kangs,2023-06-16
just a retroactive change for style purposes would be weird to show gwen being super close friends with a grown man miles is also wearing different clothes in the scene where gwen pops into his universe when hes laying in bed,2023-06-15
i like this idea i believe those edges were initially used as a way to simulate depth of field in the first film through the comic print lens but i’m definitely enjoying this interpretation now,2023-06-22
prowler miles seemed so indifferent about miles father dying yeah i get it his father is dead but if i knew an alternate version of my dad existed id still feel obligation and love towards him,2023-06-19
i had the same question my assumption is that miles42 prowler wants to use miles1610 spiderman in some nefarious scheme  like establishing an alibi or using him as bait,2023-06-20
my guess is he wants miles father for his own universe for good or bad though that’s a question for me,2023-06-22
the miles morales we follow is from earth1610 he gets bitten by a radioactive spider from earth42 as a result his dna reflects the spiders world instead of his own that is why the machine sends miles to earth42 if you pay attention closely during the spots flashback you will see earth42 miles morales in a classroom next to the spider,2023-06-23
hes not from 42 the spider that bit him and mutated his dna is thats what the go home machine was catching in his dna scan,2023-06-27
"1 the indian spiderman knows about the spidersociety but he wasnt given a watch
he was confused when a bunch of spider people were there to contain the quantum hole it is obviously that he didnt know anything about canon event stuff you dont know what a canon event is you most likely cant stop it if canon events is a real thing
the other questions may not have definite answers for them because there is not enough information to conclude anything",2023-07-04
"if the whole spot thing is not canon then why was the indian captain supposed to die there

i think the way it works is that dimensions have scripts where ultimately its the outcome that matters not the journey so even if the inspector singh was killed directly by spot it would still count as a canon event as far as the dimensional rules are concerned 

why did they even bother going to the indians spidermans world in the first place if they did manage to stop the spot in time then the captain wouldnt have been in danger either thus he wouldnt need to be saved thus causing an anomaly this whole ordeal makes 0 sense to me

they went to pavs world because spot was there if they managed to capture him before he caused the alchemax building to fall over mumbattan i expect it would simply delay inspector singhs death to another time thus fixing the anomaly 

if miles is an anomaly then why is his universe not already on the verge of destruction like the indian spidermans universe is after saving the captain saving the captain immediatly caused the world to almost to crubme but miles become spiderman which was not supposed to happen has no effect on the intregry of the universe huh

thats the big question here and the biggest wrench in miguels canon event theory i assume itll be answered in the next movie but for now my theory is that miguel is onto something with canon events hes just being way way too rigid with it dimensions can probably tolerate some degree of outside interference and that degree varies from dimension to dimension for example with pavs world you had miles glitching almost immediately after arriving then destabilizing 30 minutes after spots interference and interrupting a canon event but if we assume mcu is directly tied to spiderverse and dont even get me started on dr strange and that little nerd from earth19999 you had a bunch of displaced villains running amok with no glitching whatsoever then being sent back to their worlds cured with no apparent ill effects on their world 

i find it incredibly hard to believe that all the spidermen in that whole society are on board with letting certain people die just to preseve the cannon

personally i think miguel specifically sought out spidermen who aligned with his ideals the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few sort of deal its also a good way to ignore the fact that they couldve saved their uncle bens their captain stacys etc its a tragedy that miles has to lose his father but itll keep his dimension safe and hey thats what it means to be spiderman right",2023-07-09
he would have had the powers miles got iirc the powers always come from the spider rather than the human,2023-07-01
please give an example of when miles didnt listen to someone when he shouldve im genuinely confused what youre talking about,2023-07-04
"neither peter or gwen are really trying to capture miles throughout the chase sequence theyre just doing what they can to keep up and adjust along the way at the start of it they dont think miles will be able to escape so theyre initially just trying to ask him to stop and talk things out 

as the chase develops they realize that miles is actually doing pretty  well so they just need to keep up with miguel and jess in the event that either of those 2 capture miles gwen and peter just wanna be there to make sure that miles is safe and to try talking with him again if miles were to elude jessmiguel while petergwen kept up then they would have tried asking him to talk again they still wouldnt force him to do anything though

when theyre climbing the train gwen and peter are starting to see just how unhinged miguel has become at this point their priority is convincing miguel to calm tf down so he doesnt hurt miles andor tell him things that they didnt want him to have to worry about hes an anomaly he doesnt belong etc when miles jumps away and turns invisible we see gwen and peter both look relieved because at this point miles escaping is the best outcome for his safety and wellbeing",2023-07-07
"i mean at the end of the day everyone is entitled to their own opinions sure this movie doesnt give us a conclusion on the storylines of saving miles dad or miles and gwens relationship but that doesnt mean there wasnt any conclusion whatsoever so ill give you my best shot 

we start and end the movie with gwen getting to see her arc develop as she figures out more about who she is what being spiderwoman means to her and how that affects her relationships with the people she cares about we get to see her finally be accepted by her father and realize that even though she did it with good intentions keeping the truth from miles wasnt the best way to help him gwens struggles and what she learns from them are what drive her to do the right thing and start her own band to go and make things right

miles also has his own self realization by the end of the movie he initially thought that he could never be whole without seeing his spider friends again thinking that he needed to be with them again to feel fulfilled and belong somewhere after all of the events in nueva york transpire however miles realizes how strong he really is on his own he is whole he is enough he is strong because of his familys love and support with that affirmation hes no longer afraid to finally tell his parents the truth of who he is

atsv gives us a heavy focus on miles and gwen on their journeys of further self discovery while setting up plot points for the next movie the story itself can have more focus in btsv since weve already seen so much of our two protagonists character development now in the next movie we can see how these more fleshed out characters face the challenges ahead of them i think thats ultimately why people dont think atsv has a satisfying conclusion because the conclusion we do get is centered around character development rather than the plot itself",2023-07-09
"the movie was actually meant to stand on its own however as they kept working on it the decision was made to split it into 2 parts to include everything that they wanted if it was generally acceptableprofitable to release a 56 hour long movies they mightve done that 

each universe has its own style gwens has a watercolor aesthetic that takes inspiration from some of her comic book covers they made a creative decision to have that style be influenced by characters emotions",2023-07-15
dont know if you found it yet but its called “guess whos back” by rakim,2023-07-22
"it’s implied in miles’ eyes but not really i used to stay at my one female friends house constantly leaving behind clothing and a toothbrush and she did the same everyone thought we were hooking up but we weren’t 

even if we were societal standards believe we were or wanted too or one of us was “friend zoned” don’t get me started on that one we are actually just really close friends and that’s okay too",2024-01-23
"i feel like the movie was perfect up until the ending and then it really left me feeling disappointed

im sure if we watch part 1 and part 2 in sequence then it will be amazing but personally i dont think that part 1 works as a standalone movie it just feels incomplete",2023-06-07
to be honest i’m relieved to see that someone else feels this way too,2023-06-07
"its not a plot cliffhanger its a thematic one

the next movie is going to be about gwen redeeming herself and miles figuring out how his earth42 self ended up as the prowler",2023-06-07
" why doesnt miles morales mom in universe 42 notice that her son has a completely different hairstyle

she did ask what did you do to your hair or was that aaron

  i hate what marvel has done to movies why is everybody quipping

its a spiderman movie and he was always the constantly saying annoying jokes in battle character since the 1960s 

 nice to see gwens conflict have been resolved off screen

the only offscreen stuff i remember for her is her hanging out with the spiderman team and we already have the sense of what she was doing her conflict was with her dad and we see her running away and then making up with him",2023-06-05
" except every spiderman obviously tries to save their universes captain so miles trying to save his own universes captain wouldnt even be a problem hed just fail

the impression i got is that all the other spiderpeople joined miguels team after their canon events have already happened since miles now knows whats supposed to happen he can take steps to prevent it which is an advantageopportunity none of the other spiderpeople had

the spiderpeople joining after their respective canon events have occurred also explains why they all agree with miguel its hard to argue that certain events in your life are fated to happen once you meet hundredspossibly thousandsof alternate versions of you who all had the same experiences

re mumbattan i assume miguel changes his mind because one miles now knows enough about the spiderpeople that theres no longer a point in trying to hide details from him and two the giant realityeating hole that appears in mumbattan presents miguel with an opportunity to explain the concept of canon events and the consequences of altering one

i imagine miguels hope at that point was that peter b and gwen would be able to talk sense into him when that failed he went for plan b trap him there and lead the spiderpeople in fighting spot as a result of which the canon eventthe death of miles dadcould occur uninterrupted",2023-06-04
"yeah also what determines a canon event exactly

the original peter parker’s parents died in a plane crash when he was a kid but you don’t see miles morales being raised by an aunt his parents are still alive

wouldn’t his parents not dying in a plane crash be “breaking canon” and yet the universe is fine with it

he already lost his uncle but apparently that’s not enough to finish the canon",2023-06-04
i loved it,2023-06-05
"painfully average imo most people are in there honey moon phase like usual avengers endgame had this same thing so did nwh

i enjoyed the pre dimension hopping and thats about it",2023-06-05
yes thank you i found the story so frustrating especially about the characters  i can imagine gwen maybe going along with it because we’ve established in the opening that she’s troubled and trying to stay within this multiverse but peter b parker having a happy family and conceding to it makes him a total  i find it completely hard to believe that all these spidermen would go along with it it’s depressing and villainous,2023-06-06
man miles dont care imagine youre 15 years old with incredible powers and a bunch of people you just met told you your dad is going to die and youre not allowed to do anything about it so dont try,2023-06-02
"you’re supposed to dislike it that’s why miles the one who refuses to do that is the one driving the story and the other are trying to help him 

i think miguel is too wrapped up in the idea of loss and sacrifice that he’s unable to remember what spiderman really means he’s led the other spider people into thinking on a large scale and forgetting the small scale",2023-06-02
idk if i consider spot the main villain in this one tbh i think he will be in the next one but imo miguel was the villain for this movie,2023-06-05
after reading this comment i’m even happier that i chose the screening with subtitles,2023-06-05
theaters were given specific instructions on how to set the sound settings for spiderman many of them never followed the directions in my theater the sound was fantastic,2023-06-06
"spot never cared about spiderman before getting in his accident though he was just  off miles ruined his life and had no idea who he was

i see what you mean though spot felt like what they were going for with electro but it was done much better",2023-06-05
" specific nitpick but i thought the scene where gwen comes out of miles room was weird his parents really didnt react enough for me lol the girl just comes out of his room tells them she came through the window and miles is missing

they already had an idea that miles might be dating this girl and it just looks like they were hooking up and sleeping there they do react with a really type of response but are more just focused on what she has to say about miles",2023-06-07
yea the beginning segment with gwen i thought wouldve been fantastic but i was totally distracted by the sound the entire time thought i was going crazy and i kept thinking about how good it looked and how frustrated i was that the lack of sound was taking me out of it,2023-06-07
that would really  she’s such an endearing character,2023-06-07

it wasnt so much we let them die as our canon events have already happened if they believe the multiverse depends on those deaths its somewhat easier to grapple with ie that was bad but ultimately it was for the greater good,2023-06-06
being spiderman is about sacrifices one person vs an entire multiverse isnt really hard to understand,2023-06-06
"it’s supposed to signify the older generation vs new generation the other or older spidermen probably see themselves as similar to doctor strange working out the single solution to defeating thanos where they believe following miguel is the solution to keeping the world stabilized and on the right path 

miles serves as a reminder to stay true to who spiderman is supposed to be 

it’s kind of like in our real world how the older people get the more stubbornrigid their opinions are",2023-06-06
"theyve been through immense loss and need some rationalization for what happened

the idea that loss is worth it and all part of the plan is a very common coping mechanism",2023-06-07
i dont understand the pregnant spider lady point peter literally carried a live baby around for the whole battle,2023-06-10
why do you think it was mid,2023-06-11
the entire point is that spidermen are a dime a dozen while miles is a statistical anomaly whose completely unique it’s a callback to when miles popped up in comics he got shat on even then as not really a spiderman by the readers and a knockoff who was made by an ignorant writer cashing in on the ultimate universe rebirth,2023-06-11
didn’t realize it until someone pointed it out on twitter but miles’ secret id coming out narrative reminded me of the common lgbt coming out dilemma,2023-06-03
what imagery are you referring to specifically,2023-06-04
,2023-06-11
"i dunno man i think the premise of the main protagonist being right over one of the antagonists shouldnt come as a surprise especially in a comic book movie

the whole movie shows that miles is right that you can save the one person without destroying the universe the inconsistency with how these canon events happen plus the fate of gwens dad changing shows us this if miguels interpretation of the canon was to be believed both miles universe and his spiders original universe shouldve collapsed long ago due to how drastically things changed

this doesnt make miguel experiences wrong it doesnt mean his actions arent justified from his point of view but its showing that he clearly didnt get the whole picture hes come to a false conclusion based on his own traumatic experiences which blind him from whatever the truth about the canon is

miles decision to run and to try and save his father makes complete sense why on earth would he just  guess ill let my father die because some guy told him that miles isnt the guy to make some cold and calculating reasoning doing so would be ridiculously outofcharacter of him its essentially the trolley problem but whereas most of the spiderpeople have resigned themselves to making the obvious binary choice of 1 person or a universe miles challenges that by essentially saying why does it have to be a choice in the first place having characters be driven by emotion is what makes them relatable and what makes the film great",2023-06-07
multiverse trolley problem,2023-06-07
i think the movie set up expectations to believe miguel but im guessing theyre going to subvert the idea a lot of people see the plot of the movie as a critique of the spider man comics where all the stories need to have the same plot points,2023-06-07
its not just the price of 1 life its the price of the life of a close loved one i think most people would take the risk of saving them especially when it was already shown that they have tech to prevent the annihilation that may occur,2023-06-07
"i think there are two ways where miguel is mistaken though

first of all if miles wasn’t supposed to be spiderman’s why is his father death a canon event maybe it isn’t maybe it doesn’t need to be

second of all if you notice when the universe where miguel was was erased he didn’t stop a canon event from happening he went there and replaced the other dead miguel miguel did die there he just went there and took its place so for the universe miguel died but for his family they never noticed so maybe it was more that the universe was destroyed due to an incursion a la doctor strange


also makes me wonder… what happened to miguel original universe he just abandoned it

also why is that vision peter b parker there",2023-06-07
" so at the cost of 1 single persons life we should risk all of existence

miles isnt trying to just save his dad hes trying to find a way to save his dad and the universe miguel wont even try and in an infinite multiverse miguel is letting infinite people die by refusing to even try and find a way to save them all because hes trying to make himself feel better by overcorrecting after his own attempt failed miguel is right only if you accept it at face value when he says theres no other way

 but in order to take the second option you must pay the price of 1 life

 what a cheap and low price thats a steal almost literally

then they should tell the guy whose life is on the line to at least give him a chance to make an informed decision to selfsacrifice they rescue innocent people theyre not supposed to sentence them",2023-06-07
"even though hes risking the destruction of a whole universe

the more unhinged that miguel the comes the more you should realise to not be taking his word at face value he could very easily either be lying or simply misinformed about the true nature of why his universe collapsed and that he turns to violence so quickly and readily shows how mentally unstable he is it doesnt matter if the multiverse is at stake miguel isnt going to be the one who saves it his martyr complex makes him think hes the only one capable but he simply isnt responsible enough

so at the cost of 1 single persons life we should risk all of existence

its not one person its a lot of people miguel has established a society which excepts that some people must die in order for the universe to be right thats not being the good guy thats being a fascist spiderman is a hero he saves people who are danger he should not consign certain people to certain death that is not something a hero does

youre also taking the narrative very literally at not viewing the metaphoricalmetatextual reading of the scene miguel appealing to the sanctity of canon is a metatextual analysis of spiderman stories that certain beats must happen and that spiderman cannot exist without tragedy the scene doesnt exist to reconfirm these preconceptions it challenges the viewer  do writers need to constantly need to reuse ideas to justify that theyre telling an authentic spiderman or is the core identity of spiderman about more than just plot details does spiderman need trauma in order to exist do humans need trauma to find meaning is it ok to justify a traumatic society just because someone says that it has to be that way these are the kinds of questions you should be asking during that scene you shouldnt be taking the malthusian fascist maths equation at face value

the films a twoparter theres an entire movie left to disprove miguels fundamental assumption but i already know that will happen because the emotional context of the scene makes it clear that the viewer shouldnt be accepting what they are being told",2023-06-07
"miguel has the same logic that a nature documentary filmmaker has if you see a rabid lion about to eat a beautiful gazelle you dont step in you let nature run its course 

miles would be stepping in and trying to feed both the lion and the gazelle in a way that doesnt involve  its just kinda cruel to tell him your dad is about to die and theres nothing you can do about it we wont let you",2023-06-07

its a meta commentary on comic writers how even though spiderman is meant to try and save everyone on a narrative level he is never actually allowed to do that due to some arbitrary writers rule that spiderman has to lose big miles morales conceptually was made to redefine what spiderman can be and likewise he serves as the outlier for fate in this film too,2023-06-03
"no it keeps the principles of spiderman


miles saved captain singh and wants to save his father so he’s trying to save everyone he sees in danger microcosm


miguel is trying to keep the multiverse alive so he’s literally trying to save everyone macrocosm


they’re both good guys they’re both trying to ‘save everyone’ in their own way and that’s why it’s such a great dilemma



miguel tried to tell miles that he was an anomaly and doesn’t belong little does he know miles is the necessary anomaly who will not only save the lives of everyone microcosm but also save the multiverse the lives of everyone macrocosm miles is the solution and necessary conflict turned resolution in miguel’s timeline— miles has the answer on how to change canon events while not having universes destroyed


you change canon events in every universe the same way that way they are consistent and thus happen in every universe thus they are still canon events and no longer anomalies


it’s happening in 3 universes so far

captain singh spiderindia’s love interest’s dad — miles saves singh

captain stacy gwen’s dad — he retires from being a cop after gwen revealed herself to him


miles’ dad it’s inevitable that this is where the plot goes


you don’t want the multiverse to collapse miguel go to every other universe and save every captain this will keep the multiverse alive you have the power to jump into every universe so it’s your responsibility to apply the necessary changes",2023-06-03
same i found it really hard to keep up with and the experience was more exhausting than it was enjoyable the first one was already fast but this was x10,2023-06-06
tom holland’s spidey was directly referenced though miguel complaining about “doctor strange and that nerdy kid” or something like that which has to be a reference to no way home can’t believe some people are still complaining about tom holland his spidey’s fine,2023-06-05
there was also a reference to homecoming’s “guy in the chair” line,2023-06-04
"they’re saving him as a live action appearance in the next movie at least i think they are

i 100 agree with this felt like it needed to be cut 15 minutes shorter,2023-06-06
"just noticed the “protect trans kids” flag on my second watch really love adding that in as it not only makes perfect sense with gwen’s character but is an important message 

plus on a completely dumb note the colors of the flag match really nicely with gwen’s universe haha",2023-06-04
it’s actually spiderman 2 ps5,2023-06-05
theyre definitely gonna do a subversion since miles wasnt technically supposed to become spiderman his dad as captain wont be in danger spot will go after his mum instead,2023-06-02
i don’t think there’s 90 minutes to 2 hours of movie in miles dealing with earth 42 then saving his dad from spotspider society i think there’s going to be a twist and my current theory is it will have to do with gwen’s universe miles connected the dots  gwen’s dad is ‘a captain’ then he steps down potentially curbing that canon event i think this is going to be a plot point in beyond,2023-06-02

harkening back to donald glover being fancasted for the first reboot spiderman role and so many racist comments id see online about it quite the full circle moment seeing his cameo now i wonder if he knew just how far this would all go with the idea of a black spiderman,2023-06-02
they were saving everyone they could but miguel specifically wanted them to leave the indian cop and i think there was a kid there too to die its not like they were ignoring other people in favor of the cop,2023-06-02
"see this comment i left elsewhere for my thoughts on the “plotproblem”


",2023-06-03
"i think i can forgive that aspect because it functions as a lesson on how loss is inevitable it shapes us we grow from it accept it and carry on with our lives 

its strange to see heroes not saving people but miguel has them convinced i reckon the sequel will show miles saving his dad disproving canon events and showing the spiderpeople that loss while an important part of life doesnt have to define them and isnt necessary gwen has already foreshadowed that a little with her dad surviving",2023-06-03

"ha having rigorously avoided spoilers neither did i  i literally did an aw cmon when the tobecontinued card popped up but ill get over it

"i agree i had the same thought but just chose to ignore it if you wanted to give the movie the benefit of the doubt you could say that running away is a lot easier than catching someone especially if they have spiderman powers so maybe most spiderpeople would be able to hold their own running away from all the others

add to that that he has force field disabling and invisibility powers which most of the other ones dont have",2023-06-05
i think it was more the sound mixing than his accent although the accent probably didn’t help several parts of the movie were difficult to hear for me and many other people including gwen’s opening monologue and some of the action scenes it’s a common complaint,2023-06-05
"thats related to his comic backstory

if i recall correctly miguel was a dna scientist and spiderman already existed in his world miguel wanted to see if he could alter his dna to become similar to spiderman and tests his chemical on himself it works but he finds out that the changes arent permanent shortly after his employer alchemex patents the serum he invented and blackmails him into continuing to work for them because they know he needs the serum to live 

now it could be different for the movie but is at least playing off of his comic backstory",2023-06-06
"the original peter parker has an uncle who dies and later a police captain close to him died miguel is implying all spidermen have to go through a version of that captain stacy death 

he has canon events because while hes not supposed to be spiderman he is still spiderman miguel is just making him feel guilty for  over another universe and leaving it without a spiderman of its own in the process",2023-06-07
2 was what i was thinking if he is not supposed to be spiderman then his fathers death is not set in stone,2023-06-07
i feel like repeat viewings are definitely rewarded theres so much going on,2023-06-07
the entire movie makes more sense if miles is 17 tbh with all the going off the college plot etc i feel like he was written as 17 but then sony made them keep him 15 to be a bit younger and appeal to kids,2023-06-15
didnt give me that vibe seeing as he said were family when giving her some money of course its possible,2023-06-19
you said it not me,2023-06-04
idk how people can call this better than the first one when it literally set up a ton of things that didnt even pay off yet,2023-06-10
i felt this way too not because of the lighting but because the animation is so complex and jampacked and obviously some elements are starkly different to others like hobiespiderpunk that during the action sequences i just couldnt tell what was going on it was very disorienting at times and i felt sad that i couldnt understand what i was seeing,2023-06-29
i felt this while watching as well there shouldve been a lighting warning i am specifically not taking some of my friends due to the lighting,2023-06-06
the point of the movie is that theyre wrong and my read is that the difference between them and miles is that theyve already lost their loved ones theyre all traumatized and believing that it had to be this way is a useful lie to tell oneself,2023-06-07
thats where i think in the third movie migel will come to ralize that miles can save his father without it affecting the spiderverse,2023-06-07
"one person vs an entire multiverse 

its not exactly rocket science",2023-06-07
the disagreement is over predestiny or fate ie there is no way to guarantee that miles dad living actually destroys the universe so you could theoretically be letting him die for no reason when you have the power to stop it whats being overlooked by miguel  co is that they all had a fighting chance to save their police captain and failed which is brutal but a much healthier development arc than knowing its going to happen and idly standing by,2023-06-07
i think itll be better after next year and we can see both halves as a whole but right now they cut the movie at the end of act ii and its a weird place the only blemish on this masterpiece for me personally,2023-06-07
wonder how you reacted to infinity war,2023-06-07
"see i’m on the opposite end i adored the first one but mostly forgot about it over the past few years then i watched this and i’m about to see it for the third time tomorrow it’s rare for me to love movies this much 

i also rewatched the first one the day after i saw the second it was incredibly good but it felt a little bland in comparison 

overall it definitely seems like a personal preference thing i loved gwen’s arc and the family drama a lot of people didn’t",2023-06-08
i think itll age a lot better if one was to rewatch it right before the third movie to come out and just treat it all as a 4 hour movie,2023-06-11
movie felt to short it was flying though the movie then just abruptly cut out without an ending,2023-06-11
sounds like this wasnt your type of movie,2023-06-02
"i get it but it’s pretty obvious that they needed that in order to get an emotional connection with the audience and characters if it didn’t have that it would just be more “empty” as they would need to fill the void making it really only be an “action” movie which isn’t a bad thing but since the first movie it was obvious they were trying to put heart into it with peter and mj’s relationship miles and his father etc

it’s also part of a trilogy so it’s not really supposed to stand on its own",2023-06-03
it was first announced as a part 1 and 2 but they dropped that title bit along the way as seen here on youtube,2023-06-04
peter b and gwen mistreated miles a lot sadly hopefuly they make it up to miles big time next film or it would not make any sense miles still wanna be around them,2023-06-08
so in the comics 616 jessica drew gets pregnant and uses a special suit to fight while heavily pregnant yes it was silly and ridiculous and didnt really make sense so i imagine this jessica being pregnant is a nod to that store she even wears a similar costume,2023-06-08
this all of this,2023-06-08
theres trope for that,2023-06-11
i started to really miss the beginning of the movie when it was just gwens world or just miles world cuz i felt overstimulated too,2023-06-10
yeah you can tell its a good movie when the only complaint anyone has is that it ended,2023-06-11
"i just watched it i feel like im taking crazy pills i thought it was super disappointing

my biggest issue is when they completely made up their own definition of what has to happen for a canon event

they kept bringing up that a police captain has to die and thats why its important because miles dad is about to be made a captain while handwaving that the death of uncle aarons death was miles moment

earth 96283 had nothing to do with a police captain in the first spiderverse they show gwen saving her dad only to be retconned that he died oh and all police captains have to die

they just made the rules up i liked the concept of canon events they just used it to make up self imposed stakes",2023-08-26
well considering ive been waiting 5 years for this one a year doesnt seem so bad,2023-06-02
the wait isnt even that long 9 months for a new part is nothing we waited 5 years for this one,2023-06-02
no that version of miguel also lived probably around 2099 he just never became spiderman as he died before then so he slotted in just fine at least going off of that slideshow of that miguel,2023-06-02
"i never liked that line 

they traded hella lives but they were wakandan lives so i guess they dont matter

and its ridiculous to be so obstinate when even vision sees that the most sensible path forward is the one that the avengers refuse to take",2023-06-02
the twist is that gwen’s dad is now subverting the canon,2023-06-02
"i believe there are two separate cannon events

loss of a family member… uncle benaunt mayuncle aaron etc which gives the spiderperson motivation to use their “great power”

and loss of a loved one and i guess that loved one may also be a family member… mjgwenpeterdad this is the loss that angers the spiderperson and tests their “true responsibility”",2023-06-02
uncle aaron acted as the equivalent of miless uncle ben death which is the first canon event there is also a second canon event that was specified as death of the police captain miless father got promoted to captain before he experienced the death of a police captain making his father the next target for that second event,2023-06-02
i wouldn’t be surprised if he stole one and that’s the one he threw would have to go watch closely to see what it looks like…,2023-06-02
it looked different i think he made a new watch possibly with the items he stole,2023-06-02
what a spectacular film,2023-06-02
" it feels like it ends right after the seconds act

because theres a third act theres a 3rd spiderverse movie and it comes out next spring",2023-06-02
will you adopt me,2023-06-02
i agree,2023-06-02
regarding the canon event as i understand it 1 is the uncle ben event the one that instills the sense of loss and gives the peters the reason to be spider the second is the death that comes as a consequence of spiderman being spiderman the one that challenges his identity and his morals both of these are integral to the overarching and shared arc that make the spider people who they are,2023-06-03
what was the mario kart joke,2023-06-02
yes,2023-06-02
miguel was just upset that doctor strange and mcu peter ripped a few big holes in the multiverse during no way home,2023-06-02
reference to no way home and how doctor strange nearly broke the multiverse,2023-06-02
"miguel and dont even get me started on doctor strange and that little nerd back on earth199999

gwen doctor strange sounds like he shouldnt a medical license

something along those lines",2023-06-02
i couldnt hear  during that sequence haha the movie was very quiet and mixed weirdly,2023-06-02
bangs,2023-06-02
imo it’s on par if not better than the first one the tracks are timed excellently like the miles scene you gave as an example there’s a lot of returning motifs and the new ones are mindblowingly good check out spiderman 2099’s theme if you don’t mind music spoilers,2023-06-02
same avoid trailers for ever,2023-06-02
it said cough lord and miller always sneak a cough into their movies,2023-06-02
yes great comment i missed that as well and then forgot by the end,2023-06-02
this movie really clowns on no way home from doing the multiverse stuff better to having a spidey that doesnt just lay down and let his life be torn apart because of metatextual rules,2023-06-02

but more and more glitches happening ups the chances of that for example vamp spidey got to actually live with his replacement family for some time before the whole universe imploded",2023-06-02
his uncle was the first canon event his uncle ben while his dad would be a different canon event his captain stacy makes me wonder if there will be something about gwen dying which could be another canon event it occurs to me that might be part of why spiderwoman didn’t want gwen to visit him,2023-06-02
less than a year,2023-06-02
no seeing the first one is pretty critical in this case,2023-06-02
need to see the first one,2023-06-02
first one is a must see for this also why wouldnt you want to watch the first before this one its the better of the two movies anyways haha,2023-06-02
"i dont think so changing an event creates an alternate timeline the thing with spiderman is that saving spiderpeople from tragedy may prevent them from becoming the person theyre supposed to be and in this case the heroes that stop spot thats why those universes become consumed by him  

saving the villains from their fate wouldnt change the existence of spiderman

in reality all these movies change the rules slightly so it fits the plot so you might have to suspend your disbelief a bit even for inuniverse fictional rules lol",2023-06-02
great q i think he just got access to space and time so he just gained that information or it could be that he actually doesnt have any idea and only went to other universes colliders just to get more powerful and in the final scene he came back to 1610 just to cause general mayhem and in this gneral mayhem miles dad is destined to die,2023-06-02
i mean its definitely because of the spot dude became a multiversal being thats gonna have consequences,2023-06-02
i think its the case as well that the next film is going to reveal that miguels understanding of whats going on is flawed but i really dont want the film to do that  the dilemma presented is incredibly meaningful and id like to see the next film actually give its position on what the right thing to do is spidermans whole thing  and i want the next film to give its characters consequences regardless of which position it takes,2023-06-02
i doubt it i think the whole idea of the canon event and miles’ rejection of it has a meta level meaning that spiderman doesn’t always need this level of personal tragedies to be good and mote importantly superhero stories really should stop using them as a motivation tool and come up with something better,2023-06-02
this is what i thought as well it makes sense with the whole spiderman and gwen never work out in any universe thing,2023-06-02
exactly we should’ve been able to see different versions of earth and different super heroes but it just flopped,2023-06-02
yeah i think its a theatre thing like they asked to raise the volume but many theatres didnt but i read this somewhere here so im not sure but i definitely ahd sound issues and im so disappointed because the first movie had phenomneal sound design,2023-06-02
with the shots of his school and everything i need to know this too it’s been bugging me since i heard it,2023-06-03
"well they did state sometimes it can be stopped sometimes it cannot

so maybe not their first rodeo 

but you are right i’d like to see an explanation for this but this could all just be strictly for the spider’s main universes not the infinite of the multiverse like in mcu

because there should be an infinite number of miles with spider powers",2023-06-03
100 they both appear in the third movie alongside japanese spidey and maybe tom hollands spidey,2023-06-03
he’s already beyond the spiderverse in 42 since it doesn’t have a spiderman,2023-06-03
"i thought the same but it’s not gwen’s place to reveal miles secret

but the parents also knew he was lying the whole time so they just assumed he has been doing bad things or fighting it was allured they both weren’t the best teens growing up so they just assume he needs to get out of his system and spread his wings

that’s my take",2023-06-03
mrs chen the shopkeeper from venom,2023-06-03
theyre leaving money on the table if they dont do a marathon screening of all three spiderverse films when the third one releases especially since this second film directly leads into no 3,2023-06-03
"yeah i also felt the scenes were playing sorta slow like a computer struggling with a resource intensive game

but otherwise phenomenal movie",2023-06-03
it was honestly just weird tbh,2023-06-03
they’ll probably turn good by the end of the trilogy they’re probably bad now as they both probably took the death of the dad pretty hard miles will probably turn them maybe with the help of his dad in his own universe,2023-06-03

doubt its a plot hole he either has a misperception or another motive",2023-06-03
i think thats why miguel is so angry at miles why is miles allowed to be the wrong spiderman in the wrong universe but when he does it he loses everything im curious to hear their explanation as well,2023-06-03
he doesn’t have a good point because the solution to his problem is if you change the canon event in 1 universe you go into every other universe and make sure the same changes happen with great power comes great responsibility— he has the power to jump into every universe yet doesn’t change things for the better when he can be he can go into every universe and save each uncle ben or each captain that should be his responsibility from the great power that he has anyways by the end of the next movie  probably realize this because a new canon is rising up… spiderindia captain is alive gwen’s dad captain is now alive and will survive and miles will probably save his dad so his universe’s captain will survive miles wrote a new canon which started with saving the indian captain and is now spreading to other universes,2023-06-03

i just assumed that the legit strike force team members knew whereas the majority of the spider people were only part timers and didn’t know the full story of why miles was being chased,2023-06-04
counterpoint miguel might have tried to avoid recruiting any spiderpeople who would be likely to oppose him he was reluctant to bring gwen along at the start because of her connection to miles  and it seems like he was friends with peter b before he got super serious about maintaining canon events,2023-06-04
or its the green and purple of the prowler that miles now has to deal with instead of miguel,2023-06-04
probably because spot can go to dimensions on his own the more powerful he gets the further removed he becomes from cross dimensional rules,2023-06-04
just the 1610 miles was on track to become prowler the earth42 miles was going to become spiderman but the spider was taken by spot right before it bit him eventually biting 1610 miles instead so their paths flipped,2023-06-04
no,2023-06-04
"i mean its the multiverse possibilities can be anything really 

the better question is what happens to miles if he didnt get the spider bite while theres still a spiderman

same with miles being 1610 because 1610 is the ultimate comics number…",2023-06-05
i can’t speak on miles’ character but just by going off of peter he always had a darker side his classmates picked on him so he despised them and once he got his abilities he used them selfishly it wasn’t until ben died that he understood he must use his powers for good our miles already had an admiration for spidermanan idea of what a hero should be and yeah earth 42 miles dad was still a cop sure but what do kids do they rebel and he loves his cool uncle though unethical as much as our miles doesdid,2023-06-05
our miles is a mistake when the spot is explaining how he pulled the spider into 1610 we can see that it was literally about to bite 42 miles before it got pulled,2023-06-05
during one of the fights spiderpunk comments are those my chucks so i assume she borrowed them from him after crashing in his universe and if i recall the ballet slipper scenes where in the beginning before she joined the spider society,2023-06-05
" i mean if the movie wanted to comment on the harms of the stagnancy of the spiderverses and storylinesome of the people who buy comics rejecting miles morales

then how come miles is shown to have become a villianbad without the spider bite does that mean the world is only bad because there are no spiders to protect it

in that scene we heard j jonah jameson complaining about what a menace the sinister 6 is  usually if he said the sky was blue id check for myself  but in this universe maybe hes right about people being villains because they are  and people who we know as heroes are villains  introducing spiderman to a universe like that wouldnt really work in my opinion  however i dont believe that the writers thought that much into it  

or perhaps it isnt a mirror universe after all and its simply the universe with this adaptations version of evil morales from the comics  a very lose adaptation  

that version was an adult this version is the same age  the comic book version was from the mainstream universe this one is from a parallel universe",2023-06-05
well spot does originate from miles’ own universe so maybe that plays into it he will end up using power from outside the universe to  miles’ dad so it’s still a bit weird but maybe it’s not the same as an entirely foreign entity entering the universe and disrupting things,2023-06-05

miles isnt part of the canon so the rules dont apply to him   
but also since he isnt part of the canon he can affect the canon is mysterious ways

i believe some writers didnt realize who jefferson davis was so the inuniverse reason is that jefferson  took his wifes last name at some point to avoid the comparison,2023-06-06
no clue myself but it was a very weird name for a black cop from brooklyn anyway sad though in a way because if miles took his last name he would have been miles davis still though a black man named after the president of the confederacy is a wild one,2023-06-06
in the comics jeff legally changes his name to morales,2023-06-07

preventing canon events if we are to believe what miguel said when he took his variants place,2023-06-08
"in the comics no not really now what can cause incursions and other universe ending events is if a universe is bombarded with too much dimension hopping and time travel but there are ways to fix that and there are spells and methods to safely move between universes 

miguel is not a reliable narrator",2023-06-08
storywise miguel pretty much says that hollands spiderman  too much it sounds like he doesnt think he deserves to be there,2023-06-08
definitely because theyre gonna have new tom holland stuff in btsv and dont want to spoil it by i introducing him with archive footage,2023-06-08
everyone probably forgot about him,2023-06-09
the reason likely stems from ip rights and the fact that both disney and sony spiderman worlds are only connected to a certain extent,2023-06-09
"i think that miless dad was destined to die just not because of spot remember neither miles nor spot were supposed to happen— theyre anomalies miless universe assumedly course corrected already for his presence because 1610peter died so the spiderman canon is still mostly intact so going by the logic of the movie jeff is still supposed to die but its less they have to die at this specific scenario and more of theyre supposed to die by x means type of deal as long as it fits the canon of police captain dies saving child from falling rubble and spiderman fails to save him is met its fine 

but spot isnt accounted for as hes an anomaly and issue that affects not just miless universe but can affect otherwise which makes him a unique and very dangerous threat spots actions just more or less cemented what that canon event had to be rather than it being the original scenario",2023-06-09

but then i realized its better theres a second movie than trying to rush and finish the story in the next 3060 minutes 

they need to 

1 save miles from earth 42 which includes finding him and dealing with prowler

2 save miles dad which also probably includes showdown versus miguel and his crew 

3 beat the spot

4 miles reconciliation with his family

5 ending to miles and gwen

6 whatever peter b and miles reconciliation will be

7 dealing with miguel",2023-06-12

now you must draw portraits of him in your sketchbooks till you two meet again,2023-06-15
hes not originally supposed to be spiderman but he is now so he gets the canon events the original spiderman who died either lived out the death of a police captain or was going to in the future,2023-06-13
i think its because nobody really understands how it works so since his dad dying seems to be an important canon event due to how much it aligns with others then miguel might think its miles universe trying to correct events to better align with everyone elses,2023-06-13

miles was not meant to be spiderman but he is spiderman now so he gets the canon events

gotta see how the next movie addresses this it may be that now gwen is going to have another seperate police captain close to her die or miguel is wrong about what canon events are and how they work",2023-06-15
gwens cannon event was peter parker dying,2023-06-15
there are definitely a couple changes to canon in this and the previous flick but they try to cover their  a bit by having miguel say sometimes we can hold things together sometimes we cant as in it destabilizes everything but sometimes they can stitch it back together in theory chris pines spiderman dying and presumably most of the plot of that movie was not a canon event and according to miguel should have vaporized that dimension but somehow they fixed it i guess,2023-06-16
or miles dad dies in a freaky accident caused by the super natural so miles took the role of prowler as a replacement for the spiderman in earth 42,2023-06-18
i think evil miles is actually going to let good miles go aaron is going to get  and turn on both miles and probably drop this revelation in the process good miles inspires evil miles to be a better person and actually help his universe,2023-06-18

captain george stacy,2023-07-14
well yeah in the opening he was a good guy and at his core he is a hero thats why peter b and gwen tried to work with him as much as they did regarding stuff with miles they trusted and respected him however by the time miles meets miguel some 3 months later he is undoubtedly an antagonist hes let the weight of responsibility and concern about maintaining the canon in what he believes is the right way to consume him using that concern to assure himself that hes doing the right thing trying to imprison and assaulting a 15 year old  is not what heroes do though miguels ends do not justify his means,2023-07-10
neither 1610 miles protagonist or 42 miles bad were supposed to become spidermen the spot— when he was human—managed to bring over earth42s spider to earth1610 miles then got bit and became spiderman the result of that is earth42s peter parker never got bit and thus never had a spiderman 42 miles then turned to crime and became the prowler in a distraught nyc while our miles became a herospiderman—the one that wasnt supposed to exist,2023-07-14
"you raise a lot of great questions about the canon and how miguels explanation doesnt match up with a lot thats happened thats exactly the point btsv will definitely give us more insight into how these things actually work and show why miguel is wrong

earth42 miles doesnt have the influence of his policeman father anymore but he does have his uncle aaron we know that our miles really looked up to his aaron so its likely that earth42 miles did the same without jeff to balance out the more criminal influence of aaron it makes sense for miles to take after his uncle more and more

the spider was brought to another universe by happenstance spot and dr octavius were running small tests on interdimensional technology and one of these tests happened to pull through the spider from earth42 since that earth is so similar to 1610 thats why spot claims responsibility for making miles spiderman because his testing is what brought the spider that bit him to earth1610",2023-07-13

their lives arent great they dont have a lot of friends and their relationships with their parents are deteriorating the only person that understands them is the other they quiet literally need each other

 theyre so likeable they havent showed a glimpse of evil or selfishness throughout the movies

their reasons to not be together are very understandable being together has a chance of ruining the spider verse as there cant be multiple spideys in one universe gwen dies whenever she falls for spiderman so thats one thing to look out for it literally makes sense

all of this makes the story so much more painful",2023-06-04
those must be the only 2 movies you have watched because across the verse is mid at best i don’t know what the hype is for i guess the animation makes people think the movie is good almost nothing happened the whole movie i sat through that and i’m almost convinced there wasn’t a single line that wasn’t corny as  also the fight scenes seemed to have 0 stakes because every fight scene was just characters fighting a bad guy nothing happening and everybody is laughing during the fight i’m genuinely curious if i watched the wrong movie or if everyone who watched it hasn’t watched a movie before this one not only that everything seemed so cluttered and the first 30 minutes of the movies audio sounded like a 3rd grader made it someone please send me the actual movie so i can see what your seeing,2023-06-18

in the comics peter is more or less constantly surrounded by death and he is quite defined by gwen and her father dying as anything else really not just him but his entire cast is changed by the events it pushes harry over the edge it softens flash and it pushes mj and peter even closer together and it also wrecks peters life,2023-06-08

 i dont think it matters how it happens as long as it does happen and maybe if it wasnt spot it wouldve been someone else i think the implication was there wouldve been some other event that wouldve caused pavritr to have to pick between the bus or captain singh and the end result is the same no matter how he gets there

",2023-06-02
i loved that miguels universe has this look where the sketch lines are still kinda visible and stuff and u can see the same thing on the watches which immediately tells you what universe they were made in not like that wasnt clear but still a fun detail imo,2023-06-02

"i feel like a big part of the third one is we are going to find out that miguel is full of  what happened to him probably happened because he literally tried to replace another version of himself and that probably wrecked that universe 

the destruction that happened in mumbattan after they disrupted the canon event from what we saw wasnt really universe ruining it could have been some aftermath from the battle with spot honestly 

maybe i am wrong but i feel like miguel is gonna be exposed in the next one what we know about how the multiverse works was mostly explained by him if hes lying or omitting details for his own personal reasons it can change everything",2023-06-02
perfectly stated and i mirror these feelings my biggest gripe is that im afraid the writers are going to find miles an out and that will cheapen this entire thing if they can stick the landing it will not only make for a great third film but will also retroactively bolster this second film atsvs fate as a good or bad movie in essence rests on what they choose to do in part iii im interested but feeling a little uneasy right now time will tell cheers,2023-06-02
"i meanthis isnt flashpoint where miles has to accept that his fathers death was an essential point in history and was crucial in making him into the person he is theyre asking him to stand back and let it happen because reasons its hardly selfish of him to not just accept the word of someone hes never met who provides no proof that he has to allow his father to die when he is capable of saving him thats just heroic

if miles tried to break the multiverse to get his father back thatd be different but what miguel is trying to do is to force things to happen a certain way then claim that it was all obviously predestined the only certain example we have of a universe being destroyed was when he inserted himself into another familys life that could have been because of something he did something someone else in that universe did or any other number of reasons",2023-06-02

it makes sense that he outmaneuvers them he makes a better spiderman than the rest of the spidermen do because he wasnt meant to be one of them in the first place theyre limited by their conformity and canon while he has a idiosyncratic ability to thread the needle and find a wait out of a fate that wasnt actually even meant for him in the first place,2023-06-03

narratively speaking depending on whats in the second half it might be justified the setup for part 2 has a ton of potential that they can have 2 hours worth of story to tell can you imagine trying to trim this film into 1 hour and keep everything let alone doing the same for the second half to fit everything into 2 12 hours",2023-06-07

i thought they were going to say something like every gwen dies and thats why miguel was reluctant to recruit her in the very beginning,2023-06-11
no,2023-06-11
i absolutely love how this movie looks in motion but i feel like it doesnt look great in stills its a very unique style to do that whole 3d blur thing and the watercolor stuff for gwens universe but it sometimed came across as tacky and distracting,2023-06-10
this is not the mcu,2023-06-11
that obviously means alchemax had already accessed alternate universes and was experimenting on them,2023-06-20
"miles didnt notice the city being different because he just underwent like a ton of  take a normal spiderman day and multiply that by 50 adding onto the fear and betrayal hes feeling dude was on autopilot swinging home and questioning his entire existence so he was way too distracted to notice the details that wouldve given it away

they probably avoided having too many different spideys interacting with miles to avoid being too fanservicey and distracting from the plot the movie already runs pretty long with miles only interacting with the main cast

true

gwen and peter really wanted to visit miles and if they thought it possible they wouldve but they knew just how serious miguel was about not risking things with miles anomalous status if either gwen or peter did step out of line to visit miles that would pose the risk of losing their watch and being completely trapped in their own dimension forever they were trying to be patient in hopes of helping miguel get all the villain anomalies sorted so that they could convince him to let them see miles we see that this did actually work for gwen and she was able to see him after being patient unfortunately spot happened and messed things up from there",2023-06-28
great opinion,2023-07-10

miles didnt go into spots universe wut,2023-06-03
i agree with the animation a lot of spinning the camera and anytime it was a cohesive animation style like in miles world it was so much better  the constant changing of spider punk bothered me and the renaiccwanse vulture,2023-06-04
miles knocked miles out,2023-06-03
can you imagine seeing some weird bizarro clone of yourself walking with your uncle and your first instinct isn’t to knock him out,2023-06-03
i think it makes sense based on the explanation in the film his view is that he is preventing universal genocide  as part of that is forced to make some very difficult choices that are grinding him down terribly he’s been forced into a bad spot  i’m pretty sure movie 3 will involve him redeeming himself to help miles because at the end of the day he’s still spiderman,2023-06-05
its been more than a decade but my recollection is that the whole world was a dystopian hellhole  this world looked nothing like it save for a small section  so the writers thought of him as a mouthpiece for the villains role first accuracy to the original version second,2023-06-05
"the other complaint i have is that they shouldnt have any references to live action movies

yess ive been waiting to see if anyone else felt this way the mcu has so severely disappointed me in recent years that i dont want to be reminded of any of it i also feel like bringing in the live action stuff complicates things in a way i cant quite describe its just better for them to standalone even just seeing live action people playing within an animated movie is jarring and takes me out of the world which is why i didnt like the donald glover cameo

when i saw the in association with marvel thing at the start my heart skipped a beat i dont want them to get their grimy moneyobsessed hands on these movies i dont want them to ruin this the way they ruined their own universe",2023-06-29
"how do you know no one died in the tobey universe that was a police captain when we see him again in the spiderman no way home film it’s been years and a lot has happened to him…

i love the tie ins as long as they don’t try to strongly connect the mcu to this because to me the mcu is currently a mess and maybe needs to die 

like if they wanna cameo some mcu stuff that’s fine or vice versa… but no straight up story strongly involving any live action stuff",2023-06-05
"it seems it sounds like miles would only doom his own universe

just got out of a screening and miguel says that canonbreaking events can create things the black hole thing that destroy the entire spiderverse if they arent contained its visualised when the mumbhatten world shatters and it spread through the entire web and it falls like red rain around miles during miguels explanation they could have probably done a better job explaining this for sure though 

when miguel calls miles an anomaly he doesnt mean literally  he means his existence is essentially an anomaly because he was bit by a spider from another dimension this  miguel off because miles is breaking the rules simply by existing the thing he would do to doom his own universe is save his dad which if we take miguel at face value would create another black hole thing that could spread to every universe and he knows miles will simply keep doing this until the spiderverse is destroyed or thats what he believes anyway thats why miguel didnt want miles to know about the spiderverse canon situation because he knows miles will break canon by saving his dad whether this is a goodright thing to believe is another story",2023-06-05

i understand that the character is canonically black so its true to the comics and since its from another britain i can dig that maybe its a different alternate britain with more black people but in terms of this planets britain and especially the 80s britain punk scene youre not wrong its not that there were no black british punks back then but there sure werent a lot i didnt mind the character but i do get what youre saying,2023-06-05

"i don’t think you’d be lost you could follow the story just fine they also recap whenever there was an important link to the first movie

"no real spoilers but supervague mention of order of events stuff like the climax would probably feel

i wouldnt recommend it at all this movie assumes youve seen the first one i guess you would get by and understand whats going on in terms of storyeven if it doesnt always fill in backstories the implications of what happened in the past movie would be an easy jump i think its hard to pretend i havent seen the first one

but i also think it would be 100x more enjoyable if you see the first before thislots of callbacks backstory and characterizations from that carry over into this one the climax for example relies on knowing what happened to miles in the first one and is then explained further after it happens instead of before so you would understand what happens with this alone eventually but it would be jumbled the last act also really relies on the first one otherwise a particular event would feel incredibly random the first one also did a phenomenal job building relationships so a lot of the scenes would probably fall flat if you arent previously invested

tldr highly recommend you spend an hour or so streaming the first then go see this plus the first is also excellent so it wont even be a chore 

best of luck",2023-06-02

because he’s still the spiderman of universe 42 whoever the spider bites the victim is cursed to go through what the spidermans go through,2023-06-04
it’s only because of the spider that hit him thereby causing a universe that didn’t get a spiderman like it was supposed to and when miles was bit it caused peter parker a to die and the collider incident only added more to mess with the universe holes,2023-06-04
"as i said earlier here because he was making too much sense at least in the context of this movies lorecanonheh so they had to make him go crazy and evil so our hero could be right while also doing the right thing it’s lazy writing and in the next movie i’m sure we’ll learn that the canon thing is bs can’t have miles rip apart the universe 

but i’m kind of softening up to the idea as a criticism of what spider man has fundamentally been as a character tragedy  i kind of like that i just hate the whole trope around how the villain turns to a brute because he’s right and the hero gets to make the right choice without any consequences because he’s the hero but i also have a feeling i’m getting a head of myself and they will have a clever solution to all of this in the next film",2023-06-04

"no thats not what theyre saying at all 
  
the rule of the multiverse as miguel describes it is that there can only be one spiderperson per universe  
  
because the spider from earth42 bit miles in 1610 there is no spiderperson in earth42 and because there are now two spiderpeople in 1610 the universe course corrected and killed peter parker  
  
the rules do not say only one peter parker can exist otherwise peter b parker wouldnt exist they only used one peter parker in this movie to ease confusion but its safe to say a good contingent of the unnamed spidersmen at spider hq are also peter parker  ben reilly is technically peter parker

i knew fellowship of the ring was part 1 of a trilogy  it was heavily marketed as such and they shot it all at the same time but it also has a great climax with boromirs sacrifice it was satisfying with more to come

i knew infinity war was part 1 of 2 i thought it was just fine but at that point i fell out of mcu stuff 

i think the ending feels worse here because its a followup to a great insular tightly paced movie that stands alone and it wasnt marketed as part 1 apparently it was in 2021 but they dropped that from the title so i went in expecting another tightly wound complete story and got a really abrupt ending which is disappointing because it felt like it was building to a great climax",2023-06-05
not necessarily upset i just didn’t see it coming and kind of got my hopes up especially now having to wait for the story to conclude,2023-06-03

saying his dad needs to die is not very spiderman of you",2023-06-03
"as others have said the movie is challenging this idea that he needs to suffer to grow 

we already saw in the first movie that it wasn’t aaron’s death that pushed him it was peter b‘s belief in him leap of faith that helped him become spiderman

and in part 2 it was his mom’s love that boosted his confidence — this is what has him believe he can beatoutsmart the spider society and he even tells his notmom at the end 

i think if there’s anything these movies are saying it’s that while you can grow from bad moments it’s not necessary and that having good people who love and believe in you is enough for a person to be able to grow it doesn’t always have to be through paintragedy",2023-06-03

he’s fine being in his own universe  the problem is that the spider that bit him came from a different universe and it left a gap in that spiders og universe where there should have been a spiderman,2023-06-04
i dont think the rule is necessarily one spiderman per universe the point is that the earth 42 spider was supposed to bite someone in earth 42 and they would become that worlds spiderman however the spider was transported to miles world so was an anomaly and bit him instead directly causing the events that led to peter parkers death now earth 42 has no spiderman and miles is his worlds spiderman which was never supposed to happen,2023-06-04
that would still disrupt the canon because in the timeline hes supposed to be captain and die anything miles does to prevent this will  the canon and i think gwen telling her dad her identity  up her canon too,2023-06-06
miles would need to reveal hes spiderman though,2023-06-07
"it wasnt a rando spider  it was the spider the one that would have created spiderman in that sense  there is usually only one spider

miles powers arent a result of the spider being from another dimension  that same spider would have created spiderman in earth 42 its just that they happened to swoop up specifically the spiderman spider",2023-06-13
" yes but its not like that was the only spider 

i hope you understand the flaws in your own statements this is your own assumption",2023-06-12
its not like peter was beset upon by legions of radioactive spiders  in most origin stories there is only one spider that gets irradiated and bite peter by accident,2023-06-12
"we see a bit of it when miles and spot share the same perspective  that spider was going to bite the miles of universe 42  you can tell by the braids he has

the general assumption is that each universe only has one spider  this has been generally true in other spiderman media as well aside from the insomniac game

i think it ties back to the the canon events that miguel was going on about  sure there were probably other spiders as part of that experiment but only one canon spider",2023-06-12
there normally only is one spider though,2023-06-12
mcu isnt 616 its 19999 or whatever it was that miguel said,2023-06-14
that was gwen from the other universe when she was transported to miles universe her spider sense told her to enroll at school there and thats where she met miles,2023-06-15
they originally wrote the sequel to itsv as one movie but there was just so much story that they had to tell that it had to be split into 2 parts if it was widely acceptable to release 45 hour long movies they mightve done that but just wasnt feasible,2023-06-20
so im guessing you hate  bill,2023-06-22
i doubt it the theme of the movie seems to be refusing and rebelling against fate its no accident one of the most prominent characters and the one who helps miles and gwen the most is spiderpunk,2023-06-24

stop reaching,2023-06-02
its a shame youre being downvoted because you absolutely have a point to be clear this isnt to say that miles or gwen are lgbt rather its that theres definitely a parallel or resonance with comingout narratives or maybe you could say the stories of superheroes with secret identities or maybe even allmost narratives about having to hide a critical part of yourself but almost never perfectly enough that people dont suspect somthing being viewed with suspicion and distrust by parts of society regardless of ones neutralpositive intentions and leading a double life in this way often automatically carry that sense of relatability for lgbtqueer audiences,2023-06-02
gwen’s conflict with her father definitely rung some bells for me  she literally has a trans flag in her bedroom,2023-06-02

"if gwen and hobie were seeing each other their relationship ended long before the events of the film took place look at how gwen acts around miles in comparison to hobie she literally took time from her very important mission to bond with miles her thoughts are nothing but miles through most of the cold opening also when spiderbyte gets miles attention gwen literally wrangles him away 

gwen is not like that with hobie however it is quite apparent why the two may have been close they are both musicians they also work together and they wear the same size shoes 

its doubtful they could have been together for one reason hobie does not like compliance and gwen is compliant throughout the film until the very final scene he helps miles immediately upon introduction and assists miles in bypassing miguels trap",2023-06-02

go support the artists and make this the highest grossing box office movie ever it deserves to be seen on a big screen,2023-06-02
totally agree i would have preferred a 3 hour full single movie breaking this into 2 parts was a mistake and i think that now more than ever after seeing it its ending was just nothing because it was a cliffhanger so this movie doesnt stand on its own and thats very annoying,2023-06-02
except that the whole point is that events arent predetermined they tend to happen but its a result of similar tendencies and then its actively enforced by miguel even when it could be averted so its closer to selfdetermined,2023-06-02
"for the most part this is rather in keeping with the comics in the comics it is made explicitly clear that the characters exist in a literary medium this is what makes characters like deadpool who is somewhat aware that he is a character in a story and loki who is currently the  of stores so powerful they understand the rules 

here marvel and sony are trying to work with this understanding of how the marvel universe operates these characters do not really represent people but rather characters in a story",2023-06-03
"its a lot easier to digest knowing there was a part 2 prior but its been highlighted by others that there is a clear arc for spider gwen in this movie right to the end it can be argued this was her movie and miles was the catalyst to her arc

i say miles too he breaks the status quo of what spiderman has to be and rather personifies what spiderman should be by the end we have all the spider people that broke away from the status quo and are changed by miles especially with gwen

miles has also come along way in being sure of himself hes not binded by the rules of fate like the other spidermen which is an evolution of him from the first movie",2023-06-03

given that this miles is the prowler i take it hes probably seen more than his share of supervillains given that they hinted at the 42 sinister six im sure its not out of their realm of possibility

also alt miles has a dead father and was raised into the prowler by his uncle id reckon thatd make anyone into a hateful little  i dont think itd be difficult to understand why hed hate a version of himself that has what he doesnt",2023-06-03

its a comic movie the villains are supposed to be a bit shallow thats how spot starts trying to get by gain some notoriety and then builds a greater grudge against miles and figures out ways to grow his powers tremendously hes turned into more more of a monster first thing he does is talk about how he cant get a job lost his friends and family etc as his power grows his animosity and ambition does as well i thought he was really well done,2023-06-12
" the donut guy is a super arching villain 

will they make a point the collidor caused issues to lots of people and they show flashbacks of a scientist in the control room being hit with the collider stuff while holding some unknown substance 

its very normal in comic books for villians or even heros to be made this way 

 its supposed to be convincing that the spider that bit him in the first movie was a mistake


well in the first movie the spider comes from the collider room and it was glitching alot so they arent convincing they literally showed you in the first movie it was from a different universe it was a show rather than tell thing from the first movie

 as well as how the original team members couldnt visit miles

miguel and his team wouldnt let them probably to stop them from telling him about his canon event miguel probably also has some plan for the first anomaly so it makes sense he doesnt let his friends go see him and tell him about the spider team thing he does niot want him around for it",2023-06-12
so because of these issues you find i don’t this is the absolute worst movie you’ve ever watched is this the only movie you’ve ever watched in a theatre,2023-06-03
" is spot destroying the multiverse or does he need to  miles dad to save the multiverse what course of action are the different spiderfactions even trying to accomplish and why

spot wants to become more powerful and destructive  and show up miles 

spot is part of a larger fabric of something causing a death of captain x in every spiderman universe 

they wanted to keep him at spider hq so he couldnt prevent his dads death",2023-06-03
give what a week,2023-06-02
nah his heart wasnt in it,2023-06-08
"im not saying this as an irrational unthoughtful person

press x to doubt",2023-06-02
whole lot of words but not a whole lot of sense being made here what the  are you on about who made you the arbiter of real diversity,2023-06-02
totally cool that this is your opinion but man do i disagree so hard lol,2023-06-03
—miguel ohara,2023-06-03
we get it you voted for trump,2023-06-03
he appeared in spiderman homecoming as aaron very briefly,2023-06-02
i disagree i think this movie was as much about her as it was about miles more her than his honestly because this was about her learning to do the right thing rather than following spider2099s  if anything she was following in miles footsteps of im a do my own thing,2023-06-03
now people are just making  up to make sony look bad,2023-06-03
why would you want this,2023-06-06
why do you think you deserve to watch this for free,2023-06-02
 i bet you ain’t gonna like the next one,2023-06-03
oh if you didn’t like that wait til the 3rd one with an entire 20 minute segment with tom holland and live action miles and gwen,2023-06-03
which took 5 years to produce and was over 2 hours long  i suppose you were disappointed when empire ended on a cliffhanger as well,2023-06-12
if the general public was ok with theaters releasing 45 hour long movies they wouldnt have had to split it ,2023-06-14
"the movie was 2 hours  what do you want a four hour movie

i will agree they didnt really have a climax though",2023-06-03
do you like enjoy things,2023-06-03
so why are you here,2023-06-02
it has been 5 years since the first spiderverse movie fwiw,2023-06-02
yea the best one,2023-06-02
l take i feel bad for you,2023-06-05
l,2023-06-05
what,2023-06-05
the most unpopular opinion get ready to be flamed by redditors man,2023-06-03
"the film focuses so strongly on the idea of family and responsibility of being a spiderman the baggage they have to carry as a spiderman and with miles staying true to oneself and also tackling what is the idea of spiderman as a character

the movie was also trying to break away from the idea of how spiderman has to be and what spiderman should be which has trapped the character of spiderman to always be tied to the death of his loved one uncle ben etc and how the character always has to suffer and remain the status quo of spiderman is the poor friendly neighbourhood spiderman that struggles to balance his life and cant get everything he wants

the other spidermen accepted how some things are supposed to happen and spiderman cant save everyone while the movie seems to be highlighting almost superbly with miles that the idea of  spiderman is that he always tries to save everyone even if he cant save everyone

 just because you cant save everyone doesnt mean you shouldnt try and we will see a lot of that payoff in the third movie miles kinda represents what spiderman actually is while all the other spidermen are lost to their fate

there was a lot going on in this movie and the visuals are there to tell the unique characteristics of each of the spiderman it was one of the most well written movie that really show great representation of the familial struggle of being a parent to a teen and a teen that is growing up way too fast and finding his ownself with gwen and miles

to say it was just tik tok  pointless jokes and boring conversations is really baffling to me this was far from braindead but idk the movie is not for you i guess

a little add on when people like you make baseless assumptions and tries to insult the type of people that watch this movie says more about you than others honestly you can critique and hate a movie but you dont have to be an  about it",2023-06-03
because thousands of dollars is a rounding error in a movie this expensive,2023-06-02
it could be akin to john krasinski as reed richards but here’s to hoping that’s not the case,2023-06-02
she clearly had to move on from the robot her father built being destroyed  changes people makes you grow up fast,2023-06-02
she was completely broken when her original mech was destroyed by scorpion her dad built it before he died so she’s still probably  up about it,2023-06-02
its the ps5 one thats coming soon spider man 2 its just blurred so the graphics look  lol,2023-06-08
miguel is probably morlun,2023-06-03
he was in this for 1 second i think,2023-06-02
next one comes out next year ala infinity war endgame,2023-06-02
footage of tobey and andrew from their original movies appear but not anything new,2023-06-02
tom doesnt appear but he and mcu strange were briefly referenced in dialogue,2023-06-02
not that i know of my impression was that she was there for the humor shes in the comics as sun spider so thats an appearance for people who like her,2023-06-02
based on the way they explained it i dont think the presence of spiderman controls where or who the villains are when the spider didnt bit peter parker or his analogue all the villains just happen without him there and miles being the prowler is just another multiversal variable,2023-06-02
my understanding is that canon events are those things that happen to every spiderperson stuff like bitten by a radioactive spider uncle benuncle aaronaunt may dies a good friend becomes the hobgoblin etc the movie is concerned with a police captain close to them dies because thats the specific event miles stopped from happening in mumbhattan and because miles dad is about to become captain but its not the only such event,2023-06-02
apparently that wasnt athe canon event,2023-06-02
spider speed dude,2023-06-02
now that you mentioned this i think this will be the third movies cold open,2023-06-02
my guess is theyre intentionally misdirecting us with the nondisclosure and jokes i think theyre just super close friends i think they want to do a relief scene where hes either  pure platonic or brother like,2023-06-02
he was playing spider man 2 on ps5 a game that isnt out yet,2023-06-02
"my theory

1 they stop miless dad become captain so they can save him without affecting the canon
2 the original spidey in miles universe already sacrifice his captain probably stacys so saving capt miles wont affect the canon
3 its all just coincidence no such thing as canon he isnt kang  tva miguel cant see the future  cant predict the real outcome its just a problem of causation  correlation thing they cant really predict when the will spot comeback its just the algorithm
4 miles saves his dad his universe is crumbling miles force spot to save their universe universe saved the end everyone is happy   
edit adding 4th theory",2023-06-02
being from outside the universe always glitch so it is pretty normal for it to glitch before it bit miles also im not open for new ability lol hes already interesting and somehow overpowered with taser and invisibility,2023-06-02
usually spider sense reacts to danger,2023-06-02
" why gwen didn’t have her spider senses tingle when miles was invisible near her

i guessed his cloaking power trumped the others spidey sense doesnt seem like it should though

 or why miles didn’t turn invisible when he was running away from literally every spiderman

requires more concentration than he could afford i suppose

just spitballing",2023-06-02
"why gwen didn’t have her spider senses tingle when miles was invisible near her

yeah that struck me as odd too especially considering how miles told his mom he could sense her breathing behind him literally 5 minutes earlier 

could be argued that gwen knew all along ",2023-06-02
have you checked the soundtrack,2023-06-02
no,2023-06-02
nothing about this movie is mid even the credits,2023-06-08
i don’t know who suffered more gwen with her life and without revealing the truth or miles learning about his dad and betrayed by his friends and forced to stay and do nothing,2023-06-02
"if spiderpunk left his bracelet when he quit how did he go to gwens dimension and leave it with her dad

my read was that he made a new one the new bracelet he gave gwen looked like it came from his universe not miguels he also couldve used a few of the bits and bobs he stole from hq

remember that miguel used peter b parkers bracelet to track him hobie wouldnt like that",2023-06-02
he was stealing parts throughout the movie and made his own like he told miles to do,2023-06-02
its not destroyed but it can be heavily damaged with enough canon events happening they’re scared that universes do get destroyed,2023-06-02
they do a recap in the beginning but its definitely worth watching,2023-06-02
definitely need to see the first one like 100,2023-06-02
yeah that entire opening was     phenomenal when she leaves into that portal i audibly went that is   hype,2023-06-02
i think jess drew turns coat,2023-06-02
as much as i think it would be cool to see any of the live action folks gwen has no reason to trust them,2023-06-02
the couple sitting next to me saw i came alone and offered popcorn,2023-06-02
miles originally dimension but they know gwen knows about 42,2023-06-02
the question is why has earth 42 not had an incursion event due to not having a spiderman,2023-06-02
yeah confirm for march 29 2024,2023-06-02
this is quite a bit more flashy than the first  my cinema had epilepsy warning signs,2023-06-02
probably safer to avoid this one at least on the big screen its flashy a lot,2023-06-02
"the original title included “part one” so it’s surprising so many people were surprised 

well if you didn’t see the empire strikes back in theaters now you know what that felt like",2023-06-02
they handled the sequel really well the plot was engaging and pacing was tight don’t see any reason to doubt the final part especially when they planned the trilogy from the start,2023-06-02
im assuming there will be shenanigans with evil miles in our miles’ dimension lots of drama to be found there with his parents,2023-06-03
i think earth 42 peter would just be anomral kid cause uncle ben didnt die or because of the rampant crime uncle ben dies and peter just tries to make due without any powers just intellect,2023-06-02
which oscar,2023-06-02
air and spiderverse are the two movies i’ve seen so far this year on the best picture nominee level,2023-06-03
the problem that miguel isnt confronting is why and how the alchemax spider ended up in miles universe if miles wasnt ever supposed to be spiderman and everything is preordained then the spider should never have been there in the first place,2023-06-02
since he was talking to miles on the phone in homecoming i had hopes we would see more of the two of them not looking too hot considering hes trapped in a magic box in another dimension ,2023-06-02
need that spider catmulaney interaction next time,2023-06-03
the ending is also a total blue ball haha but for real that sucks man hope you get a chance to see it in full,2023-06-02
the joke is that nj is literally right next to ny the mom is saying its too far because shes worried about miles growing up when really it may as well be ny,2023-06-02
i legitimately thought the sound in my theater was messed up it got a bit better as the movie went on though the mixing definitely needed some more work,2023-06-03
just you i guess ,2023-06-03
she did,2023-06-03
"miguel does have a very good point technically why shouldnt someone sacrifice themselves and another person to save countless lives incursions are not easily stopped once they start 

however miles also has a point yes he is selfish but then this is his life and his fathers life why shouldnt he at least try",2023-06-03
disney is not involved in this,2023-06-03
and lego spiderman for the kiddos,2023-06-03
"i think it is because 1610 peter died and miles was already bitten by the spider so all the canon events are now attached to him thus making the universe stable

or there is something we dont know yet all the explanations we have about anomalies and canon events is from miguel he could easily be wrong or miss something",2023-06-03
he’s playing spiderman 2,2023-06-03
the mech suit itself was destroyed the spider survived theres a shot of her picking it up and its on her shoulder when she falljumps back into her universe,2023-06-03
i would put my money on sony eventually just bringing andrew garfield back as their spiderman juts seems like a super obviouseasy decision,2023-06-03
no although rumour is well find out in madame web technically,2023-06-03
"the other commenter has answered your first point but to your second point they changed a lot of the designs because gwen got a bigger focus in this one the conflict with her father and peter being the lizard that attacked the homecoming dance is part of her backstory that is in her comics

its probably because her backstory is explored more and she gets more focus that they decided to give her peter and her dad and her band which actually includes her mj variant side side note theres a possible romantic undertone that the writers were never brave enough to go there in her original run a unique design

it is also probably canon in spiderman lore that no matter how much good he does to the city there will be some people who hate him who see him as a lawless vigilante and that is also one point this movie showed with the conflict of captain stacy and miles not being able to tell his dad",2023-06-03
"a hes stealing parts from miguels universe when hes with miles its implied he is stealing parts to built a separate device

b i would bet they retconned a bit of gwens backstory but it was generic enough in the last movie that i dont think there are any conflicts she does technically save her dad sorta when peter turns into the lizard",2023-06-03
later in the movie they literally say he’s a vampire,2023-06-03
mona lisa by dominic fike,2023-06-03
had the opposite and audible gasp when the toy was taken out of its packaging,2023-06-03
i think that was a more emotional moment in which he was vulnerable rather than running away from danger,2023-06-03
year wasnt it that tiny 2d spiderman that tried to say some corny line,2023-06-03
somehow when the character was created nobody noticed theyd named this modern day black cop jefferson davis the same name as the president of the confederacy thats  not great so in both the comics and here hes taken his wifes name instead,2023-06-03
probs some early form of spiderman straight from the first comicanimated series,2023-06-03
i had trouble parsing that gag in the moment as it went by so fast but i think the setup was miles panics seeing 2d spiderman coming right at him but then the camera perspective shifts and it turns out hes just a flat drawing on the wall and cant actually do anything,2023-06-03
im pretty sure its this spiderman 024 is the frame they use they just made the animation more stilted for comedic effect,2023-06-03
comic book spiderman,2023-06-03
i think it implies she used to be a stripper,2023-06-03
lord and miller did direct the lego movie so im sure there was enough of an existing relationship there to get the licensing done,2023-06-03
they probably licensed the rights for the film,2023-06-03
"points

you",2023-06-03
"i think miguels model of the spiderverse is designed to only involve spidermen who have already experienced certain canon events the reason every spiderman there is on board with fate is because they have already experienced it and they have seen examples of it destroying universes when changed there are an infinite number of other spider people who do not agree with letting fate play out and so those spider people are never invited to the citadel 

miguel has been cherry picking his systems model which is why he thinks canon cant be disrupted but thats only one model and it doesnt account for universes existing disconnected from eachother",2023-06-03
i would though that might depend on how well they can handle the film’s cliffhanger ending and not getting a happy ending for the heroes in which case i’d explain to them about what will happen next and how the good guys will figure out a way to save the day,2023-06-03
i think he created the spider society after the collider event in 1610 first movie and before the collapse happen so peter b is already joined the team,2023-06-03
i think there’s probably a lot of holes in miguel’s theories on purpose his whole idea of what the “canon” should look like will probably unravel in the next film,2023-06-03
i think if he never becomes a captain he wont die,2023-06-03
because she took her mask off which made him quit his job as captain so her captain isn’t going to die prior to that spiderman india also didn’t lose his captain thanks to miles i think a new canon is being created where the captain gets saved because it seems like miles’ dad will probably end up being alive this will probably show miguel that there is another way which is to go into each universe and have the same thing happen in all of them go into each universe and save the captain therefore becoming a new canon across all universes,2023-06-03
"as i understood it it prove that miguels theory is not guarantee to happen 

alternatively this could be proven still given that we have an entire additional film to show the consequences of all this",2023-06-03
spider which bites our miles is from another dimension he wasnt suppose to be a spiderman and original spiderman in his universe doesnt die because he wasnt distracted by morales,2023-06-03
this miles spiderman wasn’t meant to happen i think it’s more so that his spider is the ‘anomaly’ within the film’s terminology as that’s the thing that crosses dimensions,2023-06-03
both may and ben are minor characters in earth 65,2023-06-03
spot is also a noncanon event in that he created miles which is a non canon event,2023-06-03
spot is causing a bunch of anomaly events by jumping universe to universe and absorbing the reactor’s powers or whatever the canon event is miles’ dad is supposed to die if spot gets captured before he causes anomalies in every universe he goes to then a different threat or a different way of getting killed would have happened to miles’ dad,2023-06-03
they werent trying to  him they were trying to catch him like they did with all the other anomalies and send him back to miles universe so he could fulfil his destiny,2023-06-04
"or
maybe tony stark was captain of the avengers he’s dead captain america is also dead",2023-06-03
maybe his uncle ben was a police captain,2023-06-03
march 29,2023-06-03
probably because it was himself idk tho,2023-06-03
he was super distracted after realizing he ended up on the wrong earth and out of it from glitching,2023-06-03
we have seen in some classic spiderman comics that spidersense doesnt work on symbiotes because they share his dna or the like,2023-06-04
better than what theyre doing with him in the comics right now,2023-06-04
careful hes having a painful memory right now dont trigger him,2023-06-04
theres always the possibility hes in the third film,2023-06-04
im wondering this too i also wanna know the hiphop song that plays when miles is reintroduced to the audience at the very beginning of the film,2023-06-04
i actually just found it it’s called “light the city up” by cut the lights here is the spotify link,2023-06-04
i thought it was interesting that gwen readily accepted that her father is destined to die tragically,2023-06-04
" why’s miles dad dead in earth 42 if there’s no spiderman nor spider

well learn in the next movie but i wonder if its prowler related miles dad was a policeman after all",2023-06-04
his dad probably died because there are no super heroes in that universe and he ended up dying because there was no spiderman to save him he works in a dangerous line of work imagine facing doctor octopus and spider man isn’t there,2023-06-04
trying to find a job or survive or do things the proper way,2023-06-04
i thought so too but i think during the train sequence they were blurring her present day persona imagining going back to prom when she is shown from the front side her hair didn’t look shaved,2023-06-04
mine erupted when spot appeared in the venomverse with the asian lady who works at the store lol,2023-06-04
well it would be very suprising for them not to imo after all the buildup and in the comics this is based off of i beleive they do get together,2023-06-04
yes,2023-06-04
thats what i was thinking once miguel said he was an anomaly the spidey rules shouldnt apply to him,2023-06-04
miles morales in this movie is considered an anomaly because the spider that bit him came from a different universe it’s not that miles morales specifically isn’t meant to be spiderman it’s just that this miles morales in this movie is an anomaly because of the spider being from a diff dimension,2023-06-04
yep  that was her  she was very unimpressed seeing spot,2023-06-04
the thing about the multiverse is that its infinite the insomniac spiderman that showed up may not have been the exact same spiderman from the same universe as the game but from an infinite number of other possible universes that are like 99999999 identical,2023-06-04
they renamed him two years ago after realizing jefferson davis was also the name of the president of the confederacy lol,2023-06-04
you came back after like two years just to make this post lol talk about a petty attempt at positivity,2023-09-05
hobie dropped it off with her dad before she got back to her universe,2023-06-04
he shows up at the end as part of gwen’s group he didn’t go to hq presumably because there was no reason to what with the ongoing cleanup in his own dimension,2023-06-05
it isnt that miles not being peter parker makes him an anomaly its that the spider that bit him came from a universe other than his own due to the multiverse being meddled with,2023-06-05
"also shouldnt there be another spiderman with miles if earth42s spider switched over

there was he died in the first movie",2023-06-06
did you skip the entire first movie lol no wonder youre confused,2023-06-06
nope,2023-06-06
there had to be something to justify her letting him get away in the end so thats how they set it up she was there to seemingly provoke a slight amount of jealousy in gwen and also to be another friend for miles,2023-06-10
xxxtenacion did music in the first movie thats just how it be when rappers are doing your soundtrack lol,2023-06-10
i think it is a necessary change that doesn’t do too much harm retcon wise,2023-06-10
in itsv peters lizard model was just the green goblin as it was just a quick shot it makes sense some changes were made when fleshing the story out,2023-06-10
he says this is all our lives woven together in a beautiful web of life and destiny,2023-06-10
didnt they release the new version a day ago,2023-06-11
had to be some time between itsv and atsv hard to say exactly when though i imagine we might get more info in btsv,2023-06-14
"i saw peter b going home with the baby back to mj and thought oh maybe thats what theyre all doing including gwen then gwen gets back to her universe and dad acts like he hasnt seen her for months  


still i dont think thats the same as being without a spider gwen still exists and connected toserving her universe shes just taking something akin to a vacation",2023-06-11
they address this in the movie if miles hadnt been bitten his peter parker wouldnt have died,2023-06-11
in the movie miguel says if miles wasn’t bitten by that spider and wasn’t at the collider the original spiderman would have deactivated it and gotten away and would have never died so miles would have never had any powers in the original timeline,2023-06-11
insomniac spiders,2023-06-11
they also showed insomniacunclebens death when they explained canon events pretty wierd because the games exist in moviemiles universe,2023-06-12
yeah my extremely secondhand understanding is that its pretty common in latin american culture to refer to an older member of ones community as an uncle regardless of blood relation,2023-06-12
"1 venom strike his electric shock power it just looked different from normal due to miguels suit being so electronic

2 it almost certainly wasnt their plan all along its unclear if they even knew or cared that miles next canon event was coming up before he got their attention in mumbattan  if they did the reason its a canon event is that its not something spiderman is normally able to stop however once he acquired meta knowledge that the event is coming he may have been able to prevent it by doing something that normally wouldnt happen without foreknowledge like taking his dad and locking him in a safe place for the duration of spots attack",2023-06-12
i just treat them as entirely separate multiverses theyre no doubt going to retcon spider verse into the mcu but it just raises continuity issues like this,2023-06-12
strange is still magically traveling the universes which is a more natural way than the sciencey method the spidermen are using but i really doubt the main mcu and the spiderverse movies are collaborating and establishing rules for each other,2023-06-12
"its unlikely because miguel is shown at the end of the first movie to be just trying out the multiverse hopping watch prototype for the first time after lyla shows him miles beating kingpin and all the other spiders going back to their home dimension which means he couldnt travel to other dimensions after miles had defeated kingpin

also were not given any indication that miguel can travel to the past with his watch every time each spider hops to a different universe time is flowing parallely in each dimension

so miguel couldnt have been present at the time and place to  aaron prowler",2023-06-15
i bet thats one of the things well find out in the next movie,2023-06-15
"i think thats why they call miles1610 an anomaly  because the spider biting him instead of miles42 didnt erase either universe but just changed the trajectory of their futures  peter1610 who originally would have stopped the collider from running according to miguel now had to save miles1610 in the middle of his fight which gives the collider time to start and by that time the space time continuum had already been torn open and peter eventually dies and of course miles42 becomes the prowler instead of his original fate to become his dimensions spiderman

i think this the fact that the trajectory of the future can be altered without drastic consequences will prove to be the key that miguel is missing in his spiderverse canon hypothesis another example is george stacy in earth65 retiring from being a police captain thus no longer being in canonical danger

edit i recalled that the stray villains captured and kept in the spiderhq are also called anomalies so the name anomaly wont relate to my theory but anyway the fact that there must be a way to circumvent canon events safely will be the key to save miles dad without destroying the multiverse",2023-06-15
i lured everyone away from your spider base didnt i,2023-06-18
miles saving the kid interrupted the canon event while gwen’s dad quitting caused the canon event to never happen in the first place i think there’s a difference and the significance of the ending was gwen coming to the conclusion that there is a way to change the outcome of canon events without destroying the spiderverse,2023-07-01
"i wonder how gwen’s dad not going for captain anymore is going to affect the canon events and what their going to do with gwenmile’s dad

its a huge reach but her father quitting as captain could be interpreted as a captain close to spiderman dies saving a child in other words gwens father killed the captain side of him for his child",2023-07-09
what are you on dude that cliff hanger was wild,2023-11-05
thats actually miguels white suit from the comics we might see him put that on in the sequel look up “miguels white suit concept art”,2023-08-23
"weve had dozens of live action spiderman movies centered around peter parker 
can we not have a trilogy for miles this whole trilogy is about miles and his story and how he deals with being spiderman which is accompanied by the presence of his great friends who have a big part and place in his story and journey plus peter was a huge part of the first movie and hes still an important figure in miles life you can see how he and miles have impacted each other in many ways and were gonna see even more of him and everyone in beyond the spiderverse",2023-08-24
that is not at all what happened lol,2023-09-17

it was funny as  seeing the doll spiderman swing in that one shot,2023-06-03
his canon event was that his uncle mercedesbenz died,2023-06-10
an actual comics character,2023-06-03
so is this the cars universe spider ah car,2023-06-04
i didn’t catch that ,2023-06-04
“parallel parker” could have also worked,2023-06-06
"i said this out loud in the theatre and people just looked at me weird but that was genius
peter parkedcar",2023-06-11
i choked on my mnms when i saw this,2023-06-10
well except for miguel “spiderman is supposed to be funny”,2023-06-02
loved multiple spider men cracking the joke that miles armpits are bleeding,2023-06-02
" spiderman is a smartass in every single timeline  

that was something i loved about the gwen intro scenes in this movie we got to see her being as quippy as any other spiderman which i dont remember happening as much in the first movie",2023-06-05
i noticed in the lobby there were like 20 puns about the spot layered on top of each other,2023-06-10
"chai tea isnt even that bad if you think how it is used to identify that is both from india and tell the english speaker it is tea it is a name not a description
",2023-06-25
also that spidey was voiced by comic book artist humberto ramos which is pretty dope,2023-06-02
i thought he was saying ¡oye coño which translates to hey ,2023-06-24
coño translates to  but is used an expletive not quite an fbomb but definitely a curse word,2023-07-16
he didnt bring her to a battle he brought her to a chase big difference,2023-06-03
"its good because it both works as a joke and as a continuation of the theme that spider people need to friggin communicate and work together just like how the spiderpeople lie to their families about their identity here peter b is lying to his family again

if they can take down multiversal threats by working together then surely they can save everyone too",2023-06-03
the little bit we got of mj was pretty great,2023-06-03
“i didn’t bring her to a battle the battle kinda came to us…” ,2023-06-04
the theatre i was at blew up in laughter at that scene,2023-06-02
biggest laugh of the night in my theatre the lady next to me didn’t stop laughing for at least a full minute,2023-06-04
great callback to the first one,2023-06-02
i love that banksy is multiversal  they’re probably a nexus being,2023-06-03
basically a jab at the british national museum that place has more south asian artefacts than actual south asia,2023-06-29
"the one i’m not seeing talked about is that the moment a bridge collapses there’s a spiderman who is eaglewing holding it together and all the other spidermen just trampling right over him


i figured that was a training area since it was part of the hq",2023-06-04
same ad in different universes in its they showed the legit coca cola ad in peter b parker’s universe and then an altered name in miles’ universe,2023-06-03
loved this part ive hated the phrase chai tea ever since i learned the word chai while studying middle eastern languages wish he would have said café coffee with crème cream just to  with him even more but it was a solid burn regardless,2023-06-05
joke within a joke noticed it too,2023-06-03
its rude to stare,2023-06-04
i believe it stands for automatic teller machine,2023-06-09
you’re safe here you can say new rockstars,2023-06-03
i came home yesterday from seeing the movie opened up youtube and the first thing in my recommended box was a 40 minute easter egg video about across the spiderverse they are feasting,2023-06-03
some youtubers are gonna have to watch this on 005x to see missed details,2023-06-03
film theory why spot is actually the villain,2023-06-05
new rockstars video is already 40 minutes long so when the movie hits digital expect lots more,2023-06-05
ya there is so much things going on that definitely i am missing out on various easter eggs,2023-06-07
 i hope its only a year you gotta figure its already written and im sure production has already begun but do we think itll take just a year have they hinted at all,2023-06-03
i noticed this too and figured it was some sort of glitch in editing,2023-06-07
it makes so much sense in hindsight the attention to detail in this series is amazing,2023-06-03
i was wondering as to whether miles being bitten was why peter and the other spiderpeople only glitched near him when they weren’t already near the collider as when they glitched under may’s house it was clear most of them hadn’t yet glitched at that time,2023-06-03
yeah at first i thought the glitches were just a visual cue for this spider has something wrong with it and by the time we see the glitches more later in the movie i had already forgotten about the spider,2023-06-05
i had always assumed it was also pulled in by the collider the same way the spiderpeople were gwen was also sent back to before it went off so totally possible,2023-06-10
and its right after an earthquake there was another earthquake after the collider went off during the fight with blond spidey the collider brought the spider,2023-06-20
correct thats what tipped me off,2023-06-04
i was surprised how hard they leaned into it despite clearly showing miles was being sent to universe 42 by the machine it didnt seem like a blinkandyoumissit moment to me but they sure treated it like it was the biggest rug pull,2023-06-02
yes honestly one of my top ten moments in cinema history so tense so exhilarating and the reveal of being in a different dimension just flawless,2023-06-04
"right after gwen saves miles and peter b at alchemex in the first movie miles asks “how many spiderpeople are there” peter replies “save it for comiccon” and miles says “what’s comiccon”

so for “his” mom to ask him if he’s dressing up for a comics con proves he’s not in the correct verse",2023-06-03
exactly and the fact that every time they went to a new location they made sure to display it on screen it adds to the fact that something should be off only when miles realizes this does the font shows up,2023-06-05
"“you call this art”

“we’re talking about it aren’t we”",2023-06-02
its super similar to the one from spectacular spider man,2023-06-04
absolutely loved that the hammer joke at the end of into the spiderverse was one of my favorites,2023-06-05
i was beyond impressed when i saw those bits,2023-06-04
its actually a direct sound clip from the first movie so its an extra laugh,2023-06-03
thats a good observation i saw the concept sculpture and it had the same colors as vultures parchment paper look plus the raimi concept was definitely going for a more traditional less scifi look,2023-06-16
it makes you respect peter b parker since he’s totally unfazed by miguel and miguel seems to acknowledge him as an equalnot annoyed by him,2023-06-02
"i feel like the whole spider society was portrayed as a bit too incompetent in the chase scene tbf

miguel was the most competent one but i pictures him as this unstoppable force and the best by far of all spidermen

i mean it could be the case that miles is one of the strongest spidermen since he‘s an anomaly",2023-06-02
the dude has claws,2023-06-02
i like this take i also think that the lesson is a 2 parter spiderman would not be spiderman without the tragedies that befall him this is the aspect that miguel is hung up on but he also wouldn’t be spiderman if he didn’t try to prevent these kinds of things from happening it’s not just the tragedies that connect these individuals but also the way that they respond to those tragedies and do their best to make things right in summary we are out past and the summation of our experiences but we are also our intentions and actions in the face of what happens to us i predict that this second part is going to be the major lesson of the next movie,2023-06-03
and its probably that the idea of there being another way that doesnt involve letting peopleand possibly causing people to die brought up by a person who shouldnt even be there is terrifying to him and causes him to lash out because hes committed so fully at this point,2023-06-02
as a big 2099 comics fan i really loved the pain addicted brooding psychotically workaholic miguel,2023-06-04
"coked up on 90s edges

i see this and i want you to know that i appreciate it and will be using it i the future",2023-06-04
man imagine in the third movie if miles saves his dads life and nothing happens and the multiverse doesnt actually collapse miguel is gonna lose his   now thats a prime villain origin story waiting to happen i cant wait,2023-08-08
"mom also explicitly explained that wanda says near the end something like “what if my boys get sick and there’s no cure in my universe i need the power to cross the multiverse”

the whole point was that she had been driven mad by the darkhold amplifying her own grief she claimed she wanted to be with her sons but what she really wanted was power because the dark magic was corrupting her",2023-06-03
"yeah i feel like his not being the captain anymore is going to have major implications for how beyond resolves

like how was his resigning not a canonbreaking event and if its not that seems to mean that timelines can change and still be fine unlike what miguel is saying",2023-06-04
yes it was slightly confusing why thousands of spidermen were following this guy who is clearly an unhinged maniac as he tries to take down this kid who understandably just wants to save his dad,2023-06-04
miguel is from the future so we dont exactly know when he wouldve switched places its presumably after miles was bit,2023-06-02
he says a year and six months,2023-06-02
yea other guy said it best spiderman 2099 is decades after miles assuming miles took over the role from peter in 2020 ish he technically wasn’t alive when miles caused the first anomaly the fact that he’s from a different universe too sony can throw him anywhere in the timeline,2023-06-03
i was referring to what he considers is a big nono in his spiderverse ruling dictatorship which is breaking the rules about not messing with what’s canon and not interfering with other universes too much cuz it’ll destroy pieces of the spiderverse so since he replaced his dead self in another universe he ended up destroying that universe presumably i don’t even know how long he was there for in order to destroy that universe  months years but now miguel is trying to prevent miles from breaking what he considers is “canon” but i guess we’ll find out in the third movie that spiderpeople can have their own story and that not everything has to be canon,2023-06-02
isn’t that exactly what thanos was doing in infinity war killing trillions to save trillions more it’s antithetical to what spiderman is,2023-06-14
miguel literally is a spiderman the  are you talking about spiderman 2099 is a thing for decades,2023-06-04
"you might be right just like e42 miles is the prowler maybe the universe miguel is from had him as the prowler or another baddie and he swapped with the “real” miguel that was spiderman

edit this is basically like in progressive spoiler in 3 parts star trek discovery  when the lorca from the mirror universe jumps to the prime universe and pretends to be the “real” lorca maybe miguel is doing the same thing and he’s a baddie pretending to be the version of himself from that universe…",2023-06-04
"i’m super late but enjoy reading these so…spiderman 2099 is literally spiderman his dna is part spider 

spiders actually do have claws and paws too some also have a paralyzing bite too so that’s why miguel is the way he is this is consistent with the comics too his whole thing is that he’s the unconventional and non traditional spiderman
he is also incredibly more hardened to the world than any other spiderman if it comes down to killing a villain  do it but he’s more of an  with a good heart like all spidermen he’s  up but he’s really  up cus of his trauma

he’s really cool and challenged the idea of spiderman anyone can wear the mask i really hope we see more of him in the next movie",2023-09-24
nah it works because the whole point is that miguel has completely lost sight of what it means to be good and what it means to be spiderman he’s lecturing miles about “this is the job you signed up for bla bla bla” but he’s forgetting that what makes spiderman a hero is that he tries to save everyone everytime no questioned asked he doesn’t make sacrifices he does everything in his power to defy the odds and of course he can’t always succeed and can’t always save everyone but he will always try miguel has gotten so obsessed with his grief and the mistakes that he’s made that’s he’s accepted this idea of sacrificing innocent lives for “the greater good” when really he’s just trying to reconcile for the destruction he caused of his alternate universe he’s not being the good guy anymore gwen’s right,2023-06-04
i dunno if anyone who intetionally beats the  out of a kid who just wants to go home and save his dad that hard and was also totally ready to tear vulturenado di vinci’s throat out for a vampire snack can call themselves “good” lawful neutral maybe,2023-06-04
aaron was the “uncle” his father would be the “captain” two separate canon events,2023-06-10
some of us don’t watch most trailers of a movie if not all so we get to see the movie completely blind,2023-06-02
i saw it passingly a while back already knew i wanted to watch so didn’t really consume any other teaser content except to look for the release date,2023-06-02
hes actually less menacing than in the trailers which i like,2023-06-02
that’s one way to prevent a cliff hanger ending,2023-06-03
" oooh whatcha saaaaaay

oooh that you always meant weeeeeeell ",2023-06-04

yeah hanging him off the ground and playing a record for me was a callback to that torture scene from reservoir dogs upbeat music is playing loud while a character is tortured it was so ominous any movie that has a character begging a family member to not hurt them messes with me bad,2023-06-10

so  based,2023-06-05
nope he stole enough supplies to make 1 band but he didnt seize the means of production,2023-06-11

i give the various animated spidermen a lot of credit for not having an existential crisis at seeing live action universes,2023-06-04
even further then that glover’s “donald for spiderman” campaign on twitter back when tasm was announced was what got the ball rolling on the creation of miles him wearing the suit in community was a nod to that campaign i even think they had that shot from community on aaron’s tv in the first spiderverse film,2023-06-04
yeah thats why i wasnt surprised at all that he showed up hes inevitably part of the miles morales character which just reminds me of what a quick come up its been for him,2023-06-07
that makes so much sense ,2023-06-04
i hope not i thought they were just sending him back to the mcu from wherever he ended up,2023-06-05
rumours are that mile morales is going to be peters neighbour in spiderman 4 so it might have prowler in it i imagine donald glover is probably up for it if hes appearing in prowler costume in this,2023-06-04
it was dope to do and the suit was sick but glover doesn’t seem menacing and intimidating enough if we are comparing animated aaron davis,2023-06-04
how,2023-06-04
these comments have been edited using power delete suite,2023-06-04
the little visual effect of rio snapping at miles having the colors of the puerto rican flag was pretty good,2023-06-05
i think it was cough,2023-06-06
just saw the movie and its burned into my mind it was so silly bold and stylish a perfect microcosm of these movies,2023-06-12
reminded me of rorschach,2023-06-04

it was great to see them all back was  mech different from the first movie i thought it looked more evangelionesque like the comics but i could just be misremembering,2023-06-02
im hoping the next one will give me the same feeling we all did the first time watching endgame cause after watching the film i got the exact same feeling i had the first time i watched infinity war,2023-06-02
they had a few more spidey there besides then iirc no,2023-06-02
i think thats now my favorite appearance of known  a movie i got so hyped seeing everyone,2023-06-02
i was so unbelievably happy at that shot,2023-06-05
already was at the end of the first one you see him complete the rubix cube in a single shot as miles is wrapping the movie up in his closing monologuemontage,2023-06-02
"yeah when the first teaser was released back in 2021 i think it said across the spiderverse part one but i guess since then they decided to have different names instead i totally get why you would be confused though

edited here yo go
 ",2023-06-09
oh definitely there were a few times not even just with him where me and my buddy looked at each other asking if we knew what was said,2023-06-02
ok im glad it was not just me and many other comments in this thread confirm it the sound mixing was very strange i could barely make out what gwen was saying in the beginning scene especially almost wish i watched an open cap showing,2023-06-02
i couldnt understand like 50 of what he says didnt like him cause of it but  hes my fav by the end of the movie,2023-06-02
he doesnt believe in audio balancing,2023-06-02
i see a lot of comments about the audio mixing but also im pretty sure miles makes a joke saying you understand anything he just said,2023-06-02
yeah im gonna need to rewatch this movie with subtitles on at some point because i only understood like 20 of what this dude was saying,2023-06-02
i couldnt tell what he said to gwen just before miles glitched out when they were walking through the lobby,2023-06-02
yeah his introduction especially and im  from england i shouldnt have been struggling to make out his words lol it did get better later on though,2023-06-02
yeah i thought my theater had low volumes to where i couldnt even hear the movie but apparently its bad mixing then,2023-06-02
"i was at an imax and the beginning monolog by gwen was drowned out by the drums ive never been to an imax so i thought it was just that 

and the sound effects during the india sequence made it hard to understand both pavitr prabhakar and punk with their accents the dude beside me who kept laughing anytime a character with an indian accent talked didnt help either",2023-06-02

thank you multiple times in this movie i thought the  dialogue volume was too low i thought i was going crazy the mix def seemed off to me especially in the first 2030 minutes,2023-06-03
a lot of the voice levels seemed low to me,2023-06-03
i had issues in my theater with voice levels for most of the scenes especially when gwen is narrating in the beginning my theater had no problems with any other sound being clear,2023-06-03
"yeah almost all of his dialogue i completely missed there were a few other times mostly during fight scenes where they blared the music or when miles and spot talked over each other

im rewatching this with subtitles at some point but still 1110 movie",2023-06-04
im a brit and i still only caught about 50 of the things he said though the 50 was fantastic,2023-06-04
mostly in the beginning with gwen,2023-06-02
very grateful that i got a cc device for this movie,2023-06-02
"reminds me of how chadwick boseman was in what if

it wasnt too bad in the theater but it definitely felt a bit muted especially in his first scene you could barely hear him out over the explosions",2023-06-03
mixing was off in dolby you could barely hear dialog while building collapses shook seats,2023-06-03
i found a lot of the voice levels were low the music and effects were too loud,2023-06-04
i did the only very mild complaint i have about this movie was that it sounded like they hired chris nolan’s sound mixer at times,2023-06-05
could’ve been your theater or your ears only once or twice i didn’t understand what spiderpunk said but because of the accent but i heard everything else including when gwen was talking during drumming,2023-06-04
"felt that way during the opening monologue and the closing monologue by gwen for the entire movie which made for the ending to not hit as well as it probably should have it was just really quiet and im not sure if maybe it was my seat in the corner of the theater that was the problem  

i look forward to watching this when i can have subtitles on so i dont miss anything",2023-06-05
"this is partly why i always take the showing with english subs even though my hearing is just fine 

the other part is that sometimes my attention slips",2023-06-05
one thing i like in our indian theatres here the subs are always on,2023-06-08
ive been watching nothing but bbc stuff this past month and could only understand 50 of his lines the mixing was pretty bad,2023-06-02
even in imax i wish his voice was bigher,2023-06-02
surprisingly caught on to understanding him pretty fast,2023-06-03
what kind of theater did you watch it in i saw it in imax and fortunately didnt have any issues but i thought imax audio is supposed to be a step down,2023-06-04
i was wishing for captioning,2023-06-04
,2023-06-05
i was just going to say that yes his audio levels were too low also daniel spoke really fast and not particularly clear maybe they asked him to rerecord his lines and he said i dont take orders mate,2023-06-05
there were times where i felt the audio was hard to hear especially their dialogue in the beginning,2023-06-05
im really good with accents especially british ones but he was pretty hard to understand,2023-06-05
yeah i was definitely like  im going to have to wait to stream this to hear  he is saying,2023-06-06
yes i was really missing my supportive captions,2023-06-06
my theater had  sound mixing or i was sitting too close to the speaker that was only playing music so i had to strain to hear anyones dialogue throughout the whole movie,2023-06-06
yes the accent,2023-06-12
same both accent and speaking volume made it really difficult i cant wait to rewatch on streaming so i can have subtitiles on and also have the ability to pause and rewind to catch all the visual references and gags,2023-06-13
i’m british and there were a couple of times it’s a very particular kind of very unpleasant london accent,2023-06-18
i didnt expect to hear mandem in the film but a welcome surprise,2023-06-11

this is beautiful ,2023-06-04
that spinning shot was  incredible the whole sequence was just gorgeous,2023-06-03
the nicest detail was she webed up anchor points to seat so she would have contact point with the handsbut in the end they were both feet and hand free so they were with their butts glued lol,2023-06-03
and a call forward apparently to the spiderverse hq being upside down for some reason,2023-06-02
using her webs to to pull herself “down” was a great touch,2023-06-06
i adore that they didnt dance around their feelings or will they wont they things even with two whole movies they go ballsout yeah uhh  in every universe gwen falls in love with spiderman in their first scenes together ,2023-06-02
,2023-06-03
to be fair every frame of the movie is wallpaper material,2023-06-05
ha same i felt very uneasy during the whole upside down scene even though i knew both characters would be fine,2023-06-02
same it was too visually rich and clearly upsidedown for my body to accept,2023-06-04
same i felt sooff the whole time,2023-06-12
they’re either used to it or their bodies were modified to handle it there’s also that scene where they swing upside down with the web attached to their foot so sitting upside down is probably nothing compared to that,2023-06-04
i don’t remember where but i think at some point a comic explained that it just… doesn’t happen to spiderman they can be upside down all they want,2023-06-07
do you know if sonymarvel release high def images of it,2023-07-04
my lord thats such a great detail yes his morales pronunciation was definitely stronger,2023-06-03
"its a different voice actor too

i noticed that as well your explanation makes a lot of sense",2023-06-03
he definitely had a stronger accent i hadnt thought about it but your reasoning makes a lot of sense amazing how detailed it gets,2023-06-03
its only a few lines but yeah that was also the impression i got,2023-06-03
especially with the braids that’s the like go to dominicanpuerto rican look for teenagers  i like prowler miles he seems like a cool as villainanti hero,2023-06-06
that’s a plausible explanation but the actual reason for the voice change is due to another easter egg in the movie when miles1610’s mom says she thinks spiderman is puerto rican and he responds jokingly and nervously that he “seems more dominican” the voice actor for miles42 jharrel jerome is a nod to that jharrel is actually afrolatino of dominican descent jharrel jerome has also frequently been suggested by fans to play the liveaction version of miles for a long time now and he has expressed interest in playing the character as well his inclusion was a clever way of giving him the chance to finally play him and also keeping shameik moore as the voice of miles1610,2023-06-05
definitely had a stronger spanish accent like rio totally didn’t notice he had a different voice actor until someone pointed it out though,2023-06-04
yup he definitely rolled the r in morales  the same thing dawned on me about his dad not being there and it kind of floored me  one rolled r developing actual backstory is just insane,2023-06-08
rio42 was speaking more spanish with him than 1610 was too,2023-06-05
i noticed it was stronger but didnt connect whythe attention to detail is astounding take note of these movies every other movie producer,2023-06-05
i’m pretty sure he was played by another actor too,2023-06-04
i noticed that too and i respect the world so much for that you know the writers and producers were having a lot of conversations about what earth 42 would look like and what miles would look like if his story had gone different they didnt just change his hair its how he talks and walks and holds himself,2023-06-10
he wasnt spiderman so maybe he didnt skip as many spanish classes,2023-06-17
also different texture hair i felt like he looked more like his mom as well in the profile shot of the two of them but i don’t know if i was trippin,2023-06-16
"but his dad still died after being promoted to captain so he probably was still around for most of his life

the accent could have been him just embracing his mom more",2023-06-07
its giving marty mcfly returning to an alt1985 and realizes everything is ruled by biff tannen vibes,2023-08-08
yes 100 noticed that,2023-06-11
yup when he introduces himself as im miles morales at least in the german version he rolls the r just like the college lady at the start does to try and emphasize his spanish speaking side,2023-06-27
didnt his dad die recently tho,2023-11-07
of a black teen,2023-06-04
man you did not just go there ,2023-06-05
it feels like he had to mature earlier and therefore know who he is and what he wants  being without a father and a spiderman he fell into a life of crime his growth was expedited than our current spiderman,2023-06-18

i googled if it did just to not waste time especially since me and my friends had a 2 hour drive home,2023-06-02

they also felt to me like james bond credits,2023-06-03
"their artists are severely underpaid with no overtime bonus like in california also they cut them loose the moment their contract is over and only few gets to stay its an extremely high turn over work place with a lot of moving around pixar mostly have their folks with secure full time jobs so if people wonder why spiderverse has such low budget learn that their artists are underpaid

it was funny because here in india we often refer to the british museum as chor bazaar thieves market,2023-06-02
here in india the entire audience cheered when he said that line,2023-06-05
i couldnt help but think  even in a completely different universe with india themed new york the british are still up to the same old ,2023-06-03
that was such a great line,2023-06-02

 was hilarious",2023-06-06
my kids were the same my daughter was stoked about the movie and my son was  lol he complained about it being a rip off the whole way home even though he’s bout the one that paid for it he’s truly my son,2023-06-03
as someone who was a tad too young and never saw infinity war in theaters i think i understand how you guys felt now,2023-06-03
i took my 5 year old son and this too was his first experience of such a disappointment explaining to him we gotta wait another year was brutal,2023-06-05
i remember that feeling at the end of the fellowship of the ring in the cinema even though i knew i was watching part one of a trilogy i was so taken in by what i was watching that when it faded to black and the end credits started i was miffed,2023-06-09
luckily beyond is less than a year away,2023-06-04
i felt sort of scammed with the to be continued there should have been a part i in the title or something,2023-06-11
my 10 year old was so  and i loved it,2023-06-08
it reminded me of how i felt the first time i watched back to the future two i just had no idea who they were in the movie and then to be concluded pops up i was absolutely shocked because i knew tv shows could do that but i didn’t know movies could,2023-06-05
you could say that it was her canon event,2023-06-07
its a canon event,2023-06-15

same  one of mine cried out of frustration,2023-06-22
ive never been so nervous looking at my watch i kept on wondering when they were gonna pull the plug and actually cut to to be continued,2023-06-02
really should’ve had that part 1 in the title but i was anticipating that to be continued during gwen’s team up speech,2023-06-02
"i was really loving all the time the movie was spending on the emotional moments gwen in her universe her and miles upsidedown on the roof miles’ multiple talks with his parents but i definitely had that thought in the back of my mind of “ how are they gonna wrap this up in two hours”

and now we gotta wait a year to see what happens haven’t wanted to see a sequel so bad since infinity war",2023-06-02
i couldve sat there all night long to see this story through to its completion i was absolutely riveted the whole way through,2023-06-02
"apparently its the longest american made animated movie looking at wikipedia its tied for 20 on all time longest animated movies too at 2 hours 20 mins

x200b

when you see 1 is like 273 mins long however",2023-06-02
i did sit through almost 5 hours my theatre had a fire alarm at the last 10 minutes and i went back immediately to catch the next showing i can confirm it’s great,2023-06-02
"the to be continued was the worst part of the movie

which says a lot about the quality of the movie i think",2023-06-04
this was me the movie ended and i immediately said to my wife “i thought we had a whole other hour left” was caught completely off guard can’t remember the last time i was that engrossed in a movie where 2 hours flew by,2023-06-02
"this was the first time in a very long time i audibly reacted to the end of a movie  partly because for once i wasnt in the know about this being a twoparter going in and partly because of where the movie left off in general the movie is superbly paced so its not like i felt the time or anything but the being in the wrong universealt miles swerve had me wondering how they were going to wrap this all up with the remaining time

so gwen getting the band back together sotospeak and revealing miles spoiler left my jaw dropped when we got to be continued  me and the theater crowd all were like wait wut no wayyyy",2023-06-02
after coming out of the cinema all of was agreed that that spot was perfect for a liss break and that all of us wouldve sat down through full five hours,2023-06-02
my bladder barely survived this movie im so glad it wasnt 5 hours since i didnt want to miss a second of atsv the runpee app only had like two peetimes one was the escape chase between miles and the other spiders i cant imagine ill want to miss btsv,2023-06-03
please dont remind me of avatar 3 9hour cut lol,2023-06-02
you know at some point during the movie i remembered that the writers said it was their intention to have an empire strikes back type of sequel and it was then i realized it would end on a cliffhanger this one is awesome,2023-06-02
"i didnt even know there was going to be a part 2 thought maybe this was a gimmick or something checked my watch then checked online 

wouldve glad sat there for another two hours",2023-06-03
there were so many moments in the movie where i wanted to watch more because of the way the art justworks the whole gwen stacy opening was just beautiful and i wanted to watch a whole movie through how her universe looks,2023-06-04
the staff at my theatre announced “there’s no post credit scenes everybody you can go home” we all groaned and laughed in unison,2023-06-04
" i legit think a lot of them could’ve sat through 5 hours of this without complaint

i heard a few people just say this",2023-06-05
it got a mix of whoops and groans i think it was roundly enjoyed saturday afternoon showing was packed,2023-06-03
exactly my thoughts when the theater erupted i think most people were so engrossed time was not even a factor i definitely couldve kept watching more of it,2023-06-05
100 would’ve stayed all day in that movie it was beautiful,2023-06-05
"saw it today and the two 8 yeard olds next to me walked up and said i couldve seen 3 hours of it we saw avatar remember and thats the longest movie ive ever seen in a cinema

rarely do i agree with kids at the cinema but today i did",2023-06-05
for real i could tell it had gone on for a while but i was not even close to done with it  truly the only problem is that it ended,2023-06-07
man i had been holding in my  for a good hour and then when miles is on the rooftop with aaron i walked out to  only to come back about a minute later to see that miles is tied up and about 23mins later it cuts to the to be continued maaaaaaan,2023-06-02
if after the movie ended some sony executive pulled me aside and offered me the chance to watch beyond but i had to sit through across again immediately and it would lead right into beyond i wouldve agreed to it in a heartbeat,2023-06-02
i felt that too lol and i was even holding my bladder gimme the 4 hr cut,2023-06-02
same i realized how long id been in the theater and was like im good for another hour and a half,2023-06-02
so like a miniseries yeah for sure,2023-06-02
the only thing that made me aware of how long it had been was how bad i had to ,2023-06-03
i was like oh  has it really been two hours already,2023-06-04
"i actually looked at how much time we had until the movie was finished when there was thirty minutes left and i was thinking “ummm i feel like there’s way too many plot points that need to be resolved in thirty minutes”

when the to be continued came it all made sense",2023-06-04
i felt the two hours this movie was great but it doesn’t match the pacing of the first one,2023-06-04
i had to  in the final minutes of the movie my verdict i would rather  my pants in order to get 2 more hours of the movie than wait 10 months ,2023-06-04
i could’ve if i wasn’t approaching my second bathroom break thats the only reason i was aware of how long the movie was going i really gotta stop drinking soda at movies i wanna see all the way through but popcorn and soda are a part of the movies for me,2023-06-04
i extremely loved the movie but could definitely feel the two hour runtime on the backend i thought it was about to end at least three times before it actually did,2023-06-05
hahaha this was me tonight i knew it had been awhile but i was enjoying the movie so much and avoided all the conversation and it slowly clicked the movie was over right before the “to be continued”,2023-06-10
it seemed like it was approaching the climax but when the plot was stalling i had a feeling we weren’t getting an ending today,2023-06-11
yeah my son immediately said ah of course there was no time left for a true resolution to everything that is set up,2023-06-11
completely agree the pacing of this and the first movie are topnotch,2023-06-12
"yes this is what i felt i was thinking oh boy its gonna be an amazing third act and the bam it ended 
i guess its nice that they made it so entertaining that i didnt even realize its been 2hs but at the moment it felt like a slap on the face",2023-06-12
the whole thing is paced well but once they get to the spider society or whatever time absolutely flew,2023-11-12
i am so incredibly late to this discussion but i legitimately thought that miles went to the prowlermiles verse about half way through the film,2024-01-27
yeah my theater seemed like more excitement than annoyance movie itself is a lot to digest so fun to end like that,2023-06-03
not me because i like checking my watch from time to time hehehe,2023-06-03
my theater literally turned into the movie theater from scream 2 drinks went flying popcorn buckets sailed popcorn everywhere dogs and cats living together people just jumpingrunning around yelling and shouting with various emotions my friend and i just sat there watching it happen like what the actual  are we  witnessing this was a 300 in the afternoon on a saturday showing with families and kids and such the place turned into a madhouse and then after about two minutes of this everyone aggressively just exited the theater not like pushing and shoving but like they were together in their passionangeremotionsetc once the coast was clear and my friend and i were both comfortable enough to express outloud what the  was that did we actually get up and leave,2023-06-04
if i looked it up and saw this movie was 5 hours id have packed diapers and got 2 drinks and 2 popcorns,2023-06-06
a girl in our theater said what the  and the whole theater started laughing,2023-06-03
i said to my mates i didnt want it to end,2023-06-02
my theater got an immediate “bruh” from the backrow didn’t miss a beat,2023-06-03
i honestly thought it was a joke like after the title splash it would say right now,2023-06-05
"at the second screening i went to there were two audible reactions dude and what the 

they truly spoke for all of us",2023-06-05
that was me i was that guy,2023-06-04
"yeah ngl 

i knew it was going to be 2 parts since that was first announced but i really forgot until it started to feel long and i thought “there’s no way the can end this soon” then i remembered",2023-06-02
i only learned of this like half a month ago while looking up the exact date and noticing there was another movie with similar name dated for 2024 i dont recall it being mentioned in any official trailer,2023-06-02
i consider it more to be a middle chapter empire strikes back ends in a similar way with plenty unresolved one of the main characters is stuck in a dire predicament while everyone else is preparing to save him and stop the bad guys,2023-06-02
i can forgive the questionable advertising audiences tend to be warier of movies with part 1 in their names,2023-06-02
its a movie about playing with tropes dusting off an honesttogod shocking cliffhanger was a great metatextual move,2023-06-03
i think a lot of people felt that way with dune as well it just kinda ended and i bet most didnt know it was being split into two also it to a similar degree i didnt get the chapter one until the end credits but it had a pretty good ending to wrap it up,2023-06-05
it was plenty advertised as part 1 lol,2023-06-03
it was advertised part one in the first teaser that how i knew at least,2023-06-05
it felt like it was building up to a climax… and then it just ended like the whole movie felt like buildup to absolutely nothing,2023-06-16
"i saw it yesterday and people actually were waiting until the lights turned on because i think most of us thought it was a fake out

i was left disappointed",2023-06-05
exact same thing here my kids were  lol,2023-06-09
im not gonna lie it was a very awkward stop great character writing great visuals great script but that awkward cut is gonna hurt it critically in retrospect,2023-06-05
that’s my audience right there,2023-06-05
yeah same here i felt that miles,2023-06-05
the way i gasped,2023-06-05
this is why i dont like people coming into my room even if they mean well they dont know how i like things,2023-06-15
"this really did not need to be a two parter and splitting it feels like a cheap cash grab there was so much fluff that could’ve just been cut

gwen’s opener and miles’s fight with spot could’ve been tightened

the scene where they drop an add for the spider man game and a plug for nike could’ve been cut

lego spiderman and half of the other random spidermen thrown in for gags could’ve been cut

the huge spiderman chase could’ve been cut in half

the entire plot point of miles going to the wrong universe could’ve probably been cut but we’ll have to see how much it ends up playing into the movie’s theme right now it feels like a wasteful side plot that isn’t going to pay off though 

the movie had some good humor and the emotional beats worked but it honestly feels like the studio told them to bloat it so they could cut it in two to make more money",2023-06-07
imo they shouldn’t have revealed miles in earth42 until the next movie have him go into the go home machine leave and then bookend the movie with a focus on gwen as in the cold open assembling a team to rescue him include a scene of her confronting miguel and quitting the spider force make sure he says something to the effect of “you’re also an anomaly” and vowing to capture both her and miles save the stuff with the spot and earth42 for the sequel that way it feels like at least one plot thread was somewhat resolved but also that this ending is merely a jumping off point for the next one to pick up from immediately,2023-06-02
this it got my blood pumping and then it was to be continued i didnt realize it was just a part 1 i thought the movie coming out next year was just the third movie not that i was being shown half of a plot and the other half to be shown later definitely could have been handled much better than that awkward okay the movie is over now cut off,2023-06-05
yea i cant actually say i enjoyed the film yet ive been left with all the negative emotions associated with the stress of act 2 and the heartbreaking reveals of you knew and then dumped out of the theater with no aftercare,2023-06-09
"ya i agree completely it would need a bit of a rewrite but they could have ended this one way better

maybe if they developed spot a little less and made 2099 seem a little more sinister to miles and miles a little more wary of him so it really felt like escaping him was the big ending of the movie then also at the same time put a little more focus on gwens internal struggles and have it kind of resolve with the escape and gwen making good with her dad the whole miles dad dying is canon could have been kept secret and not the primary reason for miles needing to escape  instead he was just getting away from what appeared to be nefarious motives by 2099 so then you give a fake ending to the movie after gwens situation resolves splash the title on the screen one more time then go to the scene with miles realizing hes in the wrong universe because his uncle is alive again he glitches out and bam thats your ending way better a little more sense of conclusion before its ripped away from you  but a lot more mystery about whats the come",2023-06-02
just got out and it kinda felt like the last 20 minutes or so were cut not a whole movie worth of time,2023-06-07
"yeah for me the to be continued completely ruined the movie went from an 810 with final twist which i loved to  a 210 this movie built up to a climax then just ended

this is entirely different from say infinity war which had a complete story of its own with a climax and it was like the end of a chapter with more to tell

this was just not a complete story",2023-06-20
the screening i went to had one guy audibly shout the biggest “ you” at the theater screen ever that man was not pleased with an unfinished story,2023-06-02
i feel like saying “we get more of this” is a pretty weak reason to end the movie at such a bad spot lol,2023-06-03
"but then they would miss seeing this movie in the big screen  

an experience all it’s own",2023-06-02
wasnt a fan of the cliffhanger ending but the audiovisual experience alone is worth the price of admission,2023-06-03
empire strikes back was technically a cliffhanger as well as infinity war,2023-06-04
always leave them wanting more,2023-06-03
im kinda late to the party but even as a two parter this isnt really a satisfying ending infinity warend game was also a two parter but iw still had a definite ending while at the same time building up to eg the spiderverse ending would be more like if iw ended just as thanos got the last stone the snap was incredibly important for the movie,2023-06-12
i knew it was a part 1 i was so immersed in the movie that i just genuinely forgot and i was so upset i went oh no out loud,2023-06-02
"yea all those “casual fans” who show up to a movie on opening night on a work night

nobody in a theatre on opening night thursday can be referred to as “casual audience” imo",2023-06-02
that’s what i figured,2023-06-02
lol a casual fan is one who doesnt want spoilers ya ok ,2023-06-02
yeah kids are such casuals ,2023-06-02
who tf is dm’ing you people need to grow up,2023-06-02
i watched no trailers or promos coming into this and didn’t even know there was a third one being made the “to be continued” came as a big surprise to me,2023-06-18
"i liked the movie but for me it dragged a bit because it felt like acts 1 and 2 of a movie and the first act felt really long

it made sense when it ended but i hated that about it

the visuals action dialog and everything was great so it is still enjoyable but",2023-06-05
yes they should you shouldnt have to follow all the press about a movie to know its a two parter,2023-06-16

empire’s cliffhanger was way better there was at least resolution there and direction for the next movie this was cut off literally right in the middle of something pivotal happening,2023-06-03
…i pointed this to my gf after watching it i thought my eyes were deceiving me because miles and other spiderpeople who went to earth42 definitely felt like animated at higher frame rate,2023-06-02
 can movie theaters project at arbitrary frame rates,2023-06-04
i don’t know how people notice these things but that’s incredible,2023-06-08

"sorry to comment after the movie has been out for so long but ive just watched it on netflix and i could not agree more

its difficult to even explain what theyve done here and the deeper you are into animation and visual development the more insane this final product is",2023-11-02
"i feel like these movies really highlight the creative skimp pixar is in i saw a trailer for elementals beforehand and it just looked so visually uninspired it hasnt evolved past monsters inc from like 20 years ago

i want to see more visually creative stuff stylisation is so common in games yet weirdly lacking in movies",2023-06-07
i’d also throw promare 2019 in there for visual competition if i didn’t know any better i would go as far as to say promare might’ve inspired some of those action shots in the climax with the way the fight scenes are presented,2023-06-02

i agree arcane deviates in style a couple times like in jinx’s showdown with ekko but here they have a unique art style for each universe plus those creative decisions are relevant to the plot contribute to the storytelling allude to the comics etc it’s so impressive,2023-06-07
worth pointing out its also kid cudis combined filmalbum concept and the first ive seen so the synergy of the soundtrack is on par with metros score in spiderverse scenes,2023-06-29
beep boop,2023-06-02
i love how the dialogue and “beep boop” mouth sound effects were consistent with the lego movie’s style,2023-06-02
that small line got one of the biggest laughs out of me,2023-06-02
that killed me too ,2023-06-03
one of the biggest laughs in the showing i saw today,2023-06-17
that was a tongue in the cheek compliment to themselves not the actual peter lego,2023-06-06
"hey man you are insanely talented and im so glad they used your work

just wish they brought you on board to help

hopefully you just got out of seeing the movie with some pretty cool friends ",2023-06-02
im so confused were you involved with the film did they have to pay to use your models or let you know or credit you,2023-06-02
"my lego spiderman minifig design was used

did someone from the production reach out to you about doing this or did they just use your design without telling you",2023-06-12
that’s awesome,2023-06-04
that video was so cool and i love the 90s theme song at the end,2023-11-04
they used the 2002 spiderman audio for that too i believe brilliant callback to the creators,2023-06-02
by jksimmons,2023-06-02
is jjj a nexus character,2023-06-03
after the second viewing it’s the canons scene for me,2023-06-11
he did show up he was on top of the windshield in the peter parkedcar scene,2023-06-13
warner lost the rights to make lego movies universal has them now,2023-06-02
"you can see him on the petermobile during the chase with miles and hes a tiny mini fig lol

hes on the corner of the windshield",2023-06-06
"you can see him on the petermobile during the chase with miles and hes a tiny mini fig lol

hes on the corner of the windshield",2023-06-06
spot’s art style as he gains power is serious eldritch horror,2023-06-02
i actually thought he was gonna be a villain of the week to introduce us to a more experienced miles and that the movie would transition to miguel being the full on bad guy nice to see they’re keeping miguel as a good guy just from a different perspective,2023-06-02
i love how his usual awkward akimbo stance didnt change over the course of the movie but it went from making him look goofy to making him unsettling,2023-06-03
such a good way to put it i love just how visual these movies are as we go into the different spiders worlds their visual style is throughout who controls the visual medium controls the narrative,2023-06-02
when he morphed into the black and the entire colour scheme changed my jaw dropped that  was so terrifying,2023-06-07
his final form there reminds me a lot of the antispiral from gurren lagann,2023-06-03
some of the shots from miles vision gave me mob psycho 100 vibes and thats high praise,2023-06-26
 still be the lovable  in my heart ,2023-07-09
if there’s one thing anime has taught me its the goofiest character is always the most op naruto guy sensei zenitsu etc ,2023-08-28
me and my friend were talking about that on the way home i love that hes so iconic its literally unfathomable that anyone else takes the role,2023-06-02
hes a canon event any universe where jk isnt publicly denouncing spiderman is swiftly taken care of by miguel,2023-06-04
they used the raimi jk simmons voice clips for the lego universe,2023-06-03
ive talked to some people who wished it was liveaction and it honestly baffles me the liveaction version of this is dr strange universe of madness and theres a reason this works so much better with stylized animation,2023-06-05
seeing this movie and then seeing trailers for dreamworks projects like that kraken movie or pixar’s elemental honestly makes them seem worse i know those are primed way more towards kids than this or even  in boots 2 but i genuinely don’t find much reason to watch those in theaters when animated movies like this exist,2023-06-05
the animators should really be proud of themselves before this animation was either anime or pixar style and there was nothing much in between when it came to big movies they really did such a crazy cool thing with this movie,2023-06-25
right i actually prefer it when movies are animated the whole comic book style just wouldnt work as live action,2023-06-13
i absolutely loved the spot in the older spiderman animated series i had a dvd of the portal saga and used to watch it on repeat as a kid,2023-07-14
i feel like that was a minor concept of the film too miles was super late to several important life events bc he felt he had to solve all these petty crimes,2023-06-02
"eh i think things would have still gotten worse spot still had a vendetta against miles but things just escalated a lot more quickly due to his involvement 

spot still seems like a multiversal threat before miles involvement im also not sure how anyone could contain him even prior to miles getting involved",2023-06-02
in this universe…… beyoncé is spiderdiva,2023-06-04
yeah i think its absolutely masterful the way the story manages to contain the high concept with miles personal character journey the emotional high points of this movie hit really hard i think the only thing it suffers from is being incomplete as part 1 of 2 but that being said im soooo  glad they got the chance to really spread this story out instead of stuffing it all into one movie,2023-06-02
"sequels are always hard to overcome especially for this movie in particular since it was so acclaimed for its novelty in terms of animation i enjoyed the first film more too nevertheless this was a strong sequel that succeeded in taking its strong suits up a notch ie the sound design and the art style

the few sequels i can think of that overtook its predecessor without the first movie  would probably be nolan’s batman and mad max",2023-06-04
there is always a lighthouse,2023-06-02
i cant speak to how accurate his portrayal was at the time but todays comics are 1000 written for his version of the character,2023-06-17
that scene was so gorgeous,2023-06-05
i have a feeling spot is the peter parker that would have been bitten if miles hadnt,2023-06-02
like that scene from john wick chapter 4 with the room of giant paintings lol,2023-06-05
this movie does stand on its own though i think id argue the stand alone story of across the spiderverse is actually about gwen there is a full story arc with her over the course of the movie while the movie also serves as a proper 2nd act to the trilogy itself,2023-06-08
no but the voice actor did a  good job sounding like him,2023-06-03
"absolutely they really stole the show for me her entire opening sequence was such a strong start to the movie the art style was absolutely beautiful

the only other scene that came close was when gwen and miles were sitting upside down overlooking new york but the use of colour and shadows towards the end with the prowler looked amazing as well",2023-06-02
this movie is art,2023-06-02
basically a gwen mini movie within the movie,2023-06-03
how they hug was animated on screen in this screen was ,2023-06-05
"my favorite part was when he first learns gwen’s secret and he’s struggling with his mission to get “justice” for peter is opposing his love for gwen 

his background is the “thin blue line” with him fully inside the blue vertical band 


really did a good job of using visual imagery  colors to depict internal struggles",2023-06-16
so random seeing you in this thread as a huge fan of your artvery cool,2023-06-10
its incredible the way they use animation to all of its potential corners in this movie is fantastic,2023-06-07
some art coming from you about this movie ucamartinart  ,2023-06-04
same,2023-06-09
not since my acid days have colors moved me so much,2023-08-08
"huge jjba vibes from the pallette switching too the creative freedom they have with these films is just absurd

they really revolutionised animation in cinema once and went ill  do it again",2023-06-02
the coolest part was the scene having water marks or drops coming down the background when she was being very emotional incredible detail,2023-06-03
her universe was my favorite to see every time just had this melancholy vibes to it,2023-06-04
yes it was gorgeous ,2023-06-05
this is 10 days late but they told her that her characters world art would be based on mood rings,2023-06-12
amazing i am still amazed,2023-06-11
big true colors vibes for sure with the color changes,2023-06-02
disco elysium,2023-06-02
yes i struggled throughout the movie to place that visual style,2023-06-02
i also saw some disco elysium when it got abstract,2023-06-04
dude thank you i noticed that in this movie for sure sometimes the visuals and character designs reminded me a ton of life is strange or telltale for the more stylized characters,2023-06-06
arcadia bay vibes,2023-06-16
or the game gris,2023-06-02
same especially with the polaroid picture and her wanting to go back there,2023-06-14
i had this thought while in the theatre today,2023-06-04
glad im not the only one who thought this,2023-06-05
ahh fr,2023-06-10
and gris too,2023-06-10
i need to rewatch to see how the backgrounds relate to each other colortheorywise as their perspectives diverge and converge,2023-06-03
right distinct is perfect description all the characters feel so unique but still whole im blown away by the craft of this thing,2023-06-08
i called it watercolor and my partner told me the same thing haha,2023-06-05
they do such an amazing job translating the art style from different comics to the screen it’s insane how well all of them blend together to make one cohesive world,2023-06-02
wow your son kind of perfectly summarized what i was feeling when i saw the consistency on the backdrop of the room,2023-06-05
im pretty sure theres one coming,2023-06-02
chekhovs happiness right there,2023-06-02
i would think they did it just to spite marvel comics itself because of how much they want to  on peter in general,2023-06-03
"i feel like the baby is in danger peter said that he had the kid because of miles miles is an anomaly that was never intended to become spiderman thus by that logic maydays very existance is an anomaly as well

 miguel is giving me strong pretends to do bad for good but is secretly evil and misguiding the heroes for ulterior motives vibes so maybe to up the scale of villainy to fill another 2 hour flick cause no way the 2nd film is just them fighting to prevent spot from killing the dad thats atleast the first third perhaps he intends to get rid of all anomalies to save the multiverse with mayday and miles being an obstacle in that goal

also was miguel ever vampirelike in the comics i dont recall it from the old spiderman games from the wii era actually wasnt there some multiverse vampire villain that fought spiderpeople in the comics maybe the miguel in this film is secretly that villain with the twist being that the real miguel was the one who died in his backstory",2023-06-04
had to happen eventually for one of them,2023-06-05
at least until mayday grows up and peter b becomes her uncle ben so to speak,2023-06-11
i mean they were married before and then split up right,2023-06-05
"the only thing i didnt like about it is that nobody asked the question when is it enough

like miles already lost his uncle that was his major loss event that drove him to be spiderman what sense does it make for him to have to also lose his dad by that logic spiderpeople are just fated to have their loved ones constantly ripped from their lives over and over

i kept wanting miles to look at peter with his daughter and go okay what if you had to lose uncle ben and her would you be cool with that is that just fate",2023-06-03
his evolution from pathetic dork to multiversal abomination was impeccable,2023-06-02
he has lines at the end of the movie as he comes back into his universe unless im misremembering ive slept since then,2023-06-02
jason schwartzman is such a good actor and a gifted va he’s about to pop the  as gideon in the scott pilgrim anime,2023-06-04
i feel is more a middle finger to other writers who think that the moment characters are allowed to grow beyond the status quo something is bad the current spiderman run,2023-06-03
at this point i would feel is more insulting to the readers if they keep peter and mj together id rather if they get new love interests and close that chapter for good,2023-06-03
the whole thing is confusing but its on purpose everything is explained by miguel ohara but its kind of contradicted by gwens dad not being a captain and her universe still being intact i think the spider society is missing something and that will create a conflict in beyond the spiderverse where gwens group is opposed to miguels with miles and the spot stuck in the middle,2023-06-02
my understanding is that the canon events will happen one way or the other regardless of how and who causes them and once they’re on their way the fabric of the universe rips if an outside entity stops them,2023-06-02
there was a collider there no matter what so i think what was supposed to happen was a villain in mumbattan was going to turn on the collider and create destruction just like miles in his universe with kingpin and doc ock but because of spot he had more help than he should’ve,2023-06-02
yes so all of that was supposed to happen and spots actions was supposed to lead to captain lieutenant singhs death as part of that universes fate,2023-06-02
totally was nice that he got a decent amount of screen time i bought his books when they were on the racks as a kid and am also a huge fan of his blue hoody costume,2023-06-02
scarlet spider’s creator was a professor at my college and passed a few years ago i wish he could’ve gotten to see his boy on the big screen,2023-06-04
i imagine he is going to play a bigger role in beyond the spiderverse,2023-06-03
dude ben really is fantastic why call it trash,2023-06-04
agreed,2023-06-10
andy samberg is a treasure,2023-06-02
it had the same read as karen gillan’s “thanks dad” in guardians of the galaxy,2023-06-02
i love that ben reilly is voiced by adam samberg who is always always always so good,2023-06-03
that killed me too,2023-06-03
does scarlet not have spidey sense how come he didnt detect gwen lol,2023-06-02
i hated how they made ben like that i thought they done him dirty art wise he looked incredible but the characterisation was very disappointing to me as someone who is a fan of the clone saga and ben in the comics,2023-06-02
its a loveable jab to aesthetictone that existed in comics when ben reilly was scarlet spider in the mid 90s and andy samberg did the voice so that was fun,2023-06-02
"the 90s was a time of edgy grim dark storylines and lots of pockets in comics  ben reilly was a clone who was introduced as a replacement for peter who was married to mary jane he was really sad and angry that he was a clone until they revealed he was the real peter but then he was the clone again 

basically his portrayal is a lighthearted joke about how he was constantly brooding about his life",2023-06-02
looove the love child of andy samberg and adam sandler good ol freaking adam samberg ,2023-06-02
i love it when we get a completely off the wall villain,2023-06-29
him snipping the webs complete with hand gesture was the moment that really sent a chill down my spine he is so powerful now that he is having fun with it he is completely unconcerned with being stopped,2023-06-04
but after thinking about it is kind of ridiculous how he goes “from ahh spiderman angered me by messing with the spider let me steal this atm machine to you took everything from me” it’s fine but it feels like we’re missing something,2023-06-05
i suspect parenthoodparents are a theme of the movies no way jess being  pregnant isnt to underline that,2023-06-02
im pregnant with a little boy and i was definetly choking up during some of the parent scenes cant imagine how it feels for someone whos watching this with their young teenage son,2023-06-02
"my adult daughter took us as my birthday present and it was a bunch of sidelooks throughout for sure

the cant i be out just doing benign things when im not around and the parents reaction got a big laugh from all of us",2023-06-03
mommarvel fan this was literally the first time i identified with the parent character in a movie both parents felt like fully formed humans everything rio said toabout miles is how i feel aboutwhat i want for my kids,2023-06-03
watched with my 12 and 9 year old girls over and over my oldest and i exchanged knowing glances hugs were given after,2023-06-03
my teenager learned over a couple of times and asked dad is that how you are during scenes with miles parents  they really captured it well,2023-06-05
“maybe get off his  a little”,2023-06-05
im a dad i cried three times,2023-06-04
mama morales reminds me too much of my mother lol,2023-06-04
lovely touch that peter b was reading how to talk so kids will listen and listen so kids will talk,2023-06-09
"my wife and i felt completely connected with them we have a 15 year old and we were looking at each other when their conversations were happening on the screen

such a realistic portrayal of a couple of parents that just want their teenager boy to be a honest good and responsible human",2023-06-05
i brought my son whos four he was enthralled my wife and i were crying the whole movie,2023-06-05
the incredibles movies do a great job with parents and parenting in general the first movie was the only animated movie my parents enjoyed watching with me as a kid and i treated them to the sequel when it came out regardless this movie did a wonderful job too,2023-06-04
i was fs having a parentgasm every ten mins,2023-06-05
wife and i took our 5yo to see it today we ended up in tears while our kid was just wondering where spiderman went,2023-06-06
"they’re not particularly overbearing  miles has been skipping class missing family events obviously lying and they have no idea who his friends are besides ‘peter’ and ‘gwonda’

if i was in their situation i’d be seriously concerned",2023-06-18
they’re hardly overbearing even if you mean it in a good way they’re so tolerant with him and do not hound him in asking “where the heck were you” of course they ask but they respect that he has things he doesn’t want to talk about,2023-06-05
it honestly was we had to stop taking the kids to see marvel movies the last few years because they’re not made for kids or families anymore and they’ve been bummed it was awesome taking them to a movie that portrayed parents as positive role models and people trying their best while loving their kids regardless of what’s going on there were multiple times i reached over and put my arm over one of my kids,2023-06-03
parent here i cried at all the parenting stuff,2023-06-04
i really think they should have released it on fathers day would be so satisfying to watch it as a family,2023-06-05
time constraints as a father of twins so im only halfway through the movie but its literally had me in tears throughout the whole  thing  i was not expecting that,2024-03-14
"my wife and i were talking about that when we left the theater the parents werent idiots or overbearing they had real feelings and legit wanted their kids to be safe gwens dad making a mistake at the beginning had weight that paid off at the end even in the first spiderverse movie where his dad talks through the door was real 

such a great set of flicks",2023-06-11
just got out of watching it with my 4 and 8 year olds  yes there were some strong feels,2023-06-08
and gwen got a b in english,2023-06-02
he must have gotten a kick out of gwen greeting them by their first names i cant even do that with my own mom or other adult relativesminus cousins and im nearly 23 lol,2023-06-02
i teach a lot of students with parents from spanish speaking countries and i have heard that exact same conversation happen like once a month it was spot on what generally ends up happening is that the students already speak spanish so they don’t try or cut a lot because it’s a class they feel they can slack off in more than other classes which… miles…,2023-06-04
yeah i went with a latin american crew and we were cackling,2023-06-02
they made his mom so hot lol,2023-06-07
31 year old man in the theaters trying to hold back the tears during that scene  did it hit like a ton of bricks,2023-06-04
i started crying i mentioned this upthread but i teach high school in nyc and not only is miles like just spot on accurate for a nyc teenager but that fact makes me feel a way about his family actually this whole movie did parents really well because gwen’s conversation with her dad was also very well done and very heartfelt and relatable,2023-06-04
“make sure you take care of that little boy and that he knows he’s loved” i was like ,2023-06-02
thats really sweet,2023-06-10
“oh she called me jeff…that’s fine i guess”,2023-06-05
"my daughter is 7 months which i guess since this is 22 days after your comment yours is as well

the opening scene with gwen absolutely wrecked me like is my daughter going to be unable to share a secret like that with me yeah very quick with the tears",2023-06-25
random point of confusion are we supposed to know who sam is,2023-06-02
i was definitely impressed with rio in this movie after being mostly in the background for the first movie they absolutely nailed her scenes and made her a boss,2023-06-05
"yeah i definitely dont think milesprowler is a villain antihero at worst i think

i cant imagine not getting superpowers would have changed miles trajectory so much that it tanked this universe and miles himself",2023-06-09
i mean the speech definitely fits for a woman who has a black child in an elite public school who wants to attend princeton but rio absolutely saw the spider suit during the party,2023-06-04
i think to drive it home he even swiped gum branded venomint,2023-06-02
nah it was great nice to see the venom universe getting some love,2023-06-21
no lol,2023-06-05
alright lets do this again one last time,2023-06-02
 i hope she doesnt die for it i love her and miles together so much im gonna be thinking about that upsidedown scene for weeks,2023-06-02
miles is the main lead of all 3 films with coleads in each gwen this one peter b the first,2023-06-03
i would possibly miles has had main stories in both and will continue in the third but maybe peter would be the secondary focus in the third,2023-06-02
nah she’s got a bit of resolution left gotta sort out this love square,2023-06-03
nonono were not done with gwen i want more gwen please gwen is amazing,2023-06-07
so done that she has her own movie in production,2023-06-03
yeah the first was peter b parkers emotional revelation 2 is spidergwens so 3 being miles is going to be the perfect wrap on the trilogy,2023-06-04
but which miles,2023-06-05
oh great we get to wait for the actual main characters story to be wrapped up fantastic,2023-08-11
i think its actually split 5050 which is even more impressive  they both have 4 leading decisions in the movie that i can recall although the ramifications of one of miles is never brought up again cannon event disruption,2023-06-02
"yep

her emotional state up to right before the opening credits is pretty much what drove the movie had she not been in that state of mind she wouldve made much different choices",2023-06-03
it feels like gwen is the protag of this specific movie but when both parts are paired miles is the protag of the wider story,2023-06-07
really felt like an episodic movie within a movie and i loved it for that,2023-06-02
yeah that intro was fantastic im really glad i didnt have the audio issues a lot of other theatres apparently had because that monologue was so  good,2023-06-02
i already thought gwen was cool in the previous movie but she got so much more play here than i was expecting and all of it was fantastic hailee steinfeld really killed it good on her,2023-06-02
the opening scene with gwen is possibly the greatest first minutes of a movie i have ever seen the visuals the music the flashbacks perfection,2023-06-05
"i was crying through almost the entire gwen intro for so many reasons ive been a massive spidergwen fan since her books started and i never thought id see her story play out in a movie then the watercolor art style kicked in and i realized they were animating her scenes just like much of her cover art then it hit me that they were going through her whole origin it was weird because i never felt strongly reading it but i started bawling both when peter died and when captain stacy turned on her i knew it was coming but that just made it worse they really did her justice and hailee did such a great job

seeing the mary janes was surreal im wondering if well ever get gwenom andor carnage mary jane in the all female spinoff thats been talked about",2023-06-05
shout out to her theme as well the best song from the soundtrack imo  cut to 120,2023-06-02
the shot of her briefly pretending to kiss miles when she was going into the collider was genuinely devastating,2023-06-03
just going to toss out that the music in this was fantastic as well when gwen was going full emo drumming in the beginning i was vibing,2023-06-06
her dimensions visuals and the audio to it was something else,2023-06-04
oh  its more leaps of faith,2023-06-02
i would say into the spiderverse is also partially a peter b story he was divorced from mj and depressed in itsv we see him a happy father in atsv i think it more likely that we get a spotlight on miguel i could even see a cold open like this one with gwen where we flash back to the first canonbreaking event with peter b and experience that first hand,2023-06-03
i dont know if thats the case her story is almost exactly like the comics and her father never died in the books at least not yet,2023-06-05
this confused me bc i thought the canon was spidermen just needed to have someone close to them die not necessarily a police captain a lot of times its uncle ben but it could be anyone close to that particular spiderman in these movies gwen had her peter die and miles already lost his uncle so why did his dad have to die as well,2023-06-25
its okay it isnt complete isnt it  because complete would just mean not telling such a good story  more will come,2023-06-05
great catch,2023-06-07
eh whats the alternative  imo its less story to fit the time block  i dont mind the two parter but im used to it with anime etc,2023-06-05
everything,2023-06-04
i lived in new york,2023-06-14
i cried so much during this move the family scenes were so well done,2023-07-10
woah now people say terminator 2 is the best sequel 31 years later let’s wait more than a weekend to take the crown away,2023-06-05
yeah i just got out of this movie and i’m confused by this sentiment it was pretty but it literally had no ending it was two hours of buildup to absolutely nothing,2023-06-16
i enjoyed the first one but didnt understand the hype maybe because i didnt see it in theater  this movie was top tier no way around it,2023-06-27
at your street fighter theater makes sense,2023-06-02
spot is talking to chen from the venom movies,2023-06-02
my 8 year old had to remind me she was from venom lol,2023-06-26
you stab him in the kidney facevoid,2023-06-05
"the spot has always been one of those characters that constantly gets clowned on for having a dumb name and silly character design but is absolutely terrifying if you actually stop to think about the implications of his powers and what he can do

in other words he was the perfect choice for a villain that no one takes seriously until they suddenly have to",2023-06-02
"its amazing what a little echo effect and the right tone can do to turn someone from a villain of the week into a multiversal threat and the way he used his powers while fighting the spider folk was awesome

really interested to see what they do with him in beyond",2023-06-02
i like that the trailers kind of redherringd his character a bit playing up the early goofy scenes to get people thinking he was the wacky act 1 sideshow keeping miles busy before the real threat reveals itself,2023-06-02
i like how his entire motive is just trying to get powerful enough to be a worthy nemesis for miles,2023-06-02
he became one of my favorite villians ever his character and voice were so perfect and the arc of his story made me want to go and watch it a few times more which ill probably will until digital release,2023-06-02
its such good storytelling hes a villain of the week that miles lets get out ofcontrol because hes caught between two lives,2023-06-02
i loved how fullon madoka magica his animation became as he grew in power,2023-06-02
"casting jason schwartzman as the spot was brilliant i love how his normal scientist self looks like schwartzman in design

truly a frightening example of a nobody becoming a nightmare",2023-06-03
his voice was so instantly recognizable took me less than 3 seconds kaluuya took a bit longer but it definitely clicked at some point,2023-06-02
so it was him i was getting huge gideon graves vibes,2023-06-02
the whole time i was watching i thought the spot was voiced by david spade  he sounded so much like kuzco from the emperors new groove i’m surprised to find it wasn’t him brilliant movie i loved every second,2023-06-02
i love how the b or c story was the spots second origin story journey the journey of him becoming the super villain,2023-06-05
i have always been a fan of his but this was next level work from him,2023-06-05
oh yeah and spot is such a nobody character i mean who is next the ringer,2023-06-07
it was so interesting how his character just kept growing and growing even tho you kept doubting him just like the spider people lol,2023-06-07
he was fantastic i loved him in scott pilgrim aswell and im glad to see him in the bad guy roll again,2023-06-08
same can be said about tobi obito from the naruto series also started off as a good person and then later shifted to a serious and intimidating person,2023-06-10
reminded me of him as bad guy in scott pilgrim,2023-06-10
hes good at that kind of thing,2023-06-11
also can we talk about casting,2023-06-15
just saw him in asteroid city i had no idea the same actor was playing such different roles killed it in both,2023-07-03
he seems like such a non issue until he gets angry and becomes terrifying,2023-09-03
and they created each other like he said,2023-06-02
"both of them werent taken seriously by the people around them until all of a sudden they became the nexus of the multiverses problems

i dont really believe miles is the problem though the spider society thinks he is the problem but everything ties back to spot playing with forces beyond his comprehension unknowingly giving spiderman his powers and creating the situations that lead to his own powers miles only reacts to what he thinks is right and got bit through random chance",2023-06-02
they’re also thematic parallels as well  the powers that spot gained changed him in ways that pushed his family and “real” life away  he goes on to embrace the “holes” that make him special and seeks to further distance himself from what he loves by traveling the multiverse to gather more emptiness  miles’ new life also threatens his family and close relationships and he travels the multiverse trying to fill that hole with more of what makes him special—namely by bonding with more spider folks  but in doing so he discovers that what they’re doing is holding on to their own loss and emptiness their holes by pushing it as the “correct” narrative  he even finds the version of himself at the end that has suffered that loss and that version too was transformed into a villain,2023-06-05
it be funny if he was always meant be his nemesis also miles electric power is hacks,2023-06-02
"and they mirror one another in a yin and yang kind of way

the spot uses his powers to create havoc and without it he is essentially hollow devoid of life as he obsess to destroy everything miles hold dearly 

miles sees his powers as a gift and despite not fitting in initially he chose to become his own unique person striving to do good in what he does best",2023-06-02
miles is definitely the main character of the universe of the movie that were watching which is a meta thing thats just kind of inevitably there,2023-06-07
,2023-06-02
"oh  im dumb arent i

the big twist is that spot was supposed to be spiderman right but miles stole his spider

man my plot senses were not tingling during the film itself i was just there for the rollercoaster on the first watch

edit yes confirmed dumb",2023-06-03
its why i think mikes is going to seek him out in the next film,2023-09-03
bagel was classic and i cracked up in this one when miles patted the spot on the head and the comicstyle exclamation was “good cow”,2023-06-02
the dude who animated that is probably feeling pretty good about himself right now,2023-06-02
bagels being a central plot point for 2 different multiverse movies with this and eeaao is hilarious,2023-06-02
how was it an easter egg,2023-06-03
it was straight and center on the screen it wasnt an easter egg,2023-06-02
what really tickled me is that the guy was hit by a food that is defined by having a hole in it it felt like a parody of the whole man has accident with sand and becomes sand shtick man hit by an everything bagel wakes up with the power to  everything into his gaping hole,2023-06-08
it was all a part of peter bparker’s plan to go pick up a bagel from the cafeteria so in a way he helped create him,2023-06-03
,2023-06-02
"there are many things i missed in the first movie until i rewatched it or saw someone point it out on youtube but im proud of myself for noticing bagel at the time

for across the spiderverse my son pointed out the playstation references for me  im ride or die for xbox",2023-06-03
bagel was it supposed to be a everything everywhere all at once easter egg,2023-06-11
this is the second multiverse movie where the bagel is an icon for realitybreaking nihilism the first being everything everywhere all at once,2023-06-12
holy  i adore eeaao and i didn’t even catch that amazing,2023-06-02
"on the outside wall of spots warehouse lair you can see a parallel universe movie poster for all of it all of the time

theres a giant bagel in the middle",2023-06-02
i actually totally thought the live action scene the spot goes to was the everything everywhere all at once universe before they showed a closeup of the lady lol i only just learned in this thread that it was the venom universe since ive never watched those movies,2023-06-05
do you know what’s weird is that i swear there’s a third one in like a doctor strange movie or something,2023-06-02
"well see it needs to become a trope now 

a few years from now anytime a bagel is on screen fans will start using it to justify the moving being in another multiverse",2023-06-04
,2023-06-02
spiderverse does it better because its actually a funny callback and not some  lol random plot point,2023-06-02
right it builds on that but doesn’t really change or backtrack on anything,2023-06-04
it also had the number 42 on it already,2023-06-25
"retcons are things that retroactively add to continuity because they weren’t planned at the time 

the guy getting bagel’d was never planned to be be anything more than a joke for someone paying attention just like the death star exhaust port was just supposed to be a design flaw

so going back in the sequels and saying that bagel guy eventually turned into the spot and the design flaw was specifically made to destroy the death star are retcons

just cause comicbooks have retcon so much  and so poorly that “retcon” no longer has the neutral meaning it started out with doesn’t change that op is right to call those two things that people liked retcons",2023-06-02
"in a film television series or other fictional work a piece of new information that imposes a different interpretation on previously described events typically used to facilitate a dramatic plot shift or account for an inconsistency

seems to fit the definition to me",2023-06-02
it was pointed out many many times on rmoviedetails that the exclamation is bagel when the bagel actually hits him,2023-06-02
,2023-06-02
miguel seems to avoid universes where the other avengers exist and a tony stark or stephen strange might mess up his plans,2023-06-03
its literally just a blink and you miss it gag from when miles and peter are being chased by olivia octavius and the other scientists miles tosses a bagel that hits one of the scientists and a little visual onomatopoeia effect that says bagel flashes by his head for a split second,2023-06-02
"its a terrible one in fact the death star flaw was always that it was an exhaust port

rogue one actually kinda makes it worse because proposes that the exhaust port that is near impossible to hit and requires the most suicide mission of suicide missions and even then couldnt be hit with a targeting computer was actually a deliberate choice by someone trying to destroy it and the main weakness and then you have to ask why galen designed such a  vulnerability",2023-06-14
i mean in the spots case it kind of is necessary to explain how his origin story is connected to kingpins collider experiment instead of making it random and unrelated,2023-06-04
" is it possible the bagel guy is this universes peter parker that didnt get bit

umm no this universes peter dies in the beginning of itsv",2023-06-02
 i thought that was just the lighting,2023-06-02
his jordan’s changed too they went from his typical chicago’s to the recently released “next chapter”,2023-06-02
his actual mom had brown eyes alternate mom has green,2023-06-02
its funny because i noticed it but thought it was just a nod to his uncle or green goblin from nwh turns out i wasnt far off,2023-06-02
even the puffer looked a bit different but i just thought bro has two puffers,2023-06-03
"his moms eyes are also brown in his dimension in this dimension theyre green

i also noticed during my second viewing that a blueprint for the prowler glove was taped to the side of his desk",2023-06-10
for me it was the rain difference,2023-06-03
i have a weird catch when hes at his dads party there is a very brief scene where you can see his suit neck is slightly showing on a side view and then when his parents confront him the black suit neck isnt there either im remembering things incorrectly it was a blooper or playing with time will be a big part of the next movie,2023-06-09
"its like that sliders episode where hes home but the gate doesnt squeak and the golden gate bridge is blue


fan  tastic film",2023-06-04
funny i thought that was just a homage to his uncle with him finally revealing the secret,2023-06-03
purple jacket with a green jacket over it too,2023-06-04
it did occur to me once the green and purple were reminding me of prowler and green goblin,2023-06-04
whenever i saw it i thought he was just wearing his uncles jacket and kept it for remembrance completely caught me off guard realizing it was his own multiverse self’s coat,2023-06-05
purple and green just like prowler,2023-06-11
the purple jacket felt weird weird to me and i didn’t get why at the time,2023-06-04
and his mothers eyes are green when in his universe they are brown,2023-06-09
i thought that was hinting at the green goblin haha,2023-06-03
 i didn’t even catch that,2023-06-04
"apparently his moms eyes are a different color as well

i say apparently because im monochromatic color blind",2023-06-09
do you have an example trying to find,2023-06-23
"i thought i was losing my mind i had caught the 42 in the machine but the scene was played so straight i thought i mustve missed something 

when gwen entered miles empty room it was a straight gut punch what a great way to do the reveal",2023-06-02
i honestly forgot because they kept showing 42 throughout the last movie and this one,2023-06-02
miles universe is 1610 not 6106,2023-06-02
i saw it said earth 42 but i didnt remember what his universe was im going to blame the sound mixing too i guess but it helped me get  into that awesome twist so i cant complain,2023-06-02
42 is the answer to the ultimate question earth 42 will be key for fixing the spiderverse and finally giving spiderpeople the happiness they deserve,2023-06-05
so did the avatar girl with the puffs didn’t catch her spidername know he was going to 42 i thought she was helping him out when she didn’t reboot the sequence but maybe it was more of a “ it let him go there instead of home”,2023-06-04
yeah i spotted this and felt that for me and anyone who did spot it it kinda took the edge off what might have been an exciting twist once you had an inkling it became pretty obvious gwen and miles never being in the same shot etc,2023-06-02
go home machine made me smile,2023-06-04
my brother caught that and was very excited to point it out to me it was a lot of fun watching it together because we pieced the twists together lol miles not belonging in spider society because he was bitten by the wrong spider clicked the moment they talked about how they couldnt work with him for me,2023-06-11
yeah i assumed they had a different numeration and simply used 42 because the spider had the number but i totally forgot they mentioned the spider came from another universe,2023-06-02
not everyone is remembering numbers on the fly,2023-06-02
i caught that but didn’t put two and two together until the reveal a few minutes later,2023-06-08
yeah i caught up on that too so i thought he wanted to see his alternate self and probably warn or save him from whatever was going on with multiverse shenanigans had no idea miles1610 didnt realize he was in the wrong universe until he started talking to his mom,2023-06-07
also on the right hand side of the scene there are schematics for the prowler gloves on his wardrobe,2023-06-23
it comes up in massive letters when he makes it to the universe,2023-06-15
i saw that and immediately wondered what was happening ,2023-06-02
yeah i caught that and freaked out when he was talking to his mom i thought he had gone back to his own universe but the spider powers went to universe42 so he wasnt spiderman anymore as it were,2023-06-12
i kinda laughed when she said who is spiderman thinking she just doesnt use the internet or read the news somehow but then a few seconds later oh  that wasnt a joke,2023-06-02
an author that i like wrote a blog post about how to write surprise and mystery he said initially he tried to make the hints subtle but people didnt get it eventually he just makes the hints insanely obvious but as long as you dont explicitly spell out the answer people will prefer to continue to read than stop and evaluate this was that moment so many hints but the movie kept going and so i didnt think about it,2023-06-02
miles parents watched the news of spidermans death in the first movie so she definitely knew but in the moment i just assumed she was just being a bit clueless about superheroes and which is which,2023-06-03
"this would have been such a cool thing for me to figure out and a memorable cinema moment eg realizing strange never told wanda the name america chavez during their conversation in the trees in ds2mom

but a girl a few rows ahead of me loudly said ohhhhhh hes in the wrong dimension and ruined the realization for me",2023-06-08
glad i wasn’t the only one ,2023-06-14
and the fact that she mentions comic con but in the first movie miles doesnt know what it is because his universe doesnt have it,2023-06-02
i was a little disappointed they could have used the toy gwen took out of the package being back in the package as a signal to miles that he was in the wrong universe it was so perfectly set up,2023-06-02
same  they played that scene perfectly,2023-06-08
yep that’s when i figured it out earth 42s mom had green eyes when the og mom had brown eyes,2023-06-02
omfg i just realized i had noticed eyes and thought wow is that an animation mistake i am so dumb,2023-06-04
it was ironic to have such a beautiful art style for her universe and we all wanted to see more from it until you realize she’s miserable in that universe so you don’t want her to go back,2023-06-03
this is how the covers of her early comics looked its not a stylistic choice its a distinct homage,2023-06-02
and how they both had opposing color motifs he was warm colors against warm background she had cooler colors and her room was the same to show that separation between them but in the end they shared the same color palette when they finally reconciled,2023-06-04
it reminded me of a game called gris  beautiful little platformer that did similar things with watercolor and emotional highslows,2023-06-06
i need to get my marvel unlimited subscription back up and running i always meant to check it out and just never did,2023-06-02
there was a easter egg to eeaao in the movie there’s a blink and you’ll miss it shot of a billboard that says “all of it always all over the place” with a bagel in the middle,2023-06-05
"haha i also thought on that

this and the whole spiderverse and eeao did the multiverse the correct way hands down",2023-06-04
the eerie whistle motif when uncle aaron42 shows up was really terrifying,2023-06-02
i loved the prowlers theme in the first one i got chills hearing it come back at the end,2023-06-05
"itd be hilarious if two multiverse movies won in a row

but yeah literally zero chance of best picture reddit is wilding itll run well for best animation if not win",2023-06-07
the last one won,2023-06-02
also wasnt even a complete story,2023-06-11
"that’s the best type of plot twist though it’s literally right in front of people but in a hectic moment so many people like myself lol will have missed it some will have picked up on it when his mum is confused me when he glitches the first time right up until he spells it out 

great twist",2023-06-05
tbh a lot of people i went with didn’t realize i didn’t at first but my friend pointed it out even after knowing i was waiting anxiously for the shoe to drop so them including it didn’t ruin the moment for me or my friend,2023-06-25
yeah i was confused why people are viewing this as a twist and why they kinda played it that way the 42 is very plainly there and they make a point of saying where everyone is from the reveal didn’t work for me it was more so waiting for miles to figure it out,2023-06-06
especially when there is dune 2 and oppenheimer releasing in the next few months but i can totally see it winning the best animated film category like the first part,2023-06-02
999910 its my favourite film in long time but  some of dialogs were hard to hear many are complaining about in this thread and theyre right,2023-06-05
"yes plot twists are often shown right in front of you and ppl still miss them or wouldnt register

a trope as old as agatha christie",2023-06-04
facts like it was literally shown,2023-06-04
there are dozens of spectacular spiderman fans dozens regularly get the theme song stuck in my head from time to time,2023-06-02
i’m sold queuing up the first episode on disney now,2023-06-02
"real 

any time i think of it the possibilities of what could be haunt me


so anytime i rewatch i usually just rewatch the first season cause its got a happy ending


but i think spectacular spiderman will be my favorite spiderman for all time",2023-06-02
its the best interpretation of spiderman to date,2023-06-03
we got to see a little bit of his future in this film  we saw his spiderman watch captain stacy die,2023-06-04
"well canonically he is pretty short standing at around 5 6 as he mentions in season 1 episode 3 when on the hunt for lizard

i think he says something along the lines of if i were a 6 5 lizard instead of a 5 6 spider where would i hide  


honestly im really happy with how short they made him look as it shows the level of the attention to detail in this movie",2023-06-11
what did yuri say,2023-06-02
now give us season 3 yes im still coping,2023-06-02
yeah completely new and not a part of the show now after that at least we know one thing that happened after the final episode lol,2023-06-02
pour one out for the boy,2023-06-03
the crazy thing is that captain stacy is actually still alive by the end of the show so this confirms he eventually dies,2023-06-04
that was josh i honestly thought it was jason marsden goofy’s son max in suzume good for him,2023-06-04
"i was thinking the same thing leaving the theatre 

spoilers for both across the spiderverse  ff7 remake gwen’s arc in particular regarding whether to side with miles or miguel felt reminiscent of aerith’s implied arc in remake",2023-06-07
i was so happy to see the show acknowledged in one of the background clips but then when josh keaton also had lines as spectacular spidey i was ,2023-06-14
i believe he showed up as one of the cleaning crew spideys alongside assassin spiderman,2023-06-04
yeah i dont think anyone is touching that spiderman with a ten foot spiderpole,2023-06-06
you missed the whole point of the movie…,2023-06-06
"that was my thought too i saw infinity war opening night and how quiet the theater was at the end still gives me goosebumps i thought then this is the new age empire strikes back

this movie being able to ring that bell again is the cherry on top for me",2023-06-02
it didn’t matter to me at the end of iw i was emotionally devastated nothing before of since had affected me as much and i’m still not sure how or why,2023-06-02
"yeah i had no idea i figured there was at least 40 minutes left which is a good thing to be honest

but the yells of disbelief from my showing  i wont forget that any time soon",2023-06-03
i wasn’t aware this was a part 1 so i was caught completely and totally by surprise as was the girl who screamed “oh my ” when it happened,2023-06-04
"infinity war also wrapped up most of its plot points by the end of the movie yes people had this general idea that the survivors would get their revenge on thanos somehow but that couldve been in two or twenty movies

this movie doesnt of all its plot threads only one gets any sort of resolution by the end of the movie

and im really getting tired of this trend of movies hiding that theyre twoparters in the general marketing first it happened with dune and now this though at least dune lets you know at the beginning of the movie that you only shelled out money for half the story instead of making you wait until the end",2023-06-04
i wouldn’t have seen it if i knew this was a two parter,2023-06-04
still need to see baahubali rrr was incredible wish i saw it in theaters we never had a theatrical release here,2023-06-04
still say one of cinemas biggest tragedies is that baahubali got squashed into two movies and not three,2023-06-11
i’m with you i loved the cliffhanger and thought the build to the end got me so hyped only downside is i can’t watch the next one but honestly i might go see this one in theatres again  awesome movie,2023-06-03
i was only disappointed because i thought we were five years out from another one big relief when i found out that we’ll get the resolution next year,2023-06-04
"man i got actually mad excited as they were building to the end with the twists on earth42 and then youve got gwen building her team and the music building up to it all and going right into the credits perfect way to end the film and get me mad excited for the next part in march 

there were quite a few people in my screening tonight that were really  off with this and called the film  or a waste of time when the credits rolled interesting to note the different reactions but for me this movie fired on all cylinders and every shot delivered and perfectly fed into my hype for the next one",2023-06-04
no they didn’t,2023-06-19
i was expecting it to still be in the box that it wasn’t there made it better for me,2023-06-04
him being born is a canon event,2023-06-02
ha i said that to my wife hes the link that binds all the universes together,2023-06-03
even darin de paul jjj in the insomniac games emulates jk simmons really hard he has become the reference point for all jjj performance,2023-06-02
has been for years really,2023-06-02
he is a passive canon event,2023-06-02
then when they swung by the training room the doc oc went “hello peter”,2023-06-07
 his universe probably had a captain stacey too,2023-06-05
but isn’t his canon event his uncle dying i guess someone else usually dies inuniverses too,2023-06-03
"his universes canon events are already disrupted so why does it matter if miles continues to disrupt the canon its already doomed anyway apparently idk speculative rules like this are a big reason why i get annoyed by multiverse movies

also i dont understand why evil miless universe was able to continue to exist when its canon events were disrupted",2023-07-12
were hopefully going to find out at least some of his theories are just wrong in part 3,2023-06-02
yeah it seems obvious to me that miguel either doesnt know enough or is lying on some level about the canon events we see earth 42 where the canon was broken is perfectly fine,2023-06-03
i liked this movie but the unreliable and nebulous nature of the multiverse laws remove a lot of the scripttraction i need in order to understand the stakes and the characters options  vague slippery or contradictory rules make it a lot harder to care or get invested,2023-07-12
but there isnt even a spider man in one of the universes and it was just fine until miles came by and i doubt hes gonna stay in that universe,2023-07-12
which part i think all were stated at some point,2023-06-02
you’re right two towers has an ending and the story continues naturally the entire climax is resolved with the battle at helms deep the overarching story is shared across all three films but each film has its own story to tell and doesn’t just abruptly dump you in the middle of the climax it would be like cutting to black just as gandalf arrives,2023-06-02
nobody is talking about mrs chen ,2023-06-03
it seriously gave me whipslash wow,2023-06-02
donald4spiderman,2023-06-02
it wasnt even on my list,2023-06-02
did not expect it at all,2023-06-03
honestly thought we might get tom hardys venom,2023-06-05
seeing ganke playing spiderman ps4 at the dorm was  crazy,2023-06-02
no love for spectacular spiderman,2023-06-02
there is even a very small reference to the amazing spiderman game back in 201213 too that scene where miguel shows all the multiverse where uncle ben died,2023-06-02
"there was a atari 2600 green goblin in the jail as well but youd probably need to be at least 45 years old to even realize the reference

it was the blocky green thing that most folks probably didnt even realize what it was lol


atari 2600 green goblin",2023-06-03
we all knew wed get a spiderman ps4 in this movie but were we expecting that kind of cameo  i wasnt and i giggled like a kid,2023-06-02
couldnt hear donald glover was there a call back there i didnt catch,2023-06-02
righhht ahh,2023-06-02
i picked up on ganke playing it but what were the other references to the game,2023-06-05
dont forget spectacular spiderman,2023-06-03
i wish they had ps4 spiderman make an actual cameo in the spidercity,2023-06-11
"heck there was 2 references
 one was the dorm room
 other was the actual spider society scene where it has “insomniac’s spiderman”",2023-06-20
yeaaaah i knowwwwww will he ever reference that in the game,2023-06-11
makes me think we might see holland in beyond i saw tobey and obviously andrew but i don’t think i saw holland,2023-06-02
"honestly with this sony could fix the plothole of having mcu vulture in the sonyverse

just say he was an anomaly caused by this multiversal  and is swiftly dealt by one of the spiders",2023-06-02
what makes you say that he isn’t the prowler in the mcu at least not yet,2023-06-02
miles moraless creation is directly influenced by the original donald for spiderman campaign so its a great full circle moment to have him playing miless uncle,2023-06-02
my hope is its not a mom kinda cameo where john krasinski isnt gonna be mr fantastic in the movie and we actually get miles and donal glover prowler in the mcu at some point,2023-06-02
"same was the only one who gasped for glover

 james blake song ahahhaaa",2023-06-02
my theater collectively lost their ,2023-06-02
opposite in my theatre there were cheers,2023-06-02
surprisingly we had a unanimous  followed with some applause in mine,2023-06-02
oh that stinks  i saw this a few minutes ago with a very lively crowd and we all went   it was great,2023-06-02
my theater flipped out when that happened also ben rileys first scene my audience knew their  lol,2023-06-02
pretty much the whole crowd gasped when i saw it tonight,2023-06-02
also him cheering miles and booing the other spidermen,2023-06-03
its  crazy that community a niche and weird tv show from the early 2010s that didnt exactly break tv ratings but nonetheless had a very loyal fanbase led to the creation of miles morales which led to the creation of an almost billion dollar animated movie franchise the butterfly effect workin really hard to crank that one out huh ,2023-08-08
"donald glover played aaron davis miles’ uncle who turns out to be the prowler in spiderman  homecoming it was kind of subtle if you didn’t recognize the name of the character because he’s not in the prowler outfit in the movie but he does mention that he has a nephew in that scene so it was cool to finally see him suited up

the second layer is some aspects of miles morales’ creation were heavily inspired by donald glover there was a push on social media for him to be cast as peter parker in the amazing spiderman in reference to this he showed up in spiderman pajamas in a community episode  that inspired brian michael bendis and sarah pichelli when designing comic book miles  so in homecoming and this film it’s also a nod to his influence on the creation of the character",2023-06-02
how its 2 different universes lol,2023-06-02
totally possible if miles was 7 when aaron mentioned him in homecoming hed be 13 in 2023 assuming he didnt get blipped if they need to they could say miles was a baby when his uncle mentioned him and he got blipped and push 13 for him out to 2035,2023-06-03
maybe not soon but it will happen eventually,2023-06-03
"rumours are hes going to appear in spiderman 4 apparently hes going to be peter parkers neighbour 

my guess is he will appear and in an end credits scene get bit by the spider",2023-06-04
donald glover plays aaron davis in the mcu homecoming,2023-06-02
"after no way home it‘s been straight up bad

thor was an abomination how can you waste christian fckin bale and dr strange was just an ok movie

i dont have hope till the next spiderman movie tbh cause even the avengers wont make me care much anymore",2023-06-02
"nwh shangchi and gotg3 were excellent

black widow wakanda forever and dr strange were mid

thor love and thunder ant man quantumania and eternals were bad",2023-06-05
i wonder if this movie is technically part of phase 45 they explicitly mentioned strange and earth 616 incident,2023-06-03
i think the shows have been great loki and wandavision,2023-06-07
its been rough since age of ultron,2023-06-05
" if only marvel just went balls to wall with the multiverse

wouldnt blame this one on marvel but pop culture media 

marvel studios wanted to do this well over 10years ago but the prescreening reporters criticized the idea of having multiple of the same variants of characters in the same universe stating that its too confusing for the casual audience and general viewers 

now 10 years later it is all anyone wants to watch everyone wants a multiverse look at everything everywhere all at once

russian dolls has a spin on alternate universes lots of media today is bandwagon on a tool that has been around since comic book creation 

10 years ago reporters called us general audience too naive to understand multiverses to even want to purchase the movie ticket to begin with",2023-06-02
" dcs best recent movie is joker 

i think the batman is better hopefully james gunn actually gives dc some coherence",2023-06-04
imo those are the best comic book stories spiderman blue i forget which issue it was but there was one where spiderman gets trapped in the subway with jjjs dad he played out an imaginary game with a cancer patient to make him feel better  that just shows spiderman is just a guy trying to make the world a better place no matter seemingly small it was compared to the rest of the universe i wish a tv show would focus more on that instead of monster of the week type stuff im looking at you spiderman 2017 give me back spectacular  it,2023-06-03
so you wanted ang lees hulk lol,2023-06-04
"there’s the x men and fantastic 4 incoming 

the avengers have always been b listers compared to those 2 groups

saying the story is told is some casual comic book fan logic",2023-06-05
wow same and i thought it was a problem with the theatre haha,2023-06-02
saaaame i honestly thought i was going crazy or deaf because no one else seemed confused,2023-06-02
same for me the opening fight scene with gwen and pretty much all of spiderpunk’s dialogue was very low weird because i also watched it in a dolby theatre which i never had problems with,2023-06-03
same here this is simultaneously very reassuring and disconcerting lol,2023-06-03
i understood maybe two or three of spiderpunk’s lines throughout the whole movie lol,2023-06-05
same here could barely understand spiderpunk which was a shame from all these comments i’m seeing,2023-06-05
"i think that was intentional she didn’t say anything really important it was stuff we already knew but i think it was supposed to signify getting lost in the music and how she couldn’t hear her own thoughts 

spiderpunk was probably bad mixing lol",2023-06-05
dolby cinema seems to be okay,2023-06-04
you guys have to watch it in a dolby cinena impeccable sound hands down the best movie this year,2023-06-02
just an fyi i saw it on release friday and had that issue and then i saw it again last night wednesday with my so and the sound seemed to be a lot better i was able to catch almost all of hobie’s lines this time,2023-06-08
yeah this is going to be a pain in the  as someone who works at a theatre having to keep turning the audio up and down before and after this movie shows,2023-06-02
i’m so glad both this and the above comment addressed this almost walked out in the beginning thinking it was just the cinema i’m in the mixing was awful not sure i heard a single “thwip” sound effect in the whole movie as things were so quiet missed a lot of dialogue too especially from punk a real shame considering how great it looked i hope they fix it for future releases,2023-06-02
i thought the mix was weird during her drumming monologue too but the rest of the movie seemed fine to me,2023-06-02
ok i thought i was being too picky but many times i felt like the sound wasn’t immersing me enough to the action of the film i reside in las vegas nv,2023-06-02
same here she sounded far away,2023-06-02
i felt like it reversed in my theater she was hard to hear in the opening but then during the vulture fight the voices were loud and everything else felt quiet eventually i stopped paying attention to that because the movie  me in,2023-06-02
same although once it cut to her rehearsing with the band i thought it was intentional like she was literally trying to drown out her internal monologue,2023-06-03
oh i thought my theatre just had bonked audio i noticed this too,2023-06-03
yeah seems to be a common complaint i definitely agree,2023-06-03
"subtitles will be a godsend for this one calling it now its a pyramid scheme for them to sell dvds

j in case it wasnt obvious",2023-06-03
"my theater had warnings up stating it wasn’t their fault lol

either way awesome movie",2023-06-04
if you go back and watch the first one the opening is the exact same way every time i throw it on i feel like i have my surround sound settings messed up but for some reason the opening voice over sounds like they recorded it through a wall guess its an intentional choice but i dont get it,2023-06-03
yeah happened to me too then i just got accustomed to it,2023-06-03
her monologue at the end was also quite quiet and that may have actually ruined the ending for me not that i think its bad just that i didnt get the conclusive feeling i should have at the end i too look forward to a rewatch with subtitles because right now i dont feel comfortable giving the movie a rating,2023-06-05
i had no idea what she was talking about its like she was recapping a movie we havent seen yet,2023-06-05
ngl i didnt notice any audio issues but maybe thats because theres subtitles where i am,2023-06-02
its such a shame cause i missed so many lines and if theyre anything like the ones i could hear this would have elevated the movie just that much more,2023-06-02
"i saw it in imax and it was very noticeable

that said it was better than the usual ear splitting loudness",2023-06-02
yeah i was gonna get up and ask the theater staff if there was a way to turn it up the whole movie felt kinda quiet,2023-06-02
usually info like that is sent along with the kdm’s for the film usually in the form of a pdf of notes for the projectionist not that they exist anymore… chances are your theatre received the information just didn’t do anything with it,2023-06-02
that explains why guest services looked at me like an idiot when i went and said the audio levels were off,2023-06-02
this is what you get when you sack all the projectionists and go full automation,2023-06-02
for me the music was too quiet in general,2023-06-03
my theater must have got it it sounded fine to me,2023-06-02
funny to hear didn’t notice the mixing issue but it was loud in my theater fresh from the previews,2023-06-04
we saw it today the before movie ads seemed way too loud to me but the actual movie volume wasnt an issue in my theater,2023-06-15
apparently my theater got the memo  was so loud the whole time,2023-06-10
just saw it for the first time today and the mix was still not great ,2023-07-03
i could hear it just about but it was weirdly mellow and quiet even for the tone of the monologue itself,2023-06-02
dont think its a movie issue seems like a theatre mixing issue i just saw it and thought the music was almost too quiet in that scene no issues with the dialog hopefully theaters figure it out going forward,2023-06-02
if you go back and watch the first one peters opening monologue is mixed the exact same way like hes being recorded from behind a wall so it seems intentional but im not sure what that intention was,2023-06-03
it’s 2023 there are no more projectionists everything is digital and automated now spiderverse  up putting the onus on the theaters,2023-06-04
"my imax definitely did and thank  because some  let his two 4 year old scream through out the whole movie he also let his phone rang for hours twice

that really ever happens here but this time when it did the movie drowned it out mostly",2023-06-04
anyone know what they said when indian spiderman shook hands with the captain after being saved there was a funny exchange but i missed it,2023-06-02
watched it on imax first thing i noticed was that the audio was off,2023-06-11
and the drums werent even loud her voice just kind of melted into them like a soup of noise,2023-06-03
same here it sounded like only the centre channel was on and everything else was on minimum volume the bass was almost non existant,2023-06-02
yeah it was mostly just bad at the beginning during some action scenes later on and with spiderpunk i was worried at first that i would barely able to hear anything throughout the whole movie but most of it was at least ok sucks that there were issues at all though,2023-06-05
"


philip lord of lord and miller said this movie needs the volume cranked up because they wanted a greater dynamic range in the audio mix",2023-06-07
i think seeing a universe collapse all because you wanted a family would make you a ,2023-06-02
"the easiest aspect for me to see was the fact since miles wasn’t supposed to be spiderman he doesn’t have to follow in line with cannon

he can save his father and not break reality


i wonder if spiderman 2099 has something to hide…",2023-06-02
"i think hes just being harsh to get the point across plus him being mad at miles for other stuff

these events effect entire universes so i can understand the stress",2023-06-02
its insane how people like you cannot empathize and see why a character see another character in such way its obvious as  why miguel acts like that and the movie literally explains out to you as a viewer,2023-06-04
thats a fair point,2023-06-02
"
or no one explained why they didnt tell miles he was an anamoly maybe dont mention the dad but if they had explained to him the spiderverse maybe he wouldnt have recklesly followed gwen

gwen didnt want to hurt miles feelings by telling him he wasnt supposed to become spiderman if you have gone through a whole heros journey to become a superhero particularly one with all the selflessness dogood baggage of spiderman it would be kinda devastating if your transdimensional gf told you you were an accident no one else told him because they didnt know gwen visited him in the first place and furthermore they didnt want him ever knowing because as an anomaly they didnt trust miles to begin with",2023-06-07
"spot doesnt misunderstand spidey he knew exactly what his job was and he knows spidey broke the collider he doesnt care if it was a for a good reason and heck he wasnt even that me about it

and miles knows why they didnt tell him but it doesnt make you feel any better if your friends were trying to let your dad die",2023-06-21
where’s madam web she’s the key to all of this,2023-06-04
"iirc coic book miguel never gets bitten by a spider i think hes just a spiderman who has to focus on the bigger picture and miles is just too big of a risk

basically the life of one cop vs everything",2023-06-21
thats actually a really good theory,2023-06-04
"yeah hes definitely hiding more if miles is an anomaly shouldnt his universe be collapsing and shouldnt earth42 miguel says miles wasnt supposed to be bitten which would mean the canon was broken

im assuming this will be revealed in part 2 though",2023-06-13
i have no idea why but gwens opening monolog was coming from the side channels instead of the center channel like normal dialog it made it very hard to hear,2023-06-02
i dont think so the whole movie was that way for me and many others several times my fiance or i had to ask the other what somebody said,2023-06-07
i agree with this assessment 100,2023-06-05
hobie broke his before the miles vs everyone fight i 100 think he was stealing parts to build the device he gives gwen gwanda,2023-06-02
he was i noticed that later pretty clever ,2023-06-02
he definitely was stealing to make the watch he tells miles he should make his own watch in the middle of stealing stuff,2023-06-16
im looking forward to screencrush having an hour long easter egg video,2023-06-02
"charlie of emergency awesome is my favorite at this and he said hes gotta watch this movie at least half a dozen times before he can do his video its confounding the experts 

when we left the theater she asked me is this gonna be one of those movies that whenever it comes on tv youre gonna stop and watch it i was like  yeah",2023-06-03
the mask fits us all so good,2023-06-04
oh for sure it critiques the whole genre but it does feel extra pointed given how much spiderman comics have held him down in unchanging mediocrity for a large portion of his modern titles the amount of resets plot twists reality alteration to make him fall back into the story of og spiderman is wild haha,2023-06-02
"even the way they aged miles up in a really noticeable way in the beginning of the movie sets the tone 

literal growth and change hes not the super cute kid from the first movie anymore and it shows",2023-06-03
but what would the writers even do if they could not pit the same villain characters in against the same heroes in the same situations for decades and decades i am sure there are writers having batman fight the joker whose grandparents have written the same interactions,2023-06-02
its a metaphor for capitalism,2023-06-03
"its ironic that miles in the comics was simultaneously a massive shake up to the status quo and sticking to closely to it since he would eventually go through similar traumas and story beats as peter

i never thought of it this way but thats a brilliant analysis ill appreciate it more on my next viewing for sure",2023-06-05
"its funny how direct they get with it the captain always has to die

all these weird and wonderful takes on the character but its always the same beats nothing ever changes i love that theyre willing to change that up a bit and have the people in spidermans life be more than just tragic stories waiting to happen",2023-06-07
and i also feel this is directed bigots who threw a hissy fit when they realized the face of the spider verse films was black,2023-06-02
you cant escape the status quo otherwise youd cease to exist spiderman has to have spider powers,2023-06-25
"i think theres a line to be tread and its fine and i think the spiderverse writing team thinks so too a lot of the beats in itsv are about how spiderpeople all have some things in common but its more about the concepts and shared loss and responsibility than specific defined events as the canon in astv you need a thematic throughline defining shared characteristics but you can explore those in different and interesting ways

theyre all spiderman womanpersonanimal because of what theyve gone through and how theyve over come it they dont become a spiderman because of that but because of the type of person they are",2023-06-02
tbh its clear theyre going for a miguel secretly being morlun twist so i dont get this whole criticism angle,2023-06-02
fair i think it can be both criticism of those who can’t let og exactly the same peter go along with the writers who won’t let him grow,2023-06-03
im a little confused by that idea considering the spider verse comics are very popular and so was ultimate spider man like the fandom has been pretty good about accepting non archetypal spiderman its kinda a thing in superhero comics anyway,2023-06-16
it reminds me of the last jedi where it does offer a solid critique but its also a loving homage of the things it deconstructs and challenges,2023-06-03
i don’t think they mean to say the structure is inherently poor but i do think they are presenting a critique of never letting anything change there’s no issue with the “canon events” but the spiderman comics have an issue evolving past it the same way miguel is obsessed with it,2023-06-02
" metafiction
 
 deconstructing 

you really just said critique with extra steps but wanted to be more pretentious",2023-06-15
oh holy  yeah that’s pretty apt very much within the genre but also calling out some crutches of the genre at the same time,2023-06-03
ooooh i didn’t see that originally but i could definitely see that “you were supposed to let the white guy be spiderman instead you got him killed”,2023-06-05
there was a uh… certain energy to “you were never meant to be spiderman” directed specifically at miles this movie is saying something and i love it,2023-06-02
absolutely spiderman is my favorite hero but miles has had the better stories for awhile now on average,2023-06-02
good art means something,2023-06-18
i know what you mean but it doesnt really make sense in this case in this regard its not that something important happened in history and now when you mess with time you shouldnt change it this is saying that present things have to happen despite there not being an afterward that is set by the present,2023-06-03
"i feel like matt and trey are way overreliant on metatextual responses to fan feedback its like every time they feel criticized they have to make a snide thinly veiled metatextual story where they come across as bitter at the fan reactions the most obvious one is randys specials

and i know they hate family guy but i think that show uses cleverer more succinct forms of metahumor to respond to fan feedback instead of dragging it out like south park",2023-07-12
i believe my interpretation is that policeman dying is separate from tragic personal loss and just happens to sometimes be tragic personal loss so her dad was a policeman and his dad is a policeman so that wasn’t necessarily the tragic personal loss that’s just a canon bonus haha,2023-06-25
i believe so yeah its been a few weeks since i saw it but im pretty sure that was one of the little glimpses,2023-06-27
"peter b parker arrives home at the end of beyond the spiderverse

paul hey

peter b mother fu",2023-06-04
still cant get over the fact that they created a character out of thin air just to keep peter from getting together with mj,2023-06-05
did you not watch the movie they literally had a daughter together,2023-06-05
"reread the start of my comment

one of the biggest criticisms of the spiderman comics in recent years

emphasis on the last three words 

for the longest time peter did get to have a lot of character development and natural progression through different stages of his life high school college getting married with mj etc which opened the door for a lot of new and interesting storiesconflicts to be told its one of the reasons why the initial run of ultimate spiderman is so popular  even if its not perfect it allowed peter parker and his supporting cast to grow and develop in a manner that was organic and satisfying

the issue is that after one more day marvel has almost been afraid to let peter have any of that progression   one of the main reasons one more day is so hated is because of how it undid decades of storytelling and development to effectively reset peters life and relationships back to square one in the decade and a half since then not only have they not really made any progress in undoing the damage done by that story but it almost feels like theyre going out of their way to keep that from happening glares at paul",2023-06-04
go away paul,2023-06-04
i legit thought that the intro was so long like took forever before miles goes into spider lair and another while before he starts getting beef with miguel before i knew the movie was over…,2023-06-11
i was wondering why the colors looked so different but i just thought to myself maybe the world looks like this because its night time and miles is in a hurry or something that was nicely done,2023-06-02
also because you could see that the machine said earth42 when it scanned his dna,2023-06-02
i thought it was just miles emotions until the pin dropped for me when gwen couldnt find miles in his room,2023-06-02
"yeah earth 42 had those greens and purples going on which did make me suspicious 

it was a great twist though",2023-06-02
"yeah i was like “huh the rain looks different in this than usual” when he immediately lands there but i was like “hmmm maybe i’m just getting mixed up cuz we’ve been in so many universes i’ve forgotten what his normal universe is like”

sure enough…",2023-06-02
"you could see the earth42 when he was scanned

also the little details in his room there wasnt any art claw schematics and the jacket he puts on his purple and green",2023-06-02
"also his mom had different color eyes in u42 green 

they were very noticeable gold in miles real universe the same color as his own",2023-06-02
i do wonder if the characters themselves are aware of the different art styles if they are i really wanna see don glovers reaction to being captured by cartoons ,2023-06-02
they did what i wanted quantiumania to do at the end you could just feel something was off,2023-06-02
its just a matter of paying attention at the beginning of the movie it is stated that miles earth was 160 something while when he was in the machine it said earth 42 the earth from the spider that bit him,2023-06-02
it wasn’t a twist if you noticed the machine read earth 42 before sending him i was waiting for miles to figure it out,2023-06-02
another tell is the mom being surprised that mikes changed his hair,2023-06-02
i also saw the 42 on the screen before he teleported that was a pretty big hint,2023-06-02
i know right i knew that he was in the wrong dimension just by looking how different the color of the background is but the plot twist still made me want to watch beyond the spiderverse,2023-06-02
at first i thought it was the noir universe but then the color signified no and i was able to piece it together after that,2023-06-02
"what did you do to your hair

should have seen it a mile away lol that last 5 minutes surprised me a few times in a row",2023-06-04
earth 42 reminded me a lot of bladerunner the original and well… 2042,2023-06-02
earth 42 prowler made me remember the ending of spidermen,2023-06-02
"when he was talking and gwen was standing in his empty room i was like oh  no no no

such a good scene  the whole movie was beautiful",2023-06-03
mama had big green eyes,2023-06-04
it showed that it was sending him to 42 very clearly on the screen too although i cant blame anyone for missing that in the moment,2023-06-05
i’ve seen too many movies and the set up for this was blatantly obvious to me but i’m glad it landed for most people,2023-06-02
i didnt catch that i did notice as soon as miles 42 mom opened the door that his jacket had the color scheme and pattern that reminded a lot to the prowler,2023-06-02
great silence of the lambs cutting with miles and gwen too,2023-06-02
at first i had no clue they were showing clips of miles universe raining and it looked the same as earth 42 however when miles started speaking to his mom it was off her eyes had this lifeless drab green look in her eye and then her reaction to saying who was spiderman was the instant realization that he was in the wrong universe for me,2023-06-02
"bro i thought it was lowkey just raining when he got back thats why it was all dark and gloom  


nope",2023-06-02
they did show us it was going to happen kind of at least we saw what universe he was going to and we knew 42 wasnt his but it was subtle like a lot of this movie,2023-06-02
what got me was the moms eyes i was like “have her eyes always been green that’s weird” then it hit me,2023-06-02
i noticed because of that so great,2023-06-03
for me its when the mom said comic con because miles doesnt know about comic con in his universe,2023-06-03
it did gradually transition to be fair  the art style was quite close to miless verse for the first few scenes and gradually changed,2023-06-03
when he was talking to his mom i was wondering what room they were in cuz his childhood room or his school room are rectangles and that room was more round i thought they were just in another part of the house,2023-06-03
i think his moms eyes were also green in it,2023-06-04
his mom had green eyes i was immediately like nope nope nope lol,2023-06-05
"when i heard the sinister music i was like wait something’s wrong what’s wrong is there a villain nearby is there somehow a villain mimicking her 

oh… that’s not his og mom…",2023-06-05
i almost leaned over in the theatre to whisper to my girlfriend “why is the framerate different here” but then i thought nah i must be seeing things nope i was right,2023-06-14
"i absolutely noticed the world looked different but i put it down to the multiverse collapsing 
and i already thought the universe had started collapsing due to the melting colours in gwens scene with her dad

apparently the multiverse isn’t collapsing at all just yet so the twist got me good

i wonder if that was what the makers were aiming for",2023-06-18
since the third film is called beyond the spiderverse im guessing thats an apt description for whats gonna come next i mean the world miles was left in didnt have a spider man so thats technically beyond the spider verse,2023-06-02
imo they should have kept the part numbers for audience members who don’t follow movie newswatch the first trailer,2023-06-02
i think i remember reading how movies are trying to not label anything part 12 dune avoided part 1 in all the marketing and you only see it in the credits they supposedly did this because of all the mediocre releases of part 12 movies following the success of harry potter splitting the last book into 12 for the movies,2023-06-04
im kinda glad they didnt feel like the end would be less shocking,2023-06-02
any reason why they dropped it do part 1 2 labels do worse for movies in the box office felt like this wasn’t an infinity war endgame type where they didn’t need part 1 and 2,2023-06-03
should have kept the part 1 and part 2 so i knew what to expect just makes you feel duped if you didnt know,2023-06-11
"i dont understand how ppl didnt know this haha

it was common knowledge from the get go

ah wells 3",2023-06-02
my poor girlfriend had to  so bad so she went and peed right after the prowler was revealed to be miles as she thought there was going to be one last battle about to happen and thought she had enough time to go then like a minute or two after she got back the movie ended and she was so annoyed,2023-06-02
i didnt know and laughed when i saw to be continued it kinda made it better for me,2023-06-02
ive started purposefully dehydrating myself before movies at this point which has helped,2023-06-05
literally me,2023-06-02
"i heard a lot of groaning and gasps but i don’t think it was negative my theater applauded i think most people just didn’t see curtains coming whatsoever even though it made sense 

some girl around ten yelled “whaat nooooooo” behind me i turn around and saw her look of shocked disappointment turn into exhilaration as she joined the applause i think i witnessed a magical moment a young girl falling in love with film or at least realizing that art could be pretty special what a great  movie",2023-06-11
my eyes were so glued to the screen that i saw 42 on the monitor of the machine and knew what was happening before he even entered that universe not trying to brag that im some gigabrain filmgoer  i wouldnt say im typically great at this sort of thing,2023-06-05
it was also telegraphed by the fact that they literally showed a shot of the screen saying he was being sent to earth 42,2023-06-05
i was very very upset and wish i knew that it was very much a part one but i think its something that  me off in the moment but ill get over it with time and enjoy the movie just as much,2023-06-05
even dune felt like it had more of a conclusion than spiderverse,2023-06-07
"i dont get the whole idea of getting mad at a cliffhanger it seems to really be a trend in the social media era 

i rather have a good story over 2 films then a rushed ending squeezed into one",2023-06-11
now instead people are mad after the movie bold move cotton,2023-06-03
more matrix reloaded,2023-06-02
not everyone even die hard fans keep up with the news i didn’t even watch a trailer for this movie i had full faith from the announcement,2023-06-02
nope not what i was talking about i meant more that it was building towards this big team up only for the movie to abruptly end,2023-06-02
i noticed but you cant blame someone for missing that shot with so much happening on screen at all times,2023-06-05
earth 42 parker could be evil if he didnt become spiderman like gwens peter became the lizard,2023-06-02
i’m betting ceo of alchemax,2023-06-02
i doubt a peter parkerled oscorp would have let the city fall to that state it seemed to be in a state of war,2023-06-03
"norman osborn is president in the comics earth42 edit sorry 138 me got confuzzled  hes using a combo of the thunderbolts and venomised copsarmy to keep control the symbiote having been reduced to variable engagement neurosensitive organic mesh  presumably the avengers have been removed as theres only spiderpunk captain anarchy and a few other street level heroes left fighting normie

it was a great 8 page story in spiderverse 002 2015 written by jed mackay and drawn in fourcolour billposter style by sheldon vella ",2023-06-05
i would pay money to see thisoh wait im gonna pay money to see the next one anyways ,2023-06-04
and is going to give gwen closure guarantee it,2023-06-04
its not a goober its a gizmo,2023-06-04
 please let this happen,2023-06-16
"i reckon earth42 was never meant to have a spiderman or not yet it’s why it hasn’t collapsed in on itself the spider was supposed to go to miles’ world and peter b parker was a canon event for miles

 if it wasn’t miles’ world would have collapsed 

miguel is either ignoring the “rules” of the films on purpose because he is shady or he’s too obsessed with keeping control that he blinds himself with rage when he encounters what he considers an “anomaly”

also if you want to preserve the  multiverse why create an agency that  with the multiverse the only worldending  we see is because of him or his company’s bracelets i’m betting miguel is the anomaly that is tearing the worlds at their seams 

if anything miles was a reverseanomaly to stop him and coursecorrect the multiverse",2023-06-11
maybe miguel wouldn’t be able to find the correct person it’s not always peter parker in fact peter parker sometimes ends up dead i also think part of canon is that a spider bite leads to powers or something unexpected  out of the spider person’s control i think miguel pulling some divine intervention would break things,2023-06-04
spiderman is harry would be cool,2023-06-02
the earth 42 spider is gone though,2023-06-02
the spider is gone from that universe because it went to miles universe and bit him,2023-06-04
right spiderman doesnt exist but theres still probably a peter parker out there somewhere who while not having spider powers is still a science genius,2023-06-02
i should have been clear i know that that’s why i was asking i mean maybe because it’s from a different earth but he didn’t sound the same,2023-06-02
i should have been clear i know that that’s why i was asking i mean maybe because it’s from a different earth but he didn’t sound the same,2023-06-02
yeah maybe because it’s supposed to different versions of the characters,2023-06-02
had the whole theatre laughing,2023-06-02
is he wrong tho,2023-06-15
hobie really said “you’re him miles don’t let anyone tell you otherwise”,2023-06-02
he also said make your own watch then followed through made one and got it to gwen,2023-06-02
sometimes the best mentors come from unlikely places,2023-06-02
whats also great about how hes handled is that prior to the release of the movie there was speculation that there was going to be a love triangle between him gwen and miles and the movie does seem to be going that way initially when she drops his name and miles gets a bit jealous then hes ultimately introduced by bursting through the barrier that miles is trying to break but it never actually goes there hes looking out for gwen just as hes trying to look out for miles,2023-06-02
"that part got me to yell out in the theater

x200b

when miles is getting trapped in the force field thing spider punk shows his palms to miles to remind him to use his palms to break out 

x200b

i yelled

x200b

i dont think ive ever yelled in a movie before

x200b

this movie is amazing",2023-06-04
"in my opinion that was the best piece of visual storytelling in a movie full to the brim of beautiful visuals

somehow both subtle and obvious",2023-06-05
when he said palms i changed my mind about him,2023-06-11
is this the first time he actually played a british person in an american production,2023-06-02
"they keep getting some of the heaviest hitters to voice characters in these movies man its so cool 

like mahershala playing uncle aaron was always wild to me and such a good performance",2023-06-02
how can you be cooler with your mask off,2023-06-03
i thought he sounded familiar but when those credits came up i was like oooohhhhh of course,2023-06-02
considering that he can do a great american accent too my headcanon was that he was the prowler before aaron davis in miless world but probably got killed by the kingpin like aaron,2023-06-03
man like miles,2023-06-03
"daniel kaluuya

 thats why he sounded oddly familiar",2023-06-04
i salute you,2023-06-04
kids an anarchist,2023-06-05
"his visuals alone took 3 years

and it looked spectacular ",2023-06-02
"him and pavitr as a brown person karan soni as pavitr really stole the show for me  absolute perfect casting hes the desi superhero representation that i didnt know i needed until now lol i was laughing so hard over the chai stuff 

seriously though stop calling it chai tea ",2023-06-02
i thought id hate him but now im embarrassed about that,2023-06-02
i just read they were considering cutting him until daniel kaluuya did his voice,2023-09-03
and her toothbrush is there too my days of living would be over,2023-06-02
oh yeah i would be devastated the worst part is he’s that kind of cool where you can’t even dislike the guy he’s just so easily the most interesting guy in the room,2023-06-02
lol yeah when i saw him i was thinking about that for miles like that meme you vs the spiderman she tells you not to worry about,2023-06-02
,2023-06-02
ohhhh my heart for miles hurt every time she mentioned spending time with him and sleeping at his place,2023-06-02
i was waiting for the reveal he was  black  anarchist punk fighting the man in britain lines up perfectly,2023-06-04
when that was hinted i was kinda grossed out isnt gwen a teenager and hobie like 30,2023-06-03
isnt spiderpunk ,2023-06-02
hopefully they clear that up cos i dont want my boi miles to get cucked,2023-06-02
hes a good time not a longtime type of guy,2023-06-03
absolutely hes easily the coolest and there are a lot of super cool characters in this movie,2023-06-07
gwen was getting passed around by all of the spidermen they all knew her when they went back to to miguel’s world ,2023-06-28
i really liked that you could tell he was the first one to start calling  on miguel and the whole spidercity thing and he came through in the end,2023-06-02
in his own universe youre out norman as president,2023-06-02
crawls the crawl,2023-06-02
he was so amazing i got a mancrush on spider punk,2023-06-02
"i mean it comes with living in a literal fascist universe that youre rebelling against so hes antiauthoritarian to the smallest things

i really liked how he was essentially a catalyst behind several things namely hinting at miles on how to use his electricity hand thing better and dropping off his dimensional watch to gwen if itll cause chaos  do it",2023-06-02
he is determined to his own cause and belief just like the other spideys,2023-06-02
hobie more like brobie,2023-06-03
"i thought the same 

in spain we got the punk truck driver a really famous person and he is full authoritarian support of the governament against any antiestablishment people he wears like a punk talk like it and he has been seen with a fascist politian eating at the restaurant i was worried this spiderpunk will be the same pure talk but in the end he is just establishment but no he delivered",2023-06-14
its a cool character designed to be likeable the opposite that miguel that represents authoritarianism this is why hobart helps miles and gwen to challenge authority but this is not something all good or i hope the message wont be that xd because anarchy doesnt end quite well most of the times,2023-06-16
i thought  more chill and laid back but guess not lol also guess movie removed miguel mind reading ability miles electric ability seems more op also miguel using his upgraded suit and he seems more weaker because he started a new life with family if u read comic he not suppose that nice lol,2023-06-02
well  hes even more punk than me,2023-06-03
for the record i quit,2023-06-11
casually takes down the entire system from inside,2023-06-15
and then he came back,2023-06-02
it makes sense he wouldnt want to be caught with all those parts around,2023-06-03
with a bit of jacob and a mix of dani because he’s a punk from dead island 2,2023-06-02
the sound mixing is quite muddy tbf,2023-06-02
yea i wish they had subtitles ,2023-06-04
"went from super excited that the band cerebral ballzy was playing during his intro to a little disappointed that i could not understand a word that came out of his mouth i dont even blame his accent though the sound mixing definitely played a part in it too 

still liked his impact on the story",2023-06-11
as a guy with indian heritage i appreciated all of that dialogue chai  tea naan  bread had my friends and i in stitches,2023-06-04
ironic from an american but we,2023-08-26
it was pretty hard to understand most of what he was saying to me imax,2023-06-02
"punk  noir having a buddy cop movie would be great

the bad guy can be andrew garfield",2023-06-03
literally everyone would love to have an actual spiderman flick centered around a punk rock anarchist actually combatting some 1984esque regime with that sort of flair,2023-06-03
theres a throwaway joke that hobie was the one who caught the donald glover prowler,2023-06-07
meh its the same as how we havent actually met a curt connors lizard in this franchise only a peter parker one,2023-06-04
youre full of   the  is a classic anarchist anyway,2023-06-07
you dont have  with anarchist vibes to enjoy the character im a centreleft liberal and believe greatly in institutions but that doesnt mean i couldnt enjoy his character,2023-06-12
any selfrespecting anarchist despises the stalinist regimes of eastern europe so no he wouldnt change his mind he wouldnt need to,2023-06-04
not remotely ,2023-09-26
ya bruh as someone who’s been in a similar position as miles before that but was too real,2023-06-02
gwen was effective homeless at the time though which changes it just a little for me,2023-06-08
where was it shown that gwen had a toothbrush and left cardigans in hobies dimension,2023-06-02
honestly i dont know how gwen comes back from the betrayal at the end i hope miles and gwen end up together but i dont expect miles to like her in the 3rd movie,2023-06-02
miles had a moment with spider byte so they can be a possible pair in the future,2023-06-11
to be fair qwen is homeless ,2023-06-09
also borrowing shoes,2023-06-03
wanted to dislike him for unintentionally ruining miles game but the dude was awesome,2023-06-26
true but tbf hobie would have chemistry with a door nail,2023-06-02
it seemed like to me hobbie was immediately drawn to looking out for him like a little homie type way,2023-06-02
“i can do both ”,2023-06-02
"when he was struggling to tell his parents he was spiderman it made me think of someone struggling to come out of the closet

i half expected his mom to say i thought you were gonna say you were  and then the whos spider man came out instead",2023-06-02
"sony spiderman must not be homosexual

sony pictures animation okay",2023-06-04
tbf hobie in the comics is  so enjoy man,2023-06-02
"i already thought miles was bi because of something i read waaayyy back when he first debuted so i was sitting through this movie wondering if they would have the guts to reveal miles as bi

i also thought it would be funny if gwen hobie and miles became a thruple who went about tearing down the establishment in their further adventures",2023-06-05
"because since the moment theyre introduced hobie treats miles with admiration and respect instead of a rival or someone that he needs to undermine 

the first he does is gives myles advice then during the rest of their adventure in mumbathan hes following myles lead he congratulates him when he saves the captain and so on myles is experiencing the same we do as the audience in regards to hobie",2023-06-20
i honestly think he realized that basically hobie is a cool guy its hard to be mad at or jealous of someone you respect and who respects you back equally,2023-07-01
yep nothing more punk than breaking the canon,2023-06-04
same here sucks that the movie is that way but i’m glad i’m not going crazy lol,2023-06-02
"i did do that they said it was an issue with the audio mix and theres nothing they could do 


ill see it again in a few weeks at a different cinema presumably when the issue is fixed lol",2023-06-02
saaaame,2023-06-02
yup,2023-06-03
no i’m in texas usa,2023-06-02
i saw it at the palladium imax in san antonio tx and i dont recall having any dialogue issues whatsoever id be interested to find out if an experienced projectionist saved our butts by adjusting things beforehand,2023-06-02
i’m from the uk and still had this issue which was a bit of a shame,2023-06-02
my theaters in michigan but i will admit i had no idea what some of the characters were saying for some scenes the only problem i had with this movie especially during gwens opening monologue and spiderpunks intro it felt like the actors were talking 20 feet away from me or had muffled their voices because the music wasnt really mixing that well it gave me tenet flashbacks lol,2023-06-03
had the same experience at my theatre in missouri,2023-06-04
happened in nh too,2023-06-02
i’m in melbourne australia and our sound mixing was also off missed so much dialogue,2023-06-02
same in europe,2023-06-02
i saw the movie in germany and had the same issue during the initial monologue i thought i was watching the movie on my television,2023-06-02
my theatres in the uk and it was also balanced oddly,2023-06-02
i saw it at the imax in quebec city same issue,2023-06-03
my amc theater in tennessee had the same thing,2023-06-03
my theatre is in montréal and the audio was great maybe they’ve fixed it or maybe we just went to different montréal theatres ,2023-06-04
same its as if they didnt turn on the dolby sound for this movie,2023-06-02
i also watched in dolby and felt like i had no issues hearing people at all except for one line that i can’t remember anyway the metaphor for capitalism took my brain a second to process before i laughed but no one else did so it’s totally possible i was just ignoring any sound issues because i was personally blown away by the soundtrack and general audio,2023-06-02
i think that was just spiderpunk miles could barely understand him either,2023-06-02
same and saw it in europe i dont even remmeber if there were subtitles but sound was  low then boom then low very nolan,2023-06-02
yeah my theater was fine for the middle chunk of the movie but the first 1520 minutes and the last 1520 minutes was bad,2023-06-05
the main issues are that 775 is really loud and that the mix itself isnt great with the centre speakers which are usually reserved for dialogue being too low in the mix if you turn everything up then it doesnt make it any clearer sure you might hear the dialogue more but the rest will be painfully loud,2023-06-03
yes so much echo,2023-06-02
rosedale amc same disappointed,2023-06-06
i saw it in imax and had the same issue unfortunately,2023-06-02
bro called her bad but you turned into shakespeare that’s real love,2023-06-04
shes a lucky one too in her own words look at those shoulders ,2023-06-03
would be funny if you started clapping and see who else will get the rest of the audience,2023-06-04
right,2023-06-05
it eventually gets all of us,2023-06-02
it already has he’s an action figure,2023-06-02
dread it run from it capitalism arrives all the same,2023-06-04
crushed to death by money,2023-06-07
taxes is what kills him,2023-06-06
he is totally based off bob vylan and if not it’s a spot on representation,2023-06-02
which is interesting because his daughter is mj,2023-06-02
i actually dont think so because a big part of this was that miles basically saved him from being a part of the tragic spiderman story he essentially saved his innocence i feel like they wont  him,2023-06-03
it’ll deff probably be something based on his vampirism but that’s a lot of story to deal with including prowler miles plus some mention of a sinister 6 cartel  plus the spot  not even going into a potential spiderpeople civil war where some of them defect with drew and others stay loyal to miguel,2023-06-03
it’s pretty interesting that both miles and gwen are anomalies,2023-06-11
no they call him by his name multiple times his name is hobie,2023-06-04
wait really i didnt notice it was the 2nd one thats dope,2023-06-03
that was the 60’s version i think they’re talking about the spiderman from the late 90’s version,2023-06-03
i need the shot of the three spiderfolks in the red rain as my desktop now please,2023-06-02
it was the same with itsv pause the movie at any random frame and you get a sick wallpaper,2023-06-02
this and the first movie really embody the idea that every frame is a painting,2023-06-02
it really does so many amazing shots,2023-06-02
spider miles and prowler miles in that stareoff would make a perfect poster,2023-06-03
they didnt lie 2 years ago when they said their goal was every scene is a wallpaper,2023-06-05
seriously i know it’s a tired saying sometimes but i truly think you could take every frame of this film and hang it up because of how gorgeous it is,2023-06-02
agreed,2023-06-03
first movie where the artbook is just a feature length flip book,2023-06-12
i need need need a poster for when the spot turns into a terrifying villain,2023-06-15
"that shot exactly haha
its just pretty and i love that they are just in the shot but not the focus of the shot",2023-06-02
waiting for the prowler and spiderman shot,2023-06-05
"oooooooo

yup thats the shot im talking about at the end but give us that full 4k render i might grab a screenshot of the video for now to use on my work monitors while we wait for a digital release of the flick",2023-06-02
for real,2023-06-02
i’ve been trying to find this panel,2023-06-04
i whispered this to my partner when it came up id love to have a print of it,2023-06-16
"i think theres a different one  they are to the right of the frame and you can see the whole skyline  


the one you posted is good too though",2023-06-02
and hes miles guy in the chair in insomniacs games,2023-06-02
movie ned is heavily based on comic genke so theres that nice reference too,2023-06-02
"hows the essay coming
its marinating",2023-06-02
as he was sitting in a chair wearing his shoes got a chuckle outta that,2023-06-04
"i feel like they had to emphasize that point after spiderman miles morales clearly had him as the guy in the chair

it was kind of odd after seeing their relationship in the into the spider verse alternate cut  he was a lot more chill in that",2023-06-11
"
then seven years later glover is cast in spiderman homecoming as aaron davis

you missed one detail before this miles morales first on screen appearance cartoon animation was voiced by donald glover thus in a way fulfilling the donald4spiderman campaign",2023-06-02
"this is right except it started from a website called io9 where someone suggested the idea and it got passed on to donald glover who ran with it
 

i remember these pretty small mostly pointless details because im the guy rootadoo who suggested it",2023-06-02
you missed one thing donald glover voiced miles morales in the ultimate spiderman show in 2015,2023-06-02
he technically played miles in the ultimate spiderman cartoon in the storyline of spiderverse,2023-06-03
i probably would have forgot about her but the setting was exactly the same as from the movie she was also in the trailervenom a lot probably where i saw her the most,2023-06-02
yeah personally wasn’t amused by that part i also don’t get why we don’t see a single venom in the entire movie,2023-06-02
same had no idea who she was and had the thought “is this an eeaao reference how’d they get that in so fast”,2023-06-02
how dare you forget the queen,2023-06-02
yeah i couldnt quite grasp who she is but the scene vibe did help remind me she is from venom,2023-06-02
as it was the first live action bit i was so hyped and thought to myself which movie universe was that  i totally forgot about her being in venom too,2023-06-02
"yeah it’s a reward for people like you but with all the other emotional things happening in that scene i had totally forgotten that his universe wasn’t 42

the pin drop worked for me",2023-06-02
" showed it on the computer

not only that when it scans him they show a bunch of cells that looks the same and one spec of a different kind of cell slides by it before the 42 pops up",2023-06-02
yeah i thought it was pretty clear too the movie makes it clear that miles’s universe isn’t 42 in the beginning of the movie not sure why they dragged it out so long,2023-06-02
spurs winning a trophy would absolutely be a canon destroying event,2023-06-03
hes played miles before which is cool,2023-06-03
i read that they used an elephant’s trumpeting sound for it in the previous movie,2023-06-02
into the cakeiverse,2023-06-08
my partner and i were discussing how bold a move it would have been to have miguels plan work successfully imprisoning miles to keep him from saving his dadand then have a canon event disrupted alarm show up anyway because miles wasnt there to experience the needed growth,2023-06-04
he argued that the multiverse was threatened because the things that make the spiderfolks similar paraphrasing were unraveling my argument is that its not the events that make them similar its the lessons they take away,2023-06-04
did you not watch the key and peele sketch it’s basically armor,2023-06-02
still an odd choice to have the hero of the movie sling and slam a heavily pregnant woman into a vehicle during the chase sequence,2023-06-06
nah she had a huge belly when miles webbed her,2023-06-02
we still havent heard about the kid tho i feel like they definitely have to play a role in part 2,2023-06-02
she definitely did  she was very far along many months passed and then she has a much smaller stomach,2023-06-12
i am pretty sure the movie would tell us if she had the baby so i completely disagree,2023-06-09
bro,2023-06-02
calm down satan,2023-06-02
theres still time to delete this,2023-06-02

hey kid it aint that kind of movie  harrison ford,2023-06-04
if spot jerks off every male and female spider hero villain when they where talking to their crush and made them  and moan i know he capable of more than just putting 1 hand in portal because i remember in comics he can do much more,2023-06-02
manton effect,2023-06-02
you definitely watched the new evil dead rise didn’t you,2023-06-02
who hurt you,2023-06-02

get some help my brother in christ,2023-06-10

calm down rodey,2023-06-04
that would be awesome and they should totally do that,2023-06-02
well not anymore,2023-06-12
awww  nah,2023-11-05
not to mention gerry is a dual reference as that was spiderwoman’s son’s name in the mayday spidergirl universe originally,2023-06-04
maybe it’s twins,2023-06-02
even with her mask on it was absurd the emotions that were expressed,2023-06-10
i don’t share the same feeling honestly part one’s conclusion was wrapped up so neatly it was crazy he hugged his dad and made up,2023-06-05
imo gwen’s dad stepping down from being chief was a good decision not a cop out pun intended he changes his own naive perspective and lays down his career in the name of family leading her to realize how deep his love is for her and reconciling that w the also naive image she had drawn him up to be it’s a satisfying arc for each of them that sort of parallels one another having her deal w the inevitable canon event of his death in a sequel would prolly feel redundant if they wanted miles to go thru a similar thing so it was a smart idea to solve that problem in this movie instead of the finale,2023-06-14
i feel like it wouldve been both funny and helpful to give his character subtitles because as someone whos usually good at accents i understood almost nothing he said,2023-06-02
the audio mixing didnt help the beginning with gwen drumming was very hard to hear too,2023-06-03
there was a lot of dialogue that wasn’t coming through well i barely heard some things gwen was saying in the intro scene,2023-06-04
it’s the accent tbf but surprisingly understood him,2023-06-03
yupppp i missed this line,2023-06-05
i’m betting not the bland and generic scifi movie version we ended up with,2023-06-03
i believe its when the hole opens up in mumbattan and thats what he responds with when miles ask what it is,2023-06-02
it was when the black hole showed up towards the end of the mumbattan sequence right before jess drew shows up they look down over the cliff and someone asks what the hole is,2023-06-02
barely anyone laughed at my theater i think the mix was off like others have mentioned,2023-06-02
my theater also missed this line completely,2023-06-03
he says it after miles disrupts the canon event in mumbattan and the universe starts to break down,2023-06-05
peter never died in earth42 hes just a normal guy who was supposed to become spiderman but never did assuming that the spider was supposed to bite peter,2023-06-02
that’ll probably be explained in the next movie with miles’ connection to aaron it’s possible he becomes the prowler even if spiderman exists,2023-06-02
i took it as if he doesnt get bit he becomes prowler in earth42 that spider was meant for him he gets bit gets powers his dad dying is his uncle ben moment but instead its sent to our miles universe so after his dad dies he turns to crime with his uncle its not that he becomes prowler without spiderman he becomes prowler because hes not the spiderman of that universe,2023-06-02
"that part doesn’t make much sense to from miguel’s pov i completely understand how he made that jump but the spider was pulled to his dimension and he didn’t really do anything to cause his peter’s death 

in the end it all falls back to kingpin creating an anomaly to get his family back",2023-06-02
i loved that im a big fan of the first one and though it didnt hurt it at all it did sorta bother me that there would be two spidermen both bit by spiders etc so to explain that miles wasn’t supposed to get bitten and what happened really surprised me towards the end the film just keeps laying on surprises and really grabs you so tight that it’s no wonder my audience went  when it suddenly ended,2023-06-02
there wasnt a spiderman because spider 42 was brought to earth1610,2023-06-03
well actually there is a scene for a brief second where the spider was approaching universe 42 miles,2023-06-03
miles becomes the prowler because he doesnt become spiderman not because there isnt a spiderman at all since the spider left his universe peter is just a normal guy in earth42,2023-06-02
our theory is that earth42 miles was supposed to be bitten but since he didnt he became the prowler,2023-06-03
what if miles dad was suppose be spiderman in 42 which would explain why miguel is infuriated lol because he technically got 2 spiderman killed,2023-06-02
its the bendis miles his aaron is a  prowler miles was supposed to be spiderman,2023-06-03
phenomenal job moving from a joke to legitimately terrifying,2023-06-02
"all interesting points in our miles universe his uncle aaron was a good guy who made some bad decisions could it be that in the 42 universe their miles was encouraged into vigilantism as opposed to his dads law and order

great setup for a third film",2023-06-02
i suspect that the solution to everything glitching is for prowler miles to eventually become the spiderman of his universe,2023-06-03
the first thing he did when he met miles was throw something at him instant dislike,2023-06-03
"i think thats the point hes trying to make though he already walked the path that miles seems to be walking and he knows the huge consequences that doing so have

sure we might get a plot twist later that because miles himself is an anomaly hes not bounded by canon events but i dont think anyone would want to gamble an entire universe for that specially if you arent seeing the big picture like the audience is",2023-06-03

i cant believe i had to scroll down this much to find someone else do this connection,2023-06-05
maybe they’ll just shoot the  and get brunch,2023-06-04
i remember thinking wow feels like a lot has happened so far i really hope the ending isnt rushed to keep it around 2 hours then the title car came and i was just thinking you ,2023-06-12
its possible to make a part 1 that is satisfying in its own right they just didnt,2023-06-05
it was not widely publicized i think after its initial announcement they stopped mentioning it,2023-06-02
i dunno it was 5 years between the first and second movies i think youll be waiting a bit longer than a year,2023-06-02
you think or you know,2023-06-03
"ending on a cliffhanger is when a movie has a start middle and end then some reveal happens or some big event and it ends

not when the movie ends before the climax happens",2023-06-03
this isnt a full story though this felt like the whole movie was act 1 and a little bit of act 2 of a wider narrative,2023-06-03
"this is no where on empire’s level empire had a concise and logical beginning middle and end it had a climactic battle and an emotional payoff 

here they literally just cut the climax of the movie off to force us to buy another ticket",2023-06-05
they literally cut midscene like it was an episode of tv or a comic book difference being neither of those makes you wait a year between episodes,2023-06-05
is this your first time watching a movie  lol,2023-06-04
it was even announced as a part 1 because it is such a part 1,2023-06-02
they could call it mayday mayday,2023-06-02
highly doubt this they didnt even have john mulaney record any new lines for the movie,2023-06-04
elemental got a rotten score on rt so probably even audience scores might not be that good ig,2023-06-02
miyazaki is dropping his movie this year,2023-06-02
elemental already has mixed reviews no way is that movie beating spider man,2023-06-02
"when it won best animated i think that was the first time a disney movie didnt win in like 5 years since 2007 only 3 nondisney have won 

i want it to win this year but its gonna have to go up against mario which it will beat elemental trolls wish and ninja turtles",2023-06-02
"this movie is too technically innovative not to win it’s just so interesting to look at even more so than the first one

eta someone pointed out that miyazaki is putting out a movie this year so maybe not but if not what a year",2023-06-04
man after seeing spiderverse i kinda feel sorry for pixar sony straight up upended the entire medium of animation and theyre making the same ed nonsense weve been watching for a full decade plus at this point,2023-06-04
dont sleep on the turtles now,2023-06-02
elementals will have to have cosmic tier writing for them to win because the visuals we’ve seen are basic disney cookie cutter,2023-06-02
i’m convinced that elemental is just a psyop to make people who see the trailer think “wow i should rewatch atla” and ya know what it works,2023-06-05
this beats all movies animated and live action of the last few years tbh,2023-06-02
this was so good that im hoping sony tries to launch a for your consideration campaign for best picture itd be nice to see an animated film get nominated for the big award again especially after the beating the animation industry has taken the past few years,2023-06-03
ninja turtles could be really good,2023-06-03
elemental is getting mid reviews well see how wish turns out,2023-06-02
elemental is going to be a flop spiderverse should clean house in animation awards,2023-06-02
it will absolutely be a slap in the face if this movie doesn’t win best animation the level of details and how everything made complete sense with their ideas for the emotions scenery etc it was amazing,2023-06-03
elemental does not look good based on the trailer before spiderverse,2023-06-04
“inside out” took the statue over “anomalisa” so yah the academy sometimes doesn’t actually watch the best movie,2023-06-02
chin up big guy so we aint making casablanca,2023-06-03
elemental did get a standing ovation at cannes  so we’ll see  it does seem pretty pixar formulaic,2023-06-05
when i saw the trailer for elemental my reaction was oh theyve deliberately put something rather mediocre against across the spider verse rather than something theyre proud of because they know they wont win either way,2023-06-03
what makes you think we should trust the academy any more than we did 5 years ago,2023-06-02
standards for movies really took a nosedive if a movie with no ending wins a prestigious award for movies… great movie but not award winning not without an ending,2023-06-09
"this will absolutely win best animated picture 

i dont know baby sharks big movie is getting a lot of oscar buzz",2023-06-05
,2023-06-17
this should be nominated for best picture,2023-06-21
in all honesty this movie should be nominated for “best picture” too,2023-08-26
it’s been a solid year for films so far guardians 3 jw4 and now this,2023-06-02
pretty close behind suzume for me,2023-06-03
this along with air for me personally,2023-06-02
right behind john wick chapter iv for me easily one of my favorites,2023-06-02
it is definitely the best film so far and i doubt anything will top it it was  amazing,2023-06-02
it’s my 1 easily beating out guardians 3 and suzume i liked it better than the first and i rewatched the first recently,2023-06-25
right i expected the same a decent enough sequel that would entertain but not be as impactful as the first kind of a infinity war  endgame kind of thing glad i was mistaken,2023-06-02
the dd movie was a fun time but doesn’t belong in the discussion with those other two,2023-06-03
did you see  in boots i think that wins this year,2023-06-02
i thought suzume was better than weathering with you but not near as great as your name  probably should get nominated but nowhere near the win  i actually think it would have been a better miniseries,2023-06-05
well  in boots came out in 2022 so i dont think itll be getting nominated,2023-06-04
there are more movies out there than just comic book movies,2023-06-02
 gotta disagree gotg 3 doesnt even sniff this movie to me spiderverse speaks to real life in a way that guardians cant plus the depth of story the script the art the attention to a detail incredible,2023-06-02
atsv was 10x better than guardians 3,2023-06-03
the lego movie was eligible it just wasnt nominated which i really dont understand,2023-06-03
marcel the shell was nominated so yes,2023-06-02
killers of the flower moon too,2023-06-03
i loved the movie but you guys are insane ,2023-06-02
thats a 2022 movie,2023-06-02
less than half a plot it sounds like there was a ton you missed id recommend going to see it again,2023-06-02
it honestly may be the best movie of all time there’s never been so much cinema in a movie,2023-06-02
i’m tired so tired,2023-06-02
someone clearly hasnt seen beau is afraid,2023-06-02
oh nah i meant it was mentioned in an article that there was meant to be a love triangle i went in assuming it but i really didnt even see it outside of the jumper comment tbh hobie had better romantic chemistry with miles than gwen,2023-06-03
"yeah he seemed more of a mate looking out for someone who needs a place to stay miles getting jealous of the older cooler guy is something all teenage boys probably do at some point lol 

plus he seemed a lot older and gwen is like miles age so that would just be creepy",2023-06-11
i guess its either that or tom holland spidey is being saved for beyond,2023-06-03
i mean miguel straightup references no way home by mentioning him and dr strange so his existence is definitely known about,2023-06-04
probs marvel gatekeeping him,2023-06-03
yeah he wasn’t onscreen but he was mentioned in the “doctor strange and the little nerd” comment at least,2023-06-04
no he was there in the scene where they show a bunch of different spidermen there is a part where it shows toms face when he is either about to try and  goblin or afterward,2023-06-03
"i found that every interesting after the events of no way home almost like even the spider society has no idea what the identity of that spiderman is anymore  

oh thats very good you should put that on tvtropes somewhere",2023-06-04
" almost like even the spider society has no idea what the identity of that spiderman is anymore

miguel calls him that skinny nerd so that hints that the spell was multiversal

they still know he is a spiderman they just dont know his real identity is peter parker",2023-06-12
they did reference him though,2023-06-04
but they do reference him miguel says a phrase like “don’t get me started on dr strange and the spiderman from earth 199999 that’s a direct reference to the no way home events,2023-06-14
" almost like even the spider society has no idea what the identity of that spiderman is anymore

really good point i hadnt imagined until you put it into words but it makes a lot of sense with how interconnected everything spiderx related is getting",2023-06-13
same,2023-06-04
he doesn’t believe in consistency,2023-06-03
vin diesel did someone say family ,2023-06-06
shes amazing in everything true grit was insane for her age,2023-06-06
i really need to watch arcane when watching this film i completely forgot that i was listening to bumblebees charlie,2023-06-27
i love that its a reference to gwen dying but miles probably just interprets it as usual breakup stuff,2023-06-02
her delivery is just so good her saying ‘i can’t loose one more friend’ will break my heart every time,2023-06-02
imagine finding out that in every other universe where you’re significant in any way you straight up die for someone else’s character development that’d  you up,2023-06-09
nope but it absolutely needs to happen now because of this movie though,2023-06-02
oh  i didnt even clock that she looked much happier in the first film,2023-06-03
that girl went through an entire mecha anime’s worth of character development at some point ouch,2023-06-09
"it would make sense and actually address something kind of weird about the first movie

in into the spider verse a big deal is made about pennys robot being destroyed it wasnt really set up beforehand or explained afterwards but theres a heavy emotional beat of penny grieving the destroyed mech suit before leaving

in beyond the spider verse shes the only one of the gag spiderpeople who signed up with miguel and i think its because of the trauma of losing the robot her best friend spider ham and noir didnt experience that loss like that

i think in beyond the spider verse shell serve as a sort of point of view character for an average spider person struggling with the fallout of canon events and how miguels spidersociety and theories appealed to her and by extension to other spider people there is comfort in knowing your suffering isnt pointless it is necessary and unavoidable 

penny would be a great character to anchor this perspective in as someone we know from the first movie and saw that point in her spider journey",2023-06-09
man i hope so it’d be a shame if that awesome redesign just went to waste,2023-06-03
"	gainaxing

lol yes that exactly what it was",2023-06-08
i preferred the soundtrack of the first and i think its better just by being a complete film still excited for 3 and if it sticks the landing i might end up preferring 23 more,2023-06-02
i think you’re right in i agree with you in that i think itsv is a stronger film that can stand on its own but i also think we won’t be able to fully appreciate this movie until we see the conclusion in btsv i wonder if this is the same feeling people had when coming out of empire strikes back,2023-06-03
agree and i feel i can’t complete my commentary on 2 until i see 3,2023-06-12
"what 

probably the 3 second quip when miles getting chased",2023-06-02
"i think the one that played when miles had his headphones on stood out to me not sure what was the name though

but i agree the first film opening with sunflower and swae lee’s voice being kind of similar to miles was just iconic",2023-06-04
"probs you sorry haha

spiderverse 1 ost was a bangerr 

rip to all the artist who passed away on that tape

like its so sad

but respect for them being apart of the ost",2023-06-02
 even though your option is valid i dont think youre right i still jam to most songs from the first album to this day theres a reason why most of the songs on that album has over a billion plays on spotify alone,2023-06-08
"fr 

im sure they gona go 33 on the next one

i believe",2023-06-02
for me it was the james blake song before gwen comes to visit him,2023-06-02

yaaas,2023-06-02
emma stone spidergwen ,2023-06-02
except is he in this movie almost all peters agreed with miguel about letting someone die if its preordained but in nwh peter refuses it he tries to save everyone which funnily enough brings about his canon event with may,2023-06-02
"to be honest i kinda wanna see miguel interacting with tom holland spiderman now

just to be so  exasperated about everything tenfold",2023-06-02
respectfully disagree i dont think its discredits any iteration of spidey and you could argue the whole canon event of it all is a metacommentary on marvel editorial or what fans expect from a spidey even miguel discrediting miles on the train could be seen as fan outrage from when he was first announced and the  arguments nowadays of him not being spiderman,2023-06-02
"i think what this trilogy spiderverse is doing with miles might actually make him my standout spiderman more than any other right now two absolutely phenomenal movies and his character development has been nothing short of exceptional

speaking of cameos can we get miles morales from the playstation games in the next film as well would be so cool for miles to meet yet another version of him",2023-06-02
"tbh it kinda shows how spiderman tom’s peter is

not only does he refuse to let a single villain die but he solves the problem without the spidersociety’s intervention",2023-06-02
also the whole canon plot with certain events needing to happen on the topic of uncle ben for the 1000th time its clear that uncle ben is the catalyst for peter becoming spiderman in every universe that has the usual peter parker in an average world but time and time again throughout mcu spidermans life its quite clear that uncle ben just wasnt a presence in that variants life would that make mcu spiderman an anomaly then,2023-06-02
its kind of amusing that the mcu has so many captains but it seems peters captain there is either tony or may,2023-06-04
hes the spiderman from the sacred timeline also he and strange apparently made the intrusion problems worse so he does have a prominent role to play,2023-06-05
i am so happy theyre calling the mcu that instead of repeating 616 like it seemed to be their original plan,2023-06-02
he does when referring to dr strange,2023-06-02
"it has absolutely nothing to do with these movies im 100 sure but that line made me think of this 

yes thats the archer guy in a carton from the 90s",2023-11-18
yeah its fine for cameolittle moments but even as magic as the production team is itd look way too strange in action or extended scenes,2023-06-02
glad i’m not the only one who thought the live action cameos felt and looked so unnatural,2023-06-02
im with you there it was so unbelievably corny and offputting which is saying something for a film that flirts with a dozen different art styles and even fps switches,2023-06-02
same i don’t want any crossover between spiderverse and mcu mcu is more baggage than it’s worth at this point spiderverse is straightup better than even the best mcu movies keep it its own thing,2023-06-04
idk i was fine with it who framed roger rabbit was a thing after all it just gotta be pulled off right,2023-06-04
id love if they pulled a who framed roger rabbit with the cameos,2023-06-07
tom holland being animated might work better,2023-06-03
all the cameos felt really hamfisted to me like sony was trying to advertise literally all of their properties,2023-06-04
"the comics will go on forever though 

if we dont get something we like today maybe well get something we like tomorrow",2023-06-02
"im fuzzy on all of the current marvel whatnot is it no way home where everyone forgets tom is spiderman

i just saw quantumania the other day and the other bug guy jokes didnt strike me until just now shouldnt they have forgotten

does whatever multiverse breaking stuff from nwh have any actual impact on future films or was it just oh we fixed it all",2023-06-04
he was even mentioned in the first antman not namedropped tho,2023-06-06
yep sony didnt need it as they own the character as well,2023-06-02
i loved donald glover in that role especially when he won a championship along side lebron james in 2020 good times,2023-06-05
" lover’s prowler

thank you for illustrating the difference one space can make",2023-06-05
was thinking the same on the lookout for more mcu stuff but nada,2023-06-02
if they do that it kinda contradicts this tho we hear that miles is an “anomaly” and wasn’t supposed to be bit so the chances that he also got bit in our mcu universe just doesn’t make much sense,2023-06-02
"the problem there is that shameik moore will be 30 they will need a new actor and as such a new voice  

id almost rather they just start fresh with a new miles",2023-06-05
i think their point more is that atsv is using the same multiverse rules the mcu established,2023-06-02
this is my take too the more mcu connections the film has the worse off the story is,2023-06-02
welp too late for that,2023-08-18
i expected madame web to be like the antimiguel ohara her mystic powers against his tech,2023-06-02
i dont spiderverse has surpassed holland and the mcu i dont want cheap fanservice when they already have so much going for it,2023-06-02
its been established that dc comics exist in the mcu as dc comics,2023-08-18
spiderman was referenced in eternals too,2023-06-02
“spider who”,2023-06-02
no one can confirm because no one actually watched the movie,2023-06-03
i sincerely hope not,2023-06-05
that will be so awesome,2023-08-18
the only real similarity is both universes ended up collapsing on itself if anything miguel sounds like scarlet witch,2023-06-02
best explanation in video form,2023-06-05
marketing was weird im not sure why they wanted to keep the spot a secret so badly if anything showing him off would have been better than spoiling twist villain miguel literally everywhere on the internet including fortnite,2023-06-03
that’s why i use my phone until the light dim and the movie starts i suggest it for when the next trailer drops lol it was really cool to see everything for the first time,2023-06-03
character arc sure but even if it is her movie there still isnt a climax for her so in general this movie is just structured very differently,2023-06-02
" if you view this as gwen’s movie as well

im not sure why anyone wouldnt the movie opens with her she instigates the plot and shes the one who goes through a major character change",2023-06-02
not really because while ahe changes her mind she still hasnt fought a villain to save him or anything no action climax,2023-06-08
thats a good point i think i didnt think about that because you see gwen story basically conclude and then you see how miles is in the wrong universe i think if they swapped the order of doing that it might loosen me effective miles being captured but it would drive home the fact that this was glenns story and the end of her story is the beginning of the next story which its probably her saving miles and then fighting back i think thats my only complaint about the movie though,2023-06-02
i really like this comment if you have time could you explain the false victory and change in status quo for me that you may have found in the movie do you have any predictions on how to tone of the beyond movie will play out,2023-06-16
i think you described how i felt better i even knew this was part 1 but still felt blue balled like this film is just tightening the tension all the way through barely stopping to rest as it keeps introducing new characters places stories and pieces and then it just ends before the tension is released and it just feels abrupt,2023-06-02
i feel like it ended how dune part 1 did wonder if itll become a trend honestly id prefer it if it means the story works better as a whole,2023-06-02
i’m surprised most people here didn’t seem to know it was a part 1 aside from the 3rd movie having been announced at the same time as this the original teaser of this movie was called part 1,2023-06-05
i feel like paying attention to her more when theyre in hq shows her involvementcharacter evolution more its easy to miss with all thats going on tho you also have to read between the lines a bit,2023-06-02
but in a movie with that many moving parts one character arc that only has like 3 or 4 story beats across the whole thing does not equal a satisfying conclusion,2023-06-02
so happy i’m not alone in thinking about dennis movie pitch from iasip when reading that,2023-06-02
i feel like that space elevator chase started only like halfway though the movie though i think thats why a lot of people didnt perceive it as a climax,2023-06-08
you just said what i was trying to say i just couldnt think of how to word it correctly  i totally agree with you though i love seeing animation being taken seriously thats what anime does so well it tends to have much more mature stories while also having a decent amount of content for kids,2023-06-02
"this

you hit it right on the nose",2023-06-03
is this true pixar has been making animated movies with adult themes for three decades,2023-09-29
that suprised me too i know pg movies can have some cussing but i didnt know they were allowed to have as many as there were in this,2023-06-03
please if they really wanted to push some boundaries the scene in spot’s apartment would have been a lot more …,2023-06-09
i loved the way gwens universe was animated especially during the scene near the end between her and her dad that scene was like an moving painting,2023-06-05
if youre referring to what i think you are its because all the spiderman stories are more or less the same and any differences theyll mention later or are seen visually,2023-06-02
i agree with you im just saying its not very common especially in modern hollywood so its nice to see this movie not follow that trend,2023-06-03
"its for comic book manchildren if you want to watch an actual movie the last  in boots is quite good

 in boots has more child humor than this movie did",2023-06-02
it was the opposite in my theatre 90 of the people there were adults i think i only saw 1 or 2 people with kids walk in,2023-06-05
you have a good point thats a better way of saying it,2023-06-15
jesus miles is genuinely stuck in a nightmare version of a universe lmaooo,2023-06-02
i didnt even hear that part will listen out for it on the rewatch,2023-06-02
yes he says that nerd and i think them being responsible for breaking the multiverse from another side of it anyway is a good reason for miguel to include them into the small private club,2023-07-19
kilometers morales,2023-06-03
now thats a shocking plot twist,2023-06-03
 creed is in this too,2023-06-02
people were saying damian is a kang variant and when he was kicking ant mans  in quatumania i joked he picked that up in another dimension,2023-06-02
i thought he was kinda on hold for domestic violence charges why would spiderman across the spiderverse a disney film put him in the film,2023-06-05
when did that happen i missed it but it might have been because i took a bathroom break,2023-06-13
its rude to stare or something like that,2023-06-05
told my friends we haven’t had a film like this since parasite or eeao generational cooking right now by the spiderverse crew,2023-06-03
"this is one detail that no one has seemed to have picked up on

this movie has 10 hidden details every frame its ridiculous",2023-06-04
i noticed that,2023-06-04
miless mom flipping out over his b in spanish was both hilarious and painfully relatable,2023-06-02
i think he looks more dominican got a big laugh in our audience,2023-06-03
"i also have to appreciate the fact there was no translation in subtitles 

i do not know spanish but its got a latin base and there are a few words you pick up even just by cultural osmosis in any case you dont need to understand the words here to know what is said",2023-06-04
did you get subtitles my theater didnt,2023-06-03
return to evangelion you are not spiderman,2023-06-03
not really he didnt speak any lines,2023-06-12
" one of my favorite examples from the first movie is that when miles and peter are swinging away from the alchemax facility peter is moving at 24fps on 1s and is smoother than miles who moves at 12fps on 2s to show his inexperience compared to peter

people often repeat this as a bit of trivia but i dont think its consistently true

if you frameadvance through a copy of the movie there is a lot of variation between shots or even within shots in how frequently the poses change often the position of the character onscreen shifts subtly every frame but their limb positions only change every other frame but it doesnt happen consistently enough to claim in the forest escape peter is more experienced so hes animated on ones while miles is on twos or miles appears on ones throughout the whats up danger sequence to show his new confidence which is the other version ive seen during the forest sequence both characters get shots at both 12fps and 24fps

it is true that peters poses are more confident and that his and miless movements sync up more as the forest escape progresses to the thwip and release bit but thats not quite the same thing as claiming that one character is on ones while the other is on twos

heres a video the codirector peter ramsey debunking it



and there was something on the animation first you see certain characters animated at 12 fps and progressively its

 ive heard people say that  its not really true

 ah

 its not really true theyre all animated at 12 cause theyre all on twos there may be a few for technical reasons few small moments that we have to do on ones but hardly ever

 theres no progression then

 no no the only progression is in the performance of the characters a lot of people have thought oh miles was animated on twos and then he was animated on ones  no hes on twos all the way but its just that as he gets more confident his own performance becomes more confident

 indeed its great to debunk something like that because ive heard and read so many
things about the twelve

 oh yeah i know yeah its the myths

but having said that

in this wired video at 838 one of the people who worked on the movie i believe its josh beveridge head of character animation talks about the two characters coming into sync and he offhandedly uses the phrase theyre even on different framerates until they both get it together

so now im not sure what to believe ",2023-06-05
"when i was walking out of the theater there was a circle of middleschool aged kids talking about the movie the loudest one said “he’s special so everything is going to be okay” 

not sure if he was looking at it from your depth or the depth of “the main character of a superhero movie usually does fine” but it’s a solid take",2023-06-04
miles is going to end up being one of the great spidertotems or their avatars which is how hes able to change the wodal to save his dad and then this will also tie into the madame web movie im guessing,2023-06-04
he is a anomally not a real spiderman im glad miguel is one of the real ones and say it like it is,2023-06-03
not in comic where he originates from the ultimate where magneto goes insane  humans shift planet magnetic pull and moon and part planet got drown and ant man got mad because his wife died etc lol,2023-06-02
yes and look into what they did with spiderpunk,2023-06-04
"part 1 of 3 now

honestly after f9 being so aggressively average this one is a remarkable improvement and im actually looking forward to seeing how it ends if it does truly end",2023-06-06
unfortunately,2023-06-05
whoops time to edit,2023-06-02
what was it in spanish,2023-06-03
hes not,2023-06-04
totally makes sense thanks for clarifying,2023-06-02
i thought he was named that because he hated all the superhumans,2023-06-02
"thanks for the explanation still would have been nice to have even a five second explanation in the movie movie was certainly long enough to throw it in there since he was davis in the first one not everyone reads the comics and seeing unexplained changes is annoying

edit downvote is not a disagree button",2023-06-02
valid point but i think adolf  is adolf  to black people,2023-06-02
i love his brazen happy go lucky demeanor hes the most nonjaded spiderman,2023-06-06
the mj in peter’s universe,2023-06-03
it interesting they let him have talons even though he usually uses them outside his costume and he made his costume so it wont tear and break also it weird but is his upgraded suit electronic because i dont think miles electric is suppose affect him unless his better suit does not use material that protects him or etc,2023-06-02
what was he injecting into himself i dont remember anything like that in the comics,2023-06-02
"peter b says something like why are you not funny were always funny to him too

100 miguel isnt a real spiderman but hes going to go out becoming one through his actions proving just as miles did in itsv and will again that anyone can wear the mask

it always fits eventually",2023-06-02
" he isnt trying to save everyone

no  he said that because of the claws claws are you sure youre a spiderman

nbsp

also in his mind miguel is saving entire universes by making sure the canon unfolds as predicted by models so he is still saving billions of people at the sacrifice of a few",2023-06-12
he always looked menacingly 2099 was the edgiest universe i mean look at his symbol the spider on his chest is basically punisher skull even the cops on gwen world said he doesnt look like a good guy,2023-06-03
i mean he does look menacing u should show her ps4 game spiderman costume that looks white ghost rider spiderman lol,2023-06-02
,2023-06-02
i started to wonder that while driving home it would explain why he’s so villainous and also why he had such a drastic redesign since the first movie but i think thats highly unlikely…,2023-06-02
miguel working with the inheritors would break my heart i originally got that vibe too honestly i’m not sure what i think now but i trust this creative team with whatever direction they want to take it,2023-06-02
i just dont see this being a twist though could you elaborate on this so i can see that viewpoint,2023-06-03
in america i’d say it’s pretty common often even expected like we see here to refer to your friend’s or significant other’s parents as “mrs surname” especially when first meeting them and especially especially when you’re a child unless told otherwise,2023-06-06
basically what ugilthonielelbereth especially for a kidteen meeting a friends parents or even how in a job interview you refer to the supervisormanager as sir and only use the first name when you have the job have established familiarity or permission depending on the workplace i remember in middle school i had referred to the adult neighbors by their first name but was corrected by probably the most conservative parents who was very christian and republican,2023-06-06
its absolutely a cultural thing outside of white culture you typically formally address the parents during first encounters instead of casually nice the movie touched on this,2023-07-03
lol its not about gwens dimension bro its about shes white ,2023-06-14
perhaps you figure being the daughter of an old fashioned cop that she would know better otherwise i bet money miles makes the same mistake till george scares him ,2023-06-06
i mean it really goes for all people in general as not socially acceptable but some ethnic groups generally put alot more emphasis on children not being overly familiar with adults or authority figures though even miles wouldnt do so with george since dude obviously has have her home at 9pm sharp energy,2023-06-03
i had to  45 minutes in and just decided to let my bladder rupture,2023-06-04
i’m like that also and the downside is i saw the earth 42 twist from miles away lol,2023-06-04
i still prefer the first since it’s a complete story but wow this was amazing and i’ll definitely go to the theatres again to spot things i haven’t seen,2023-06-03
will do ,2023-06-02
i just like got out 5 mins ago saw it in imax and it was great this time i think its a combination of the audio mix and it being way too quiet by default this cinema must have cranked the volume up,2023-06-07
i think he went  at the end,2023-06-18
"i wasnt really able to sleep after watching it either but i wasnt sleep before even watching it anyways lol and man are you correct the movie is the ultimate cbm  
  
actually not just a cbm either but just in movies in general its literally magical",2023-06-03
"the people sitting next to me didnt get that memo

but it gives me an excuse to have to see it again",2023-06-09
"agreed biggest fear was the movie being straight trash

cause like every marvel project postendgame 

except no way home wandavision loki guardians

but bru they did and its so fire ",2023-06-02
"agreed super  instant red flag

and if youre gona talk u better whisper super super quietlyy during a big action sequence",2023-06-05
"it was singapore

ppl forgot manners postcovid hahaa",2023-06-03
hey whats that mean,2023-06-03
hope so considering all the  ezra pulled,2023-06-19
the first was much better with this,2023-06-02
sometimes i would get lost in the animation and forget they were speaking wasnt a bad thing tho,2023-06-02
yeah i saw it on a normal screen but i think im gonna pay to see it again in imax,2023-06-02
"i felt it going offtherails for me abit in the whole hqnueva york sequence which to be fair they’d written themselves into a corner — they probably did as well as they could’ve for having to explain canonthe multiverse and introduce a spider society and do a massive spider chase 

that being said though that sequence was a lot crammed in and was easily my least favorite part of the movie — on first watch it had me feeling it’s a 45 instead of 55 

maybe i was just tired tho lol excited to rewatch this great movie",2023-06-03
they need some restraint tbh theyre using the frenetic animation as a crutch crutch get it for having interesting action choreography,2023-06-03
spiderpunk was obviously cool but same here i would have appreciated his style more if it wasnt repeatedly changing every other second,2023-07-03
its supposed to feel frantic and confusing as it would feel like that from gwens perspective still its personal preference,2023-06-02
the spot stuff was also frantic and unpredictable but the vulture fight and hq areas just felt way too busy in comparison,2023-06-02
interesting i felt it in the whole hqnueva york sequence that whole fourth of the movie was the only part that i felt lagged in pacinglost me in the narrative a bit everything else was pitch perfect ,2023-06-03
"i loved the colors changing — incredibly expressive and a great way to fully utilize the form at their disposal  add to the litany of variegated animationart styles in the film

for me they never distracted from the emotional tenor of the scene — the characters were so grounded and alive their tension and love so palpable — the writing acting animation and framing on them was brilliant 

maybe my favorite scenes in the movie",2023-06-03
"i loved the background changing it changed colors when the mood and tension shifted with its water color style 

it felt like being wrapped in a blanket imo",2023-06-02
"fair opinion but i totally disagree the art told the story as much as anything else in this movie 

the gwendad scene hit for me because of the art",2023-06-04
i think i struggle with part miguel and miles fought and it got mad hectic and shot kept goving back and forth when he said yall knew it was like those indian dramatic action scenes going back and forth lol,2023-06-02
straight probably meaning like a straight man ie not comedic,2023-06-02
straight man as in like the comedy thing where hes the one being quipped at,2023-06-02
he said he’s tired of these   spidermen s let me just make that clear,2023-06-05
yeah the comparisons to empire are quite apt and its kinda cool to experience as a cultural event empire came out years before i was born so i just hit play into rotj but everyone collectively waiting in anticipation is a fun little thing to see reminds me of infinity war especially since even though infinity war has a depressing ending that you know they will remedy in the next film looking back on it id argue as a standalone film it is stronger and a better structured film than endgame super excited for beyond next year,2023-06-02
its her film as in the film is structured around her progression in a way that places her as a central protagonist its similar to how infinity war structures itself around thanos as a protagonist even though he is not the hero of the film in any way i agree of course these films are still miless films and hes the main lead but the reason why the film ends where it does is because gwens arc reaches a satisfactory stopping point for a break between films even if miles doesnt,2023-06-02
"it wasnt just donald glover and toby making appearances though they flat out use a fair amount of dialogue in reference to the sony spiderman films like spot saying that he has the power of the multiverseholes in his hand like otto said in spiderman 2 they even use old audio of doc ock from that same movie during the spider society brawl

that stuff is a lot more egregious in blatant fan service and was unnecessary",2023-06-02
"a friend of mine told me a joking anecdote about how the creator of peni parker in essence was like

 i really want to draw eva fan fic but all i have is this  spiderman ip oh well i guess ill just have to make do

and in fact several of the eva characters can be seen from behind in the comic",2023-06-05
if you are making a spiderverse movie yes it literally is about diversity,2023-06-02
"every movie no 


in a movie with spiderrex and peter parkedcar yes it would be weird not to have a diverse group of people when clearly being spiderman extends well beyond the category of people itself",2023-06-07
agreed i love punk but once i figured out mostall his lines are some variance of anti establishment quips i started paying more attention to the rest of the dialogue instead lol,2023-06-03
i did and it was awesome,2023-06-03
seriously,2023-06-04
was hoping we’d get a live action movie version of eobard thawne for the flashpoint paradox,2023-06-04
youre right it should be in its own especially bad movie category,2023-06-02
that’s exactly what he was doing pretty much — the film simplified his powers and backstory a bit his vampirism being far from your typical dracula but that is the gist of it yes,2023-06-07
hes hiding something imo,2023-06-04
 right,2023-06-04
miguel seems to have kind of intimidated the rest of the spiderpeople into following his lead hes naturally a very commanding leader and its easy to see why others would follow him especially since it seemed most had definite doubts early on but were only really sticking there bc of the big scary guy,2023-06-04
"he is also referred to as a vampire now i dont think he is a vampire but it does beg the question why call him that especially when the multiverse is home to multiple types of vampires

vampires are parasites they feed off of other beings and spread their disease what does miguel do he feeds off of fear and essentially spreads his negativity and malice like a disease 

i mean there is also the chance that he is some actual spidervampire hybrid",2023-06-08
and it was a great arc but it was just one and there were too many moving parts to make just one character arc’s conclusion feel satisfying even if she has framed as the protagonist,2023-06-02
"only the minority on reddit general audiences arent gonna be as willing to give this a pass

this is laughable people absolutely loved this movie i saw it in a pretty much sold out theater and everyone was raving about how good it was afterwards the rt audience score is 97 people loved this",2023-06-03
to be fair any spanish beyond hola was lost on the canadian audiences i saw it with who were just silent if there were any spanish jokes in there beyond the spanglish ones they were lost,2023-06-06
me too made me think he was a full on villain,2023-06-08
idk man i still think there’s a huge difference between her own son talking in vague metaphors and her just assuming the best from him especially after he finally apologizes and a girl they don’t know telling them their son is missing and them just accepting that like they were really chill about it,2023-06-09
"they have no idea she’s a spider person if a teenage girl told me my son was missing i’d a  do you mean my son is missing how do you know where did you see him last is he dead describe the events of the night to me etc… and then b call the cops and get a report from her

they were way too accepting that a random teenage girl told them their teenage son was missing",2023-06-10
the green eyes thing i noticed on my second viewing that’s a good catch no pun intended on the milesgwen thing,2023-06-12
i think gwen was recapping the story after she assembled her own spider team,2023-06-12
yeah but strange also caused the whole thing honestly its more his fault than peters,2023-06-03
yeah they try because they dont know thats how they end up losing uncle ben but they know pavitr was gonna lose someone  and decided the best course of action was to let things happen,2023-06-02
right now gwen she tried to stop miles from saving mambattans chief of police and actively knew her father was in danger but even then everyone else knew this would happen to spiderman india and did nothing to help they knew the hole would appear but miguel said at that point every occurrence was contained,2023-06-02
i agree i think he was selective for that reason not every canon event should be canon for everyone,2023-06-02
i mean theyre all with gwen at the end so they should be more prominent in the 3rd im glad it wasnt focused on them in this one and the next one,2023-06-02
they were  annoying in the first film when they werent saying jokes so i didnt mind them  on miles because he isnt immediately top tier spiderman material ages worse each time i rewatch the movie at least in this film they have a better reason for trying to stop miles besides oh we dont trust him that much when they never gave him an opportunity to prove himself besides kicking his  and trapping him,2023-06-02
"and at the end of the movie he does that so it feels like at least that part of the plot was wrapped up

this film did somewhat do that with gwen who seemed to be the character with the plot arc similar to how thanos has his despite not being the main protagonist  she went from hiding and running away from her dad at the beginning to him accepting her and a promise that shell come back at the end",2023-06-03
im a nolan stan but oppenheimer’s 1 minute speech on youtube about feeling like they’ve become destroyer of the worlds was more entertaining than the trailer for oppenheimer the movie i’m still gonna watch it but i feel no excitement  going into it,2023-06-04
suspension of disbelief is a lot easier when it’s not a real person doing weird ,2023-06-08
the more important difference i would think is chinese tea defaults to no milk while british defaults to with milk,2023-06-15
you summed it up better than i could,2023-06-05
thats like a running theme in the movie i dont know if it needs two separate conversations for the audience to understand that rio doesnt have much of a backstory beyond being a mom and saying shes a nurse and thats disappointing she feels like shes watching her child grow up and shes losing him and thats a really great storyline that could be shown rather than told,2023-06-03
"that moment is clearly part of miles character arc in finding his confidence and carving his own path

thats called the first movie we did that",2023-06-04
you’re thinking of the end op is referring to the first conversation that occurs under the water tower,2023-06-04
op apparently watched it in a theater full of 13 year olds,2023-06-06
think youre picking and choosing what im saying my example is uncle aarons relationship with miles in the first movie and how strong that connection was without verbalizing it this movie had miles and him mom just talking about how much they mean to each other its less exciting and makes for lazier storytelling,2023-06-05
"im  and i don’t really think that’s homophobia or at least not directly the brunt of the joke is in disrupting the awkwardly drawn out and predictable scene the same effect is imparted if he had yelled “black”  is just a better joke bc people actually come out as  to their parents 

happy pride month appreciate the allyship but also don’t go finding problems where there aren’t any",2023-06-04
not what im saying but hey nice one bro,2023-06-03
why is this being down voted its entirely accurate ,2023-06-03
come on can you honestly tell me that the word “” never floated to the top of your mind when he said “mom i’m…”,2023-06-18
i was jokingly thinking that in my head too why is that homophobia,2023-07-03
there is a moment in the first movie where miles and his dad are separated by a door and you feel the pain of miless dad to explain the news to his son about the death of uncle aaron thats gravity the audience feels something this moment between him and his mom is just conversation nothing has happened and it has no weight to it theres no need for his confession and so early in the movie he likely wont do it anyway,2023-06-03
im not saying it cant be used im saying this film does it often and it makes for lazy filmmakingstorytelling,2023-06-02
turning red has way more stretch and squish,2023-07-14
late here but i have totk on pause because i just watched this movie this afternoon and cant stop thinking about it every cut scene i was picking up my phone scrolling this thread until i finally thought  it zelda can wait like she been waiting for 6 years 150hrs here lol,2023-06-18
i love meta personally i cant get enough of it but in this angle it tied into the story well,2023-06-03
yeah 100 they wanted to complete the part 1 with a mild cliffhanger but sooooooo many people were thrown off by the to be continued everyone collectively forgot they were announced as part one and part two i guess lol that they should have just gone full tilt and done it,2023-06-05
also it was raining in his universe when gwen was outside the window but a clear night in universe 42,2023-06-04
infinity war ended with the good guys losing it was an actual ending and empire strikes back was criticized for having a “not very satisfying” conclusion when it was released,2023-06-04
hes just a clone anyway,2023-06-08
pretty sure she smashed it,2023-06-08
if she gave the watch to miles he would be tracked i think theyll be using the one of holbys design now,2023-06-09
"right plus he has no mouth or eyes or nose etc how the  is this guy alive

if i were in his place and i was left in that horrible state then yeah id also go on a revenge spree",2023-06-11
sure but then you write part 1 to be a movie can stand stand on its own its ok to leave things open for 2 but something should find resolution here instead its just a half movie,2023-06-02
maybe so but it doesnt feel like theres a whole other movie left to tell i guess well see what they do,2023-06-02
"true and i wouldnt say cash grab  thats too strong but avengers felt different in that infinity war felt like a complete movie with a proper climax the final battle was included they just lost

this by contrast did not feel like a complete movie to me it felt like a movie that ended abruptly early with 20 left to go",2023-06-05
next time ill make sure to set aside more research time before going to see a movie,2023-06-03
yeah fair enough,2023-06-02
exactly this one really suffers from clunky writing its too bad,2023-06-07
yeah the spider society is where the fanservice kicked in i noticed that scene is when the movie particularly starts to lose momentum even though it should be one of the most exciting,2023-06-03
"three act structure doesnt need to be there  people think film criticism is some kind of objective checklist 

3 act structure 
monomyth 

thats just dull",2023-06-03
"like i said i never had problems the first 2 times i saw it i did think the “i’m going home” line was too low so i understand why they just took it out

this was my first time seeing it in atmos and i thought the volume was kind of low to start but it picked up as it went along

so yeah i honestly didn’t notice too much of a difference",2023-06-13
thank you,2023-06-13
he has to face himself get back home team up to fight other spidermen and beat spot,2023-06-24
it works because teenagers fall for it every year,2023-06-03
thats it for a comic book movie  let me reduce that to 510,2023-06-04
"so its the right choice

wrong  from the very first scene  like gwens drum solo is too long both inuniverse and from our perspective",2023-06-04
this is well said gwens conflict was external  miles was internal  and he faced that demon and won,2023-06-02
buy some naan bread while you’re at it,2023-06-02
"parts like the chase scene were fun to watch but drug out for nearly 15 minutes 

the emotional relationship they work to build with his parents nice at first but it drug on far too long parents express concern about spiderman  spiderman cant explain because his parents wouldnt understand 

we saw that same conversation at least half a dozen times with no visible development from the exchanges",2023-06-09
the first movie was pure fan service tho but i do kinda agree with op this movie was good but left me feeling a bit disappointed,2023-06-07
tom holland’s spiderman may saved some canon events but eventually it caught up with him with may,2023-06-04
 yeah i think what theyre really doing with the multiverse canon event schtick is exploring the question of how do you write an original story for au characters who by design operate in the shadow of the original miles is his own version of spiderman but ultimately hes also a spiderman and thats a character with decades worth of history and tropes and the narrative expectations that come with it the main obstacle in this movie is that very character history which i felt was visualized in the form of the entire neuva york chase scene as he evades all the hundres of au spiderpeople trailing after him to copy the outlines of their stories onto his the spiderpeople helped him actualize his potential as spiderman the mantle in itsv but in atsv the spiderpeople are very much holding him back from actualizing his selfhood,2023-06-06
the end credits confirm it as such,2023-06-06
done my 4th today,2023-06-20
i dont think you understand hes calling it,2023-06-02
next you’re gonna tell me he’s spiderman too,2023-06-02
i mean calling it that it’s not gonna be a canon event,2023-06-02
what part,2023-06-03
thats what im thinking the canon for that universe wouldve happened to the og spiderman,2023-06-02
"i think the canon events 

uncle aaron  uncle ben

miles dad  death of captain stacy 

which also got me thinking is spidergwen’s death going to be a canon event also for miles probably not but would makes sense",2023-06-02
"this one is supposed to be the comic one universe 1610 but peter b is supposed to be the main comics one as gwen went to universe 616

its not fitting with any other canons so far",2023-06-03
"right spot is going back to i forget his actual earth  to  his dad but really his dad in original isn’t even relevant to canon bc miles isn’t supposed to be peter 

this also probably means there’s two spider men in miles’ original home because 42 and 1892 are in 1892

which also means why did the captain have to die in earth 42 when there was no peter wouldn’t that earth be an entire anomaly considering it’s just no spidey",2023-06-03
 that basicly counts as not saying it everyone in my kino was all dissapointed as  that it had a to be continued in the end at least none here saw it coming really dissapointing should really be in the title,2023-06-02
i bet many people that are mad about the ending will come around on it same thing happened with the empire strikes back,2023-08-10
"its not a comic book though its a completely different medium and yes i suppose that was the set piece of the third act but it wasnt a fight just an escape sequence and the movie continued quite a bit after it

agree with the animation part still an amazing spectacle i am going to rewatch it since i have a cinema subscription so i hope i can enjoy it more knowing already how it ends",2023-06-02
agreed,2023-06-05
i have to assume they have a plan for the third beyond just “rescue miles and then have the final battle against the spot but stretch it out into 2 hours” because otherwise yeah why not just change some stuff around have the storyline conclude in this movie and then do a third one with a different plot it would be disappointing if beyond the spiderverse indeed just feels like the third act of this one which is why i assume there will be more to it,2023-06-05
i feel like you’d have to go out of your way to be upset to be mad about that scene lol some people take  way too seriously,2023-06-05
"nah it was bloated as 

they turned two acts into 2 hours there is a lot of  to be trimmed off of here

theyre making a movie not a miniseries",2023-06-06
"nah a movie should be a complete story in and of itself even if its part 1 of 2 it should be able to stand alone and feel enjoyable and satisfying to watch infinity war was a part 1 but its better in that sense because it still stands well as its own story you dont feel like youve been cheated yes we knew the story wasnt fully over but it reached a satisfying conclusion in infinity war with the snap actually taking place

but this movie made many people feel like they were cheated because they just didnt handle this aspect well you can have cliffhangers and still make something a complete story theyre not mutually exclusive the issue isnt even the cliffhanger its just that this movie has no resolution and the fact that it has a very messy structure with no beginning middle or end just makes it even worse i loved it but this movie has its issues",2023-06-29
yeah  i agree if they do like 9 nominations again it would be a nice symbolic addition it felt really unique and incredible storytelling that deserves recognition,2023-06-05
same,2023-06-05
i tried to and they couldn’t be bothered said it was sony and their mixing and that there wasn’t anything they could do about it,2023-06-05
gwen got a full arc,2023-06-05
then why’s he wearing different clothes,2023-06-09
"godamnnnnn now thats good we even see the spider was meant to bite him 

maybe as prowler hes not a villain thats just his way of being a hero without spider powers",2023-06-08
thats fine  oh the things people let slide for crushes lol,2023-06-09
i think you are underestimating your fellow audience just because you didnt hear them gasp to,2023-06-11
i like the theory that the vacation he took in the miles morales game was actually him visiting the spider verse hq,2023-06-12
probably not  maybe as a collectable or easter egg  hes also appeared in the spidergeddon comic arc which also probably wont be canon to the games,2023-06-12
i hope not we do not need every single superhero story to be mixed together,2023-06-11
we have to assume gwen’s dad won’t die now that he’s not the chief at least at the hand of a spidergwen nemesis,2023-06-22
what about pav tho,2023-06-22
"clue the movie had the different endings some theaters played them randomly while others had individual showings for each ending

apparently the dvd has a random option so you wont know which ending until the end",2023-06-24
oohh yeahhh a crisp high 10 to that guy,2023-06-23
exactly and to be fair even a part 1 wouldnt have been nearly enough to convey just how incomplete the story would be but it would definitely have been far more palatable,2023-06-10
totally agree infinity war is the best part 1 movie ive ever seen,2023-06-10
yess the more i think about across the spider verse the less i like it unfortunately part 2 will probably resolve everything in an excellent matter but that doesnt stop part 1 from being rough in this case,2023-06-10
exactly  it is such a bizarre misstep,2023-06-03
the behavior of characters felt disconnected from what was happening,2023-06-05
i’m pretty sure the point is that they feel guilty about it but they’ve been convinced that it’s the right thing to do they’re begrudgingly stopping him,2023-06-18
also to add unto that when miles is at the counselor’s office and she’s talking about how he could still have a “story” and miles comments how that isn’t necessarily a good thing,2023-06-03
"miles is a teenager but the writers of this movie aren’t  the writers didn’t have to make miles sympathetic to spot they just could have shown  a bit more what happened to spot was unfortunate from his perspective 


they had great potential in writing a sympathetic villain yet they didn’t explore the possibilities of it instead we had a whole movie of  “look at how tough is it for miles to be spiderman he want to come out but he can’t what a sad life”


when in reality there is no one forcing him to be spiderman he doesn’t have full brain development and is not sympathetic and he is  over peoples lives",2023-06-06
"after watching it the second time ive realised it uses an episodic structure with chapters its a lot like  bill or a 6 issue paperback of a comic series 

the comic book splash screens are the chapters they each have a title and number",2023-06-08
because it’s spiderman and sony doesn’t have a streaming service…yet,2023-06-06
idk i was enjoying the movie up until then it killed my vibe,2023-06-02
heck it goes back even further to the early 1910s to 1950s with those movie serials that would usually end on a perilous cliffhanger to be resolved in the next installment,2023-06-03
trans stuff i guess,2023-06-25
gonna cry,2023-06-02
weird take because all the spanish was very clear and they portrayed how a bilingual american family talks to each other better than most other media thats tried,2023-06-03
"it’s when miles is running from miguel and co in the spidercity miles lands on a flying car which is shown to be a hyundai you also see a billboard in the background a few seconds later

that coupled with the actual hyundai ad featuring milesgwen that played before the trailers made it pretty obvious and annoying 

like the sony headphones and ps5 are borderline acceptable to me because it’s just a sony thing but hyundai is a whole other brand and the rest of the movie has jabs at capitalism and product placements like there’s literally fake brands on billboards all across ny but then 1 real billboard thrown in",2023-06-18
"idk i just really enjoy the more grounded stuff but i totally agree with character reintroductions everytime someone is introduced they gave to do the lets go over this again and it feels so pointless i wouldnt say i didnt enjoy the multiverse stuff i just wish the movie stayed a bit more consistent with its pacing and character motivation movie didnt feel like a movie tbh just a long tv episode they shaft spot  miles family issues for him to meet the others
 just hoping beyond is more interesting than this this is probably one of the worst part 1 film ive ever seen tbh its a 2hr prologue to the the real 2nd film",2023-06-06
if you dont want teenagers to lie to you dont ask them questions,2023-06-02
ive said this a couple times but i definitely think they’re going to have to address gwen’s dad at some point they gotta fill another 90 minutes and what we’re currently left with probably could have been done in 30,2023-06-02
anyone came be spiderman bless that man,2023-06-02
nope why do you ask,2023-06-02
also the fact that in earth 42 aaron davis is miles mentor successfully which the original comics were kind of building upto in atwisted way so this was a dark reflection of that,2023-06-02
 yeah we also have the flash asteroid city and the new indiana jones,2023-06-03
it was made from actual powdered babies,2023-06-06
yeah and i guess its no coincidence that peter had been spider man for years but dies the moment miles meets him,2023-06-03
felt like the obvious choice couldnt have been anyone else with the talk of the braids and his dad being dead here,2023-06-03
didn’t even make that connection wow,2023-06-03
lmfaooooooooo,2023-06-03
apparently it was fine for some folks and they sent instructions to change the audio in a way thats different from most other movies that im guessing some theaters didnt follow the one i saw it in was supposed to be one of the better imax screens in america so pretty disappointing tbh,2023-06-03
huh interesting makes sense i guess,2023-06-04
yes but he was never supposed to be spiderman according to miguel  ipso facto it wouldnt have been a canon event  their computer and miguel never would have even tracked it  peter b parker was the spiderman of that dimension  jefferson wasnt close to him,2023-06-04
for spiderman india there was already a collider present so i imagine the first time it got set off which could’ve been that day it would’ve blown up and caused the building to collapse,2023-06-05
alright yeah i think this is it i was confused too but this makes perfect sense we can assume that similar events would have occurred anyway just without the spot or the multiversal spiderpeople being there,2023-06-05
ah okay that makes sense to me thanks,2023-06-06
so if miles saved him why does it matter if he could just die from some other circumstances later,2023-06-05
neat,2023-06-05
ah thanks for correcting me,2023-06-09
here you go,2023-06-19
it could have been so easily a 3 hour movie with everything wrapped up imo,2023-06-23
what are canon events,2023-06-23
the story is best when you can sympathize with both hero and the bad guy equally,2023-06-23
ya i agree that in the comics thats his backstory and it could very well to that way  im just speculating that hes not an actual spiderman because the writers seem to be leaving a lot of hints that hes very different from the rest,2023-06-29
well yeah of course it didnt conclude the arc its the second movie of a trilogy,2023-06-25
"i think that all stems from it being too decompressed to fit 2 movies if they tightened it up and only kept the best things itd probably make a better movie 

imo the most memorable part of this film is the opening with gwen  besides that nothing is on the level of leap of faith peter bs intro the alchemax break in prowler chase scenes etc",2023-06-04
"i mean from a teenagers perspective having been one and parenting 2 atm parents are somewhat obstacles to them  we try not to be but very much end up being just that sometimes  

maybe its just me being overly empathetic or a lifelong spiderman fanatic but i was tearing up and on the edge of my seat all throughout  im sorry you didnt enjoy the film though  everyones entitled to their opinion  i get derided all the time because i like aliens 3 ",2023-06-04
its a jessica drew film with gwen,2023-06-05
"but even then we are left with so much unfinished

infinity war had the mind to pace the film and give multiple conclusions to characters albeit sad it turns it into a sunset ending for the villain

this movie genuinely felt like 
“yeah you like that  you come back next year with 20”

that is some anti consumer bs",2023-06-11
maybe they shouldve ended it with the reveal of prowler miles instead of the spider team assemble,2023-06-11
"the complete arc is clearly supposed to be him realising his strength and determination in who he is as well as gwen coming to understand that she needs to fight for her friendsfamily and trust her friendsfamily

gwens arc is great no complaints

miles arc i just dont think was set up right to me it never felt like he didnt have confidence in who he was nor did it feel like he was going to let people push him around miles mum gives him a big speech about not letting people push him out or take away from who he is and he doesnt really seem to struggle with any of that internally

the initial setup for his character arc appears to be 1 that he struggles to balance being spiderman being a student and being a son none of that gets addressed and 2 his loneliness lack of friends and obsessioninsecuritiesbetrayal of his spiderfriends that also isnt addressed in fact its pretty much left at the lowest point at the end of the movie",2023-06-12
as someone who avoids trailers i think they did a terrible job at setting that expectation it would have been a different experience for sure,2023-06-20
intermissions are a thing here,2023-06-03
everything happens so fast and this animation style doesnt really keep track of the surroundings so its hard to track whats happening boring more in the sense like a lot of pointless conversations keep happening on the same topic again and again,2023-06-03
yeah man and they downvoting me like i said something bad,2023-06-06
"i agree the first one was perfecto 

i think the main problem was i didnt get attached to any of the major characters other than miles and gwen",2023-06-09
miles is the main lead his arc is not donehe has a lot of story left but yes gwen side arc is done,2023-06-08
i mean i didnt see that said in trailer or on movie poster sooo im pretty annoyed,2023-06-07
it wasn’t i found out that it was announced as part one and two weeks ay back when they were announce and then no marketing material showed that i’ve wanted to see this movie since i saw the first one in the movie theater and i missed that so the general movie audience will be even more confused,2023-06-07
well yes ultimately but theres more shades to him than was expected,2023-06-05
i caught it early  as soon as the go home machine read his dna and pulled up the wrong one  but it didnt do anything to diminish the tension in my opinion,2023-06-02
i mean i get your point i’m also not saying the twist doesn’t work at all i’m saying it doesn’t work if you catch on to what universe they’re in and the film explicitly at multiple points draws your attention to this yes it’s easily missed but it’s more than a subtle hint taking it out would’ve meant it would be far harder to realize what was happening while still making it feel just as deserved in the overall story,2023-06-02
they did at the beginning of this one i don’t think they did in the first film,2023-06-03
right even if you didn’t see the “earth 42” and realized what that meant the universe he goes to is obviously wrong as soon as you see it and not just because it’s nighttime and raining i mean the vibe is just off immediately and when he goes to see his mom everything about their apartment is totally wrong,2023-08-08
"i feel like the sequel had a number of those slowed down scenes the scene with miles and his mom talking the scene with miles and gwen hanging upside down overlooking the city the scene with gwen hugging it out with her dad and opening up to him with her big speech the scene similar to this exact one where miles is eavesdropping on gwen as shes snooping around trying to find spot and then the bad guys come in 

im sure there were plenty more these are just off the cuff both movies were incredible and the second one was definitely more fast paced but contained plenty of impactful moments too",2023-06-07
"exactly which is one of the reasons why the pacing  structure of the movie is completely off

the first half of the movie sets up the spot as being the main villain but suddenly everyone forgets about him as the latter half of the movie sets up miguel as being the covillain  neither miguel nor the spot is dealt with in the slightest this in my opinion resulted in an extremely weird pacing of the film it felt more like watching 10 short films about spiderman and gwen than watching one coherent movie 

and thats not even mentioning the countless other plot points that are also unresolved it felt like the movie was trying to encapsulate this huge intricate plot but unfortunately didnt pay enough attention to the details which led to me not really being emotionally invested in any of the unfortunately kind of superficial plot points the first movie had an extremely interesting and concise plot which made it much enjoyable to me

to me the sequel was trying to fit way too many plot points into one film which resulted in the plot not really going anywhere i am really surprised at how much people in this thread seem to have enjoyed the film the people i watched it with were quite dissapointed

also as as sidenote it felt like there were way more cringy marvelquips in the sequel than in the first movie the first movie was hilarious without being over the top after watching 30 minutes of the sequel however i was already tired of the constant cringy attempts at oneliners",2023-06-10
also given the size of gwens squad id imagine that theres going to be a big cast of villains running wild in that universe that theyd eventually have to fight through,2023-06-02
"no because infinity war at least finished as a moviethe difference between the two is the plot and structure a part of the problem are the amount of actions that dosent get consequences for example we get to see how miles is willing to tell his identity he makes that choice but we dont get to see the consequences of those choices in the plot because of it not being his universe even though what i mentioned may be a problem the real crime is the structure the tension gets up through all the movie and after it reaches a certain point it starts to go down but then suddenly it starts going up again in a speed like never before just to stop abruptly do you know what would been a good or at least a better ending if the movie ended when it is revealed that miles is in another universe because the story would end in a low point of tension but with a plot twist thats how you make a good cliffhanger make a plot twist when the tension is low thats the key but instead they took a lot of bad decisions that ended up giving an unsatisfying end

edit if you think it is written in a bit weird way its bacause this is an old comment responding to another person which i copy pasted and changed a bit too lazy",2023-06-14
whats infinity war,2023-06-04
maybe end on whos spiderman then cut to black,2023-06-04
"nowhere close the 2nd one is maybe better visually 

but the story and the way they decided to tell that it made this film overal a letdown the 1st had a welltold and tightly paced story and the 2nd movie lacks that which brings it down considerably imo

its still a good movie but nowhere near as good as the first one",2023-06-08
"but this one doesnt have a proper ending still

its not episode 6 of a season of a tv show its a whole  movie theres an expectation to have some ending",2023-06-09
not everyone spends all day on the internet and reads all the info about movies they should have called it part one in the title,2023-06-03
once they jumped through the portal in spot’s apartment the movie hit its highs imo,2023-06-04
that was one of my favorite parts honestly i need more movies to take time to flesh out their characters and dynamics like this did,2023-06-05
movies are so much more mindblowing when you dont,2023-06-05
i think youre right the gwen story did offer a conclusion i missed that i wonder if it will show up in the next movie,2023-06-05
at least they took it out last week i saw fast x and a baby started crying and the mom instead of walking out she started to walk around inside to try and calm it down,2023-06-06
but in the grand calculus of the multiverse is it really even worth the risk of finding out,2023-06-04
"this is kind of true i wouldnt say free will is the prominent theme but a consequence of the primary issue between realism vs nominalism 

the spider alliance idk what else to call them are echoing the arguments of the philosophers  when they say the spiderman essence and actions canon events are the same in other words in order to be spiderman its not enough to have spider dna and spider powers you must also necessarily do things being and doing are the same

miles then rejects this invisible world of forms and says im miles morales instead of i am spiderman rejecting the essence entirely for his own individuality even though he wouldnt be himself without the spider in the first place

this is also the same debate going on in gender ideology and people like matt walsh kind of walsh cuts off the doing and only leaves the being part woman dna whereas the trans people reject he essence and say i can do whatever i want problem is you cant see any identity or perceive any distinction without doing they are both wrong you need being and doing there has to be movement towards something with powers and actions for something to be intelligible this is what aristotle called energeia

so for the same reasons the trans people will believe miles is their guy and see the movie as an allegory for their ideology realists will see this as another instance of propaganda as a realist i can still acknowledge this move was a well crafted not preachy very subtle and clever example of satanism the serpent rejecting ",2023-06-25
pop money  another dimension ,2023-06-05
"ah i like this one too but the one i’m trying to find is after this part as they’re talking on the tower

it plays in the background and is really subtle but it captures the mood perfectly and i wanna know what it is",2023-06-02
oh  yes,2023-06-05
thank you for this will take him he’s too obsessed with it not to and this is really good preparation for a teachable moment ,2023-06-02
fyi he had a blast and absolutely loved it thanks so much for this,2023-06-05
"i just don’t like how they make it out to be that every spider man from spectacular to dozens from the comics would just be duped like that or be “too weak”

but then again looking at the history of spider man as a character i guess it does make kind of sense",2023-06-04
well the japanese spiderman i’m referring to has a big mech so that probably wasn’t a reference to him,2023-06-04
that’s a crazy good eye you got,2023-06-05
its possible which also makes me a bit sad because that would me the spectacular spiderman was in on it too what the  peter,2023-06-05
can’t wait for it to go beast mode in 3,2023-06-05
she might just be dead too like spidergwen noted in most universes she dies  which has to be a pretty messed up concept to wrap your head around,2023-06-05
spot extracted the spider okay i gotcha yeah no i remember the opening credits of the first film and the glitching spider i just didn’t remember why that universe was spiderless,2023-06-05
it’s honestly wild to me that they named him that you can tell that there weren’t any history enthusiasts in the decision making chain there lol,2023-06-05
"evil miles and aaron are criminals involved in shady business out of nowhere some lookalike pops up and tricks aaron into thinking hes evil miles who the  is this is this a bust by some undercover cop or something they need to find out what he knows

then all we really know is evil miles asks why should i let you go he could easily be leaning towards letting good miles go 

but if he did still want to  miles it makes sense why should they believe his story it could be a trick even if its true good miles knows evil miles is a supervillain what if he alerts the cops on his way out you dont stay a successful major criminal by letting loose ends exist out of the kindness of your heart",2023-06-05
if i met my doppelganger id tie her up too,2023-06-05
i did not was it an alternate wu tang like the 3 pac t shirt,2023-06-06
it was going to bite 42 miles you can see it about to bite him when spot pulled it into 1610,2023-06-07
but they showed that they can prevent universes collapsing when captain singh died and they plugged up the black hole so whats to stop them from doing that again,2023-06-06
the right song but not the right part yes someone helped me within a twitch streamers discord community it starts at the 135 mark up to 200 the lofi part i heard was the high pitched twinkling like sound i believe  thank you for helping out,2023-06-07
thank you for your efforts in assisting however it was gwens theme  i posted on another subreddit just to be safe and cover ground and they found it within the center of it i appreciate the help with finding this song though i really do enjoy it,2023-06-07
"how do you know that from what were shown each spiderman or woman experiences one canon event peter b lost his uncle ben gwen lost her peter miguel took the place of a dead counterpart thereby dooming that world and causing his own canon event maybe because miles is an anomaly and he has to experience two canon events or maybe thats the consequence of disrupting a canon event i dont know 

none of this took away from my sheer enjoyment of the film which ive now seen twice its a question that came up for me along with wondering why a heavily pregnant woman is running around and endangering her unborn child and why peter b didnt leave his daughter at home rather than needlessly exposing her to danger  love love love the movie",2023-06-10
okkk ,2023-06-11
he seems more like a werewolf than a spider or vampire lol,2023-06-11
yeah i know but for me i think that kind of cliffhanger for a first part movie needs to be more subtle like infinity war if you watch those 2 movies separate you can clearly see that the tone between the end of iw and start of eg is way different with spiderverse i feel like the movie will start just at the moment that it stopped like if a movie was simply paused in his half and youre going to watch it later it doesnt do any big harm to the experience but at that moment that the credits started rolling i was like so its over at that point wow overall i like that movie more than the first,2023-06-15
i see thanks,2023-06-15
council of reeds richards as well,2023-06-16
you’re talking about the ending right when she’s asking if he’s got a minute,2023-06-15
that’s what i thought too about the friends with a grown man part just weird when i rewatched into the spiderverse this morning and seen it,2023-06-15
thank you i sat with my friend for 39 minutes having that talk,2023-07-01
thats a great read of the situation thanks ,2023-07-07
"did they have a bts talking about that im interested 

i think ill have to watch it again i watched it at a drive in theater and the projector quality wasnt that good",2023-07-15
million thanks man,2023-07-22
its only a partial resolution miles turmoil isnt fully resolved hes still in a state of panic and isnt able to resolve that tension between himself and his parents also a good character arc should have an internal and external resolution and that external resolution doesnt exist because he doesnt get a chance to spot the spot and save his father infinity war has an external resolution because the final battle of that film is what its been building to the whole time thanos vs the avengers and thanos wins,2023-06-05
"i think the canon events are

  bitten by a mutated spider 

 the death of a loved one as a direct result of an action taken or a choice made by the spiderperson

 the death of their first love interest conditional based on said love interest existing ex gwen doesnt have a love interest in her reality so theres no opportunity for this death to occur

 the loss of a police captain close to the spiderperson

in the case of miles hes only completed the bitten and the death of a loved one canon events the death of a police captain is the last one remaining and its just bad luck that the police captain close to him happens to be his dad",2023-06-04
"yeah also what determines a canon event exactly


perhaps plausibility  for example miles parents plan to never leave new york  common sense says that means except on vacation  but maybe theyll never get on a plane ever  so they cant die in a plane crash they were never in

or perhaps miguel is only saying that because hes a mouthpiece for the writers wish that miles gets accepted and doesnt actually have to make sense  and its just a plot hole",2023-06-04
i just dont know how you can call this average when theres not a single movie like it  story animation nothing,2023-06-05
i get that i don’t know i feel like the fact that every other spiderman is cool with this felt a bit much the movie needed more of a justification for it,2023-06-02
but its not smart to do with that the main character just creates dislike for the main character who we know should have learned his lesson by the first movie,2023-06-03
"no but at this point miles is supposed to be gone they know hes not at home and the girl just comes out of his room  that was just really odd imo 

she really didnt need to come out of the room either 

idk  scene bugged me lol",2023-06-07
"exactly what i was thinking when she was fighting the italian villain  apparently the sound was bad in some theatres and ok in others no idea how that happens  

when this movie comes out on streaming id be happy to give it a full re watch and maybe with proper mixing itll elevate alot of it 

ive sen people on here referencing jokes i didnt even hear",2023-06-07
she is and this movie may have pushed her ahead of miles for my favorite character however this is where it seems to me that the story is going and would be a fitting conclusion for the milesgwen arc imo,2023-06-07

"i understand it

x200b

i just think it is  and something that would never actually happen with spidermen especially all of them they are literally free thinkers that always get in trouble on teams cause they question everything or try to save everyone

cause thats not how they work

also  the metaphor cause gwen is litteraly the same age as him

  
plus its way to  meta oh  its a cannon event cause spidermen cant have nice things so like lets make so if they do they think the world will end yea that is a cool idea  idiots

i knew getting new creatives behind this  would  it up

the first movie understood spidermen

this movie doesnt

resulting him in introducing an infinite pool of black spiderman,2023-06-11
the entire color scheme of her world is the colors of the trans flag not to mention the flag on her wall and her own fathers jacket,2023-06-04
"gwens dad fate changed bc gwens dad isnt the equivalent of uncle ben in gwens universe for gwen it was prolly her version of peter parker when he changed into their universes version of the lizard guy so gwens dad didnt have a canon event because he isnt a canon event character 

just like how the mumbattan universe had a canon event that was supposed to be the death of captain singh the dad of a girl spiderman liked and not even spidermans dadfamily himself 

also ya miles is the cause of all the troubles in the multiverse the movie even states that everything that happens because of characters crossing between universes when theyre not supposed to and thus subsequently risking the destruction of entire universes is because of miles actually 

if earth42 spider had just did what it shouldve done and bitten earth42 peter parker and turned that peter parker into spiderman then not only would miles be avoiding this situation but so would everybody else 

so even by your own admission miles is actually an even bigger villain than everyone else combined together in the story albeit an inadvertent one

him being the original anomaly started the rest of the anomalies and destroyed everyone elses universes and if it werent for miguel and the other spiderheroes stopping crossuniverse events then even more unierses wouldve died out already 

i mean you defend miles actions here so badly but look at the cause and effect chain here 

spot is going to  miles dad is the effect but the cause of that is bc he was donuted by miles yet the cause of that is bc miles became spiderman and the cause of that is bc of a crossuniverse mistake where a canonevent got disrupted and made miles morales into spi8derman when he shouldve just been an ordinary person 

so even your own logic defeats you",2023-06-07
"the trolley problem is a mathematical equation so it breaks down as you reach infinity if there are an infinite amount of people in both track one and track two then switching the track ceases to become a meaningfully distinct choice as both outcomes are identical

"the movie set miguel up to be quite the  actually

even his very first appearance he seemed like a good fighter but was otherwise either an  or at least just sorta unfriendly not not personableat best he certainly did not come off as likeable or main characterheroic vibes and if anyone got that impression at all then that impression was immediately and jarringly shattered the next time he showed up onscreen when he went into fullblown psycho mode 

they didnt even let him explain the logic of it all very accurately 

imagine a real life incident where an active shooter holds a school hostage and says either this teacher jumps off the building and then ill  myself and end this whole crisis or ill just massacre this entire school of kindengaden children imagine that teacher runs away and then the shooter laughs maniacally while slaughtering children all of this is caught on live stream in every social media platform immortalized eternally on the internet 

the death toll is like 20 kids 

imagine how utterly hated by everyone in the entire  world this teacher would be

"youre exactly why the term conflict of interest exists and why more people also need to learn how to recuse themselves froma lot of things honestly 

ya no  your personal feelings are going to matter a bit here",2023-06-07
"again the movie did a bad job of showing the full story bc they obviously wanted you and the audience to side with miles but the answer is bc that scene was like only 60 seconds of exposition and the full story of miguels universe collapse involved much more than what couldve been explained in 60 seconds of talking 

miguel replaced alternate universe miguel and caused a canon event disruption and thus began his habit of continuously disrupting the normal flow and whats supposed to happen in that universe thats why even miles reazlied that they brought in peter to bring him down softly 

bc they knew that this very first step into the multiverse they needed to establish a habit of him enduring the pain of sacrifice it sucks and honestly nobody really likes it but he knows that if he lets miles have this one then miles will do what miguel did continuously disrupt canonevents and break his universe until his universe does indeed break 

you even saw it in the indian spiderman universe he goes after captain singh bc thats just his nature he has a habit of disrupting canonevents the same habit miguel had 

thank  miguel learned from his mistakes",2023-06-07
"then they should tell the guy whose life is on the line to at least give him a chance to make an informed decision to selfsacrifice 

thered be some hilarious lolz cuz miles dad would likely choose to sacrifice himself if he knew what the spiderheroes knew 

and no miles definitely isnt trying to save the universe he literally just wants to save his dad and he even tries to use some nice mind games with uncle ben on peter parker to do 

also if you want to go the route of infinite people dyingthen by your logic letting the entire multiverse die is actually perfectly ok bc infinity is infinity ya its a baddddddd road to go down if you want to go down the infinite concept thing 

miguel is right bc you literally saw the results of what happened when he didnt do what he shouldve done what he is currently doing and what he is currently trying to do with miles",2023-06-07
"the more unhinged that miguel the comes the more you should realise to not be taking his word at face value 

thats actually my problem with the movie too 

they make him a complete  even at his first showing and then he cant even talk like a normal person and just screams and rants 

they portray him as this evil and mentally unstable person when they couldve just as easily shown him to be logical and wellbalanced bc they had to do the whole muh what is 1 life worth thing

its not one person its a lot of people miguel has established a society which excepts that some people must die in order for the universe to be right 

miguel established nothing 

for some reason everybody here just cannot seem to accept that what if it really is true that there just is no way to avoid that part about

some people must die in order for the universe to be right 

bc the movie even makes it obvious that some events need to happenincluding ones where people die in other words some people need to die 

hollywood and the entertainment industry really need to stop coddling everybody and making everything all happycheery loveydovey and write stories about how theres always a nothing bad needs to happen and everything can be good ending this is the definition of toxic positivity and it needs to go away",2023-06-07
"lol and this is how you can tell that youre someone who doesnt know much about nature and science 

the never interfere under any circumstances rule that nature documentarists and scientists follow is written for a reasonbc we humans used to not follow this rule and the consequences were far far astronomically worse 

hint there wouldnt be any nature left if we hadnt stopped doing that and started following that trule 

so you kinda just proved my point for me",2023-06-07
alright thats slightly less rage inducing,2023-06-04
almost like that was mentioned multiple times,2023-06-03
i actually didn’t see it like that good point but i guess i’m more biased i think what miguel is doing is wrong as he’s letting people die but at the same time if he doesn’t let the people die then the whole universe will die,2023-06-03
by recently u mean how many years,2023-06-05
"because it felt a little pandering it’s never indian people just existing it’s always about being indian the only progress is now it’s not viewed as the butt of the joke 

as an indian american son of immigrants i related more to miles than pavitr",2023-06-02
thats how i felt about hobie as a brit ngl felt like how japanese people must feel about weeaboos haha,2023-06-02
"to be fair its meant to be a kids movie jokes are meant to be dorky and silly

like the way miles and his family speak spanglish always cracks me up most latinos i know and myself dont talk like that but i guess its to make it easier to understand for the kids and nonspanish speakers",2023-06-20
idk i didnt care for the costume change and his voice but i loved it,2023-06-11
look at their post history they hate diversity and assume any non white character exists only to pander i would bet they didnt see the movie at all,2023-06-03
gwen literally stated it for the dummies ,2023-06-03
this has to be a joke it literally showed he was being sent to earth 42 the color scheme is all different when he gets there the clothes he puts on in his room are different colors including a purple hoodie vs a red one hinting at the prowler his moms eyes are a different color they shouldnt have shown earth 42 on the screen the rest of the clues were enough i wish i would have actually been surprised instead of just being told what was going to happen,2023-06-03
oh definitely could see that like if spiderman doesnt have an uncle ben type or a police captain hes close to what would happen to that canon event interesting angle i like it i definitely think there will be a lot more to it than i outlined beyond will probably be 2hr30 just like across so theres likely a lot to it maybe theres something about hobies device that doesnt work right so they cant precisely travel or maybe the earth 42 story is a bit more significant no matter what im locked in they clearly know what theyre doing,2023-06-02
could also say dune i guess,2023-06-02
true,2023-06-02
i appreciate you sharing your thoughts and i hope your proposed solution is what happens as that sounds really interesting but i completely disagree that this setup upholds spidermans morality its the exact opposite of that miguel and co arent trying to save everybody theyre explicitly sacrificing a few people in order to save the many a greater good thats not saving everyone miles on the other hand is trying to save everyone hes going to save his dad and then try to find a solution to the collapse problem thats saving everyone and its what spiderman as a collective ideal should be doing i dont really have a problem with miguel being ok with it as hes always been morally ambiguous its what makes him so interesting and so refreshing compared to other spidermen but characters like peter gwen and the rest no way and as i said if the canon issue gets resolved then all these characters are now  accessories spiderman the ultimate symbol of selfless sacrifice is now a murderer in almost every universe dreadful decision,2023-06-03
wait til the reddit edit that combined both parts together into 1 film comes out the true goat movie ever,2023-06-04
thought i was just being picky but it’s good to know i’m not the only one ,2023-06-06
think you got things a little twisted around unless they changed his backstory since his origin  he was a dna scientist but he used his experiment on himself because his boss and biodad spiked him with a addictive drug that bonded to his dna the only way he could see himself free of it was to reboot himself back to his old dna but a disgruntled colleague sabotaged his effort and bonded him with the spidermen experiment his boss does think hes blackmailing him by giving him the drug rapture but miguel doesnt need it  so im not sure why hes dosing himself in across the spiderverse well probably find out in the next movie,2023-06-07
"i thought this too miles in the first movie actually does feel like a young teenager but in this one he’s so much more mature even in the first movie gwen treats him like a kid that doesn’t know how to use his powers correctly

i guess its supposed to be a “they grow up so fast” kind of thing but yeah 17 would make more sense the speech to his mom at the party also would have felt stronger if he said “i’m 17” instead of 15",2023-06-18
i loved the film but that’s my main complaint it was missing a 3rd act just hard to see it as a complete movie plus the ending kept dragging if that was going to be the end of the film then they should’ve ended it immediately when miles realized he wasn’t in his home dimension we didn’t need multiple twists at the end would’ve been cool to start the next film with the prowler reveal,2023-06-10
he just needs to prevent his dad from being sworn in as captain,2023-06-07
"i understand that but miguel and co are all missing that core spiderman pillar of saving anyone they can save no spiderman would ever stand by and let someone die even if everyone said they were supposed to

it’s like every spiderman in that multiverse is missing the core pillar of what makes spiderman “spiderman” except miles",2023-06-07
infinity war does at least show the conclusion of thanos quest if it were like spiderverse 2 it would end on a cliffhanger of whether or not thanos will get the mind stone,2023-06-07
infinity war handed it better ngl i enjoyed the majority of spiderverse much more but at least infinity war had an actual third act and some sense of emotional conclusion this film had none of it like there was some good setup but the complete lack of any type of payoff makes me entirely unwilling to see the next one out of spite,2023-06-07
"gwens arc in this is great and her theme is one of my favourite pieces of music from this franchise

"im not quite sure how you could gather that from my criticisms about the ending didnt even comment on the movie itself 

things can have good and bad in them bud",2023-06-02
"the first movie is a part of the trilogy and stands on its own while since this is a part 1 it just doesnt i am just personally not of a fan of that feel other mediums would be better suited for this style of story to be honest because this a part 1 it felt the pace slowed down so badly due to the runtime without really adding or using it time to make it not empty what doesnt feel empty to me is everything that came out of the first movie i just saw lots of opportunities to cut it down or to add more focus overall its a great film just really meh at a lot of parts im not sure im super convinced it needed to be two parts ie i didnt get much more emotional connection that i wouldnt have gotten from just anything because of the first movie i actually feel like some character motivations were really shortcutted or just very empty outside of main trio and ohare just a personal opinion again i expect to be in the minority but who knows i am a huge fan but not a fan of the small creative choices outside that im just a big fan of the spiderman series so i like the references and being an art perspn i bet a lot of it comes down what a of part 1part 2s struggle with


edit im also a sucker for romance too so a good bit of bias it will still be the best thing i watched all year",2023-06-06

a year is not bad any chance the writers strike delays it at all,2023-06-02

thank you i thought she said “will you dock me” and was like what,2023-06-02
when gwen meets renaissance vulture and he starts speaking italian she quips sorry the only italian i know is from mario kart,2023-06-02

thanks man you rock,2023-06-04
"if gwen is going to die as his canon event then shes going to die and they wouldnt try to stop her

i think she just didnt want her mentee getting close to miles because he was the original variant",2023-06-02
ahhh it would be a fascinating twist if miles is able to save his dad but gwen dies instead hmmm something to ponder,2023-06-02
march 29th 2024 to be exact,2023-06-03
was just looking for a nice movie to see at the cinema tomorrow haha but yeah will watch the first one before then,2023-06-02
"that makes sense miguel travelling to another dimension and being that worlds spiderman must have prevented that worlds next spiderman their version of miles morales maybe his kid ig  from coming to fruition which would have caused a canonical disruption   


youre right thoughbest not to dwell on it too much espically when its entirely two different mediums handled by different teams and only half the story is told at this point",2023-06-02
i think that last point is it hes just going to go ham in brooklyn which will  miles father miles looking at this vision recognizes his dad the spot seeing the same vision just sees a cop,2023-06-02
it’s not off the table though i would say i think spiderman always has the question “you can do anything but at what cost” and it’s something that makes his character so good in all the spidey iterations but i don’t disagree that they could completely shatter the mold but then it just becomes a happy ending story we’ll see,2023-06-02
yeah exactly that one let me know if you find out,2023-06-03
turning someone from bad to good seems like a very spiderman thing to do,2023-06-03
"i dont mind different art styles 

but miles running to school at 12 fps in the first one almost gave me nausea cannot watch it on the big screen if theyre doing that again",2023-06-03
yeah just a lot of questions with no  answers yet,2023-06-03
"that doesn’t make sense though what happens at least from miguel’s perspective with the information he currently posses is that those events must happen otherwise the whole universe begins to unravel on itself and collapse

is not that the events are something that every spiderman must face to be spiderman is that those events are necessary for the universe to exist at all",2023-06-03
there is a “miles will return in beyond the spiderverse” title card after the stylistic credits but that’s about it,2023-06-03
thank you,2023-06-03
i know but still those chains are like paper to him,2023-06-05

thanks,2023-06-04
oh  i don’t think i’ll ever forgive 1610 miles for that if i were 42 miles even if it wasn’t his fault now it’s clearer why 1610 had 2 spidermans and 42 had none initially i thought that there was another peter parker equivalent in 42 which the spider was supposed to bite,2023-06-04
"they never specify who will become spiderman in earth42 only that the spider came from that earth and bit miles in earth1610 instead 

could be miles or a peter parker of earth42 id be willing to bet peter in earth42 is who saves miles but with no spider powers could be goblin like as he could still be smart in this world thats my theory anyway cause miles will need help to make a watch to get back to earth 1610",2023-06-04
yeah there were a few longass conversations about family and love and some reintroductions that had me like wondering how long this was all going to be and then when it turned out to be a tune in next year ending i really could have used a more truncated version like we get it miless family loves him miless mom loves him miless dad love him holy jeez we know like it was all heartfelt and beautiful and im sure lots of people appreciated it but i had that same feeling from the portal onward was pretty much great,2023-06-05
very nice,2023-06-05
the beginning of the movie when spot is saying he got the spider from an alternate universe you can see the spider is on its way to bite 42 miles 42 miles was supposed to be spiderman and fight against all those villains and our 1610 miles likely would have taken over as prowler after his dad died,2023-06-05
"miles isnt part of the canon so the rules dont apply to him

you believe that fact then u can surely believe saving miles dad can destroy the spiderverse you cant negate miguels whole theory 

let say miles disproves the theory and saves both therefore his canon since nothing changed

else say miguels rightthus far he has been right therefore miles spiderman shouldnt exist and only blonde peter should exist basically only one spiderman for each dimension

but heres the catch e1610 comic is the real canon of the story in which where the spider 42 was from in my theory since the spider leaked to the past miles became spiderman way too early and caused a e1610aevil miles and e1610b basically the multiverse is already rewritten and still writing at this point with miles being the accident sole purpose of it  the saving or sacrificing dont matter at this stage cuz the multiverse will eventually collapse earlier or latter to e616",2023-06-06
"the point of the third movie will be to show that not every spiderman story needs a tragic backstory
spiderman can save everyone

but thats solving a problem that didnt exist until this movie  plus he already has his uncles death",2023-06-06
struggling to see why canon can be changed in some cases ie gwens father isnt going to die now and thats fine but captain singh not dying nearly destroyed the spidermanindia universe,2023-06-06
oh interesting didnt know that,2023-06-07
yeah you see miles put his hand on a nail and start his venom charge before the to be continued ending hes basically doing the watch the hands not the face technique that peter b used on miles in the first film,2023-06-07
right before and after miles jumped out through the window from the spider society,2023-06-11
does he actually reference him or are we just assuming tom hollands  too much,2023-06-09
that’s a quip from the first movie great to see it make a return ,2023-06-11
"i dont miss him the way miles does with gwen we just said hello but i was sad about the loss of the possibility of our friendship not that sad just disappointed he really looks like me but looks happy  much more positive than me im not sure if he is genuinely happy  positive or its just a packaging 

i dont think i will meet him again in fact hes the second doppelganger that i met still got 68 other doppelgangers left to meet",2023-06-15
miles already had his uncle die though so if he required one close family death for the canon he already fulfilled it didnt he,2023-06-15
" miles was not meant to be spiderman but he is spiderman now so he gets the canon events

but then that would make miles being spiderman canon and thus meant to be",2023-06-16
thank you so much when did link up play then because i thought that was the one when miles and gwen were eating maybe it was both it was a long scene,2023-06-18
ohhh that explains a lot thanks,2023-06-25
in the scene where the spot tells how he came to beended up like this theres a frame where you can see the spider going towards a person with braided hair before it gets pulled through a portal which is obviously the earth 42 miles so yes actually he was supposed to be the spiderman of that universe,2023-07-14
i dunno maybe infinity warstyle where the final battle goes to  and the next movie builds back up from there thereby giving spot a complete arc a la thanos but something tells me sony were too cowardly to sign off on that so were left with a brilliant work of art that just shudders to a stop,2023-06-05
yeah and some of my issues with the pacing from my first watch completely disappeared the second time around i appreciated them giving everything time to breathe movie flew by again didnt feel like 2hrs,2023-06-07

okay its a movie about every version of spiderman",2023-06-04
not much of a “spidey fan” are you,2023-06-05
gwen went against orders and visited her friend because she happened to get assigned to his world probably begged for the assignment because she is a rebellious teenager she didnt intentionally bring him into the spidersociety she just didnt think of the consequences of her actions such as spot getting away when shew as supposed to catch him or miles following her through the portal,2023-06-06
thank you so much i listened to a few songs and wasn’t sure,2023-06-10
im pretty sure he said letting him escape out of the museum would disrupt the canon event,2023-06-10
it was cool seeing the vr spider girl allow him to go it’s like he thought he made a friend but that spider girl knew he was going to the wrong universe,2023-06-19
ah yes i did get that just thought that maybe there would be another reason,2023-06-25

best theatrical animation ever never seen a miyazaki movie,2023-06-12
"i glad i stumbled on your post saved me some typing from a technical view point its excellent and amazing even i can imagine being ina great cinema with the speakers blaring the soundtrack and the score is admittedly pretty good like avatar its definitely a movie to watch at a cinema rather than at home


but story wise its nothing special even taking into regard other scifi movie stories its not a patch on interstellar or inception its kinda basic scifi story the twist at the end was interesting but other than that it was pretty simple 

i too wonder for those that say this is the best movie ever lol",2023-09-10
gwens story had a full arc and she is what started the movie i would much rather a 25 hour climax than a 20 minute one its like saying they should have just made empire strikes back 20 minutes longer because last jedi was just a cash grab,2023-06-25
"it ends at a point where the story within itself is over there’s obviously more things to to come and it would have been it’s own disappointment if there was no rotj from a fan perspective but imagine if ended where luke is cornered by vader right before he drops the reveal

that’s not an ending to where it can function as it’s own story within the overarching plot of the trilogy across and beyond are tied as one to me now because the ending was too abrupt for it to function within itself i get that it was intended as a part 1part 2 but personally i still think you can leave enough closure between each for them to stand as 2 separate films


even  bill wrapped up enough in part 1 for it to feel like a settled ending before the adventure continues again",2023-06-04
i understand that but that wasnt because of a deviant spiderman doing something they werent supposed to  it was simply the natural order of things in that universe im pointing out the fallacy in miguels thinking that some things are destined to happen if the death of his uncle or the police captin are destined miles becoming spiderman and the peter parker from that universe dying is also destined and therefore there needs no correction,2023-06-07
yeah slower theres a lot more contemplative talking or visual driven story that the more fastpaced actionfocused origin story dont get me wrong still a lot more action but im glad there was more time to let the story really soak in the gwen scenes were especially great,2023-06-12
you meaninfinity war,2023-06-17
unfortunately im seeing that more fans than not are looking forward to a solution that does allow miles to have his cake and eat it too  i understand we empathize with his character and we want the absolute best for him  but that just isnt real and i think it not only betrays the character of spiderman but it also betrays the purpose of posing these questions in the first place,2023-06-03
i think thats fair but im approaching this from the way miguels character and the movie frames the situation  as it stands miles saving his father necessitates the destruction of his universe at the very least and vice versa  while its more than completely understandable and even good for miles to save his father miles as far as he and all the characters are concerned is knowingly risking the safetyexistence of his universe and its people to save his father that is selfish understandably so  this moral dilemma isnt only worth exploring on its own terms but its a meaningful one to explore to the backdrop of what makes spiderman who he is  using some plot point that gives miles an out of this situation really diminishes this experience hes in,2023-06-02
"a he isnt special in the comics and still beats peter

b i liked how the spider was from a different universe and the ramifications of that but i dont see how that makes him swing better",2023-06-03
"its a trope in marvel riri is smarter than tony miles is more skilled than peter same with kate vs clint i thi k its lazy in order to garner interest in the new guard

miles one year in wouldnt beat peter whos went toe to toe with thanos and the like it just wouldnt happen

miles is cool though i like hip hop and graffiti so hes got that going for him

but its still silly",2023-06-03
it was meant for e42 miles when spot first explains his backstory theres a brief shot of the spider sneaking up behind him in school,2023-06-03
"yeah uben123111 is correct  when spot says he brought a spider from another dimension its picked up from right behind earth 42miles with braids inside of a classroom  

so it was always meant to be miles in that universe",2023-06-03
potentially could although itll be a while since therell be multiple live action spiderwoman now,2023-06-03
well miguels not the villain hes just misguided a brief antagonist but not a villain,2023-06-03
"yes but is that miguels universe is what im asking  

it doesnt have a spider man because that radioactive spider got sent to miles universe  im thinking miguel is who that spider was supposed to bite in 42  that he never got bit and doesnt have spider powers naturally since he uses that shot for strength and speed and uses claws to climb

he left that universe to go to one that he could be with his kid  so thats why 42 verse doesnt have a spider man  miguel never got bit and then he left",2023-06-04
yeah lol i wrote this comment somewhere else and caught that no idea how i made that mistake in the first place lol but forgot to edit it here,2023-06-06
yep if its just a conversation scene then i really want to be focused on the characters and not distracted by the background i found that happening in the rooftop scenes where the effect was really pronounced in the buildings i had to look around to make sure i hadnt walked into the 3d showing,2023-06-11
ok ok i meant the whole marvel superhero stuff ,2023-06-16
wasn’t gwen only in his universe to stop spot i thought she wasn’t supposed to see miles when she was there,2023-07-07
yeah i hope so too i liked into the spiderverse quite a bit still sort of busy but enjoyable and miles is a great character my main problem with across the spiderverse was color styling and the ending it was still entertaining just not rewatchable for me,2023-07-10
i meant the universe where the spider bit miles came from it kinda gets confusing at some point,2023-06-03
its going through a rough time it happene no need fo it to die,2023-06-05

 i haven’t seen great movies lately though for real and the ones people acclaim i don’t even enjoy them my fav movies ever are casino and the departed i didn’t care for “everything everywhere all at the same time” or we it’s called it didn’t blowmind me felt straight forward to me i just love the details in this spider man movie and i never really liked any of them that much… they just felt like whatever to me,2023-06-02
i know we wont have time before then ill try to find a concise youtube recap of it,2023-06-02
i like this yes this is the better question,2023-06-02
why do you perceive me as a bot,2023-06-02
definitely not,2023-06-02
okay i didnt get that part he was able to just jump off of the train and return to the base so why werent the others we even saw miguel jump off like half a second after him yet somehow arrive a good half a minute too late,2023-06-03
"ohh that makes sense i missed that line because the audio mixing was  up and i completely forgot that i didnt really understand what his plan was

man i love how smart and crafty miles is",2023-06-03
it was announced as a two parter,2023-06-03
chavez has a natural power to cross universes these spiderpeople are using imperfect human technology to cross universes that’s probably why chavez and strange blend into the universes they cross magicreality powers vs imperfect human tech which makes you ‘glitch’ because you clearly don’t blend into that universe,2023-06-03
yeah i was ok with all the different versions of animation from these movies i’m just not sure how i feel about live action being mixed in and i kinda wanted these movies to stay separate from the larger mcu but it’s obvious they exist in that universe,2023-06-03
"  at least not when the tool of interdimensional travel is america chavez

 that movie was so lazy

multiverse of madness and what we get is three slightly different versions of new york meanwhile this and everything everywhere all at once ran circles around it",2023-06-04
ohhhhh,2023-06-03
technically it was a different earth that called the main mcu earth616 so the illuminati earth  it up,2023-06-03
yeah i don’t think they intended thatthat’s just me being me,2023-06-04
"miguel is pretty much always written to be super brutal also in the movie he tried to step into another universe to take a guys family that’s not exactly normal behavior  the idea of “canon” is also definitely commentary on how spiderman has been forced to fit into this idea which basically comes down to ticking boxes “bit by a spider mentor dies aunt may etc” 

the canon is pretty inherently flawed when you look at it plenty of spidermen there have yet to go through certain events and they’re doing okay gwen’s dad quit as chief and she’s still a spider hero also blaming miles for getting bit by that spider is way off base the spider went through the super collider no matter what 42 lost their shot at having a spiderman 

miguel’s primary character trait is his arrogance so it seems pretty likely for him to become unhinged when he has hundreds of spidermen chasing miles fail to catch him and miles is doing what he perceives as destroying the multiverse he has very good reason to be  off at least in his perspective",2023-06-04

why are they exposing these heavy heavy topics to little kids this is a kids movie at the end of the day i found it inappropriate for my preteen nephew,2023-06-23
even if trying means the deaths of billions cause i think miguel is wrong isnt realmente a strong argument against thst,2023-06-28
yeah i think a lot of folks misunderstand subtext and metaphors lots of superhero stuff has things that work as lgbt allegories even if the characters themselves are not ,2023-06-05
there are screenshots of a trans flag patch on her dads jacket and a protect trans kids poster above her door thats a little more than cis girl allyship,2023-06-05
in a movie with such tiny drawn details her hair and water color palette being pink blue and white was intentional lol i havent even seen the movie yet but sure will now ,2023-06-05
yeah thats the main thing if youre going to do a multimovie series you have to have smaller contained satisfying arcs in each of the movies with the series arc interlinking and building over the movies,2023-06-12
i hope so cause he went full on comicbook ironman in civil war the comic not the movie and he seem to play judge jury and executioner with the fate of the universe,2023-06-05
i agree i think in the third movie he will come to realize the importance of miles wanting to save his dad he will become a good guy and help save the spiderverse,2023-06-05
miguel is wrong he gone to another miguels world and got the world and all its people killed he had no right to talk about what miles is going to do because miles only saves people,2023-06-05
"i dont get it why do you think he is a  

i think its because both that poster and the writers of the film are in agreement  the poster was picking up what the writers were putting down  it doesnt make sense to me either but it was what was intended  all opposition to a mc is a ",2023-06-05
but its been a long time i seen a super hero movie address lost and grief so  well hope to see more,2023-06-03
"how so in both characters timelines the canon would still happen im assuming just to some other captain rather than their parents

but i guess that wouldnt be really moral because someone still has to die so theyll probably find some other work around i think in the next movie",2023-06-06
" you can tell by the braids he has

what do you mean",2023-06-12
you’re right thanks,2023-06-15
they should have found a better ending point for this one then,2023-06-23
and another major theme is sacrifice,2023-06-24
wdym throw her away its the last movie of the trilogy,2023-06-24
"didnt hobie say gwen had a jumper and a toothbrush still at his place i mean their relationship couldnt have ended that long ago

yes i agree with you on her caring about miles i never said she didnt what i said was that she only considers how she feels at the expense of other characters and everything besides her self

gwen is not like that with hobie are you sure it looked like as you say two characters who have a ton of things in common and are also attracted to each which might lead to occasional bonks here and then especially if they work together and a possible that was a mistake and guilt followed by another night of bonking once in a while

last thing i would say is her wearing those shoes is gross for me personally imagine caring about someone so deeply that you keep your head shaved where they accidentally cut your hair and then keeping the shoes of the guy you occasionally bonk at the same time thats inconsiderate to say the least in my opinion there are other shoes in the multiverse i would imagine yuck",2023-06-02
i hope he interacts with ben reilly at some point,2023-06-02
that wouldnt stop him from being spiderman,2023-06-02
yeah they could have trimmed a bit of the  in the beginning but these movies are so genuinely gorgeous that i cant complain,2023-06-02
it would have definitely been a lot better knowing there was a part 2 going into it i didnt even know the run time and thought the movie was pushing it on time in the end because i knew there was no way the climax could be wrapped up in less than 20 minutes minimum i still think itd have worked better as a show but my opinion seems to be in the minority and thats fine,2023-06-04
ur right  ok same thing i found her voice annoying,2023-06-04
nah this is a wholly sony production only the tom holland live actions ones are coproductions with disney where disney get some money,2023-06-02
key frames are the starts and ends defining a smooth motion so for example miles winding up a punch then miles throwing the punch would be two keyframes and then everything else would be “inbetweens” having miles at a lower frame rate wouldn’t affect the keyframes it would be effecting the amount of inbetweens,2023-06-04
even still its like rrraahhhhhh ya know lol,2023-06-03
alt miles didnt know anything about spiderman miles before be knocked him out and spiderman miles showed nothing but love to uncle aaron showing no signs of hostility so it still doesnt make sense why they treat him so bad,2023-06-05
id agree with you if bagel guy wasnt just a bagel gag for less than a second never have i seen such an immediately fast background thing get so much attention in its sequel comic movie or show,2023-06-12
okay so then why were the spider council trying to stop spot like 5 minutes before they switched to stopping miles from trying to stop spot why did they go to such pains to tell miles that his dad would die with the completely predictable effect that hed try to stop that when making sure it happens is apparently their highest motive,2023-06-03
to give spoilers at least give others a chance to watch the movie before spoiling it,2023-06-02
keep pressing x as our society goes to ,2023-06-02
not even american ,2023-06-04
right but not the prowler yet thats what threw me off its a cameo for a villain he hasnt become yet,2023-06-02
all three of the film are still miles story,2023-06-03
hire fans,2023-06-06
well my brother offered to pay but i told him that it was going to be a 2part movie so we can split but he didnt believe me so i let him pay for the whole thing including the snacks so thank  i didnt pay he was pretty mad that it was actually a 2 part movie,2023-06-02
ahhh,2023-06-03
emma stone spidergwennn huge if happen,2023-06-03
i would rather that then watch an unfinished movie or at least have the decency to put part 1 in the name so people know what they are getting into that 2 hours was wasted btw they could have easily cut an hour of that film and finished it but instead they added ridiculous fluff just to go for a part 2 cash grab absolutely garbage i don’t think i’ve ever seen a movie do that,2023-06-03
yeah the budget is ballpark of a million dollars for every minute of movie,2023-06-02
you think maybe they put donald in a mo cap suit idk i feel like it would be hard to do cgi for motion capture and then put more cgi animation over it,2023-06-02
how can you tell then lol,2023-06-08
smart ill take it,2023-06-02
ahh okay gotcha thank you for the response,2023-06-02
 never mind then lol,2023-06-03
i really doubt the animated movies will have the same multiversal rules as the mcu,2023-06-02
is there a chance of it shifting,2023-06-02
ah that sucks i’ll probably catch it when it comes on streaming then thank you,2023-06-02
animation for sure like they outdid the first movie 10x times i genuienyl didnt enjoy this story as much as the first one 99 chance cause this movie felt like it got split in the middle of a longer movie but the animation was so good i was just looking at each frame with mouth open,2023-06-02
it would feel like they would introduce miles in a long time in the mcu ,2023-06-02
sony is using disney canon and concepts,2023-06-03
you sir or madam are a hero,2023-06-03
"i mean in this movie when she show up we only see peny not the spider and the mecha is emotioneless and unless my eyes deceived me the spider was not there at the end

i think she showed up alone to show that all spidermans lose something and she lost the spider that is why im asking",2023-06-04
 yeah that makes sense,2023-06-03
atsv gwen mj is not unique this gwens mj is black like mcu mj is black,2023-06-03
" a hes stealing parts from miguels universe when hes with miles its implied he is stealing parts to built a separate device

yeah he had been stealing parts to make more than one because he didnt buy into everything miguel was selling",2023-06-03
that was painful,2023-06-03
and i think its gonna be revealed that not all of those spidermen were completely in it  theyre chasing down a kid and miguel is obviously trying to hurt him  theres gonna be that doubt in the back of some of their heads that theyre doing all this to stop a kid,2023-06-03
in the trailer,2023-06-03
i dont understand how you could not notice that even if the writer missed it marvel must have a team of lawyers who check all names to make sure they dont already belong to celebrities or already existing characters,2023-06-03
wow i didn’t realize that connection talk about  massive oversight i’m glad he took his wife’s name at the same time couldn’t he have just been jeffrey davis,2023-06-03
"you got it
i found the frame in this video  1533
",2023-06-03
thanks,2023-06-03
yeah thats what we thought,2023-06-03
"i dont track how that is miles fault  he just got bit in a subway tunnel

that miguel dude seemed like he trying to blame miles for a lot of  because he got bit like it was his choice",2023-06-03
okay but why doesn’t anything happen to his world just asking because i’m not sure if he caused anomalies or something else he did,2023-06-03
is ben dead in 65 because peter may gwen and captain stacy were in gwencaptain stacy’s kitchen in the beginning of the movie but no ben i was wondering if aunt may also died because there was no appearance or mention of her after the flashback memory of the kitchen,2023-06-03
but if both of them are noncanon then how is miles’ dad dying a canon event and how can miles have a canon event if he himself isn’t canon,2023-06-03
march 2029 d,2023-06-03
rakim “guess who’s back”,2023-06-04
but that was also when she thought her dad was going to arrest her,2023-06-04
well all the spider people are destined to lose 1 person tragically beyond that gets more grey  peter parkers lost at least 4 at my count george stacy gwen stacy captain dewolff and uncle ben miles already lost 1 in his uncle and gwen lost her peter parker,2023-06-04
ahhh okay that makes sense thank you ,2023-06-04
i feel like whoever that spider bit has to go through all the things that all the spidermans go through he’s his universe’s miles morales but he’s universe 42’s spiderman he still has to go through the rite of passage of all the spiderman,2023-06-04
gotcha that makes sense thanks i was sitting there kind of confused on that but figured i was thinking about it too much lol,2023-06-04
thanks,2023-06-04
"havent seen it since theaters on release

the first question was irrelevant to that though",2023-06-06
yes sorry totally forgot about that,2023-06-11
i just watched the first one again and miles gets bit like the day before the collider kills spiderman  so realistically earth 42 spider transported bit miles and died regardless of miles interaction and would still leave earth 42 spidermanless  him getting his spiderman killed i can roll with but i’m missing the connection between miles getting bit being his fault,2023-06-12
"sorry yes thats not my question that part totally makes sense i just didnt catch miguels response at all what does miguel say in response to miles after miles calls him tio

thats the part i missed thanks in advance",2023-06-12
"on 1 ahha gotcha thank you

on 2 this makes sense but the only reason he has that meta knowledge is because they told him right i guess i’m confused why miguel would explain the concept of canon events to miles at all… but this feels super nit picky at this point thanks for filling in my knowledge gaps this helped a lot",2023-06-12
it also may lead to the next captain dying i’m not sure if the canon event is spiderpeople’s dad dying as captain or whichever captain it just so happens to be when the canon event takes place,2023-07-07
yes you can give me a little climax than a cliffhanger,2023-11-06
"i would honestly say that i really like across the spider verse a lot more than into the spider verse even though they left the audience on a cliff hanger which i felt ripoffed because i used my hard earn money 

however i would like to see a more updated version of peter parker but with the same production value as the spider verses trilogy or even a whole movie about the other universes spiderman and not just a snippet of a few and their backstories",2023-08-24
"hmm i understand thats not what happened in the film itself but i guess its a reasonable extrapolation of what gwen might have done in her months with the spider society based on what did happen in the movie ie gwen trying to stop miles from disrupting a canon event

that said i do understand if you think its too much of a stretch ",2023-09-23
out of all the peters in the spiderverse hes the best parallel parker,2023-06-11

miguel was a smart  not a smartass,2023-06-02
the irony being that his serious demeanor produced comedy when put into situations with the funny spiderpeople,2023-06-03
miguel isnt a spiderman,2023-06-07
nah miguel isnt a spiderman  theyve already set it up with that offhand comment from miles my bet is were going to find out in the next movie hes a prowler,2023-06-07
talk about an anomoly,2023-06-05
well he accidentally killed billions of people so let’s give him a break,2023-06-07
that was a big red flag for me,2023-06-09
i don’t think he’s a true spiderman we’ve already seen him steal one identity that of a different version of himself think how sick that is of the people you’d delude and what they’d do for you it basically implies he’s a  plus the jazz with injecting himself i wonder if he’s artificially given himself powers,2023-06-18
im convinced hes not actually a spiderman i think well see some popular xmen characters in the beyond movie and this version of miguel will be revealed to be wolverine,2023-11-05
its because hes not really spiderman hes the punisher in disguise,2023-07-06
ramos also voiced max in the english version i only thought it was part of the latin dub that included youtubers and influencers,2023-06-02
really thats so cool love ramos style,2023-06-03
that is what that means but  isnt used that way in spanish,2023-07-16
in literal translations yeah but its a word that means different things with context,2023-07-17
yeah and the first chase at that,2023-06-04
and the chase started after he got there so technically the chase was brought to him,2023-06-28
it was miles ran past a sign that said “strength and conditioning” before running across the ‘bridge’,2023-06-06

eric voss is probably the best of the youtube sub genre he at least knows what he’s talking about it’s better than the likes of screencrush screenrant and watch mojo,2023-06-04

it’s currently set to release march 29 2024,2023-06-03
i think when i first saw it i just figured the glitch had to do with it being radioactive and then upon subsequent rewatches i just never questioned that assumption,2023-06-04
when miles’ first meets the peter parker of his universe and they have their spidey sense moment the colour scheme behind miles is initially the same dominant purple and green hues associated with the prowler until they eventually become spiderman’s classic blue and red,2023-06-07
i dont think thats true gwen said that the wristband helped her not glitch when she was in other dimensions and jessica threw one to miles to help him not glitch when he was at headquarters the first time the group glitched together in the first movie made it seem like it wasnt their first time,2023-06-07
oh my gosh of course it totally fits with the fact that the collider pulled in a bunch of spider people instead of a bunch of peter parkers i wonder if they’ll explain why spiderness trumped peter parkerness the first time the collider operated but the second time it was kingpin’s family’s dna that determined who was brought from the parallel universes,2023-06-10
there was a spiderman the blonde peter parker voiced by chris pine who died at the start of itsv in atsv miguel believes that peter would have survived if he hadnt had to save miles,2023-06-22
"late to the party but yes you are right

there are two spider men in miles universe and none in the universe the spider came from",2023-07-02
the universe being in an entirely new shade of color and mama commenting on his hair gave me a tip that something was off,2023-06-05
the go home machine says earth 42 and not 160xx or whatever the ultimate designation is in this movie,2023-06-21
"what tipped me off was when miles was talking to his mom htere was a decent amount of light in his room because his door was open and the light was on in the hall 

in his original universe while gwen was waiting outside his room miles room was completely black as his mom hadnt opened his room to go in there",2023-07-05
"like it was the biggest rug pull

because it was definitely a rug pull from miles perspective  plus you have dummies like me that couldnt put two and two together until youre beaten over the head with it",2023-06-02
i was convinced right when he entered the universe because of the colors being different and the rain i thought it was reillys universe because it fit the 90s edge but they convinced me out of it when it went on for so long and gwen was following him i thought oh i guess its just a really rainy night in his dimension interesting until his mom commented on his hair,2023-06-03
"despite clearly showing miles was being sent to universe 42 by the machine

i asked my family i was the only one who noticed",2023-06-03
yeah but the funny part is i kind of forgot like i was like why are they showing this tense scene with miguel miles is clearly in another dimension but when the conversation with the mom happened i am just like oh hes back home i guess,2023-06-02
"i appreciated that it kind of worked both ways i noticed the 42 so i was waiting for it the whole time i think the feeling of dread you get when you watch miles fighting to make it while knowing he’s so so far from home is very effective i think that if you hadn’t noticed or if you forgot about universe 42 you get to feel the shock along with miles which works really well too

maybe this is far fetched but i feel like it recreates the parentchild perspectives that they were emphasizing the whole movie the parent watches the child do something they know will go poorly despite good intentions with dread but acknowledges the child’s lack of knowledgewisdom the child experiences the event for the first time and feels the shock in its entirety",2023-06-03
i went isnt 42 the dimension his spider is from oh  and then when it kept going i started double guessing myself if maybe id gotten misremembered which number was his and which the spiders i thought it worked really well with the is itisnt it,2023-06-04
"honestly i think most people just missed the split second of the machine saying universe 42 like i did there’s just so much going on at times in a good way that i’m trying to take in 15 different things at once in this beautifully animated film that i just glossed over it saying that because i was focused on something else in the scene in that brief moment there were a lot of moments that i caught and my friend didn’t catch and vice versa so for you you saw it the whole time but for me i didn’t see the signpost and so it was a rug pull 

brilliant film but i definitely was sensory overloaded at times too haha can’t wait to watch again",2023-06-04
"there was just a lot going on to keep up so a lot of ppl including myself definitely saw that hes being sent back to earth 42 but didnt register thats not his universe 

and even if you picked up on that it still has another surprise for everyone which is who is prowler in that universe",2023-06-04
by that point i had long forgotten what number miles’ universe was supposed to be so the twist was a big surprise especially since the interspersed shots of gwen made it seem like she was listening to him instead of outside a different empty bedroom,2023-06-04
it was for me i dont even know the universe numbers,2023-08-27
wow great spot wish i had rewatched the first one before seeing this,2023-06-03
the “it’s a banksy” after they successfully stop the helicopter had my whole theater laughing out loud as well that entire sequence was amazingly done,2023-06-04
pretty sure it wasn’t an adlib since it’s a line from the first movie,2023-06-03
its actually the exact same soundbite from the first movie during the banksy joke,2023-06-03
glad i’m not the only one noticed that,2023-06-09
yes my thoughts exactly,2023-06-16
peter b is supposed to be ‘default’ spiderman so it makes sense,2023-06-03
"i saw it more as he got away because he doesn’t think like a spider man per se they do keep commenting “what is he doing where is he going” so what i got from that is that because he’s not a spiderman he is unpredictable to them and escapes their clutches 

there’s something to be said about the recurring theme in the film of identity and labelling theory the thing that is no doubt holding the spider society back is that they’ve almost resigned themselves to be spider people down to their pre conceived lore and despite their costumes and their gadgets are not allowing themselves to break out from what they’re “meant” to be",2023-06-02
he’s the rickest rick spiderest spiderman,2023-06-03
conservation of spiderjutsu in universe i dont think he is meant to be the strongest but its just that most spiderman powers are more adept to getting away than catching people and the spiderguys are not trying to hurt him too bad overall and maybe also dont have their hearts into attacking the kid,2023-06-07
is he even spiderman,2023-06-04
eloquently put i’ve been trying to put it into words since it really rings wrong to me when people express that miguel is a villain when he’s really just trying desperately to be the hero since the last time he failed to do so countless lives including those of his alt family were wiped away,2023-06-04
you put this beautifully,2023-06-03
the idea that he could have saved his alternate family and just failed to do so is probably also so painful to imagine that he just rejects the notion outright if canon events can be ignored then they died unnecessarily,2023-06-03
it’s kinda like high evolutionary from gotg3 so set in his ways until an outside force shifts the paradigm not in his favor,2023-06-02
i mean he literally says hes sacrificed too much to stop now,2023-06-04
i’m super late to the game but i don’t think his dad is fated to die in 42 the dad dies despite there being no spiderman our miles was never meant to be spiderman so there’s no reason for his dad to die the problem is now that miles got involved spot and probably 42 miles want his dad dead so it’s not a matter of faith but the consequences of his actions at least that’s my read on it,2023-11-21
miguel may have made some sort of other huge mistake or just isnt 100p sure what canon means and might just be projecting his traumas on others,2023-06-04
i mean how is the actual radioactive spider disappearing from the universe not a canonbreaking event shouldn’t earth 42 have already collapsed,2023-06-12
especially since gwen’s canon event was her friend dying and not the police captain or her uncle like the others she was breaking canon way before,2023-06-04
"i guess miguel selected for those that would agree with his mission 

and also those who had already had their canon events and so would find the idea that their suffering was necessary and destined to be comforting 

its kind of a selffulfilling maladaptive trauma response i hope we get to see more of the other spiderpeoples perspective as gwen flips more of them in beyond the spider verse we can already see she flipped a couple penny spiderbyte peter",2023-06-09
i mean it’s complicated you kind of need somebody so dedicated to their mission that they’re an “unhinged maniac” if you’re running a organization with the literal fate of the universe on its hands and it’s not like he isn’t right…,2023-06-12
wait is 2099 the year or the universe number,2023-06-07
my personal theory is that because miles is not supposed to be spiderman ie he was bit by a spider from another universe hes already not bound by the laws of canon anyway,2023-06-05
how does this relate to kang,2023-06-04
you didnt respond at what he asked which is miguel ohara origin story guess you arent a comic book reader,2023-06-04
"well no spiderman 2099 is saying there are fixed points in a spidermans life where someone dies they dont happen the universe dies

thats not killing anyone thats not interfering with natural law to prevent a catastrophy 

thanos was just a madman  if you  half of all life on earth you just say things back a generation or so youre not really saving anyone of course in reality since hes killing all flora and fauna hes actually collapsing the ecosystem of planets triggering an extinction event  since you eat plants and animals if he dusted half of those then youd still have the same shortage",2023-06-14
yeah man  didn’t know that  i guess i’ll go  myself   tor trying to have a fun thought,2023-06-04
"eeh too many clues in this movie that he isnt

first parker says youre the only spiderman not funny

then miles says you have claws are you sure youre a spider man

he might not be",2023-08-08
"hes clearly morbius

or i need to rewatch the movie because i vaguely recall noticing an icon on the prowlers suit having a shape reminiscent of what miguel had on the back of his suit",2023-06-05
that was exactly my thought,2023-06-05
"miles’ problem isn’t that he tried to save the other spiderman’s parents the problem is that he succeeded miguel understands how the multiverse works and paid a steep price for making a similar mistake he believes miles will  off his entire universe if he saves his dad 

regardless of what spiderman stands for he’s never been capable of saving everybody including his loved ones miguel understands the big picture it doesn’t make him a villain or evil and i think the movie missed the mark by not addressing the situation with the nuance it deserved",2023-06-04
that’s fair from his perspective miles is risking billions of lives to save one i think the fact that they’re all super powered beings kinda lessens the impact of him fighting a kid plus miles was fine but i see where you’re coming from,2023-06-04
i was guessing miguel has a paralysing venom bite and that the was trying to put renaissance vulture down,2023-06-04
yes avoiding all movie trailers has absolutely increased my enjoyment of movies 10 fold it’s awesome to go in blind,2023-06-03
this is the best way to see any movie my most intense and memorable movie moments were watching a movie completely blind i cover my ears and close my eyes when i sit through a trailer for a movie i want to see at this point,2023-06-03
dear gwen by the time you read this,2023-06-05
literally reminded me of reservoir dogs too it was genuinely unnerving and i cant wait to see that part in beyond the spider verse,2023-06-13
bingo,2023-06-07
i don’t think that was an actual intended detail ,2023-06-03

a large portion of anarchists are communists,2023-06-05
most anarchists are at a minimum syndicalists and a lot are anarcho communists government isnt needed for communism only the vanguard types of it,2023-06-07
anarchism is a socialist ideology seizing the means of production is very much an anarchist thing,2023-06-13

what are you the creator,2023-06-03
boo theyre both masterpieces,2023-06-04
what was it he said again exactly something about how he was just gonna ignore him because he couldnt be bothered to deal with him,2023-06-04
thanks was unsure what to call it,2023-06-05
this movie taught me that naan means bread i hate that no one has corrected me before,2023-06-05
"it’s honestly fine and depends on the individual

i’ve never met another chinese person who got mad at americans saying “chow mien noodles” and i’ve never thought twice about it either i’m from taiwan

for reference “chow mien” is a really bastardized pronunciation and spelling for the chinese words “fried noodles”

i think it really depends on the word lol these examples exist in other languages too everyone does it",2023-06-08
it literally doesn’t matter,2023-06-14
it’s really not naan is just a specific type of bread i don’t know where this story started…it’s like saying focaccia bread or panini bread,2023-06-25
i’d like the meet the  who design that city and punch them in the face  like do they not have earthquakes in this universe or what,2023-06-08
its more not wanting to acknowledge it happened at all,2023-06-03
some of them yeah while some just prefer not to talk about it yeah i can see that line not really ringing with certain brits but  em itll hit in literally every other country on earth,2023-06-04
heh not like americans are any different loud and proud of them,2023-06-04
three days late but yes  or at the very least don’t acknowledge it’s significance with anything approaching respect,2023-06-06
yeah same one of my favourite memes has it as the punchline after all,2023-06-04
"whats my blud waffling about


nothing wrong with making jokes about britains past every country has had a bad one well almost besides its funny and thats whats most important maybe if i was white i wouldnt think it was but oh well still briish unfortunately",2023-06-04
taking a joke sounds like such a struggle nah it doesnt need to be super deep to justify its existence it was funny it made us laugh and thats good enough,2023-06-04
going to be tough finding someone that can live up to how miles act in the animation version,2023-06-02
feels like they kinda blew their load having a finister five in nwh actual sinister six just feels like a retread,2023-06-07
they did literally namedrop them via jjjj in the endscene with prowlermiles didnt they,2023-06-27
youuuuuu cant escape from meeeeeeeeee,2023-06-07
which if he pops in there it means that the venom verse has to have a spiderman there somewhere,2023-06-03
is that the one with the lady in the shop it felt like i was missing something in that scene,2023-06-04
the gum he grabs is brocks venomint,2023-06-09
it would just be a different style to them their home universe is the live action universe to them,2023-06-04
“lego spiderman universe” just typing that brought a smile to my face,2023-06-05
yep they did another reference in that vein i really liked was ganke playing spiderman 2 in the dorm room,2023-06-04
doesn’t have to be,2023-06-05
there just downvoting you instead of telling you but it’s because donald glover wore a spiderman suit in community and he was the inspiration for miles so him also being prowler in one universe is foreshadowing that this miles would be the prowler in another,2023-06-04
thats it,2023-06-06
dude i was thinking that the whole time also the vintage 70s era panel was reminiscent of watchmen if you’ve read the series,2023-06-05
i dont think so when he shows up at the art museum it shows his shoulders having imperfect lines that go past where they should it seems like a stylistic choice to me,2023-06-06
post malone voices the line plus he also made the song sunflower for the first movie,2023-06-07
"i legit rotated my head when mayday was hanging upside down pointing out the window

but also same with what you said",2023-06-07
"i think the squad will fight the sinister six miles prowler on earth 42 
the tv was talking about them during the two miles scene",2023-06-03
you missed the most important member of all mayday parker,2023-06-04
all we need is italian spiderman and that movie will be perfection,2023-06-03
most likely jessica will join also,2023-06-02
only 5 years to go,2023-06-03
it was 100 different much more humanoid,2023-06-02
yes thats how the original gerard ways version looked in the comics,2023-06-02
its basically the original comic design for both her and the mech im so happy because it  hard,2023-06-02
yeah cause her mech got destroyed in the final fight of the first film,2023-06-02
when gwen and miles were chilling upside down looking at the city skyline did it remind you of tokyo 3 at all the skyscrapers upside down or was that just me,2023-06-02
it was all the spideys who helped miles throughout this film and the last including spiderbyte iirc,2023-06-03
you are right seen this movie a bunch but i never caught that i thought the scene was him fiddling with it,2023-06-02
also he was showing the cube to his people in the credits lol,2023-06-03
that was the opening for me when gwen was talking through heavy drumming no clue what she said at the end,2023-06-02
the spanish was oddly quietfast and sorta muffled tho i dont speak it i can normally pick out the individual words but it was strange this time,2023-06-03
gwen’s opening talk was drowned out at times in my imax theater noticed a few times the mix was weird but other than that sound design was impeccable,2023-06-04
to me i think it was the accent this movie requires you to register a lot of information at one time,2023-06-05
to me i think it was the accent this movie requires you to register a lot of information at one time,2023-06-05
i was at an imax and the beginning monolog by gwen was drowned out by the drums ive never been to an imax so i thought it was just that,2023-06-02
same i looked it up while watching the opening scene and found loads of people on other forums saying how quiet it was at their showing lol so i decided to ask the theater to turn up the volume they actually seemed to do so and it sounded much better although dialogue was still drowned out at times it’s definitely a problem with the mixing for the actual movie,2023-06-05
just mandem things ye seriously tho i would be in the same boat as you if i didnt move to the uk for the past year,2023-06-02
ok i really had this problem too and i thought my ears are just messed up,2023-06-03
weird it was so quiet especially in the beginning i had thought it was a theater error,2023-06-03
i too have been watching only bbc this month,2023-06-02
the mandemwas what made me sit up and take him seriously as a london based spiderman and that the voice actor must def be an actual brit im so happy that hes black too because i feel like the stereotype brit punk is almost always white,2023-06-13
for sure ,2023-06-12
also he probably knew they were tracking the bracelets,2023-06-04
holy  i never thought of that,2023-06-02
music was  vibe too metro did not miss one bit,2023-06-05
butt grippies are now canon,2023-06-04
that bothered me too for a second and then i realised she was probably just pulling herself up by the webs the stickiness clearly works wholebody but its still less of a pain to pull yourself up by web than do an upsidedown squat to get your sticky self in touch with the building,2023-06-04
yeah it seemed like the thought was how could a spider person sit upside down and then they realized but then they have to do stuff,2023-06-04
because only spidermen cold use an hq like that,2023-06-02
its not upside down they just use all of the space  the lobby itself is rightside up and spiderpeople are basically on all surfaces,2023-06-03
i adore the theme of this movie so much spiderman breaking out of his chains of “canon” is so beautiful i want to see spiderman be happy no character deserves to more than him especially when his entire history is his happiness being quashed at every turn so for a gwen and a spiderman to be happy together is perfect so is peter b being happy with a kid breaking the status quo of spiderman,2023-06-04
the shoulder touch call back ,2023-06-03
 i love their character designs so freaking aesthetically pleasing,2023-06-03
okay im glad im not the only one i got actually nauseous during that scene which i was mad at because it was super beautiful haha,2023-06-03
i think one last reason is because prime marvel comics universe miles is meant to be more of a hispanic gangster seems like its a reference to that as well,2023-06-08
i think with the loss of his dad he spoke to his mom more in spanish,2023-06-06
of a black latino teen,2023-06-04
so we just not gonna talk about your username,2023-06-02

"this could literally be them

",2023-06-10
my first thought,2023-06-20
id be mad as  if i looked at a doppelganger of me that technically look the exact same but factually infinitely more badass,2023-06-03
pretty sure they were j’s,2023-06-02
ah i focused on the blue on the top of the front bit i see now,2023-06-02
jordan 1,2023-06-04
yeah we googled it too but i went to an advance screening so i didnt trust it lol,2023-06-02
you live 2 hours from a movie theater,2023-06-03
no,2023-06-04
babies like literal human babies born to the crewcast during producion,2023-06-13
coulda sworn he said store,2023-06-03
which seemed off to me if manhattan is indian in the movie doesn’t that mean india was the colonizer in that universe,2023-08-09
can you tell us more about how you or other indians felt about the movie,2023-06-06
i mean it’s no british museum but the met’s got its share of stolen stuff too,2023-06-04
and here i was thinking that it was a universe where india took over half the world rather than britain,2023-06-09
,2023-06-11
i took it as a walk hard the dewey cox story joke schwartzman played ringo in the scene where dewey goes to india to visit the beatles,2023-06-11
plus as far as im aware going to india for selfdiscovery is absolutely an american thing as well eat pray love exists for crying out loud,2023-06-03
i didnt get the other reference but i know someone who did that so it got a laugh out of me,2023-06-03
i was in london and there was a mild english chuckle a shameful one,2023-06-15
its definitely both,2023-06-03
would it be more worrying if morbius was actually just good in miles home universe,2023-06-02
i dug how purple that universe was,2023-06-02
no taste playing aint no love in the heart of the city is tasteless for you,2023-06-03
i mean spot basically went into a rant when he went into venom universe,2023-06-03
i’d upvote this but it’s at 42,2023-06-10
the change in the timeline is that they cast tom hanks as morbius and his charisma and charm made all the difference while tom hardy was busy filming the 4th movie in the inception franchise to do venom,2023-06-03
"dont think so i thought about that for quite some time but the scenes we saw of him alone show that his backstory is true not to mention how he confronts miles and works with the rest of the spiderpeople

i dont think spiderpeople is accurate btw a trex a cat im hoping to see spidersman",2023-06-02
chose the best venom character to use with miss chen lol,2023-06-03
"hello peter from nwh played and miguel referenced nwh and doctor strange 

there wasnt an actual holland appearance tho",2023-06-03
calling it now miguel is going to be the one to save miles’ dad and break a canon event,2023-06-03
understood makes sense why i mixed them though both are longe darkhaired vampires whose name starts with mor,2023-06-04
"a path towards rmovies

this gave me a good chuckle",2023-06-02
and you can do nothing to stop it this is a canon event,2023-06-04
a pathway to many discussions and opinions many of which others would consider to be unnatural,2023-06-04
only let her access it through a 3rd party app and watch a supervillain origin story emerge,2023-06-04
we are all dark miles on this cursed day,2023-06-05
this is the canon version of making villains in our world,2023-06-10
she could not live with your failure and where did that bring her to rmovies,2023-12-04
villain origin story right there,2023-06-04
it felt like 30 minutes and i have a short attention span and hadnt even taken my meds,2023-06-02
i was relieved to see it scheduled for 2024 instead of like 2026,2023-06-04
yeah but the plot of back to the future 2 was entirely resolved in that movie,2023-06-11
you were too young to see infinity wars in cinemas but youre posting on reddit good  im old,2023-06-04
"“who’s spiderman”

me internally “here it comes to be continued that’s great cause i gotta ”

movie continues

me “”",2023-06-02
"same here

there were so many scenes in the last 15 minutes miles realizing hes on earth42 miles realizing this is a spidermanless world and then being knocked out by a new prowler gwen promising to find miles the spidersociety arriving on earth 42 miles42 is the prowler the spot returns that felt like they could have been major cliffhangers and yet the film was determined to keep in going and setting up more for beyond the spiderverse",2023-06-02
same i thought they would end with miles and gwen alone after the dad speech but it still had plenty of things to show,2023-06-02
same i knew something was up with the pacing 2 hours in and we weren’t even close to the end of the 2nd act i guess the next movie will be the whole 3rd act or maybe the 3rd act will be the prologue like gwen’s this time,2023-06-03
i had absolutely no idea there was going to be a second part so i was shocked when we got the to be continued,2023-06-04
i had been looking forward to this movie since last year didnt really look at articles or news surrounding it and eventually stopped looking at the new clips that kept dropping cos i didnt want to get spoiled too much uncharacteristic for me i fully thought they were pulling an everything everywhere all at once and stubbornly remained in my seat before finally googling the ending lol,2023-06-02
"i like knowing as little as possible about a movie going in so i was all set for the grand finale and the to be continued left me kinda disappointed tbh 

the exact same thing happened to me when i watched infinity war",2023-06-07
i feel like for the last 30 minutes any one of those scenes felt like it was threatening to cut to credits and then i finally got comfortable enough thinking they were really gonna finish it out and it surely hadnt been 140 minutes yet and then wham,2023-06-02
i mean originally it was going to be labeled as part 1 they only changed the titles last year,2023-06-02
as soon as miles escaped and was being hunted and gwen was banished i just absorbed the rest of the movie in terror that it was about to abruptly end at a few different moments i never wanted this move to end,2023-06-02
the first trailer called it part 1 haha,2023-06-02
i’m glad they didn’t title it part 1 the surprise was honestly kinda hype,2023-06-02
"it was during the miles escape scene that i got the feeling and turned to my wife and said im really not ready for the to be continued were about to get

it just didnt feel like there was going to be enough time to wrap it all up successfully and i know they werent the type to take the lazy route",2023-06-02
i thought it was going to end as soon as they reveal prowler to be miles ,2023-06-02
it was definitely this movie is ending now music haha i was dreading it when that started playing,2023-06-04
" really should’ve had that part 1 in the title

you really shouldnt make a movie without a real ending though either they have multiple stories going you could have solved one of them to end the movie and then teased the third one",2023-06-05
i think it was better they didnt  i was one of those guys who didnt watch any trailersspoilers going in and i legit got fooled by the 3rd act reveal thinking it was going to conclude with a showdown  that to be continued was so good to me since i knew the story needed more time to be told,2023-06-04
i did a quick time check when it was such a slow reveal of universe 42 prowler even though it was obviously miles and was like “oh no”,2023-06-06
i dunno if they put part 1 everyone would be expecting a cliffhanger think this set it up better as it caught everyone off guard and now their even more pumped,2023-06-11
im glad they didnt i had no idea going in and only figured it out when i realized there were too many loose ends to wrap up 2 hours in,2023-06-02
yeah there were a few like the reveal like ok heres the cut wait no wait what,2023-06-02
as soon as she started going you could sense the vibe i was like oh no how long has it been is this how its going to end  only disappointment in the entire film,2023-06-07
part 1 in the title would have ruined it because then people are anticipating a cliffhanger ending people might be  at the end of it but it makes the movie more thrilling not knowing how or when it will end,2023-08-23
well it was announced as part 1 and 2 before the actual title was released,2023-06-02
no it stands on its own i believe,2023-06-02
can i just say though how much i love that they gave all of those moments the room they needed to breathe like one of the things i was worried about coming in was that this would be so jam packed they’d lose the heart and instead they really let us live in those moments between miles and his supporting cast and gwen with her dad and all of those moments made the film so much richer rio’s speech to miles and gwen’s last scene with her dad in particular were amazing moments and they benefited a ton from not feeling even a little rushed,2023-06-02
iw felt more completed though like thanos being the protagonist completed what he was set out to do,2023-06-02
5 hours here too but in my dimension there was a seizure instead of a fire alarm i think the person is alright though thankfully,2023-06-02
our fire alarm rang halfway through i thought it was the end for me,2023-06-02
i had the urge to  a little over an hour in i don’t know how i held it together,2023-06-06
hahahaha tbh every usher for any marvel movie should do this just for the convenience lol,2023-06-05
id do it if they let me use across credits as a  break,2023-06-03
"i let out a son of a 

and im still  angry

i only saw it today ",2023-06-04
simpsons did it,2023-06-07
"but how like did you think that only an hour had passed at that point or that theyd be able to resolve the plot in 10 minutes or so

im not trying to be an  im genuinly confused why so many people were surprised by the to be continued at that point in the movie",2023-06-11
i think the biggest issue was that it was a straight cliffhanger like a season of lost as opposed to the more modern take on seasonal tv where things tend to wrap up a main story but then light a new fire for the following season  if you’re gonna cut it so sharply you sort of owe it to your audience to put “part 1” in the title,2023-06-05
thr first ever trailer mentions it being a part 1,2023-06-03
"there is no imminent threat or battle at the end of empire 

the montage at the end of this has rallied everyone and miles was ready to escape theyre not comparable at all",2023-06-04
not a good excuse if you can’t handle taking that heat the movie likely never needed 2 parts,2023-06-02
well sure if youre going to end your movie on a cliffhanger of course i might think about waiting until i can just watch both but either tell me thats what im getting into or you know dont do that because its dumb,2023-06-05
i wouldn’t have gone if i’d known it was a part 1 the movie wastes so much time faffing about they could’ve easily cut an hour and lost nothing of value to the actual story and to not even have the decency to actually have an ending,2023-06-07
i wouldn’t have wasted money to see it in theaters so i guess that’s true,2023-06-05
it was for when it was supposed to come out this time last year then they changed the names of this and part 2 so if you hadnt remembered ad campaigns that started 2 years ago youd be none the wiser,2023-06-07
"right its hard to imagine since everything relies on carrying the thread into the next film 

i compared it to infinity war  and endgame part 1  2 both connected but they each feel like complete films endgame continues the story but infinity war had a clear beginning middle and end

the thing that irked me here is that you had a 1010 movie that stops right as things get interesting leaving me feeling empty watching it im not a fan of cliffhangers as i think theyre lazy unless done at a great twist that wraps up the previous plot threads while unraveling another 

i think the best thing wouldve been to give it another 1520 mins have the spider teams fight spot reemerges cut to miles in captivity with prowler miles and cut back to spot reaching full form tearing the multiverse open into darkness end it there",2023-06-02
i also thought it would end when the shot with milesgwenmiguels gang on the rooftop happened,2023-06-05
i was exactly like that leaving the movie  vocally so  but i rewatched the first and this one absolutely blows the first out of the water elevated everything about it still not my favorite ending tie between guardians 3 and flash but everything before that was great,2023-06-09
"it really really needed a scene where miles and miguel just interacted for a while alone or gwen could come too maybe they couldve gone to some universe looking for clues idk

as it is now miles meets miguel he tells him about the multiverse immediately tries to  him there should have been something in between maybe they couldve cut the last 15 mins of the movie to make space",2023-06-03
"right every time i talked about the movie with people they say its different because iw wasnt a part 1 but it serves as a part 1 to a whole story including endgame 

i felt miffed leaving the theatre but this was a much better film than into the spiderverse and if they nail the 3rd well have the greatest trilogy in film imo",2023-06-20
that wasn’t me but… he was me,2023-06-05
easily missable for me i wouldn’t have wasted money seeing this in the theater if i knew the movie was going to finish with “insert more credits to continue” i paid for one full  movie idk who tf sony thinks they are but they aren’t getting one over on me again can’t do anything right except video games,2023-06-05
it didnt leave me wanting more maybe a bit but in a bad way,2023-06-05
did the exact same haha my first reaction was  and after a bit i was happy this fully confirmed another movie of this art piece of a movie series some of if not my most favourite movies,2023-06-02
been doing this cause of no way home i thought how crazy it would have been to go in almost completely blind for no way home have not regretted the decision all these movies are so much more enjoyable without seeing trailers that give away so much now a days,2023-06-02
"i hadn’t even seen the first one my buddy just described the plot and they went over it so much in this movie it was real easy to connect the dots

i was  they hit me with a tbd",2023-06-03
same my absolute avoidance of promo for movies made me so surprised at it being part 1,2023-06-02
wish i stayed away from the trailer because it heavily gave away the fact that miles would rather save his dead than save his universe there were many other surprises along the way but i’m surprised they showed that,2023-06-03
same i don’t watch trailers anymore because  they all give away too much these days i literally had no idea there was a 3rd one planned until the movie ended i definitely understand people being annoyed but this was fun for me i don’t mind the cliffhanger,2023-06-04
same,2023-06-02
i also forgot it was part 1 of 2 but wasnt mad at it it just made me more hype   what if we get a live action miles ,2023-06-02
lots of people just like going to the movies even if its something theyre only mildly interested in and at release and its me the premiere crowds are the best and i just prefer watching stuff in theaters i was hyped for this movie but i had that described experience for evil dead rise,2023-06-02
i would count myself among those i saw the first one loved it enough that i knew i’d see the sequel whenever it came out without following any of the marketing or buildup to it and found myself free on the thursday evening it premiered in the moment i never felt that a movie totally lost me in the final seconds before after sleeping on it and learning that it was supposed to be part 1 and the studio changed the titles i was more okay with it but still hard cut to black after introducing even more conflict in the final minutes of a movie with no real resolution to any of the major plot threads is asking a lot of an audience to the point that i will avoid seeing beyond until reviews come out and i am assured that they did stick the landing,2023-06-02
"eh my dad is definitely casual but he goes every thursday to watch a new movie because he has nothing better to do when i worked at the movies a ton of old people did that every thursday morning as well 

but i can guarantee my dad doesnt know  about spiderman besides the most basic stuff",2023-07-19
some ppl just aint into banterjokes,2023-06-02
the direction for the next movie is hans friends leaving to rescue him its pretty similar to this one where gwen gathers her friends to rescue miles maybe it would have been stronger if it ended with him finding out hes in the wrong universe instead of about to fight the prowler but i doubt that fight is going to be as pivotal as people think,2023-06-03
only miles went to earth42,2023-06-11
"thats not exactly how that works frame rates and refresh rates sometimes hz sometimes called other stuff are two separate things eg you can have a tv refreshing 60 times per second showing a 30 fps film  it just means the image on the tv changes every other refresh so compared to a 60hz showing 60fps it will look a little stiffer

so the movie was being projected or however you watched it at a steady probably 60hz to have different characters at different fps just means their own animations were updated less often  this was done in the first spiververse when peter b and miles are running away together i believe miles is in a lower fps  that is he has fewer frames of animation or he has fewer frames where hes moving so he looks stiff compared to peter b

a screen absolutely cant refresh at different rates simultaneously but what you want is a screen refreshing at a very very stable rate and then you have the actual media doing whatever it is designed to do under that you can technically have a 120fps even on a 60hz screen but you dont get to see the difference since you only get up to 60 screen refreshes per second no matter what",2023-06-04
"1st one i thought of spiderverse coco and the new  are the 3 movies to me that has the best animation

spiderverse for the art style  for the effects and effects they do and coco is for the pure beautiful art they do",2023-06-17

games have lower budgets and less monetary risk as a result if you keep spending 100 million dollars on projects you’d better make sure it makes it back or the studio could shut down this is why most blockbuster movies nowadays are made by a committee and not creators or visionaries,2023-06-11

"that one got an audible chuckle out of me and with lego jk simmons

all was right with the world for those 2 hours",2023-06-02
i just love that the joke is kind of akin to what humor was in the lego movies in this particular scene of the movie not surprising considering they have the same directors but still a great detail,2023-06-02
it’s the same writers btw,2023-06-03

it was just fun seeing it with my friends they were suprised when i told them about it i saw the movie twice back to back today it was great",2023-06-02
"nah i wasn’t officially involved

i made the minifig design and eye rig for my own project a couple years ago  and the animator ended up using it in the film

i published the minifig design and eye rig online for free so anyone could use them",2023-06-02
nah no one reached out the animator just used it i posted it online for free use tho,2023-06-12
thank you,2023-11-04
universal constants uncle dies police captain dies jjj voiced by jk simmons,2023-06-02
youre right all the audio for lego jj was from the raimi movies,2023-06-02
correct it was directly lifted,2023-06-05
i just realized that the outline of a human that miles spray paints on the wall in the first movie looks like the spot when his body starts to lose shape,2023-06-02
the last scene showing spot at his final form was my favorite part of the movie the art was a masterpiece,2023-06-02
i loved it so much rooting for spot and all his holes,2023-06-02
it reminded me of full metal alchemist brotherhood and the scenes in front of the gate and the truth it’s like he gained some new universal omnipresence and it completely shifted his whole body mind and soul kinda his voice changing and i almost thought he got bigger,2023-06-03
"in the scene inside of himself you can see that he still has the circles drawn in that you use for figure drawing  you can see the head circle and the circles for the shoulders 

then he turns into a junji ito character…",2023-06-04
i was expecting leopardon cameo when spot turning into antispiral,2023-06-02
feel like they took some inspiration from annihilation,2023-06-02
reminded me alot of goodnight pun pun pure dread,2023-06-03
my friend said he looked exactly like his sleep paralysis demon,2023-06-07
he becomes a black hole tearing through the page itself,2023-06-12
super reminiscent of mob psycho,2023-06-17
gave me real gurren lagan vibes there at the end,2023-06-13
"i think they did miguels character well he wants to save the world as well but hes just more hardened by his past and somewhat blind to his own flaws

both factions of spider people have understandable motives for what theyre doing

spot evolving to be more terrifying as the movie went on was great as well",2023-06-02
totally,2023-06-02
it really takes hold and immerses you which is why i understand why people are saying the live action bits are so jarring but little things i’m realizing like miguel’s design being complete but you can still see outlines of the bare figure drawings of that makes sense on him the items made in his universe etc really lead you in how does it make sense that hobies portal is gonna work it’s designed “after him” now that’s he’s took over it and i had a feeling of unease when miles went home because the color was similar but off from the world we spent all our time in in the first movie it’s so goooood,2023-06-03
had big junji ito vibes for me,2023-06-03
i actually thought the ps4 spider man jj did an admiral job,2023-06-10
thats why the andrew garfield movies failed,2023-06-05
"it’s almost

it’s almost like

it’s almost like heightened reality comic book  can play a lot better in a heightened reality",2023-06-05
i showed my sister the first movie a few days ago in preparation for this one and i was legit mad when she pretty much said she wished it was live action really makes me think about the disrespect and prejudices many people have about animation,2023-06-11
"the spot had 1 year with his powers and he could barely control them it wasnt until being offended by myles dismissals that he actually bothers to learn them and becomes incredibly efficient in a single day 

had myles show him a bit of respect things wouldnt have turned out like they did",2023-06-20

it was so so gorgeous man,2023-07-04
spot is from miles dimension and brought the spider over from 42 we dont know anything about 42 peter yet,2023-06-02
that peter parker was killed by kingpin in the first one,2023-06-02
it explicitly says that spot was an alchemax scientist from miless dimension the one who got hit with the bagel in into the spiderverse it wouldnt make sense for him to have been the destined earth42 spidey get transported to miless turf and immediately get incorporated into the collider research team,2023-06-04
idk why but i was thinking that spider was always supposed to bite miles it just bit the wrong one,2023-06-03
" the only other scene that came close was when gwen and miles were sitting upside down overlooking new york



this is one of my favorite scenes as well",2023-06-03
that scene looked beautiful to me it was so relaxing and simple but they slowly transition their worlds flipping and then eventually we see two people connecting,2023-06-11
i really like every scene where the spierpeople just casually ignore gravity and conventional movement,2023-06-23
aww thanks i’m just a random person who loves movies and makes art about them you can usually find me reading through all the official movie discussion threads d,2023-06-10
i can’t do it the justice it deserves and my tiny bit of gwen fan art that i already did is all i have time for,2023-06-04
i love when studios realize that animation allows you creativity beyond realism after this film no other studio has any excuse to still be making the stale animation of the past decade,2023-06-05
it was gorgeous,2023-06-03
that hit me really hard it had a wonderful sort of kandinsky look to it,2023-06-04
"	they really revolutionised animation in cinema once and went “i’ll ’ do it again”

this was also my thought they revolutionized animation and now everyone tries to copy the style and now they drop another artbomb and ups the volume to 11 beat that haha

this movie was such a spectacle to the eyes",2023-06-03
yeah i see that especially as the colors moved with her mood,2023-06-02
it reminded me of little talked about symbolism and meaning behind disco elysiums character portrait backgrounds,2023-06-04
yeah pure disco elysium vibes with her world incredibly well animated,2023-06-04
yeah but last info on it was still a bit multiversal with jessica drew and silk being in it too,2023-06-02
surely they wont pull that trigger please ,2023-06-03
naw they wouldnt fridge a literal toddler edgy comics might but not a mainstream movie,2023-06-04
"personally i was sold on miguel’s backstory  he destroyed an entire universe and literally all that he loved because he wanted a happy life that would send almost everyone on the warpath  plus that example shows the other spiders exactly what happens when things go wrong and from mumbattan it seems his assumptions aren’t wrong

yeah miguel was that vampirelike in the comics too  he has permanent completely red eyesso he wears sunglasses to hide them nonretractable fangs with paralyzing venomso he tries to hide his mouth when talking and the retractable talonsclaws that he uses to climb and slashhe accidentally slashed someone’s throat when he found out about this  the movie version though seems to be able to retract his fangs and his eyes aren’t completely redand it seems he can control when his pupils turn red

morlun is a multiversal energy vampire yeah  he was introduced in the 2000s as kinda like “spiderman’s doomsday”superman’s death with not much backstory but later his family became the villains of the first spiderverse event  i don’t really think miguel would fit a morlun but i do think there’s a possibility they might pull a superior spiderman and reveal doctor octopus has taken over miguel’s body since superior was an important player in the original spiderverse and a fan favorite as well  however i personally think it would be better for miguel to just be himself and learn to accept and move past his grief as a character rather than the action movie reveal that he is someone else",2023-06-04
"i dont think miguel is being set up to be a twist villain but im still skeptical of straying from the canon being the reason that universe he slipped into collapsed on itself  
 
the blob thing in mumbattan was clearly a result of the spot messing with the collider not to mention gwens dad quitting the police force seems to be proofpositive of being able to stray from canon without things going to  if you go even further peter b being happy and married with a child also flies in the face of how peter is usually depicted it may not be a coincidence that this happened after he had his first adventure with miles in the last movie  

i think beyond is going to reveal more about why miguels universe was destroyed and how hes wrong about anomalies being the reason behind everything going wrong in the multiverse we still havent seen madame web or heard anyone utter the phrase web of fate so i think theres more to this than the movie is letting on  
 
as for miguel being tangentiallyrelated to vampires i do remember there being a panel in the first issue of spiderman 2099 where he appeared to have fangs for a second it was a dream sequencethrowaway gag",2023-06-04
"the baby isnt in danger theres a reason peter is stupidly going into battle with his daughter

canon requires that the spiders have a tragic origin story and mayday is about to get hers

the bill always comes due",2023-06-06
"i suspect that the footage and reasoning given by miguel is at best partially lacking if nothing else since this movie more or less directly references mcu multiverse stuff we would except cannon breaks to lead to new verses not collapse existing ones 

given all the various givens it seems unlikely that predestiny of those exact event variations is actually entirely locked in there are probably other factors involved in the collapse miguel saw i dont think we had anyone besides him confirm other collapses  there was stuff happening in mumbattan but also that was impacted by a multiversal being blasting himself with a super collider so thats a terrible data point and the captain wouldnt have been in danger there in the first place which makes the whole canondestiny thing a bit off

could be miguels not actually a villain and just grossly misunderstands the situation which would be my best guess at whats in store",2023-06-04
"peter b will probably become her ‘uncle ben’ in beyond the spiderverse peter b either dies sacrificing himself to save spideymiles from prowler miles or he dies sacrificing himself to save captain morales from spot 

we get a somber scene at the end of gwen and miles returning mayday to mary jane",2023-08-14
"exactly its editorial that keeps them apart in attempt to keep peter seeming young and relatable 

thing is they have a young relatable spiderman so why not have a slightly less young and relatable one and let him get married",2023-06-05
i need a scene where miguel is blaming miles for being an anomalynot wanting to let his dad die just so miles can scream how the  is that my fault while throwing a truck at him for good measure that man needs year round therapy sessions amd a massive chill pill preferably a suppository,2023-06-03
"the thing is every spiderperson has to lose both a close family membermentor and an amicable police captain according to miguels algorithm its not enough for miles to only lose aaron because no spiderperson can only lose one person

the uncle ben loss forces the understanding of with great power comes great responsibility making them take up the mantle the police captain death event asm90 during the early tenure as a spider imparts the knowledge failure is an important painful inevitability its meant to humble the spider into recognizing their own limitations ensuring they dont maintain an arrogant attitude that causes greater loss of life down the line

of course the point ultimately is that miles wants to subvert those absolutes but theyre canon events in all other spiders lives for a reason",2023-06-04
it’s not about enough it’s about specific events every spiderman loses an uncle ben equivalent every spiderman also loses a captain stacy equivalent miles lost his uncle ben he still hasn’t lost his captain stacy,2023-06-04
my head canon is that since aaron was the prowler it didnt count like obviously the loss is tragic but i think even miles can recognize that aaron chose to play the game and lost its different with his dad who is a good guy and the source of his moral compass the way uncle ben was for pp,2023-06-03
this is my big problem with the movie tbh the movie wants us to think miguels mindset on this is a villainous one and it is so why did no other spiderman out of literally thousands ever defy this it’s a fundamentally antispiderman idea and i don’t get why all of them went along with it and believed it and the excuse that “we tried to defy the canon once and the universe got  so we never tried again and never questioned it further” doesn’t work imo,2023-06-03
"are you going to ask this question in reality 

all of us are doomed to lose so much we will all lose our parents or we will die before them which is probably worse we will lose our loved ones when is that enough why should spiderman expect it to be any different",2023-06-10
"yeah they did him very well this is a throwaway entrance character to holy 

mcu take notes",2023-06-04
the spot is one of my favorite spiderman villains and i was initially a little worried about them making him into a bit of a dork but jason just started low and slow and just ramped it the  when he was letting that anger flow through he was  terrifying,2023-06-04
which is kinda  considering its not the writers decision to stick to the status quo its the people who are giving those writers their paychecks,2023-06-04
that makes a lot more sense,2023-06-03
"i think theres a very obvious setup that miguel is wrong about things he has to be because thats what miles is set out to prove i dont think it was merely changing the canon that destroyed his universe but something specific to how he did it  pulling a rick sanchez and taking the place of his counterpart something akin to what we heard of in multiverse of madness 

one potential issue with this is spiderindias universe being in danger but that might just be at least partly because of the spots presence  id have to rewatch the film which i plan to and probably wait for the sequel too so im waiting to see how things play out

we do know or its heavily implied that gwens dad didnt have to die he was saved indirectly by gwen revealing her identity and him subsequently quitting his job and the universe seems alright so if something like that works there has to be some way in which miguel is wrong  at least thats what i think 

maybe it wont be exactly how i envision it perhaps its a broader issue than what miguel specifically did  he does imply there have been multiple cases after all and i doubt they were all life swaps but i think you cant try to save these people even if you know whatll happen beforehand because their deaths have to happen will be flipped on its head i dont think the answer will be what miguel believes it is  the whole point is that uncle bens death was preventable it didnt have to happen and the film is very much set up as a you have to defy what others tell you story  the narrative is clearly on miles side 

but i also dont think its necessarily out of character that faced with the dilemma of letting one person die to save countless others peter…chooses to allow the individual to go if theres really no other option i think spiderman ps4 did this very well  of course he set out to save everyone but he got the cure too late and ultimately chose to let his aunt die which didnt strike me as out of character at all  instead it encapsulated it ben parker died because he didnt understand responsibility may parker died because he did 

given how high the stakes are what the cost could be and what miguel showed of his experiencei dont think its an unthinkable choice for their characters because even trying to defy that in the heat of the moment could as far as they know doom everyone in that universe thats a tremendous risk an understandable deterrent and pretty demotivational even to spiderman but most importantly to them it doesnt look like theres any winning play thats the crucial bit 

comparing that to green goblins bridge ultimatum in the first spiderman movie or peters choice to save the villains in no way homewhile both were gambles there was still a clear goal at the outset but here it looks like the options are mutually exclusive 

but even so i dont think miles is the first to go against it  openly or otherwise others were probably just sent home forcefully or like spiderpunk stayed a bit more discrete miles was just the first to openly defy it and actually escape we see some who are visibly uncomfortable with it hesitant or on the fence  especially when listening to miles arguments and accusations its their hearts going against what their heads are telling them 

but when it came down to it spiderindia wanted to do both just like miles and despite what gwen says i dont think shed let her dad die without a fight its much easier to say youre with miguel on this but in the moment the closer that decision is its much harder to follow through especially with those close to you even among those trying to catch him we see people hesitating like the woman working the dna teleporter plenty didnt of course but in fairness most probably didnt even know what was happening

and obviously we know gwen recruits people who switch over to help miles and i expect many more to follow in the future in any case i hope this idea is explored more in the sequel and that we see the perspectives of many more spiderfolk 

but again i think itll be revealed that the spiderpeople are operating under the wrong principle its not one or the other there is another way and miles will prove it to everyone",2023-06-02
exactly was the canon event in the universe miguel destroyed him being shot and not ever being there because otherwise hed never be spiderman but obviously in his universe he was and hes fine so he must be missing something,2023-06-02
wasn’t miles canon even uncle aaron dying i didn’t get why he has to have his dad as a police captain die too,2023-06-02
i think it was supposed to happen in a different way since every spiderman have their captain dies moment,2023-06-02
team scarlet spider here his lines felt only mildly exaggerated from the constant barrage of internal monologues we got in text boxes from the og comic appearances,2023-06-02
criminal lack of its impact webbing but ill allow it,2023-06-04
i think he is probably done gwen smashed his watch obviously they could write him back in if they wanted to but that felt like a very final gesture,2023-06-04
i wonder if theyll make a joke about him being the most died and resurrected marvel character,2023-06-04
where did i call ben trash i said the stories he was involved in like the whole clone saga was trash,2023-06-04
that was andy samberg,2023-06-02
spidey sense works based on threat and danger usually could argue that though she was jumping him she had no intent to actually harm him so it didnt go off,2023-06-02
miles got sucker punched by prowler it works and doesnt work sometimes,2023-06-07
"agreed

im fine with ben reilly being a 90s edgelord but the way he was portrayed made him feel like one of the serious characters with a dark and tragic past characters that jake peralta would pretend to be on brooklyn 99 with andy sambergs voice really adding to that comparison",2023-06-02
was he that sassy and muscheheadish back then i thought the movie would take him more seriously and was surprised,2023-06-02
ok i figured there was a joke i was missing,2023-06-02
i always mix their names up but you caught me so i wont edit haha,2023-06-02
you mean something like him falling in to an interdimension within himself that shows just how powerful his powers potentially are,2023-06-09
halftime adjustments was such a great line im not even a parent yet and i still love that framing  and mj teasing peter afterwards of course,2023-06-04
it really does the book peter was reading “how to talk so kids will listen  listen so kids will talk” is a real parenting book and one that i’ve read and love too,2023-06-10
when jefferson said that miles is growing up too fast for them to handle but realizes that they must grow up too with him it was such an aha moment fuuuuck that was so good its genuinely unironically such a great parental moment every parents especially parents with teenagers needs to watch this,2023-08-08
i’m only mid 20s wife and i don’t have kids yet i still cried several times in this movie lol,2023-06-04
saw it today with my son whos going to be 12 soon yeah the tears were rolling,2023-06-06
the movie iced your game man,2023-06-09
bro aren’t cinema icees the wave,2023-06-05
yeah my theater the parents were laughing the most,2023-06-03
just curious what about marvel movies have changed to make them  not for kids or families anymore honest question cause they all seem pretty vanilla to me lately,2023-06-03
lord same me and everyone from a latin american household went oof immediately,2023-06-02
 it now i’m crying again,2023-06-04
just the person i went to see the movie with,2023-06-02
not getting super powers wouldnt have changed his trajectory but his father dying could especially when hes being influenced by his uncle now aaron also gives money to rio to cover the bills and he was talking to miles about security to a job they were likely about to do together i dont think miles 42 is full on evil but he absolutely is up to some shady stuff,2023-06-09
if the third venom movie is going to be about venom selling out and getting commercial endorsements that would be kind of awesome actually,2023-06-03
"dont think it was an easter egg but my spouse pointed out how funny it was that jason schwartzman wanted gum 

“you made me swallow my gum that’s going to be in my digestive tract for seven years”",2023-06-07
guarantee you the third film starts out with prowler miles giving this speech  okay lets do this again one final time my name is miles morales my father gave his life trying to uphold the law in a lawless world run by supervillains leaving me and my mum to fend for ourselves until my uncle aaron came back he taught me how to fight how to hunt he gave me the skills and technology to do whats necessary in order to survive  and thats how i became the one and only prowler,2023-06-02
"i think theyve set up gwens death as a unspoken canon point  in every universe gwen stacey falls for spiderman and it ends badly

and itll be the moment that gwens about to die that either miguel or jessica will break the rules in order to save her because they refuse to let another spiderman die",2023-06-02
if she dies it wont be in beyond the spiderverse shes still in the female lead spinoff they are supposed to be producing,2023-06-02
it feels so rare that teen romances are well represented which is something ive really loved these two movies for,2023-06-03
"just saw the movie and this reminds me of the end of her conversation with her dad

what if her saying “i’ll be back” to her dad is a sign that she actually won’t return and miguel was right about the canon events her dad retiring and skipping that event somehow doomed her preventing her from returning… whether through death or being trapped elsewhere

i hope to  i’m not right",2023-06-10
maybe miguel in the 3rd,2023-09-12
"gwen got full storyline with majority of it happening behind the scenes  the realization that her dad is the captain that  die her refusing to make a choice by apparently not going home for months  its a full arc that we get despite us not seeing majority of it

as far as miless story goes  this was just a set up for his storyline",2023-06-02
i would say peter b parkers main story was told in the first film this next one will be spider hams,2023-06-03
it is brought up tho and were told the assumed ramifications for it that i expect will occur in part 2,2023-06-02
they say they can possibly contain the canon disruption and show some spiderpeople with funky tech devices around the edge of it so either its a chekovs gun for an action setpiece in part 2 or its dealt with and just a reminder of the threat of messing with the canon,2023-06-02
i agree they seemed more like cotagonists,2023-06-09
"especially with how we got another for miles right after including credits 

i would just love a sort of pulp fiction with multiple episodic movies in different arts types",2023-06-05
the audio issues were a thing that some but not all theaters had i just figured it was a problem with the movie itself a la tenet since so many people were complaining about it but it’s wild if some people didn’t have it i wonder why that is,2023-06-05
it sold me instantly the way they did the drums was incredible,2023-06-05
yup s tier world introduction it even made the “recap the 5 year old movie for the audience” entertaining,2023-06-05
" ive been a massive spidergwen fan since her books started and i never thought id see her story play out in a movie 

thats cool that it means so much to you i had only heard of spidergwen before into the spiderverse but the intro to across was enough to make me want her to have her own film",2023-06-05
thats such a good track and its a great little sweetener for the grand finale of an action scene i noticed it cut in during the end of the vulture fight and it was hype af,2023-06-03
absolutely her theme is the best piece of film score ive heard in a while,2023-06-03
miguel will 100 be the main antagonist of the next movie,2023-06-03
i feel like weve already seen the background with miguels canon breaking event my money is that well be getting miles the prowler background,2023-06-27
true but isnt gwen not dying in the first place and becoming spiderwoman just a big  you to the canon anyways shes as much of an abnormality as miles,2023-06-05
i would agree if we were talking about an episode before the finale but i went into it expecting a film and left feeling super empty even knowing it’s a 2 parter i feel like we left without a true final act,2023-06-05
twin peaks the return and the godfather part ii are the best sequels across the spiderverse is up there though and it blows cameron’s work out of the water,2023-06-07
oh yeah thank you lots happening in this movie ,2023-06-02
thank you i refuse to watch movies with “venom” not coming from spiderman so i had no idea who that was,2023-06-04
as a fan of the 90s spiderman series i was really excited to see the spot become a threatening villain they did so well developing him into something sinister,2023-06-02
i did a marvel dnd villain campaign years back one friend wanted to be the spot i was like ok then we started playing and we discussed his powers a lot to try and make them authentic to the real thing holy  did he just break the game,2023-06-02
whats more shocking is avi arad is the one who suggestedtold lord and miller to use the spot as the villain,2023-06-02
i always enjoy when underated characters get featured in big ways like this typically results in their comics counterpart getting a bit of a glow up hopefully ol spotty will see these benefits,2023-06-02
the way the stylized animation actually makes his character design creepier and creepier as time goes on like drops of spilled ink bleeding into a drawing and ruining it,2023-06-03

there are no villains of the week only writers of the week,2023-06-02
now you’re thinking with portals spots,2023-06-02
and 2099 kind of still doesnt he chased after miles shouting and someone catch spot as if he were shocked or something and not a lovecraftian horror now,2023-06-02
if youve read mark waids daredevil run the spot starts a  labor camp by separating the heads of people from their bodies and force feeds them in a dark closet,2023-06-06
hes great at making spidey hit himself,2023-06-05
especially in an animated movie,2023-06-02
he could  around in multiple dimensions and do heinous unspeakable crimes,2023-06-04
me not knowing him i thought he was rorschach,2023-06-10
if he capable of dividing his spots and multiplying them it over lol also he could technically  and cut people because his spots are multi dimensional gates,2023-06-02
always  since when the defeated spiderman on his very first apearence with easy and now he is buffed to  and the only reason he doesnt go against spiderman is because his deal was kingpin,2023-06-06
"just so hes a pain in the  until he realizes his own potential

just a mediocre painter bigot until he realizes he has a strong speaking style",2023-06-11
i like that even in the first goofy fight you could tell that fighting him and his powers would be a huge pain in the ,2023-06-02
"hes the first teleporter ive seen who looks like a threat and i love it

the only threatening teleporter ive seen was in skulduggery pleasant books so i was digging him so hard",2023-06-02
remember when he said echo echono echo lol,2023-06-05
spider folk is so much better than spider people like i had been saying,2023-06-02
he quickly adapted to his powers pretty insane and he understood his power can warp multiverse plus if he can observe future and unlock quantum only way he losing is either a cosmic spiderman or being higher dimension than him lol wonder what observers and etc are doing lol,2023-06-02
wow i feel so dumb i spent the whole movie thinking he was villain of the weak not week this makes a lot more sense,2023-06-07
"the trailers for this movie were amazing i had no idea what this movie was going to be about and i thought the spot was going to be a villain but not the main villain 

maybe like how prowler or liv were in the first movie",2023-06-02
ill be honest with how much the trailers were pushing miguel chasing miles id thought hed be the main villain and spot would just be a oneoff miles takes down early but when he absorbed the powers and started acting super sinister i was so into it,2023-06-02
you thought the spot was the distraction from miguel but miguel was the distraction from the spot,2023-06-03
his inverse color form was legit scary looking,2023-06-02
you made me swallow my hole its gonna be in my digestive track for seven years,2023-06-02
i was thinking “he sounds like david spade’s brother or something…” i’d just watched the benchwarmers too lol,2023-06-06
jeffs completely earnest question spiderman whyd you create that guy sent me,2023-06-03
"thats the difference between spot and miles technically miles was only reacting to the hand he was dealt a hand he was given by spot spot started with a clean deck but messed it up on his own and blames miles for his own mistakes  


i love that there is a parallel to both and there is a clear point where their paths diverge one just rolled with the punches and made the best of what they had while the other blamed the world around them even when these events were consequences of their own actions",2023-06-04
okay i really love that explanation especially about miles relationship with all the spiders it makes so much sense and really makes me want miles to be right about everything as i was on the fence before since the death of everyone for one life seemed like a really bad tradeoff no matter how much you cared about that person,2023-06-06
"nah i dont think so the spot is part of miles universe which had his spiderman in the peter parker that died 
the missing spider man has to be someone in the universe in which miles lands at the end of the film",2023-06-03
no the miles who became the prowler cornrows was supposed to be bit the spiderman miles afro whose story we are following was never supposed to be bit because his universe already had a spiderman the blonde peter parker who died in the first movie,2023-06-06
not at all its a movie that encourages discovery as you go ,2023-06-11
nevermind the entire  with bagels and multiverses,2023-06-02
 my wife missed this moment and was wondering why i was losing it,2023-06-02
,2023-06-02
created the biggest villain in the multiverse,2023-06-03
i heard the b stands for bagel,2023-06-09
atsv and eeaao bagels are trouble,2023-06-02
i would not be surprised if they added the line about the spot being bagel guy as a reference to that film especially given that it received a parody poster in this film à la the first film’s alternate from dusk till shaun,2023-06-07
 i hate abbreviation so much whats eeaao,2023-06-03
what thats crazy,2023-06-02
doctor strange had the pizza balls sold by bruce campbell,2023-06-02
"dr strange had the third eye parallel with evelyn’s googley eye in eeaao

no bagel as far as i’m aware though",2023-06-02
there was a bit with a sandwich in the orville,2023-07-02
honestly when i read umegaclone18 s comment i thought at first they were referencing eeaao and getting bageld was now a verb for multiverse shenanigans,2023-06-04
the bagel definitely wasnt random in eeaao it not only illustrated the point about the arbitrary nature of life that the rest of the absurdist comedy did it also mirrored the googly eye black circle with white center vs white circle with black center with each representing the different forms of nihilism,2023-06-11
no a retcon is when they change something retroactively this is just a reference to something that happened in the first film,2023-06-04
the exhaust port is a retcon but adding story to a character that wasnt explored in a past movie is not a retcon because theres like nothing to build or construe because its just a random scientist,2023-06-02
lucas planned out many details before the original sequel and spiderverse was always meant to have an expanded world theres no evidence of a retcon,2023-06-02
he’s making a joke it’s a reference to a line in across the spiderverse,2023-06-02
woooooooooosh,2023-06-02
i mean the bagel doesnt really have anything to do with it lol,2023-06-04
yeah someone told me elsewhere i havent seen itsv since it came out totally forgot about kingpin murdering peter,2023-06-02
yes but what about parker from universe 42,2023-06-25
so much of that world is tinted purple as a hint pretty cool,2023-06-02
the computer said it was sending him to universe 42 i was like “oh ”,2023-06-04
that’s a fair guess lighting goes nuts in this movie,2023-06-02
also prowler miles has more of a hispanic accent because he has more influence from his mom since his dad isn’t there,2023-06-03
speaking of which nike better have a version of those prowler jordans next year,2023-06-02
oooo good catch i did feel like there was something off about her,2023-06-02
yeah that was the first detail i caught then i started looking for confirmation and noticed the layout of his bedroom wasnt the same after that it all clicked,2023-06-04
and those green eyes were gorgeous,2023-07-23
"glad i wasnt the only one who noticed the resemblance to green goblin in nwh

the second i saw that i thought it foreshadowed some green goblin who was noticeably absent from this film  i cant even remember a cameo or that miles was about to go crazy",2023-06-02
i saw this too wondered if it was a continuity error,2023-06-12
same,2023-06-19
i knew jimmy was up to something it was one after magna carta,2023-06-03
thanks thats the one,2023-06-02
numbers are hard man give him a break ,2023-06-02
"i thought it was 1408

x200b

wait thats",2023-06-05
hitchhikers guide universe is joining the mcu confirmed,2023-06-13
she probably didnt now it was the wrong universe am but was in support of him in the end notice she was part of gwens party at the very end,2023-06-09
i dont think so if i remember correctly she appeared as part of team save miles at the end with gwen et all makes me think shes on his side i could be wrong though,2023-06-11
her name is spider byte ,2023-06-08
i mean did she even know he was going to the wrong one,2023-06-07
wondering the same did miles incorrectly input or did she adjust it,2023-06-06
cute name for something so freaky,2023-06-07
no the number was on a spider not a fly,2023-06-02
to be fair both spot and miguel made a big deal about miles getting bitten by the spider from 42 but if you missed it on the screen during the go home machine scene then you probably wouldn’t see the twist coming,2023-06-03
they make quite a big deal of 42 it appears in countless shots on the back of the spider right from the opening montage through the revelation that it wasn’t from his universe i’m not a super fan or anything but it had definitely clicked for me by this point that “42” was the significant unknown universe,2023-06-02
my entire theater laughed at that including me i think everyone though the same thing she didn’t really notice or care about spiderman i didn’t realize he was in a different universe until right before aaron showed up,2023-06-05
except that jeff has probably birched to here about spiderman every day for the last year  i thought she was  worh him but when it became obvious she wasnt joking i knew,2023-06-08
just saw it today i missed that he went to the wrong universe and i missed the reveal in that line for the first couple seconds i was like how does she live in new york with her husband doing what he does and she doesnt know who  spiderman is and then it all clicked i felt like such a fool haha awesome twist and a fantastic movie,2023-06-21
earlier in the movie she and the dad talk about spiderman being puerto rican too,2023-06-03
"my wife caught it immediately when it scanned and said it was sending him to earth 42 she was like wait isnt he not from there

so we spent the rest of the movie wondering whether we were wrong or being bamboozled",2023-06-09
she also comments on his hair i was like lady you just saw him then it made sense,2023-06-05
oh  that one’s good,2023-06-04
i dont think that universes miles would be that sentimental about a toy probably wouldve sold it off at some point,2023-06-05
i think even evil miles has two different color eyes,2023-06-02
thats because his universes 1610 mom made that comment not earth42s mom this is the first time weve seen earth42 as far as im aware,2023-06-04
it can be and is both,2023-06-03
ok comic book guy,2023-06-17
"same thing here love seeing that someone else felt that

also both her scenes and gris brought me to tears it was just too beautifully done",2023-06-09
"do it ive read everything shes in nothing tops her original run some great twists on spidertropes and easily my favorite artwork of any comic line  


i watched the first spiderverse movie just to see her and seeing her world and origin story in this movie was an absolute treat price of entry was paid for in that first 15 mins alone",2023-06-04
same here its so menacing,2023-06-11
nomination for best picture is definitely possible don’t think many people believe it would have a chance of winning,2023-06-11
best animated  this person is saying it has a shot winning best picture overall,2023-06-02
i’d say animated film is almost a lock for it but really unsure about best picture oppenheimer and dune part 2 will likely be the big blockbusters nominated  rest of the nominees will be smaller films most likely  maybe even ones we haven’t heard about yet,2023-06-02
yeah i didnt even clock he went to the wrong universe until he glitched then uncle aaron walked in,2023-06-04
spectacular spiderman imma be honest actually has a lot of fans surely nto movie level but anyone who likes spiderman a lot has probably watched it,2023-06-02
"spectacular spectacular spiderman 

i you to headbang to this song back in elementary school ",2023-06-03
wasnt that a greg weisman show too guy knocked it out of the park with gargoyles and young justice,2023-06-04
such a great rock twist on the 60s theme gosh,2023-06-04
"you will not regret it

well you might but

youll get there when you get there",2023-06-02
i watched it all last summer as a 29 year old and i gotta say the people were right its probably my favourite animated version of the character,2023-06-02
"you wont regret it but just be prepared for an unfinished ending unfortunately  

the dream for another season lives on",2023-06-02
its my favorite version of spiderman bar none it takes the best parts from the original leeditko and ultimate spiderman and leaves it the worst parts josh keaton is the spidey voice i hear in my head when i read the comics,2023-06-03
let us know what you think its my favorite spiderman cartoon,2023-06-12
howd it go,2023-06-20
"not only spiderman the character 

but also the flash eddie brock mrs and mrs conners love them and of course the absolute best norman osborn which is a huge bar with william dafoe but spectacular spiderman surpassed it for me   
not only was he a maniacal green goblin but he was a very scary cooperate overlord and a scary father i think spectaculars version of him is the epitome of what id call the chefs kiss all the right flavors blended so well 

i think they also had the perfect tombstone my favorite dr octopus my favorite sandman and my second favorite jameson   
granted i havent read all the comics so i dont know how much was faithful adaptation or creative liberty but so many many characters were on point 

plus the natural progression of spidermans foes just made so much sense the fact that all the bizarre super villains were just a natural response to spiderman makes so much more sense and has that nuanced ambiguity of vigilante work and totally illustrated this concept from the mcu so casually and so naturally way before avengers said it",2023-06-20
hes still in high school so makes sense,2023-06-12
“video games i love video games” when looking at the video game villains,2023-06-02
second i missed it as well but i feel like he was saying he didn’t belong there so if anyone could clarify i liked how we all assumed the spidey with the white spider was insomniac spidey but the actual one in the movie was straight up the video game model,2023-06-02
i didnt quite catch what he said but he spoke when the cages were being shown i think at least,2023-06-02
i was gonna say i definitely didnt remember that sucks to realize this prob also makes spectaculars gwen equally doomed i was really hoping they would go another direction in season 3,2023-06-02
yup it was he’s been having a great summer so again good for him he deserves it,2023-06-06
then explain to me,2023-06-06
im very glad i got a quiet awestruck theatre for infinity war it was surreal when i went to see it again with friends everyone was screaming crying like  no0 spiderman,2023-06-03
everyone was so somber in mine it was actually insane that i got to experience that opening day 9pm thursday everyone just walked out shocked,2023-06-03
tbf it was announced to be part one of two at the very first trailer they just didn’t really make a big deal out of it and everybody kind of forgot… which worked perfectly,2023-06-05
yeah i think i would be less annoyed if they announced at the start of the movie it was a two parted like dune,2023-06-05
"why cant you watch the next one

unless i misunderstand you and you meant you cant watch the next one right now",2023-06-09
"not to mention that as other people have mentioned in this thread we got a start of and a resolution to gwens story so the tbc wasnt quite a slap in the face anyway we had something wrapped up and the tbc is just for the rest of the overall plot 

it also helps the next thing is due next year so there isnt much of a wait time either",2023-06-04
opening night vibes man,2023-06-19
it being in a box wouldve been such a cool detail,2023-06-05
"i would agree with you except the whole thing with canon events is almost certain to be subverted in the final film  

jk simmons is probably a substantially more persistent fixture than mere canon eventsfixed points in timewhatever else they call them",2023-06-04
he did such a great job that i just learned that it wasnt simmons voicing him in the game i just assumed it was considered how much it sounds like him,2023-06-02
the position is open for a reason i guess ,2023-06-08
"spider folks lose their uncle which he did 

and the captain of the police force also dies  which just so happens to be miles dad",2023-06-03
there are multiple canon events that each spiderman goes through,2023-06-04
"im pretty late as well just watched it myself i think thats the whole issue between miguel and miles miguel and miles have a short line about this how do you know its going to happen and miguel responds we dont want to find out

and it makes sense from miguels perspective he tested his luck and the algorithmcanon event predictor has not been wrong yet miles is a special case and everything really is possible to him so he may be the exception to the rule especially when miles knows he is the original anomaly he absolutely will push his luck",2023-07-19
i dont think canon is established until a universe has a spiderman so earth42 simply didnt have a canon to break,2023-06-04
the rules are intentionally left unclear and not certain as a central plot and character motivator its clearly part of the central tension of the film and will factor heavily into the resolution in part 2btsv,2023-07-12
this exactly how i felt it’s like u end the movie right at gandalf arrives and before the ents march on isengard,2023-06-03
considering how underwhelming venom has been i’m not surprised i was worried that was the only live action cameo until donald showed up,2023-06-03
same best cameo in there period,2023-06-03
i wouldnt have realized it except my son  i have been watching every spider man adjacent movie leading up to seeing this in theater so we watched venom like 2 days before i love anything spidey related  venom in particular so i actually liked the movies although eric foreman eddie will always be my favorite lol,2023-07-04
"definitely not nobody some random girl in my theater loudly said to whoever she was with this is the venom universe

thankyou captain obvious",2023-06-03
my theater blew up,2023-06-02
whats next michael cera as shaft,2023-06-04
donald glover can play spiderman hes nerdy,2023-06-04
pass,2023-06-03
"it was actually spiderman 2 someone on the rspidermanps4 reddit figured it out a few weeks back the minimap in the movie matches the one in the showcase gameplay video it’s distinctive enough for it to not be the ps4 game

edit here’s the post what’s even more impressive is that op found it before the gameplay reveal our first look at this game was from a tv spot of an animated film",2023-06-02
i loved to see a short film of ganke just playing spiderman ps4 in the dorm,2023-06-02
yeah and his heungmin son poster absolutely love that guy great footballer lol,2023-06-02
ganke is a tottenham fan too ,2023-06-03
which raises the question of whether miles and his family are characters in that universes version of the games and if not who replaced them i assume its like the spiderman comic miles has in the first movie where the broad strokes are the same but small details like names and faces are different,2023-06-02
i love the departure of how ganke isnt miles guyinthechair here since he clearly doesnt need to be,2023-06-04
i know this is nerdy overanalysis but wouldnt that make miles secrete identity public knowledge since the game gives that all away ah well it was a cute reference haha,2023-06-09
spiderman 2 if you pay attention spiderman has the waldos while fighting,2023-06-03
i didnt notice that thanks although i am only on my 1st of many watchings,2023-06-03
it was so wonderful to see spectacular spiderman probably got to me the most out of every reference or variant spidey,2023-06-02
will try to spot spooderman in the 2nd watch,2023-06-02
when he spoke my heart skipped a beat it made little kid me who grew up on spectacular spiderman soooo happy hearing josh keaton again,2023-06-02
him speaking made my  year he had so many lil moments remember his name,2023-06-02
67 spiderman rocking back up for a quick little moment as well got a huge pop out of me,2023-06-02
"recognized him entirely by josh keatons voice because his spidey kind of stuck out in a weird way during that miles intervention scene because it was sort of uncanny valley and i wasnt sure til i heard him speak

love spectacular ",2023-06-02
i immediately pointed out at the movie screen when i saw him,2023-06-02
did he have a cgi model or did i see wrongly he doesnt seem 2d animated to me in the scene,2023-06-02
i spotted that too,2023-06-03
nice catch  i saw that and had no idea what it was lol,2023-06-04
he played miles uncle in homecoming,2023-06-03
hear he actually shows up in liveaction,2023-06-03
"in the scene with the laser prison cell things there were 2 cells with i think green goblins the one on the right was apparently from some old atari game i wasn’t familiar with lol

and ps4 spidey in his standard suit is standing in between them and says something and i’m 99 sure it was yuri lowenthal the voice actor",2023-06-05
he did voice any everything he was between the 2 green goblins,2023-06-11
"there was an mcu mention at some point right
they mentioned dr strange and peter i think",2023-06-02
how  crazy it is that andrew garfield had a cameo but the movie just relentlessly throws so much cool  at you that you just kinda forget,2023-06-02
i think its a certainty at this point they dipped their toe into live action in this one im expecting them to go all in for the next one potentially even a whole scene in live action,2023-06-02
they showed holland grieving over stark when they were showing the uncle ben incidents throughout the multiverse,2023-06-03
i think we see holland and 90s animated spiderman in beyond those were the only two i didn’t see,2023-06-02
"im pretty sure theres a bit of tom holland when they talk about spidermen losing their uncles and the computer screen shows various spidermen mourning uncle ben with tom hollands peter sat on a bed looking at bens suitcase from ffh

obviously its just archival footage but its about the same as we got for maguire",2023-06-02
i think we’ll get all 3 of them as voices in beyond,2023-06-02
holland shows up in a sort of holovideo when talking about loss from endgame,2023-06-04
"call me crazy but i think theres a chance we saw hollands uncle ben death from above at one point it all flew by so fast but something about it looked off to me

not ashamed to say ill be deleting this when i watch the movie again and am proved wrong",2023-06-05
they couldnt use footage from marvel movie that is why they only reference strange,2023-06-03
where was tobey,2023-06-06
holland’s in the credits but i don’t recall actually seeing him,2023-06-04
id be shocked if he wasnt honestly,2023-06-05
i gasped loudly when i saw andrew and then tobey,2023-06-11
"wait where was tobey and andrew

holland appeared when they were talking about canon events we saw tonys death",2023-06-15
late to the game but we did hear doc oct’s “hello peter” from no way home in one of miles’ running away scenes,2023-08-10
hey he said he thought it was spidermans fault he never said which spiderman,2023-06-02
"that wasn’t a plot hole tho there were no set rules about the multiversehow the spell affected the multiverse in nwh it fit with what they set up

this is just added information to explain it",2023-06-02
"it wasnt confirmed whether he was prowler in the mcu if he were he wouldnt have just told peter about it

theres no proof either way but occams razor is this prowler is the same guy from homecoming and his backstory is basically similar to prowler from 1610",2023-06-04
now we need a cameo of michael cera as shaft to fulfill the prophecy,2023-06-02
he also already played uncle aaron in his cameo in spiderman homecoming,2023-06-02
"i definitely think this cameo implies he already exists and was active off screen just got transported to another universe temporarily 

with reliable rumors that miles is in sm4 and sm4 being a gang war type of film with several villains after peter glover’s prowler could easily return there",2023-06-02
we already go glover in mcu though i could be a very long term setup,2023-06-03
haha my brother is gonna hate when he hears james blake in the soundtrack hes annoyed when i play anything with him,2023-06-02
someone in my theater said its danny glover ,2023-06-04
i hope he posts something on social media of him in the suit id love to get a better look at it,2023-06-02
mine lost it multiple times  one of the most engaging crowd pleasing movies since nwh  everybody loves spidey,2023-06-02
mine too actually got a clap and a whoop from me,2023-06-02
did you see it in the morning afternoon or night my 2pm showing was lackluster which was the same when i saw endgame in the same time of day,2023-06-02
i think it was the other way around the online push was to have him play spiderman in the upcoming sony reboot a part which ultimately went to andrew garfield the scene in community was a reference to that online campaign and in turn was what inspired bendis,2023-06-03
wait i thought miles had been around longer than that your saying his first appearance was after community aired,2023-06-03
if there’s a story then i’m all for it but what’s the point of having that amazing casting just in proximity but not using him,2023-06-03
ooooh thanks,2023-06-02
gotg 3 and wakanda forever were pretty good very good in gotgs case,2023-06-02
gotg3 is my favorite mcu since endgame but otherwise yeah,2023-06-03
dr strange 2 was the most unimaginative and boring multiverse movie i’ve maybe ever seen,2023-06-05
thor was a disappointment especially after how good ragnarok was i had such high hopes,2023-06-03
no way home was fueled by pure nostalgia,2023-06-04
this movie handled the multiverse way way better than nwh did,2023-06-04
"no way home was just fan service spectacle the movie whereas  spierverse while has way more fan service  cameos have a way better story characters etc



even spiderverse used cameos and references far more effectively they literally used tobeyandrew scenes to explain canon events mcu has never used cameos this effectively for the story",2023-06-05
nwh gotg3 and shang chi were the only good ones,2023-06-05
spiderman movies seem to be our only hope when it comes to marvel nowadays they’ve been consistently good,2023-06-03
"no way home was kinda  ngl

wanda absolutely carried the  out of dr strange 2 and i ended up liking it but mostly just because of her

guardians 3 was good and i feel like its a great place to finally stop watching marvel movies",2023-06-03
i thought dr strange was good wakanda forever was top tier and guardians was amazing thor wasn’t good and antman was decent but not amazing,2023-06-02
no way home was always a terrible scriptlaughable cgiunfunny jokescharacter assassinations mess of a movie that banks on cheap nostalgia and the purposeful hiding of andrew and tobey just to build hype across the spider verse is a great movie through and through with the added benefits of great cameos,2023-06-02
"my biggest complaint is that these movies used to appeal to everyone of all ages and used to be family friendly they were all a “root for the hero” and “good prevails in the end” through perseverance that’s not the case anymore 

as a dad i haven’t taken my kids to see almost any of the phase 4 movies we saw mom and it gave my 10 year old nightmares for a week shang chi said “” probably 47 times and now they’re throwing in “” there’s not many parents flocking to the theaters with their kids under 10 to watch these movies anymore same goes for conservative middle aged and older people i feel like marvel has abandoned their core audience and geared their content to be mature and adult themed which doesn’t fit phase 12 look and feel nothing like the newer phases and they wonder why the movies aren’t doing good",2023-06-03
like others said guardians was great imo black panther was ok but too bloated which is sadly understandable because of chadwick bosemans passing,2023-06-10
guardians of the galaxy 3 was the best marvel movie in years other than that yeah i agree,2023-06-21
"i think black widow had great parts and i did enjoy the overall product but it was just a complete tonal mess

starts off as a bourne style spy thriller then when she meets her sister it turns into a full blown buddy cop comedy and david harbours character is hilarious then you get to a generic 20002010s sci fi action movie cgifest finale",2023-06-08
oh yes i enjoyed nwh and shangchi but everything after that has been average so i’ve been a little wary of marvel since — will get onto gotg3 next,2023-06-06
those were good,2023-06-10
"i meanif you make a multiverse saga and call it the multiverse saga you should expect a lot of multiverse stuff 

so regardless if audience were cool with it 10 years ago doesnt change the fact that they came out and called it the multiverse saga",2023-06-02
"two different takes on the batman verse and different enough to be hard to say which is better  i think joker works as a non super hero movie as some pointed out its derivative of taxi driver but thats not a bad thing

where as batman is a great reboot movie that doesnt focus on his direct origin as much it focused on him becoming the batman we know the worlds greatest detective",2023-06-05
"i don’t particularly care for either of those 

the f4’s powers are just lame as are the characters and as for the xmen i remain to be convinced how they can fit into the mcu considering what motivates them as characters doesn’t have a place in that universe plus you cannot find better actors for the characters than sir ian mackellan sir patrick stuart and that australian bloke",2023-06-18
i had issues in my dolby screening too,2023-06-04
my dolby was actually a perfect 7580db when i saw it usually it’ll go 90100db i was very pleased,2023-06-05
i was in dolby and the beginning was hard to hear but it got better later still a great movie,2023-06-08
saw it in dolby but agree that the opening segment was a little low it got more balanced later i thought,2023-06-07
i just got out of a dolby screening still had the same issues as others have described and someone else in this thread mentioned the sound being strange in an imax as well…something is just off about this “print” of the film i guess,2023-06-03
i just left my dolby screening and i still had the same issues and my hearing isn’t bad,2023-06-04
do you guys have ability to mix vocals versus other elements or is it just that you turn the whole sound up altogether,2023-06-02
"punk

yeah i could not hear a single word that man was saying",2023-06-03
i was no joke questioning my hearing like “oh no all those concerts finally caught up with me”,2023-06-04
as a mix engineer i guarantee you that was the intention with a movie this high budget there is no way the mix was bad also because this movie was so high budget the dynamic range of the audio was probably a lot greaterwell more intentially emphasize anywayand the theaters playing it just didnt raise the volume enough when this movie played i watched this in imax and the action scenes and music didnt feel as loud as they should have been and i was sitting dead center i had this same issue watching john wick 4 in imax,2023-06-05
i started wearing ear plugs to movies a few years ago and it’s amazing you can still hear everything that happens in the movie and it blocks out any people whispering around you highly recommend,2023-06-03
dude i did the same thing the mixing was totally off and my theater sounded like it was in 21 the whole time like i don’t think the side or rear speakers were even on huge let down that really soured the experience,2023-06-03
"it’s a shame i can only ever see it for the first time in imax too once

goddamnit

it was incredibly noticeable that the mix was off and that all of it was too quiet in general",2023-06-04
"dont think its a movie issue seems like a theatre mixing issue

its a movie issue i saw it in europe yesterday same thing they pulled a nolan",2023-06-02
the parts that were hardest to hear didnt have the dialog in the center channel just an odd choice it made it so hard to hear,2023-06-02
watched it a few weeks back and i don’t remember it being as bad as gwen’s,2023-06-03
something along the lines of thats the most emotion ive ever seen my dad show as he was stone faced shaking miless hand,2023-06-02
over here in aus me and my roommates were complaining about the exact same thing it had to have sounded like the speakers were broken because it sounded so thin it really lacked the impact that the first movies mix had,2023-06-02
i was getting rip hunter vibes from dc’s legends of tomorrow,2023-06-04
also its very similar to kingpin in the first movie,2023-06-10
but what i dont get miles has had his canon event when miguel was showing miles the long line of spider beings with their uncle benlike losses at the very end was miles with uncle aaron,2023-06-02
yeah i’ve got big “plot twist that will recontextualise all the other movies” vibes,2023-06-02
i dont think he has anything to hide rather that he wouldnt want to gamble and entire universe just on the possibility that it miles being an anomaly would change stuff,2023-06-03
there is also the big difference of 2099 outright replacing another version of himself after he died i think that is more likely to create a tear in reality than saving someone from your reality yourself also kinda messed up like clearly they had different experiences theyre different people,2023-06-04
haha relax man i get why he was acting that way i just thought that he blamed miles for getting bitten and getting his spiderman killed which imo was not miles fault,2023-06-04
but also having sat on it idk if i like that they all just sorta succumb to fate like that  it really makes the gravity of their own choices not as important,2023-06-02
but then how did he get to gwens dad and back home he had to have already made one for himself right,2023-06-02
he could have sent the watch to gwen’s dad then go back just in time to help miles out,2023-06-11
thanks for saying this  i didnt know about this channel and am watching their breakdown,2023-06-03
 was like a hallmark card,2023-06-04
i was actually a tad bit disappointed that the mcu did a reset on toms spiderman to put him back to lonely poor guy,2023-06-02
do you have any good runs to recommend i have no idea where to start with spiderman comics i keep choosing runs that end up being sequel series,2023-06-02
this was literally what happened in nwh and it  me off so much,2023-06-04
i think it covers a lot more ground too not just a critique of spidermansuperhero comics bound to a repeating narrative but to the whole idea of classic coming of age stories in general and the idea that the bildungsroman requires suffering that pain is what makes you who you are and by extension you should simply accept the hurt the world puts on you as normal and unavoidable in order to join it,2023-06-14
"i personally don’t fully agree with this criticism ultimately spiderman is for kids the whole concept is just perfect for a kid to lose themself in and daydream about the whole doublelife thing mirroring how kids have their personalityworld at home vs school so to me it makes sense to always have a version of the character with that setup no 6 year old wants to read about a peter with marital issues  the character is so popular because he’s very relatable to the target audience

this is in no way  on adults who like spidey btw since i’m one of them at some point you just gotta move on though and realize it’s time for the character to connect with the next generation",2023-06-03
"i was actually surprised when he said he was 15

the dude looked like he could have been 1718 i actually wished they made him that age he looked older than 15 to me

it would have worked better for the theme of the movie too a 17 year old is almost an adult which i think works better for the movie

i dont see a 15 year old getting away with the stuff that miles gets away with yeah he gets grounded but the gwanda situation it works better if miles is around 1718 instead of 15

this is a total nitpick i still loved the movie",2023-06-03
wouldnt it be swell if sony continued andrews spidey and its about dad spidey sony please,2023-06-03
insomniac spiderman was great for this he was in his late twenties and dealing with the consequence of broken relationships and a compromised career it really capitalised on that human element of peter and placed itself in a time where it didnt have to retread the same ground,2023-06-07
"oh no writers might have to create something new i stead of beating the corpse of the same 20 villains maybe take a look at someone like the spot and do something interesting with him

maybe spend six issues on peter dealing with how he cant fix all of maydays problems as easily as he could fix super villain issues  coping with problems hes got no ability to readily solve after decades of super heroing would be interesting to see

let the man deal with issues like not being broke as  all the time touch on how different his life is now hes not in grinding poverty nearly always",2023-06-05
more like capitalism manifest,2023-06-05
"it’s actually one of the reasons i was fairly unimpressed with miles in his original portrayal what’s the point of creating a new character just to make him nearly the same as peter but a different race

the first spiderverse movie did so much for the character",2023-06-10
did people really do this i dont remember this,2023-06-03
"of course and well said

im not really speaking toward atsv so much as the films in general and your excellent comment about the pattern got me thinking one day id love to see someone cross that line and have a cocky peter accidentally  the love of his life its the moment that was always meant to shepherd him into adulthood",2023-06-02
is it i never felt thats what they are were going for,2023-06-03
yeah it’s very much rian johnson’s mo to tackle a genre story with a metafictional approach so that he can bring some originality to the proceedings,2023-06-03
a last jedi compliment is the wild is always good to see really like that movie,2023-06-09
i think that’s premature until we see where they land with things in beyond tbh,2023-06-02
miguel literally explain in the movie that he tried to alter a world where he was dead and all reality died so it is true they will obviously pull some bs to not make its true but its the reality now,2023-06-04
no,2023-06-15
yeah love how miguels monologue about miles being an anomaly kinda mirrors the sentiments of the specific subset of the spiderman fandom that vehemently dislikes the mere existence of miles as a character  brilliant writing,2023-06-02
its not exactly subtle  not that it needs to be but yeah it was super on the nose,2023-06-05
of course it has a meaning but why does that meaning invariably end up being criticism of previous works,2023-06-18
"agreed

i think an example of this is to me one of the more recent episodes “the big fix” i love the idea of gaslighting people into thinking that tolkien was always named tolkien instead of token and i do think the idea is really funny but in practice it felt really… venomous when it shouldn’t be it’s as if it’s  with itself as much as other people

ironically for a show that constantly tells us not to give a  about everything happening in the world they get a bit sore when the fans raise criticism about how they handle the show and they double down on it through making jokes how randy’s the face of the show now which in a way i don’t mind he’s a character that they could center on for realworld events without making him into a too much of a soapbox but i think it’s too much of a good thing 

but i will give it this at least south park feels real with matt and trey continuing to be at the helm of the show rather than feeling like a compromised product made with clashing writers like in family guy",2023-07-12
i had to read the detailed plot for the first movie i watched it a bit ago i didnt remember the quick clip at the end when peter b presented flowers to mj,2023-06-08
also they kept mentioning his hair too i didnt think anything of it until the reveal and then it made sense,2023-06-02
i realized miles was wearing the prowlers colours while hiding his spidey suit from his mother but i thought it was just a clever callback,2023-06-04
"it’s because it was dark and raining in both to confuse us better yet obscure some of the tells i figured he was in the wrong universe before he glitched but i don’t remember at what point 

i was so sad",2023-06-06
same here i figure this was a night scene and with miles in a panic that this was just that,2023-06-07
plus they mixed gwen in it so pretty good way to try to trick you into thinking its the right world,2023-06-15
yeah i pretty much caught on immediately to what was happening,2023-06-02
also im pretty sure miles brooklyn was raining but in earth 42 it wasnt,2023-06-02
"yeah i was like

hmmm wait miles is not earth 42

then i was like 

oooohhh holy ",2023-06-02
which earth is our miles from,2023-06-02
i figured it out but then i start to question whether or not it was an “error” and then i get annoyed at myself for thinking that i know better than the filmmakers,2023-06-02
i caught on that too also rios eyes had a green tint on earth 42,2023-06-02
i noticed that but i didn’t realize that was the wrong universe i thought the spider was just sample 42 not from earth 42 so it took a while for me to catch on it also helped that there were 1000000 things happening on screen at all times to distract me,2023-06-04
we were watching with our father and he noticed that immediately so the reveal wasnt a surprise for us it was still awesome and cool picking up on all the visual clues before they revealed it,2023-06-02
i noticed his moms eyes were super deep green and thats what tipped me off that something was wrong,2023-06-03
aye i immediately clocked that and wondered how long they were going to drag out the reveal ,2023-06-03
i noticed all that but i wasnt entirely sure i was thinking wait that isnt his universe and then i noticed the slightly off style of earth 42 but i didnt put it together ,2023-06-03
"oh i didnt see that part but i knew as soon as he got in there where he was going

they made a point of telling you over and over again that the spider wasnt from his universe",2023-06-03
i did catch the 42 but even before then i had pretty much guessed where they were going with it as soon as the machine was introduced didnt even realize they were going for a big twist,2023-06-04
as soon as i saw that i knew miles was in for a bad time,2023-06-02
and the fact they literally just spoke about a universe without a spiderman,2023-06-04
i noticed that but i didnt remember what earth miles was initially from,2023-06-05
i feel like i saw that but so much was happening that i didnt really register it,2023-06-08
the fake supreme poster in his room was blue instead of red,2023-06-04
yea i caught that was thought wasnt that the spiders but wasnt sure,2023-06-04
"whoever cut the scene between gwen arriving in the alleyway to miles reaches his room needs a raise

mfer got me tricked ",2023-06-02
my  thought she was just in a different room or smth ,2023-06-03
same i noticed the amp in contrast with the background colors but i didnt put 2and2 together because i thought it was an exaggeration for ridiculously gorgeous emotional effect,2023-06-04
man i didnt notice rio commented on the hair change i thought only aaron did,2023-06-02
her eyes were green too when they’re normally brown,2023-06-03
this movie is one of those where it has so much rewatch value i love it,2023-06-02
well gwen noticed vultures art style it seems and miles seemed to be curious seeing a live action prowler lmaooo,2023-06-02
i like leaving my brain at the door when watching movies its kind of fun to realise things 5 seconds before the reveal and gasp no matter how mundane,2023-06-02
wait why was the spider that bit him in a different earth than our miles how did that spider go from 42 to our miles does that mean spot is really looking for earth 42 miles,2023-06-02
can you elaborate,2023-06-02
 that i liked getting hit with the to be continued left me wanting more,2023-06-02
"100 pretty  decision imo on their part

walking a lot of unsuspecting audience members into a cliffhanger of that magnitude is not something i expect to age well",2023-06-02
the part 1 and 2 part aren’t bad but i didn’t like that 23 of the trilogy would have the same subtitle,2023-06-02
nah its a story its not to be a soft landing for the populace,2023-06-04
it might be so that people would be suprised by the ending cause if you have a movie labeled as part 1 then you know its gonna be a cliffhanger of some fort but dropping that means the ending will be more suprising,2023-06-03
to be fair not everyone follows internet news as much as some of us do,2023-06-02
they changed the titles and removed the parts name i think,2023-06-02
"i hadn’t been keeping up with news barely even saw trailers so total shockmild let down

the cries and gasps of shock in my cinema last night would also indicate it was a bit surprising for most",2023-06-02
i’m a huge spiderverse fan and try to stay up to date while also trying not get spoiled by any leaked stuff and i had no idea that was a thing until the end of the movie lol,2023-06-02
i knew about this but i just forgot and then half way through the movie it hit me lol,2023-06-02
i didnt know and i thought i followed marvel news closely it was most definitely a nice surprise but i had my guesses in the last 10mins of the movie,2023-06-02
i avoided all trailers and news so the surprise made it even better,2023-06-02
yeah wasnt it like officially announced way ahead of time,2023-06-02
"i feel for her i went  once towards the beginning after miles got to his dad’s party because i figured “yeah i’m guessing gwen is gonna show up soon and they’ll just run around for a bit” got back and they were running around so i felt smart 

i wasn’t actually smart because i grabbed a send drink while i was in the lobby and nearly died by the end",2023-06-02
that was the one and only thing in the screen for 7 seconds,2023-06-05
"i wouldnt be surprised if spot is earth42s peter  


you stole my spideryou stole my face conversation means a lot more if thats the case",2023-06-02
ohh edge of time peter,2023-06-05
that’s a good point,2023-06-03
didnt realize jed mackay wrote the spiderpunk into existence he is one of my favorite writers in comics right now,2023-06-05
"as opposed to the hundreds of other peter parkers shes been interacting with

although actually it is kind of interesting that gwen seems to have gravitated towards the spiderpeople that arent peter parker like hobie and pavitr",2023-06-09
"exactly right im sure that by the end miguel will come around i know hes the main antagonist but hes still a good guy just really wrong about whats happening

its probably the biggest reason we havent seen cosmic or madame web because itd take just a minute for either of them to go no it doesnt work like that miguels obsession is certainly driving him to overcorrect everything",2023-06-11
"peter b parker was a canon event for miles

while i agree with you peter b is miless mentor blond peter is usually how the peter who died is referred to",2023-06-11
the miles in that universe would likely have become spiderman hence his father a police captain dying,2023-06-04
im surprised weve gotten no harrys in this series yet with how much love other spiderman characters have gotten,2023-06-02
knowing peters luck he’s either the green goblin lizard or some crazy twist taken over by venom,2023-06-02
would go hard af,2023-06-02
they could introduce a venom symbiote as the spiderman of that universe,2023-06-02
peter parker goblin pls,2023-06-02
fact miles morales does not exist in every universe does not mean their a parker in this universe also,2023-06-02
it was him,2023-06-02
i mean he was definitely playing a darker version of him with a deeper voice maybe,2023-06-02
i didnt initially realize that he made that watch from all the stuff he was taking when he and miles were talking before meeting miguel i thought they made a mistake cause he tosses his watch before leaving during the big chase scene so i was super confused how he was able to give one to gwen,2023-06-02
literally seized the means of production,2023-06-03
when hobie was subtly grabbing things i got rocket vibes and immediately thought “ooooo this mf is building his own type of watch”,2023-06-05
i noticed that although before the reveal i had a worry that he might be a double agent actually trying to undermine the spider society but for like actual evil i was glad when it was just for anarchism lol,2023-06-05
i wonder if he was planning on giving it to miles then after meeting him and realising he was competent enough switched tracks to give gwen a hand,2023-06-13
london,2023-06-03
its so  nice to have the jealousy generator cool guy character actually just be a cool  guy who gives miles a bit of a character development kick with the jealousy but isnt actually seemingly even datingwith gwen hes just a genuinely good friend and cool enough to make miles insecure lol,2023-06-02
"innit

also first ever spiderman with a british accent on screen",2023-06-02
made even funnier by the fact hobie in the comics is from nyc,2023-06-03
no he does the voice of michael angelo in big mouth,2023-06-08
the mandem,2023-06-11
i loved andy samberg as ben reilly,2023-06-03
spiderpunk being daniel kaluuya blew my mind when i saw the credits honestly,2023-06-04
i was this cool the whole time,2023-06-03
thats the attention to detail that makes this series stand out they couldve settled for something less spectacular and in a shorter timeframe but no they went above and beyond,2023-06-02
it was worth every minute they put into him he looked like a walking talking mashup of an 80s punk zine and every cut and paste band flier that ever lined a dive bar,2023-06-02
i love how his visuals are reminiscent of the 70s punk rock scene in the uk with the faded and diy aesthetic around him,2023-06-02
3 years of playtiiiiime,2023-06-02
3 years so when is part 2 coming out haha,2023-06-02
source,2023-06-02
"likei needed this comment my gf just said it was just like the comics and seemed to be surprised that this was important to me 

likegif of dr strange seeing the infinite possibilities of the multiverse this movie was so good and so much and what you just mentioned is just 000001 of the experience",2023-06-03
any source on that not that i dont believe you i just wanna show it off to some friends during our discussions,2023-06-02
wait really can i see the proof,2023-06-02
worth it 100 i was sold from the vulture fight when hes a da vinci style of design art that was so  cool,2023-06-26
a contender for best spider design definitely the way he changes from full color to blackandwhite like hes a cutout from an old newspaper and then back was  tripping me out you gotta respect the artistry ,2023-08-08
" chai tea

it’s like miles didn’t even listen to himself when he talked about “atm machine”",2023-06-02
and they’re sharing chucks,2023-06-02
"so

a lot of folks are missing that she cant go home

hes playing big bro helping her out

i dont get any romantic vibes just others speculation",2023-06-03
she  that dude,2023-06-04
spiderpunk approving mayday has got to be one of my favorite moments in this movie,2023-06-02
he looks even cooler even when he takes off his mask,2023-06-02
it’s like forgetting sarah marshall but with people that have spider powers,2023-06-02
hes mr steal yo girl but hes not really trying to do that,2023-06-03
right gwen be doing something suspicious i wanted to hate spider punk but the guy was just too cool so i’m just pushing my anger to gwen,2023-06-03
they exist and theyre amazing but you cant help but be completely overshadowed by their magnificence and its almost sad to a degree,2023-06-07
"the worst part is he’s that kind of cool where you can’t even dislike the guy he’s just so easily the most interesting guy in the room

hes effortlessly cool",2023-06-14
agree to disagree i guess i first i thought he was cool but then he started coming off as annoying,2023-06-03
"eh the dude didnt seem like one to pull ladies his name was literally a reference to him looking like a hobo i think our boy miles will be fine

x200b

hes like a conspiracy theorist intriuging and fun to listen to but his head is blown up and you would never want a relationship with someone like that unless youre into nutjobs",2023-06-02
im pretty sure the only people that are interested in him are the commie redditors,2023-06-03
pretty on brand for a rocker,2023-06-03
dude same hes clearly an adult and shes what like 16,2023-06-03
this your first time in the punk scene,2023-06-03
i don’t think so as far as i know they haven’t suggested either way but i know he has a partner named captain anarchy a captain america variant who is  i think people thought they were partners like a couple but if i remember correctly they’re more of a team i think cap is with someone else,2023-06-02
i think this is the route theyll take plus gwen is 1516 and itd be weird i thought the toothbrush mention was more alluding she just hangs out there,2023-06-04
honestly i think based on gwen’s actions at the end of the movie it’s pretty clear who she prefers,2023-06-02
it got cleared in this movie,2023-06-03
"i was so sure they were going to have the joke be that hes a hypocrite who talks punk but is totally in miguels proestablishment corner

nope my mans punk to the core",2023-06-02
he was also the one to give miles that big push to break free when everybody else was leaning towards siding with what miguel believed not just a joke character he was actually rather integral,2023-06-02
spiderpunk was an absolute homie,2023-06-02
"oh  

what you just said about spidercity  that place was like cop city down in atlanta a whole specialized complex from which they can train to observe and police the entire spiderverse  i didnt even think about that 

and of course spiderpunk saw through it all",2023-06-02
when spiderpunk dips out you see him drop his doohickey i actually thought miles was going back to pick that up rather than using the gohom machine,2023-06-04
also taught miles how he had broken the barrier in mumbattan i think he knew they would lock miles and was telling him so that he could free himself,2023-06-21
what bullshxt tho theirs nothing he could even prove he basically admitted that everything miguel is talking about happened in his own verse,2023-06-03
what was bs about it and didnt he participate in it anyways,2023-06-03

british norman osborne,2023-06-02
out am i,2023-06-02
this is actually the plot of his first appearance isnt it,2023-06-02
ive been thinking about how for all that miguel talks about how all spidermen fall under a certain pattern and diverting from it destabilizes the universe hes also probably the least spiderman in temperament,2023-06-02
"miguel is always trying to control things that he shouldnt and he gets in the way of people who actually know better than him

look skepticism is cool but mumbaiverse wouldve been gone hes obviously not just blowing hot air the problem here is that they are not looking for alternatives to just letting  happen",2023-06-04
"if itll cause chaos  do it

chaos isnt the point

it just happens that doing the right thing brings chaos 

seems like the problem is the environment",2023-06-03
he sure did i just wish they do an opening where gwen and miles talk about how they were brought together in the final movie,2023-06-03
moby jones from ssx maybe 80 because his name rhymes,2023-06-06
movie was amazing but saw it in dolby and was underwhelmed by the sound mix,2023-06-03
"super late comment

but they basically got the guy who voiced him to come in and give ideas and tell them how to build the world the writers themselves realized they didnt have enough cultural influence or knowledge to do it themselves",2023-06-12
"yea america also stole other peoples cultures you think youre owning me or something 

both countries thrived off imperialism and colonialism",2023-08-26
i saw it in imax too and it was a bit difficult i thought it was because of the accent and me being just a  american lol i got most of his dialogue tho,2023-06-02
just real life andrew garfield i’m down for that just pretend he’s secretly a psycho haha,2023-06-04
i mean i think the whole point of a punknoir team up would be not being cops,2023-06-04

oh you crash in his dimension where though

they were talking about it while swinging in the indian universe,2023-06-02
"oh honey youre out of your mind if you think miles and gwen dont end up together 

yeah miles may end up disliking her at first but it wont last especially if shes the one that saves him from prowler morales and gets him home to confront spot like it seems like she will",2023-06-03
it kinda bothers me that interracial couples are seemingly a touchy subject in hollywood still,2023-06-15
i read up that in the comic books his partner is an indigenous  man called captain anarchy,2023-06-02

lol,2023-06-02
reminds me of cinemawins videos how the first movie has a  coding subtext with the spiderman secret,2023-06-03
thats only peter parker and thats marvel telling sony,2023-06-16
im wondering if theyll keep that for the movie,2023-06-02
i did the same they didnt fix it ,2023-06-02
its been 3 weeks  i just saw it  audio still fubard,2023-06-24
then i doubt it was a venue flub spiderpunk was so hard to hear and the other comments are telling me i missed some good lines,2023-06-02
i don’t know about you but i watched it in a dolby theater which was my first time in one and i noticed the dialogue was much quieter than in a usual theater,2023-06-02
as opposed to texas australia,2023-06-02
tulsa ok here as well,2023-06-02
same in texas we had to have amc turn up the volume because it was so low in the beginning,2023-06-02
"saw it at santikos silverado at an avx showing and had all the issues people are mentioning

gwen opening was hard to hear and spider punk was quiet but also i couldn’t understand the british accent at times lol",2023-06-02
saw in a uk imax and the beginning was inaudible and it seemed all diegetic audio was quieter than everything else,2023-06-02
"yeah i saw it at a 70ftimaxscreen and had no issues with sound 

sucks that so many others did",2023-06-02
yep same in hungary as well,2023-06-02
dont think it was dolby exclusive issue had this problem at my imax showing too i think its just the final edit,2023-06-02

how do you even get an action figure of him tho his colour shape style was constantly changing,2023-06-03
gonna feel bad about buying his funko ,2023-06-04
still not over what they did to my boy nemik from andor ,2023-06-22
zoe kravitz,2023-06-02
i think its gonna be peter b or miguel the former makes sense because he was essentially miles father figure akin to an uncle ben or captain stacy i can also see miguel realizing that canon events dont have to happen and instead sacrificing himself to save officer davis and motivating miles and the rest of the spiderpeople to take down spot and work towards a brighter future,2023-06-04
 look at me being mentally stuck on tropes that the movie itself was telling me to let go of,2023-06-06
i hope it doesnt get that complicated i prefer if they follow a two plot approach gwen and band vs miguel where they advance the canon issue and what it means to be spiderman plot b myles and myles42 taking down sinister 6alchemax and building an inter dimensional device then merge up for the climax against the spot then finally resolving the plot maybe having miguel saving myles dad,2023-06-20
but i remember he made a huge point about not revealing his identity in one scene idk confused me,2023-06-04
"yup someone spotted the mini map when the scene showed up in a tv spot and made the comparison to the mini map from the first game and realized it was different

i need a shot of the spider folks before saving captain singh and the citizens,2023-06-02
"and ben reilly on the roof with the shot in the room looking out the window at him

there were just so many good scenes that would make amazing wallpapers",2023-06-03
honestly every shot in that sequence,2023-06-03
its not now its 2 months later but i saw you asking for this and grabbed some screens at various frames i thought were cool from that scene as i wasnt sure which frame you would want exactly i can recapture in 4k if needed but hopefully 1920x1080 is plenty and one of these are to your liking  let me know if that link doesnt work i tried imgur but the site was being a ,2023-08-22
even some of the shots during the credits at the end were absolutely gorgeous to look at its honestly really  hard to fault this movie and its certainly the best thing im likely to watch all year,2023-06-04
exactly both good but i meant the corner one i added a link in my original comment to the image i pulled from the music video,2023-06-02
which is interesting that they showed the insomniac spiderman is connected to the spiderverse and yet miguel mentioned miles was never meant to become spiderman even if insomniac playstation spiderman’s universe has a miles morales spiderman,2023-06-20
yeah the mcu was heavily inspired by the ultimate run,2023-06-03
i mean mcu peter is heavily influence by miles as far as i can tell so it follows,2023-06-14

dude what youre the reason everyone in this thread is even here talking about this life is wild,2023-06-03

that would have been soooooo brutal,2023-06-05
"	my argument is that it’s not the events that make them similar it’s the lessons they take away

yeah but what i’m saying is that miguel meant it was the events themselves that kept up the structure the intersection nodes what the spiderman associated with that event learns from it means nothing so doesn’t matter what lesson miles takes from it only the event happening is what matters to keep the nodes connecting them intact",2023-06-05
shes had the kid  it was mentioned she was very late into the pregnancy when gwen met her its been several months and her stomach is much smaller,2023-06-12

42 had strong skitterverse vibes,2023-06-03
it was fun ,2023-06-02
some folks in the other comments have said that it’s because of sound mixing issues where he’s too quiet and i think i agree with that normally i can understand a british accent but it was real hard to understand him and pavitr and gwen at the beginning of the movie,2023-06-02
"in india we have subtitles for almost every movie shown in the theatres its very useful for knowing what the dialogues say even when theres loud music and explosive action going on or simply unfamiliar accents

even if the movie is in english we still get english subtitles

though for some reason none of the spanish dialogue had subtitles in this movie",2023-06-02
yes seriously some of thar accent was too heavy to understand so it just flew by me,2023-06-02
it’s funny cause at my theater they had closed captions on so for every funny line hobie gave we were able to laugh lol,2023-06-03
lots of people laughed at that one over here i didnt notice the audio issues but that might be due to the theatres here including subtitles for all the dialogue,2023-06-02
my theatre lost its  at that line ,2023-06-03
well it wasn’t the best line,2023-06-03
lot of audio mixing issues on top of them thiccc accents from what ive gathered this was during the canon break on the bridge hobie referring to the big black hole pretty spot on,2023-06-03
"i think it was meant to be miles i saw braided miles42 in the flashback scene when spot was narrating the origin of the spider and at the back of the spider image it was near miles42 but then it got transported

i could be wrong tho",2023-06-02
if miles wasnt bit his universes peter probably wouldve killed uncle aaron in a fight unintentionally which would lead to miles taking up the mantle of the prowler,2023-06-03
the point is that since the radioactive spider was pulled from earth42 means that there was never a spiderman to protect that universe to begin with peter was never bitten,2023-06-03
"his dad death and a lack of spiderman to fight the s6 is more likely the reason why the 42 miles become prowler

you can hear it in the news the s6 was fighting each other for the city you can see it from the graffiti miles dad died in line of duty in a chaotic world without spider man",2023-06-05
"my thinking is that if miles isnt supposed to be spiderman why didnt his world fade away like pavtirs an anomaly such as spiderman dying the wrong person getting bit by another worlds spiderman why doesnt earth42 fade away either

its all canon miles is supposed to be spiderman and somehow miguel and peter misses this

edit i rewatched the movie and the scene where spot is talking about how he took the spider 42 from earth42 it shows the spider hanging directly over miles42 antimiles assuming the double braid hairstyle isnt extremely common",2023-06-02
we don’t know if they’re criminals there’s a version of the sinister six running around in universe 42 that prowler miles could be fighting with his uncle,2023-06-04
most likely true since his dad died in 42 and his uncle was the influencerole model for him,2023-06-03
yeah miguel was always an  in the comics he gets better though,2023-06-03

exactly this is what threw me you never expect the same type of cliffhanger you get from a tv series or comic book from a whole  movie thats the only gripe i have and you worded it perfectly,2023-06-06

miyazaki would need to put out a film on the level of spirited away or princess mononoke to beat spiderverse,2023-06-05
yeah its a nominee at best,2023-06-03

easily spiderverse comes first then john wick 4 then gotg 3,2023-06-02
i thought jw4 was awful but i loved spiderverse,2023-06-02
theyre the only two in the conversation for me right now,2023-06-02
it does imo i definitely think it’s not as good as atsv or gotg3 but it’s not super far below them for me it’s got enough creativity heart solid humor good direction etc for me personally to rank it very high,2023-06-05
dont know how to tell you this but  in boots was nominated in this years ceremony so isnt eligible next year,2023-06-02
i thought  in boots as fantastic but this movie easily clears it it’s  near flawless in all honesty,2023-06-02
 did it time is an illusion,2023-06-05
yep i had a relatively strong emotional connection to the guardians and 3 did a good job playing off of that but atsv hit me  multiple fronts miles and his parents miles and gwens experience with the other spiders and especially gwens relationship with her dad and how it related to her experiences with the other spiders were each individually far more emotionally resonant for me than all of gotg3 obviously this is a subjective matter but atsv was just head and shoulders above any other comic book movie for me in thematic and emotional impact,2023-06-04
"i think the way spiderverse applies more supernatural concepts like different timelines to reallife issues that people go through is much more enthralling than how gotg3 did it and it concerns the concept of “show don’t tell” or to me “show more than tell”

i love the scene where gwen saw miles’s collectible figure and rips the box out because it wasn’t like that in her world it shows how gwen’s world was different compared to miles i just love how in general how gwen feels like she’s doomed to never have a normal life due to the universes she sees where either her or her friends die guardians 3 could have done so much more with the peter and gamora subplot that tackles similar themes and it wouldn’t have bugged me as much if this wasn’t the last movie in the series

i also really like how the arguments and close moments gwen and miles’s families are given equal weight where most of the time we see the guardians being at odds with each other in some way like i get that’s how a family would act but the positive moments matter as much as the  ones",2023-12-03

not in the us,2023-06-02
it was literally only the beginning of the story being told the only self contained plot this movie had was gwen’s arc and the vast majority of it happened off screen or in flashbacks nothing else was wrapped up in any way at all it was half a plot by design the other half will release next march,2023-06-02

"greetings lifelong nerd here  you make an excellent point with the empire strikes backbut as someone who was there for that there is a difference  
  
when empire came out nothing like that had ever happened up to that point and it was absolutely mindblowing  i will never forget how it felt one surprising shock after anotherlandro betraying them all han being frozen in carbonite and taken away by boba fett all while darth vader is fighting with luke cutting off his hand and telling him that he is his father lando coming to his senses and getting them all out of cloud city then saddling up in the falcon with chewie to go rescue him and flying away while luke and leia watch from the window with the droidsand then the credits start rolling   i still remember my preteen jaw going slack as it literally dropped openi ended up staying in my seat and watching the entire movie again stunned something that you could do back in the olden days before reserved seating  with atsv we went into it fully knowing it was a twoparter much like the deathly hallows and mockingjay  the only thing that has ever even come close to that feeling for me was the end of infinity war  the gutpunch that we all felt at that ending was super reminiscent of the dazed feeling i had while walking out of empire  
  
so to sum up i agree with you when you say we wont be able to fully appreciate atsv as amazing as it is until btsv comes out much like how rotj wrapped things up with a bow with some flaws imo but thats a story for another time lol  but there definitely was more to it with empire just from the shock factor alone",2023-06-04

"holland spiderman presumably doesnt know about multiverse ending nature of trying to stop his canon event hes just trying to save his friends and family if he knew that aunt may had to die to save the world his opinion might be different

we know of at least one person whose attitude changed after learning about the consequence of trying to avoid a canon event miguel",2023-06-02
i think a lot of spider people would try to do both miles would and pavitar was going to try before miles stepped in but the ones in the film are the ones hand picked by and aligning themselves with miguels ideals at least to a certain extent and theyve created a huge ego ecochamber,2023-06-02
i feel like every petermilesgwen who had no knowledge of canon events will try to save everyone regardless the whole spider society is hypocritical in that they only agreed on that aspect after their own canon event already happened no one can refute miles when he asked if they wouldve saved their unclecaptainwhoever if they were still alive its easy to make that choice when youre already on the other end and making it for someone else,2023-06-04
great point about the canon event with may  long before seeing spider verse last night i had always wondered about tom holland peter parker not having the big sacrifice of losing uncle ben while sad it was a great way to bring tom holland spiderman into the canon of the rest of the spiderman super having to lose someone special to them to make them realize how important their powers are,2023-06-02
"i wonder how correct miguel is like if you stop the canon event before it even starts does that change the path like did gwen legitimately just save her dads life by him resigning at the end while not messing with the timeline 

earth 42 had a massive canon event change with no one becoming spiderman in that universe but that universe is fine assumedly because the change wasnt made at the canon event point i figure most of the spidermen never had to make the same choice with the same perspective as miles all of their canon events likely already happened or wont happen they hear dont  with the timeline or your world will be destroyed and the debate ends there without having to make personal choices",2023-06-03
well not really there’s nothing to suggest that the deaths of those villains are canon events to spiderman in fact most of the time they don’t die,2023-06-02
whats almost all in the infinite multiverse there were a few hundred spiderman in the lobby but countless others whose opinions we do not know,2023-06-02
" which funnily enough brings about his canon event with may

my impression is his canon event is still his uncle ben dying since his aunt may dying was caused by a multiversal intervention the green goblin variant specifically across the spiderverse seems to show multiversal shenanigans do not cause canon events but rather potentially disrupt them",2023-06-02
thats exactly why miguel didnt bring him in,2023-06-02
" except is he in this movie almost all peters agreed with miguel about letting someone die if its preordained but in nwh peter refuses it he tries to save everyone which funnily enough brings about his canon event with may

well most of these peters had already gone through their canon events but i think you can be pretty sure that most of them would have still tried to save whoever died in their lives even if they knew ahead of time about canon events",2023-06-02
forgive me for my ignorance but wouldnt peter saving all those villains result in multiple canonical disruptions considering their fate was to die ,2023-06-02
seems like the spidermen are only brought there after their canon events with miles being the only exception,2023-06-03
i thought it was because trzing to save the dad risked the universe and to be honest i kinda agree with him risking the universe to save one person is kinda messed up in my book,2023-06-03
who says green goblin is preordained doc ock electro etc cannon events are important moments that make spiderman who he is both tobey and andrew didnt want to  them they were forced to or couldnt save them so tom isnt unique in this aspect at all if anything what makes spiderman is trying to save everyone no matter what you could argue tom would let people die if he knew what cannon events even were same with andrew or tobey but id hope theyd all be like miles tbh lol,2023-06-04
i think the whole thing was that most spideys dont know the person is going to die before they do all the spiderpeople who were agreeing with miguel had already lost someone,2023-06-05
the best part of this is if you only know the mainline comics continuity you basically have to agree with miguel things only get worse when spiderman refuses to accept loss this movie turns that on its head,2023-06-07
so for nwh spiderman the uncle event was probably may right and the police captain event was tony,2023-06-04
"maybe most of them were brought in fully after their captain had already died except for maybe gwen who miguel didnt want to recruit initiallyyet and the mumbattan one was maybe still under probation and didnt know his captain was about to die

maybe miguels speech is usually a easier to apologize after than to ask permission one",2023-06-04
"i think thats by choice

miguel needs people who can follow him blindly and not question his stuff or atleast accept his logic and dont come into his way this shows that every spiderman while a good guy is not equal

people like holland or miles are a threat to his mission thats why he actively avoids bringing them in 

im not saying the spiders who join him are not good guys are anything just that the heroes of our story in any of the movies we have seen have a morale toughness to them that may not exist in others and that makes them really special",2023-06-05
well all those peters have already gone through their canon events mcu peter like miles is a new spiderman whose story is being told that’s why tobey and andrew’s appearance in nwh is impactful for tom and the audience like with all the spideys in the spiderverse they’ve all tried to have it all and do both and they’ve all failed like tom and miles just had but miles simply just isn’t having it and refuses to accept that his story is already written for him come to find out hes not like the other spideys and if anyone can rewrite their story miles has the best shot,2023-12-14
how do the canon events relate with kang it looked like sacred timeline rules to me,2023-06-04
"didnt he already have it with ben though

and didnt miles already have his canon event with uncle aaron",2023-06-13
i think the difference tho is that very few spiderman have ever been in a situation where they knew a canon event was coming most of these guys have already “suffered” through their canon events and also no one else without miguel’s knowledge actually has access to any technology to know of or cause a canon event in the first place,2023-06-17
miguels demoralisinginsulting of miles was 100 metacommentary as well as textual theres quite a lot of that in this movie,2023-06-02
yeah miguel was in a sense regurgitating the banal metacommentary of dozens of closeminded fans when he was ranting about miles not deserving to be spiderman,2023-06-05
no as spider people had their loved ones die a relative a lover spider gwen for example had their peter parker die and become a spiderwoman the canon events seem to be having their loved ones die not only uncle ben but a loved one,2023-06-03
jon watts has confirmed that uncle ben existed in the mcu the briefcase in ffh that peter used belonged to uncle ben’s,2023-06-03
he wasnt mentioned by name but i always thought he was being referenced directly in civil war when peter was having his first talk with tony lines like when you have powers and dont do anything with them people get hurt and dont tell may not after everything shes been through painted a pretty clear picture in my eyes,2023-06-04
i mean it’s the multiverse you can’t expect their numbering systems to be consistent,2023-06-02
the original plan to call it 616 is from disney who had nothing to do with this movie they called the mcu earth199999 here because peter b is already from an earth616,2023-06-05
as i recall peter b parkers universe is designated 616 in itsv,2023-06-05

" the comics will go on forever though
 
 

thats why it need saving and dying only ended serie not always dying you write new concept new design new story about new hero and end it",2023-06-05
my understanding is that spiderman is not forgotten only peter parker,2023-06-04
they have forgotten who peter parker is not that spiderman existed so everyone has forgotten peter but spiderman still did all the things spiderman did,2023-08-18
fyi idk if you knew but this is a thing lol,2023-06-05
its because he got bit by a spider from another universe more than anything that soccer shouldnt have been there thus in that universe he shouldnt be spiderman,2023-06-03
how we hear that this miles is an anomaly that doesnt mean miles can never be spiderman spiderman isnt always peter parker in these universes it could be gwen miguel hobie peni pavitr jessica etc,2023-06-02
only miles1610 is an anomaly not all miles morales from the multiverse miles42 was supposed to become the spiderman of earth42,2023-06-05
i mean insomniac spiderman was in the movie a couple times and he has a miles morales spiderman so that right there contradicts itself in the same movie,2023-06-05
except for the glitching if youre in the wrong universe,2023-06-03
i just dont want to show up to beyond the spiderverse and be left feeling like i forgot to do my homework,2023-06-02
" the animated spiderverse will only be a trilogy nothing more

im not sure why youre so confident about that given how prevalent spinoffs reboots and sequels are",2023-06-02
yeah if the sony films are all telling one story then miguel being dethroned or stepping down from his multiverse protector role in beyond the spiderverse could open the door for madame web to succeed him,2023-06-02
yeah i dont like the idea either but im thinking they are really wanting brand synergy between sony and marvel,2023-06-05
"yeah spot’s origin was fun but it was revealed early on anyway i guess most of his scenes are fight scenes so maybe hard to fully market around him

i get why they did it though seeing all those spiderpeople puts butts in seats",2023-06-03
practically spells out his arc to her,2023-06-06
"hard disagree

her resolution with her dad was about as climactic as it gets it was an absolutely beautiful poignant scene and it gave her the revelation that miles was right",2023-06-02
the climax is in the hq,2023-06-02
what about rhe final scene with her dad,2023-06-02
because once miles shows up he takes the film over from her,2023-06-02
because she’s not in half the movie and miles is because she doesn’t drive the key narrative it is literally portrayed as everything revolving around miles,2023-06-20
"yeah definitely so a true victory ending the film on a climactic note with a sequel hook as in the first spiderverse where miles defeats kingpin but then gwen calls out to miles in his room as the final scene when i say a false victory im referring to heroic conclusion to the action  miles outsmarts miguel and is able to escape from earth928 and gets to tell his mom that she was right he beat them all etc  but its the wrong universe instead hes stuck in a dark world without a spiderman and the spider society is actively hunting him down in the moment hes stuck and has no allies thats the change in status quo

tv tropes calls this a rise and fall structure where the first act is more lighthearted and the second is darker

this is pretty common in musical theater where theres an intermission separating act 1 from act 2 but youll also see this in television where theres a commercial break at the midpoint in movies pairs that arent intended to be entirely standalone  bill is a good example pirates of the caribbean 2 and 3 are also a good pair here or even within a single film where a decisive moment happens halfway through like in titanic where the ship hits the iceberg nearly exactly halfway through theres often a time skip as well

some examples of the end of act 1 from musicals

les miserables ends act 1 with one day more set at the eve of the 1832 uprising the students prepare for revolution but javert is spying on them éponine despairs that marius doesnt love her and valjean is about to exile himself

wicked ends act 1 with defying gravity where elphaba leaves the emerald city and glinda when act 2 starts time has passed and shes now the wicked witch of the west  a change in status quo

hamilton has a true victory in yorktown where america wins the revolutionary war but it continues for a few songs through nonstop which ends the first act with a false victory showing hamiltons ascension to secretary of treasury while establishing the beginning of his downfall with eliza begging him to stay with her and angela moving overseas act 2s change in status quo is marked by thomas jeffersons introduction

hadestowns false victory is wait for me where orpheus successfully begins his navigation into the underworld to rescue eurydice but act 1 doesnt end there it ends with why we build the wall a hopeless call and response between hades and the workers of hadestown here eurydice joins the underworld properly and begins to lose herself act 2 of course takes place entirely in the underworld so thats the change in status quo",2023-06-16
" i hope not if i’m paying for a film i would expect it to have a narrative start middle and end obviously this isn’t always the case and so i rant although dune also left me wanting more it being the first film and taking its time to set up the setting and characters is more warranted and narratively understandable compared to this film acting as a sequel 

i can’t imagine dune part 2 ending the same way part 1 did and i’m sure you would hear more complaints",2023-06-03
id love to see a double feature of things like dune or this movie and the next with a 30 minute intermission you get a chance to think and talk about the first part and then jump into the second without waiting too long but you also dont have to sit for five hours,2023-06-04
"i agree i kind of expected at least one of the major plotlines to wrap up gwens plotline was kinda sidelined and didnt feel as high stakes

my friend put it really well if beyond was already available we wouldnt have even questioned the cliffhangers excited to see the next one though",2023-06-02
its the gwen opening that sort of messes up the pacing we get two first acts so by the time miles goes into the spiderman dimension it feels like its starting the second act when its actually the third one,2023-06-10
youre absolutely right but for most people animated movies  kid movies yes even pixars,2023-09-29
were going back to the 80s leniency,2023-06-04
its not about humor its the nature of the work of art this spidey is a tv series a miniseries like almost all marvel the  one is a movie,2023-06-02
meters immorales,2023-06-03
for some people,2023-06-02
oh  evil black panther,2023-06-04
its sony btw not disney,2023-06-16
when miguel is explaining the spiderverse and canon events to miles and why he cant be allowed to save his dad they show a collection of spidermen mourning the death of a police captain and the camera focuses on a scene from the amazing spiderman with andrew garfields peter mourning the death of captain stacy,2023-06-13
and his dad being like nope now youre in trouble and i aint savin ya,2023-06-26
“you’re speaking spanglish again”,2023-06-04
"no i just understand spanish hahaha 

a lot of the time the spanish was sorta something in conjunction to the english but there were def some stuff snuck in that you’ll miss until you can watch digital with subtitles

some theatres will have options for captions as an accessibility thing",2023-06-03
they specifically chose not to include subs for spanish in these films since usually you can gather the context of what theyre saying by the scene kinda appreciate that,2023-08-01
"ive gotta say i get weird feelings not only from miguel obviously but also from his world maybe im just reading too much into it but i found it odd that in miguels world when the fight breaks into the ground theres a whole underground slum district that it seems like a lot of people live in thats not really a thing we see in other spider worlds and then theres the massive elevatorstrains to space idk i just thought it was weird that in a world where spiderman is supposed to help people and almost create an equality and comradery in ny that miguels ny was so oddly dystopian 

also why is he in the biggest building smack dab in the middle of the city like im just curious about the lore here because even for the multiverse of spidermen it seems weird",2023-06-03
miguel was giving me unresolved trauma energy like namor in wakanda forever,2023-06-02
"that’s really interesting both about not captain stacy  miguel

part 3 can’t get here fast enough",2023-06-02
miles also broke pav canon event cycle no,2023-06-02
agreed 100 here i wouldnt call fast x good but it delivers on what you expect from the franchise in a way that 9 seemed to miss,2023-06-06
how can you tell i made a potentially dumb comment earlier if this is the case…,2023-06-06
i feel incredibly bad for one of my supervisors at work named andrew jackson,2023-06-03
adolf  is the adolf  of adolf hitlers,2023-06-03
also his “tea tea” and “bread bread” rant was pretty hilarious because of how true it is,2023-06-06
hes six months into the job and hasnt had his canon moment yet honestly once it was realized that he hasnt yet experienced the traditional loss a spiderman feels his general character makes a ton of sense,2023-07-01
isnt his costume made out of unstable particles which basically allows him to use the talons without them being affected,2023-06-03
when he injected himself you could barely hear him say it was morbin’ time,2023-06-03
"its probably a genetic serum cocktail to control the gene splicing mutations he has

probably gets more unhinged the longer he goes without them

or could be theyve been following a guy with a chemical substance abuse issue all along",2023-06-04
"theres so many little hints that definitely seem to point towards exactly that another thing that happened was that shot of him being injected with something that turned his eyes red  in the comics he was working on a spider  super soldier serum thing for alchemax  but was forcibly mutated permanently for trying to quit since his work was killing people 

im pretty sure this is a variant of miguel that did actually go ahead and complete his work due to that scene the universe 928 also might not be his original one miles lightning was glitching him out and im pretty sure it cant do that normally but if it messed with his watch 

im not sure what its all pointing to in the end but the dude is definitely a pretty big mystery im just hoping its not a buildup to another edge of time you dont know the first thing about being spiderman scene feels a bit cheap to change his backstory around to get it there",2023-06-02
"miguel tried replacing a version of himself with a happy family

my guess is that he killed a version of himself and selfishly killed rather than taking the noble sacrifice and trying to save everything this made him unspiderman and broke him",2023-06-14
he already is a spiderman his actions tho harsh are literally to save millions of universes on top of that he’s an actual spidey in the comics with fangs and all,2023-06-03
hes defo gonna die to save miles dad,2023-06-14
miguel literally is  spider man  hes spiderman 2099 for decades you newbie,2023-06-04
" the spider on his chest is basically punisher skull 

the costume was originally inuniverse supposed to be a día de muertos costume since miguel is part mexican and all",2023-06-03
he’s not villainous more like obsessed but it just comes off that way but remember the context is literally saving billions to essentially let 1 person die in the end he’s this extreme because he genuinely sees what kiles is doing is selfish and will  millions of joy billions think a lot of peoyeould come off this extreme of that much was at stack he literally saw what happened first had,2023-06-03
technically original 1st movie didnt do his look justice also world of spiderman 2099 is darker than batman beyond and i think he used to  than change to sending people jail etc lol,2023-06-02
also not sure if he ever use costume elbow blade in comics i knwo he did in game but guess he used it also miguel could have  miles but didnt also especially when miguelis angry violent  and he not meant hold back his strength even superior spiderman demonstrate what lack of control of full strength can easily  someone with punch etc,2023-06-02
maybe hes one of the only good inheritors whos keeping canon events so that morlun cant enter itd be cool twist,2023-06-04
actually miguel would be the big bad because he doesn’t work for the inheritors rather he was infected by one of them during an previous battle his spiderman powers are the only thing to keep him from fully turning but now they’re failing he’s on a countdown before losing his mind and completely turning into the natural enemy of all spiderpeople,2023-06-06
by contrast as a kid all of my friends parents insisted on me calling them by their first names for the reasons you described i wasnt ever comfortable with that so i kinda justdidnt address them directly at all if i could avoid it,2023-06-07
"im not sure if all theaters use the same audio equipment but i saw it again in a smaller theater at the same theater complex without dolby atmos surround sound and the audio mix was great problem is all the voiceover dialogue comes from only the front speakers so big surround sound drowns it out for most of the audience

many theaters have big screens and less big screens buy a ticket to a showing with the less big screen its older and wont have the overbearing surround sound",2023-06-07
"hey same but half hour ago man his moms speech was sooo much more impactful knowing what was coming 

did you get any sort of vibes from aaron and 42 miles on second watch im wondering if were getting duped and theyre not actually villains",2023-06-07
guardians of the galaxy was fire,2023-06-02
a group of  teens were talking in my theatre had to ask them 3 times to be quiet and when i finally told them to shut up and that the whole theatre could hear them one of them said dude its spiderman who cares,2023-06-03
if anything i think the pacing was pretty slow especially in the first hour i didnt mind it but i definitely wouldnt call it a fast paced movie,2023-06-03
definitely do imax was incredible really easy to follow imo,2023-06-02
wait maybe im high but i dont get it ,2023-06-03
i definitely dont remember the first film being this chaotic and the scenes there were pretty  experimental and stylish like the partical accelerator lab or the doc ock reveal sequence despite having loads of action and style breaks the flow of action was consistent,2023-06-02
"eh

it probably just feels different because its straight up liveaction

and honestlyi dont see the harm

to me it worked fine i guess the suspension of belief only goes so far with some people though

if there were any film to get a bit selfcongratulatory it was this film plus the moments did at least match up with what the scene actually demanded it wasnt there just to be there

i guess it just befuddles me the concept of this movie is already wacky enough so i guess i dont understand why the line is drawn with the liveaction stuff i know you said it was the gratuitous nature of it but to methe whole movie can be seen as a gratuitous love letter to the superhero genrewhile also deconstructing it

those scenes we watched are basically described as part of the horror of being spiderman it doesnt actually celebrate those moments they critique why theyre necessary to begin with those werent happy moments

and as for the doc ock thing i saw no issue with it 

actually i was wondering if they were going to have the balls to show the liveaction stuff i figured they never would but to see it as part of the multiverse toothat was pleasantly surprising to me it really made it feel like anything was possible

i even dug the possible dig at the mcu where the asian lady just acts totally unfazed by the spot this  is just so routine to her that it does even register as a threat to me that was a critique of how nothing in the mcu feels at genuine stake anymore using deadpan irony instead of playing things straight",2023-06-02
because spiderman is a repetitive story where certain things tend to reoccur thats kinda the point of the film,2023-06-02
to each their own i guess i thought the movie was different visually stunning and raimis particular brand of campcheese is great it was the best phase 4 outside of spiderman for me by quite a lot,2023-06-02
glad i sleuthed it out then,2023-06-07
yep vampire parasite nailed it can’t ignore the blatantly obvious imagery there,2023-06-09
yeah i had a hard time understanding miless mom too my spanish isnt the best but i can usually catch enough words to understand meaning,2023-06-06
to be fair i believe it hasnt been a full day yet since miles was technically gone though,2023-06-10
ah  that makes sense actually,2023-06-12
um what stranges fault in this ends at him doing the spell it was peter who came up to him to do the spell peter who begged and eventually convinced him to do the spell and also peter who didn’t think about what he was going to say for a little bit instead of constantly changing his mind mid way through,2023-06-04
i think that gwen’s going to be in trouble too her dad stepped down curbing her canon event that was heavily implied to be coming  they’ve gotta make the next movie 2 hours and i was wondering how until i remembered they will likely have to deal with that too,2023-06-02
"i think that whole hazing thing was on purpose he hadnt been faced with crisis yet and they know all spider folk will need to face crisis to be able to rise above it if you rewatched there were multiple times where the team would wait to see how miles would respond to see if he could step up to them but failed to

it wasnt with the purpose of bullying him but pushing him to see if he could get up again",2023-06-03
that’s true you could probably tweak that subplot a little bit if you wanted the movie to feel like it had more of a conclusion,2023-06-03
"i can see your point that some conversations in the film are maybe more tell than show but i think the conversations do still serve a purpose in the movie and to the audience thats why i disagree with how u initially described them as ruining the pacing or lacking gravity  even if you would rewrite those intimate character scenes to leave more unspoken those scenes still served a clear purpose that the audience can clearly see is a serious moment some guy yelling out  in your theater doesnt make that moment poorly written

i think there also are a lot of show moments in the movie still  the way miles has so many drawings of gwen or how gwen is clearly very attached to that photo of her and miles together yeah they still have a conversation with each other and express to each other that they missed each other but theres a lot left unspoken there too and the moment feels believable because of what weve seen from both characters reintroductions since the events of the last film maybe this is something id notice more or less of in a rewatch",2023-06-03
id argue the first movie is miles learning how to become spiderman the second movie is miles learning how to be himself and be his own spider man do things his own way not listen to the spider society and quite literally do things differently by stopping canon events,2023-06-04
im an adult and jokingly though  too dont have to be a kid for that its fine,2023-07-03
orrrrr miles learned a lesson from aarons death and from cowering on the other side of the door when his father was talking to him,2023-06-06
this movie has a lot of bloat for it to just end in the middle of its own story tbh it felt very obvious that different people worked on this vs itsv,2023-06-03
"i respect all of your views and honestly i agree with them 

but do you ever ask the question what if im wrong and everyone elses view on it is right like all of your logic and explanation makes sense but what makes this objective and not subjective is it just whoever has the best argument idk if that made sense but i hope so

and i think i know the answer to this second one but did you enjoy the movie even with the sub par pacing at some points i still had fun with it",2023-06-05
i dont know anything about filmmaking but i do watch a lot of movies it didnt feel redundant to me so i would have to agree with you about it being lazy in fact when you have a movie with as much action as this one i feel you need a lot of quiet sections to give the film dynamic range especially in a film with so many emotionally heavy themes also when youre trying make characters with depth its important that you have their theme centric characteristics reflected more than once i call that consistency not redundancy,2023-06-02
it was a good movie though i feel jetted a little by it’s conclusion but this films more about the journey instead of its destination,2023-06-05
" infinity war ended with the good guys losing it was an actual ending

so you would watch infinity war without ever seeing endgame

what about fellowship of the ring or two towers for that matter

what about all those two part x files and star trek episodes if guess they all  too  


do you really not understand the concept of cliffhangers",2023-06-04
miles has 2 days to save his dad they’ll find a way to tell an engaging story he still have to escape his alternative self and his uncle and he has no way to get back to his universe meanwhile no one knows exactly where he is between gwen’s group and miguel’s group there’s still a lot to go,2023-06-02
"theres a ton of unresolved plots not all of which can be solved by the same event

1 miles needs to get home
2 miles prowler needs to be redeemed
3 the spot needs to be stopped
4 miguel needs to be stoppedredeemed
5 miles and gwen need to make upget together
6 miles needs to be honest with his parents

and of course thats not even considering new complications the next movie could introduce i expect at least three big scenes a confrontation between miguels team and gwens team to rescue miles a confrontation between miles and the spot to rescue miless dad and a confrontation between miles and miguel over the fate of the spiderversespider society plus a long denouement that right there could make a 90minute movie without adding anything else in",2023-06-05
they were building to a miles rescue but they arent close to stopping the spot miles still wants to rescue his dad which will happen in two days in universe and we dont know what is happening in spider man indias universe with the dimentional rift which im sure will come up later as while miles is trying to save his dad as it paralells the event that happened there the spot showed both event to hin simultaniously cutting between them while they happened in the vision and miguel is still hunting miles there is still quite a bit of story from this movie and similar to the gwen plot fron this film im sure there will be a beyond the spider verse sub plot that will give the film its own self contained arc,2023-06-02
lol have faith hater,2023-06-02
this response made me laugh very hard,2023-06-04
this person needs more punching and kicking and explosions,2023-06-10
"so lets cut that about 5 minutes before we get into the plot that she mentions dont mention that it makes no sense to cut it because the whole shtick of spiderverse is meaningless and  narration recap thats its thing now say we cut 15 minutes elsewhere not only is the movie too rushed and has no room to breathe hint it wouldnt be as critically acclaimed if you cut 1520 minutes lets make it 3h15 minutes which is way too long that leaves us like 1h15m to resolve these plot points

1 miles escaping from evil miles
2 gwen getting miles back to his universe
3 figuring out the mystery behind the sketchy character that is miguel ohara seriously he doesnt seem like a real spiderman and he has to get a new spider to bite him often
4 figuring out the whole canon points thing are they real not clear because gwens dad quitting shouldve dark mattered her universe
5 probably another cool fight scene with miguel
6 teaming up against spot includes saving miles dad or failing to do so
7 doing something with the romantic tension between miles and gwen this would probably happen right before the big act 3 battle i assume but worked on all movie before the big breakthrough moment

could you technically do that in an hour and 15 minutes yeah in the same way you can recap a movie in a minute it makes for a bad movie",2023-06-04
the guy has too many internal conflicts and is not worthy of being spiderman willing to risk the world for one man should have learned responsibility in the first movie like every spiderman does,2023-06-03
yeah like if it wasnt a part one i would have given those conversations a pass but since it is a part one i could probably point out literally a half hour of redundant character reintroductions and repetitive parentsmiles conversations that could be on the cutting room floor easy snip snip and no disrespect to the artists involved it was for a every frame a painting kind of movie but the script could have been pared way back it felt to me like it had been fluffed out to justify the more lucrative move of splitting it into two movies and that makes me feel like they did a disservice to both the films and the audience just to make more money,2023-06-11
you think the first movie was more fan servicey than this one,2023-08-08
yeah also mj was saved by andrew garfield spiderman which probably disrupted the canon too but they fixed it so she didn’t remember him which means he still lost her but in a different way,2023-06-04
yo spoiler that ,2023-06-02
"there is all whole long scene in the middle of the movie where they explain about miless spider being from earth42 that miles being bitten ruined 2 universes it led to his peter dying and 42s never having a spiderman

miguel then literally screams at miles that he is the anomaly during their fight on the train to the moon",2023-06-03
"miles is odd because he doesnt really have friends aside from gwen who is also his love interest raimis spiderman lost harry osborn 

i feel like someone is going to actually die im gonna bet that it wont be miles dad i think youre onto something with gwenmiles is going to be forced to make a choice 

everyone he cares about is getting gathered in the same place and there are now multiple different threats miguel strikes me as someone who is willing to take a hostage to save the multiverse 

the real canon event is that spiderman cant save everyone  but a key component of this is that spiderman is never supposed to actually acknowledge that as a fact sacrifice is noble but spiderman isnt supposed to intentionally sacrifice anyone including himself",2023-06-03
did 2099 say it had to be 42 i dont remember that part,2023-06-03
i imagine this films dangling plot threads will be resolved in beyonds first hour or so then we get a suitable finale i doubt spot will be the final threat for everyone to defeat,2023-06-06
i cannot wait for the inevitable fan edit that turns these two films into one,2023-06-06
i genuinely can’t tell if op is trolling it’s the most benign joke  how do soft  people like this exist jfc,2023-06-06
"i agree with you but i guess the main point i was trying to make was that not all movies have to follow that structure 

infinity warendgame is one of a kind part 1 and 2 for the reasons you mentioned but similarly to my point before not all the part 1 and 2s should follow similar story structures 

to each their own on the structure and the state of it not being a standalone movie i think though after the third movie is released the entire trilogy will be one of the tightest and interconnected trilogies of all time becoming one of those types of trilogies back to the future lotr means you have to either have a sequel as good or better than the first or have an amazing final film that circles back to the first film 

if the third film manages to meet the thrill and intensity of the second the spiderverse trilogy will manage to nail both those factors i mentioned to become a perfect trilogy 

if u critique the second film still because of its unconventional storytelling and how it doesn’t standalone i get it 

i think miles said it best for his trilogy “imma do my own thing” if i wanted to watch the “traditional” movie like you outlined then i can just watch the mcu 

if you’re a spiderman fan this  a masterpiece through and through",2023-06-30
reading other comments seems like it was a mixing issue but it only impacted the first 15 mins in the dobly digital big d theater i saw it in i plan on seeing it again in a true imax screen somewhere and will see if that makes a difference,2023-06-05
gwen resolved her issues with her father but not with miles it’s still a will they or won’t they she never got the chance to apologize to miles or let him know he was still on his side it’s a very small complaint this was the best superhero movie ever made in my eyes,2023-06-05
"keep in mind that scene had to be ready for the release of itsv some 56 years ago they had the very basic outline of what was going to happen in the next movie and thats what we got to see initially now over the course of these 5 years the writing is gonna solidify more and things are going to change 


thats all that happened the story and timing changed and so theres slight discrepancy between the movies because of the creative process thats why gwens dad and peter look different in atsv than they did in itsv",2023-06-11
the thing is the theater was silent during that scene but people reacted to other cameos like the animated spidey one,2023-06-11
in the comics his main villian destroys his village and kills everyone there its possible it already happened by the time atsv happens,2023-06-22
i also thought his parents were oddly forgiving of how he was acting he disappeared and they were just like “welp”,2023-06-03
i feel like sony might have blocked them making him 17 maybe they considered it too old for an animated spider film that they still want to appeal to kidsfamilies,2023-06-03
yeah it got very messy as the movie went on to be honest what with so many characters really it seems like this could have been one movie if they reigned it in a little the third act was teed up perfectly “stop spot and save my dad” but they’re gonna spin that into another two hour movie not sure about that but time will tell,2023-06-05
"are you projecting perhaps

just because you see things a different way doesnt mean miles isnt true to himself throughout the film",2023-06-06
"damnn bruh   
this seems personal",2023-06-06
i guess youre right im not sure it works though,2023-06-08
theyre signed to amazon prime,2023-06-06
i agree it feels like they made a 5 hour long movie and had to choose a random spot to end the movie such a blue balls,2023-06-03
"all the spanish was very clear

it was spanglish very american we dont speak like that in latinoamerica its linmiranda shtick in a way

also this thing put me half to sleep but i noted that they made peter parker a wimpy dad",2023-06-04
yeah i can dig all that and thats a great point about replacing miguel with superior and having his aggressive attitude towards peter make more sense thats true also my wife very much got a tv series feel from it rather than a movie feel from it which i can also appreciate i think thats a side effect from having two twoandahalf hour films like if were looking at five hours of movie all told theres a pretty good argument for making it a series like that goes for dune too and other films like that well well see how things go im going to see it again so i know whats coming and can absorb it like that and then i wont be able to fully judge until after part 2 so well see,2023-06-06
oh i thought you meant you knew from before watching the movie or at the start of the movie yeah when uncle aaron walked into the house i was like “ this universe’s miles is probably bad”,2023-06-03
issue is the protectionist actually has to do something,2023-06-03
i think everything recalibrated the moment miles got bitten by the spider hence his uncle aaron dying became a canon event,2023-06-04
maybe it’s because a spiderman saved the police captain it’s that guilt of not saving someone which drives spidermen spiderwomen spidercats and spidercars to do better so if the police captain died from heart disease spiderman india would be off the hook,2023-06-05
have you watched the movie,2023-06-23
"thank you for listing a remarkable part youve done me a huge favour because tomorrow im going to have to do homework and write some dot points about what i actually liked about the film so my lasting impression doesnt sour

i liked gwens opening too  when the colours in the room shifted when she reconciled with her dad and when miles realizes hes stronger than he knows by diverting the spider people",2023-06-04
you know if this was just a gwen movie it could have had a lot of potential,2023-06-05
im sorry you didnt enjoy the film though thank you im a spidey fan too so it was disappointing to not connect to it on an emotional level but reading a positive comment like yours salvages the situation a little bit ,2023-06-04
i guess theres new potential in a mom spidermovie though im a little less excited,2023-06-05
no its led by gwen we knew this since 2018,2023-06-06
the film did a good job of telling gwens story  shes the narrator for the lengthy opening is a coprotagonist for the middle we see a resolution her her conflict with her dad and shes the last thing we see before the credits roll,2023-06-12
they did the same to me lol you even said it was good movie too,2023-06-06
yeah i suspected he was in the wrong dimension before the reveal but if a scene is done well it really shouldn’t matter i think they did a good job,2023-06-02
i forgot about him being on earth 42 i noticed it and i also noticed earlier that miguel said that earth 42 was where the spider was from and the twist came as a surprise to me still they did a really good job genuinely tricking us into thinking hes in the right universe,2023-06-03
because the tension doesnt just come from him going to the wrong universe tension also comes from not knowing what he will find in this universe,2023-06-12
"it still works though i caught it and for one it made it fun to feel like i was the in crowd knowing what was coming 

it just works differently it doesnt have to be a surprise or a twist to be impactful we may know but miles didnt if you watched the movie again would you think it loses anything its just a different experience",2023-06-02
the number 42 did come up a lot in the first movie which is why i had it in my head that it was his they dont number his universe though theres just a lot of number 42 that comes up,2023-06-12
i slowly realized at the same time that miles did i noticed the colors were different but didnt think much of it until it dawned on me,2023-08-09
i dont agree with virtually anything you said,2023-06-11
jj is on the news talking about the sinister six crime syndicate prowler was one of kingpins s6 in the first movie,2023-06-02
finally someone with a brain comments on this movie i think people are just seeing people say good things about the movie so they have to follow the trend and say it’s “the best movie ever”,2023-06-18
youre so right i wouldve felt a lot better about the cliffhanger if they put it when miles realised he wasnt in his own universe it doesnt make sense where they decided to end the movie its okay to have something be a twoparter but every movie needs to feel complete as its own thing,2023-06-29
there were so many couldbe cliffhangers that it makes me wonder if part 2 was turning out to be too long so they allocated more of the story to this one i could absolutely see the prowler reveal being the beginning of the next movie,2023-06-04
that’s not a falling action,2023-06-11
it’s a two part movie the ending usually is in the second part of a two part movie,2023-06-09
"but this one doesnt have a proper ending still

gwen reconciles with her father who sides with her 

gwen makes the decision to save miles and his dad shunning the spider society this is the ending to gwens story 

peter b gwen and the others create a team this is an ending to that storyline of miles friends abandoning him 

miles gets captured after getting to the wrong universe and finding out miles there is a bad guy this is an ending its called a cliffhanger 

the spot reaches miles universe this is a ending its a cliffhanger 

miguel reaches miles universe before miles does this is a ending its a cliffhanger 

this movie has an ending",2023-06-12
dude like have you watched empire strikes back,2023-06-09
i don’t necessarily disagree i think people would feel less like they have the rug pulled out from under them if it was more blatant,2023-06-03
" but no one on the internet

then

  not everyone spends all day on the internet

i dont understand lol",2023-06-04
exactly it’s all about intention either miles has enough ego to think he can bend destiny to his will or he’s just an evil selfish punk how exactly am i supposed to be inspired by this,2023-06-04
"from miguels model of the world it isnt but miguels model of the world doesnt reflect all the countless universes where spiderman does save his captain 

the idea is that destiny isnt defined by some extrinsic model of the world we create its defined by your own actions on a larger narrative its saying that we dont have to write spidermans origin the same way every time just because thats whats familiar inuniverse miles does not believe fate is predestined miguel believes it is which one would you rather be true",2023-06-04
"no it is absolutely not 

everyone here keeps downplaying the interference and disruption of the canon events but think of this way 

what if we discovered in real life that you could essentially play  if you will with the fate of the entire universe now we further discover that playing  in this case really just means messing with something that is supposed to happen in a very specific and certain way and not even that you can do magical things or give back to the universe somehow just that you are interfering with a certain event instead of letting it happen freely as it should now we further discover that theres absolutely zero zip nada potential gain andor benefit either material immaterial concrete conceptual measurable quantifiable tangible or anything at allbasically we dont get a microscopic nothing out of it and now we further discover that 1 person is solely making the decision here all by himself and hes a child too and hes doing so completely secretively and away from the knowledge of everydamn person in this world even his identity is a secret to his own family and loved ones except for some random cameo kidroommate for whatever reason finally we discover that this monumentally and unfathomably important decision of immeasurable weight being made by this minorchild is about whether he wants to save the life of his beloved dad whom he very much adores and looks up to and is undoubtedly emotionally compromised with the worst case of conflict of interest ever 

oh and this decision might someday end up destroying the whole universe and possibly even before this kids dad lives out to the nature end of his lifespan thereby meaning that the dads life wasnt even saved anyways 

lol ya can you imagine how fast the entire world would unite sworn bitter enemies and nemesis for countless generations to bring this kid down 

hahahahahahahaha

even the mere thought of such a risk is absolutely and appallingly unacceptable in anyway shape or form to the maddest of madmen even 

but but butspiderman",2023-06-08
hey sorry for the late reply i just got a comment on one of my posts saying it’s titled other dimension ft pop smoke it appears it’s not released yet though so hopefully we’ll get an announcement soon on when it’ll be released,2023-06-04
"it’s out

pop money  another dimension ",2023-06-05
yes was hoping glad he enjoyed it,2023-06-05
thanks i’m not sure why i noticed that i don’t think i blinked for over two hours,2023-06-05
yeah couldn’t make out it out but had an m it was in the dorm room scene top right corner,2023-06-12
huh i didnt catch that in my two viewings of the film maybe its time for a third,2023-06-07
they were trying to plug up the black hole they said that they dont know if they can succeed or not and have failed to do so before,2023-06-06
"they said it in the film each spiderman story has canon events “some good some bad some very bad” 

peter b parker is confirmed to have experienced both uncle ben dying and the police captain the former was mentioned in the first film and the latter in the sequel when they show clips of multiple spidermen holding the dead police captain you can see peter b parker with the body of captain stacy and he turns around looking upset jessica drew then says it happened to her too 

for your second question i have no idea  i’m not 100 sure but i don’t think peter b parker involved himself in anything dangerous at least so his daughter wasn’t really at risk",2023-06-10
yep i actually havent confirmed this just saw another comment saying miles is different in the bed scenes,2023-06-15
they just reused peter b model in the first one to save time and cost his liazrd as well is just reusing the green goblin model,2023-06-16
im sure its not much in terms of validation but there was a scene in one of the animated series where peter wishes he got bit by miles spider i think it was somewhere in the spectacular spiderman series,2023-07-01
" and i would say that miguel shouldnt have been cracking jokes either even if hes a spiderman since his character is supposed to be cynical dark and brooding

once the conflict between himmiles gets going i dont remember too much humor from miguel i just remember stuff like him throwing away the snack miles brings him and miguel putting up with mayday crawling on him hes dark and brooding but hes still a good guy from a certain point of view especially for him to have the trust from literally every other spiderman 

 yes and we find out her dad already realized he was wrong like a week after she was gone so it basically resolved itself off screen

that could have easily been how that scene plays out if gwen had stayed and gwens only mistake was running instead of giving her dad a chance but i do see  what you mean gwen just does nothing and everything is alright after captain stacy sleeps on it feels like something was missing there",2023-06-05
hm i suppose so,2023-06-04
yeah i’m guessing part 3 might reveal that miguel doesn’t know everything and was kind of making stuff up that he thought made sense at the time,2023-06-04
" nwh  doctor strange 2 loki thats only naming marvel yugioh  tmnt did this years ago the list goes on the story is nothing new arcane has a visual style similar to this it doesnt skip frames tho and have multiple other art styles infinity war story pacing is pretty much the same as this movie

does any of that mean the movie is bad no but is it the best thing ive ever seen no i consider this to be a underwhelming sequel i believe people are just in the honey moon phase and people will recognize the shortcomings the same way people did with endgame",2023-06-05
disagree ,2023-06-03
"  they know hes not at home and the girl just comes out of his room

cuz it looks like miles is out and about doing who knows what out on the town and the girl hes been having wild  with is awakening from a nap in his room they are annoyed and are about to rage about it but they get interested in what shes saying 

 she really didnt need to come out of the room either

i think she just wanted to assure them miles was ok",2023-06-07
"it didnt happen with all of them we see a whole team of defectors right there at the end of the movie it isnt a stretch to believe that miguel was only recruiting spidermen who would cooperate  it isnt like he recruited miles or hollands who were known to go against the grain he only recruited gwen after her father found out who she was and against his better judgment since he felt bad for her

and then there is some proof to his statements as well  pavs captain didnt die so suddenly the universe started unraveling easy to use situations like that as justification to keep other spidermen in line",2023-06-06
lord and miller is still the main creative forces behind this movie tf are you on about,2023-06-06
" he was on a mission to save the multiverse

no he wasnt he came to the spider hq to calm downtalk to miles when miguel was gonna tell him about the event and why he couldnt join

like mentor going to see his mentee 

as for the end when he joins gwenthat was unexpected mj is probably at work shes also a super powered baby 


the pregnant lady on the bike is literally a comic book character and also part of the avengers in some versions",2023-06-12
"its clearly shown that theres more than one canon event uncle aaron and miles dad are explicitly shown to be two from the same universe why does miles an apparent mistake has canon events in the first place miles points out that gwens dad is a captain too so its safe to assume that had they let it run its course gwens dad would have suffered the same fate

and sorry who was the person who transported the spider to miles surely if were going by cause and effect it would be spot who actually causes the problems in the multiverse he causes miles to become the anomaly which causes miles to set off the events of the film but thats not even my point because who did it first is reductive to the story miguel is the villain here because hes wrong about canon events in some capacity and is willing to let people unnecessarily die to protect a fabricated status quo he uses miles prior actions and his own experiences to justify his actions

oh minor correction but earth42s miles not peter parker was to become that universes spiderman before the spider was taken based on one of the frames from the film so essentially swapped destinies

my logic apparently defeats me yet your entire argument makes no sense on one hand youre criticising the film for being lovey dovey yet youre using said films story to contrive an interpreted version where miles is somehow the villain of the story from a metaperspective the directors are clearly showing us miles as the hero and miguel as the villain

so which is it then are you interpreting the film in a way that is polar opposite to those of its makers or criticising said makers for overused tropes if you want to say the film is bad because youre tired of these tropes then say that and go watch watchmen again everyone has their tastes but its pretty weird youre trying to inuniverse logic your way into putting your own message over the literal directors of the film while at the same time criticising the story of said movie",2023-06-07
"the trolley problem isnt mathematical its ethical if you only look at it as maths you come to the conclusion that since 5  1 you should pull the lever every time thats the conclusion miguel came to

miles correctly remembers that spiderman can do this",2023-06-07
"personally id say the trolley problem breaks down very quickly actually in fact id say right at abouthow many people can 2 units of the average trolley fit together what if we packed them in like sardinesfrom india 

lets just say 200 people for the sake of simplicity 

imagine an active shooter in real life puts a school hostage and says this one teacher can  himself by swallowing as many of these costcosized bottles of tylenol pills as he can until he dies of an overdose nice and peacefully and painlesslyor he can run away right out this door that im holding open for him teacher promptly runs out the door and lives to tell the tale the gunman massacres 200 school children before his gun encounters a catastrophic malfunction and faulty ammunition explodes in his face causing shrapnel to go through his brain and  him you can thank ulvalde cops for why i didnt change the story to be cops rescuing the kidshow badly hated will  forever if such a story came to pass 

and ya thats not even close to the population of a small rural town or a country a single planetmuch less the whole universe 

thats whats at stake 

so ya the trolley problem is an utterly inadequate analogy here",2023-06-08
"good job you figured it out theres a conflict of interest clap clap clap

plus as i said before they already showed they had the tech to undo any damage caused",2023-06-08
"i also think miles dad would sacrifice himself if he knew he could and i think miles would try to save him even if it was an informed decision

miles is definitely trying to save his dad and the universe if he thought saving his dad would doom the universe then that means hes trying to save his dad but let his mom die and ganke and everyone else maybe including his dad but just a little later than if he didnt save him that doesnt make sense hes gonna try to find a way to save everyone i think he even says i can do both at least in the trailer

letting the multiverse die is def not okay and i dont see how it being okay can be extrapolated from me saying letting infinite people die is not okay

we saw the results of what miguel did and i understand why he wouldnt want to try again since he didnt there could be a way to save everyone that miles will find that miguel didnt think of im sure the writers will think of something more clever than me but heres one idea if miles is an anomaly then the canon rules may not even apply to him",2023-06-07
" you kinda just proved my point for me

cuzi was agreeing i was trying to show that miguels logic is reasonable and we follow a type of it ourselves the only thing i dont agree with is dangling the your dad is about to die and were gonna trap you here carrot in front of him 

but your whole lolheres a hint dummyyou dont know anything about nature and science attitude makes me not want to continue this interaction or associate with you further",2023-06-07
"i feel like the real uncle ben canon event in miguel’s timeline is not literally his own uncle ben but the universe that imploded that’s his uncle ben so in his timeline each universe is the equivalent of a person to him


i guess to translate that macro into a micro… it would be like… miles saving a person vs miles knowing that a cell in the person’s body has to die for the person to live if the cells don’t die they turn into cancer and  the person


miguel probably looks at it like that people are cells to him and the universes are the living bodiespeople to him


miles is ultimately going to humanize him though


i love the poetry in this movie it’s too good because indirectly miguel is telling miles that he can’t have his cake and eat it too but yet somewhere early in the movie miles says “what if i had 2 cakes i could eat them both” which leads to him getting 2 ruined cakes for his dad’s celebration party but i bet the better tasting 2 cakes are saving the microcosm  macrocosm ",2023-06-03
"indianamerican here as well i think i understand where yall are coming from the jokes and cultural references were incredibly tip of the iceberg level one things its not like chai tea has any serious significance to indian culture so the india section being filled with jokes like that can feel pandery and weird cuz its written as something indians can go yeah thats true while also being very palletable for americans to understand as the common joke

regardless i absolutely loved the spiderman india section the world was depicted so vibrantly and with so much color pavitr himself has a great design and for once is cool and not the butt of a joke like you said and it was nice to see an indian spider man on screen at all i agree miles is more relatable but i mean thats cuz hes an actual character with a story arc and development pavitr never was supposed to be that so i enjoyed just having him there at all

i guess it is still pandering but i think its nice you can still at least notice the effects of having an indian in the writers room through small stuff like calling singh inspector singh and not chief or something idk if americans wouldve written that or the quip about westerners always going to india on quests for self enlightenment and the british taking all our stuff those felt like a little further than the average hollywood writers room would go in making an indian character which was nice to see",2023-06-02
you arent indian tho you are american,2023-06-03
i mean it makes sense why youd relate more to miles considering you went through similar experiences at the same time i know its not much but it felt nice seeing pavitr as an indian you understand the connections and jokes he makes  the british museum quip the idea of people doing the eat pray love the casual but respective way in which he calls the scientists as bhaiya  it clearly shows research and insight plus they had zomato on the billboard which i regularly use to get food delivered so it felt like something,2023-06-02
well after the gave people plenty of time to figure it out on their own i felt ,2023-06-03
in hindsight it was pretty obvious but a majority of people didnt see it coming this sub clearly shows that,2023-06-04
i didn’t notice it,2023-06-04
i saw it coming and didnt even spot half the clues that ive since seen mentioned online they couldnt have made it more obvious at all,2023-06-06
if you go ensemble cast saving the world you can throw in fellowship of the ring when they all split up,2023-06-02
"peter b’s own captain and ben died already so he didn’t know beforehand… can’t really say he’s accessory to  from his perspective he’s brought into spider city and sees every other spider man there went through the same thing so i can see why he’d believe “oh okay i guess this is what’s supposed to happen in every reality then” it’s not like he’s hopping into all these other universes and killing the captains or the bens so he’s not really an accessory to  miguel explains that doctor strange  “the nerd”  miles the spidergang  kingpin are the 2 groups that have messed up the multiverse which he has to cleanup it seems like all the anomalies so far have been random people being thrown into random universes so he’s gotten a squad to help him take those people where they belong…


miles being an anomaly himself probably means that he’s the first to know about the upcoming death so it’d be the first time that these guys are “accessories to ” if miles’ dad dies


gwen on the other hand didn’t have her captain dad die yet and she’s going along with it but that might just be because miguel is superimposing and she’s surrounded by a million other spideys telling her “yup it’s supposed to happen” but yet her dad retired from being captain saves her from being accessory to  so maybe if you’re aware of the event before it happens it gets avoided somehow gwen miles gwen would have been an accessory to  had she stopped miles from saving captain singh— but she didn’t apply force so it leads me to believe that when there is an actual person in danger in front of her she isn’t fully miguelmode had they captured the spot she wouldn’t have to even attempt to stop miles from saving singh— because singh would have just gotten killed a different way as fated to be thanks to the spot singh is alive and prab didn’t have to go through that canon event if it were not for the spot miles wouldn’t have been there and singh would have been killed as destiny dictated it miles’ existence however is the living breathing anomaly also the spiderpeople were able to contain the holeexcursion that appeared when fate was changed


i guess miguel was hesitant to have gwen  miles come to spidercity because then they’d be aware of what’s to come and that’d disrupt the flow of things because it is spideys’ natural instinct to save someone they know will perish the other spideys already went through it and saw what happens when someone who already went through it tries to change it elsewhere so they rather not interfere unless they have to thanks to kingpin doctor strange  the nerd and the spot


if the solution does end up presenting itself they would have failed being accessories to  failed in india failing in gwen’s universe assuming it fails in miles’ universe after singh was saved none of them went out of their ways to  him just for the sake of fate


furthermore gwen  peter b didn’t really actively try to physically stop miles from escaping and in the end gwen did round about all the other spideys who are down for miles’ ideas this creates a split among the spiders— people who are following miguel’s way and people who are down to give miles’ way a chance


in another comment i looked at the imploding universe miguel had witnessed being his timeline’s real uncle ben and thus each universe is like his equivalent of a person and each person within all these universes are cells so it’d be like miles trying to save each person’s cells in their body but saving those cells so that they continue living would end up having them eventually grow as tumors and then the person has cancer and dies equivalent to an universe having anomaly events and then implodingcollapsing and dying miguel’s demeanor imposing ways looking like the elite futuristic spiderman who sounds like he knows better feels like the multiversal spiderman who saves universes so all the spiderpeople look at him as the spiderman of all spidermans then there’s miles who says no there has to be another way the anomaly of all anomalies and now people are siding with him the spider gang even the pregnant spider lady who’s in miles’ universe outside his parents’ house seems to be on board as she let gwen go do what she has to do


i see what you mean but i don’t know— maybe after a spiderman goes through every canon event—which are learning moments—they come to the conclusion that they can’t save everyone and they end up becoming like miguel he is in the future afterall so maybe that’s why they don’t feel spidermanish… because their future self’s maturation lead them to be a bunch of miguels after experiencing so much sorrow they have just accepted that this is the way things will be until miles appears in their lives and he is now the new canon event that brings them back to their old ways sorry for this long  comment i just entered a wormhole of tangents in my brain",2023-06-03
this is a pretty deep cut but i know in the video game spiderman edge of time miguel gets blasted by a radiation beam and gets extremely powered up thanks to the nature of his powers this miguel may be doing something similar to keep himself going 247 and not have to worry about sleeping or eating,2023-06-07
"i think im 15 is part of the joke tbf like how teenagers think theyre more adult than they are still though yeah it all makes more sense at 17

"for me the pacing felt a little off in while watching which didnt  the movie or anything then i got to the to be continued and i was just so disappointed

the first movie was such a great complete story this got me pretty hyped up and then just stopped

i dont know if theres something just wired completely different in my brain to the people who found that exciting but it just felt unsatisfying to me im not really hyped for the next one im just dissapointed i didnt get a movie with a solid conclusion",2023-06-12
i totally responded to the wrong comment i completely agree with you someone else said they were on miguels side,2023-06-07
"its a fair point the equivalent conclusion was gwens arc getting completed with her father with the way she started the movie it felt fitting at least for me it was not as characterfocused on miles as the first movie so i felt it was okay if he did not get any closure on saving his father infinity war still ended things on a cliffhanger and asked the question of how the heck would they bring everybody back and defeat thanos but because the movie focused on thanos as a character and ended the way it did it felt like a more complete movie   
i understood what they were going for but i can understand your frustation its definitely valid i just feel one of the worst endings is a bit too strong",2023-06-07
"all of the music in the movie is so good the theme when they’re fighting vulture the way it crosses synths of miguel with gwen’s drumming and the ripping of the motorcycle the song when gwen and miles talk on the bank building the song during the ending the end credits song the song during the chase i’ve already added a  ton of songs to my playlist 

imo there was a song as good as sunflower or danger from the original constantly 

i really just think it comes down to what movie hits your personal emotional beats more if you haven’t seen it again tho you 100 should i’ve enjoyed it more every re watch",2023-06-09
"ending was very meh for me  you thought the ending of the movie was not good

nephew was pretty disappointed too  implying yourself you and your nephew were disappointed by the movie

kept asking when the movie was actually gonna finish  using context clues it sounds like your were impatient or not entertained by the movie",2023-06-02
the next one comes out in march so its not too bad,2023-06-04
i think they started making both parts at the same time so i dont think it should,2023-06-02
thats probably more likely but she did have the line early on where she said that all gwens fall in love with spiderman then die so i was thinking her death was another canon event beyond the police captain dying at least i could see that coming up next movie then being stopped at the last minute,2023-06-03
no worries i think you’ll be pleasantly surprised by these two movies way more adult and mature than you’d expect like as a grown man i unironically love these two movies and i’m not a big animation fan cheers mate,2023-06-02
"guess who’s back  rakim 

fitting title and so good",2023-06-03
yeah it’s canon lol,2023-06-03
probably need to skip this one then cause they definitely do it again haha,2023-06-03
"what we’re both saying doesn’t invalidate each other’s comments yes miguel states that those events must happen for the multiversespiderverse to exist if those events do not happen then an incursionlike event happens wipes out an universe which could cause the other universes to also cease to exist




however he did not think far ahead to ask himself “what if i changed each ‘musthappen event’ and forced that change to be kept consistent across every universe” that would still make those events musthappen events for example changing the canon event of “captain must die” to “captain survives” but going into each universe to make sure that same thing happens thus changing the spiderverse for the better and preventing the universes from being wiped out since they are no longer anomalies can’t be an anomaly if the same thing is occurring everywhere the evidence captain singh captain stacy and eventually captain miles surviving suggests miles will force a rewrite of the canon event which’ll open up miguel’s eyes and show him the solution",2023-06-03
spoiler tag for this me thinks,2023-06-03
think they renamed him for this one,2023-06-03
his cape was electric i believe  we saw it when gwen met miguel ,2023-06-03
it doesnt create hard evidence but is heavily implied by the scene that it was fueled by electricity,2023-06-03
how is it incomplete we have known for ages the movie was cut into 2 parts due to them wanting to tell the story and it being too long,2023-06-03

"from what i understand canon can be changed if spiderpeople dont influence said change   


gwens father made the decision to quit the force on his own he changed his own story

yeah going off memory but i think in the comic canon his parents named him jefferson davis in a sort of taking away the power of the thing move but he changes it to disassociate himself from the history of the name its a whole moment,2023-06-07

to its detriment,2023-06-04
 no i am i did love and catch all the references but it’s kind of insulting as an audience member just making the villain basically a joke don’t you think i mean he’s menacing sure but if it starts off as a joke the punchlines gonna come in later for sure which takes away from the gravitas of it,2023-06-05
of course i hope you like it ,2023-06-10
he just says that it would disrupt the canon like in general i think he was just talking in a broader sense of how letting someone from the wrong dimension go free in another one would  things up seeing as any influence that vulture wouldve had on gwens earth isnt meant to happen,2023-06-10
she was there with gwen and the rest of the dream team at the end there though so i think he did make a friend,2023-06-19

i also realised that gwens arc was supposed to be what made the story feel complete but for some reason it didnt land for me maybe because we spent a lot of time with miles and seeing things from miles perspective it just didnt feel complete as its own movie as much as its a part 1,2023-06-29
but vaders reveal would’ve been a awful way to end a movie if there was no payoff to that,2023-06-04
except the spot dude altered destiny by transporting the spider across dimensions i think we can safely say that interdimensional crossovers are not supposed to happen,2023-06-08
yea if that movie is the one where 50 die,2023-06-17
an ending where miles loses nobody and everything is just sunshine and rainbows would be utterly farcical and would actually  me off i pray these writers understand how much of a cop out that would be,2023-06-03
"as far as miles is concerned some guy hes known for about ten minutes is saying that he has to chill out in spider city while his dad gets killed or else the multiverse will collapse except that the multiverse didnt collapse when he saved spiderman indias canon cop so he has at least some reason to think its not an absolute death sentence for his universe or all universes

and not for nothing but the person telling miles that he has to allow his father to die also admits to inserting himself into another persons life because he didnt think anyone would get hurt so hes not the greatest arbiter of right and wrong

if miles knew that saving his dad would ring the death bell for 1610 id see your point but all he has is someone who believes that with a single data point to support that theory and peter bgwen but they were caught lying to him multiple times in a ten minute span so why should he believe anything they have to say",2023-06-02
im not much of a comic reader so im curious which one is miles spiderman origin story he gets bit by a radioactive spider i know that but was it always from another earth,2023-06-03
hes still wrong about miles while characters were meant to side with like gwen peter b parker and hobie think its fine that hes spiderman,2023-06-03
no miguel is from universe 2099,2023-06-04
no it was supposed to bite miles in that universe when the spot is talking about the teleporting the spider you see it beside someone with braids who is presumably earth42 miles,2023-06-04
"correct by acting as one of the spider societys most valuable members and downplaying her feelings for miles gwen was able to convince jess to let her take that mission this was her calling in a favor from jess since theyve been working so closely together miguel wasnt even supposed to know about it at all 

thats why jess was so  at gwen and rightfully so this was supposed to be about her bending the rules a bit and risking her neck just to make gwen happy gwen visiting miles instead of doing what she was supposed to put them both in big trouble",2023-07-07
"its the multiverse its not that deep

but you know what their decision is probably even more punk at this point",2023-06-05
the creators confirmed him before the movie was even announced,2023-06-03
perhaps because he along with the others from the first film are regraded as allies of miles and therefore suspect candidates  they only took gwen in with great reluctance because of her exigent situation with her dad,2023-06-04
it’s on their instagram page but here is a link too that confirms ,2023-06-05
because kids are a lot smarter than you give them credit for this is absolutely not a heavy topic for a preteen,2023-06-24
"spiderman lost his uncle ben batman lost his parents bambi lost his mom  iron giant the lion king toy story 3 

heavy topics are often discussed in animated movies",2023-06-25
xmen being the best example,2023-06-29
isnt that just her suit colors though,2023-06-05
fair to say thats what the metaphor mainly points to then but still different from declaring spider gwen is a trans girl,2023-06-05
he had some dialog about trying to live normally and failing due to what he had become,2023-06-04
 are you talking about,2023-06-05
"i think the point theyre trying to make is that canon events can be changed if the spiderperson isnt directly involved in them  


gwen didnt ask her dad to resign he chose to do it himself and therein it became canon

if gwen stepped in and did something then she directly intervened which is what miles is trying to do   
miles did this with pavithr too saved captain singh by violating the canon 

x200b

as long as spiderpeople arent involved there are still ways to save people and not mess up the timeline",2023-06-06
universe 42 miles has braids in his hair when we see a quick black and white shot of the spider being pulled from earth 42 its about to bite that miles same hair style,2023-06-12
she has a spin off green lit and they also are considering a few other spin offs,2023-06-29
not everything is about you you might relate to it somewhat but its not specifically,2023-06-02
"ohhhh okay i can totally understand that

on another note though i do think it’d be a good twist for spiderpunk to be  especially to avoid the love triangle trope but they’d probably never do it",2023-06-02
"i was definitely picking up on that in the theater too youre not alone

its really something when you meet with a work of some kind of art at the right time to deeply affect you as a person i hope that youre met with more understanding in your life than you got here so far good luck",2023-06-04
"wait for the third one mate plus theyre kids gwen is 16 i was confused too and my initial assumption was oh theyre together but there are rumors that hes  or gwen kept him at bay and never engaged him aside from their music sessions chances are she was purely platonic and leaving stuff behind is an honest mistake shoes are rumored to be a gift at no point it says or implies that theyre emotionallyromantically involved i think youve never had femalemale platonic friendships youre just assuming stuff

the never beta rolled peter i think shes yet to have her first romantic involvement also remember miles was not allowed in the hq youre kind of assassinating her character without a base and very obvious misdirect  jokes she does care where shes literally going up against a vampire  spiderman with a whole being the ending makes sense for all of that plus it would also make sense for hobie to be a  to miles but he isnt to a point where its clear they have a clearplatonic relationship she trusts him to hangout and stay",2023-06-02
no but it would explain the claws,2023-06-02
did you feel the same about the first movie she voiced that too,2023-06-04
don’t get the point this movie has more keyframes than most animated films by virtue it’s like over 2 hours long of mostly action montage scenes even multiple scenes happening simultaneously  you don’t just take out key points in the animation or it would just be incomprehensible i don’t see how there are any cut corners obviously computers only generate between keyframes that’s how interpolation works,2023-06-03

multiverse shenanigans resulting in an entire universe dying suuuuuuure sounds incursiony,2023-06-02
yeah it could shift but let’s hope not,2023-06-02
after that ending i really hope not but it could be possible,2023-06-02
still not involved theyre only involved with the tom holland ones,2023-06-03
its a unique design in the context of the animated spiderverse in that its not just reusing the existing spiderverse mj design just like gwens peter received a unique design in atsv as opposed to the reused peter in itsv,2023-06-03
no when they were having the big argument amongst spiderman that prompted the chase,2023-06-03
maybe its just a discussion i was confused at first but we’ll probably get a explanation in the next part which to me i so far away cause of summer when i will have nothing to do and next school year,2023-06-03
" i dont track how that is miles fault

its not his fault per say but his existence is causing all of the other problems",2023-06-04
probably gonna be explained in the next movie tbh,2023-06-03
they never said it’s spot who kills miles did they i mean it definitely seems like it but could be someone else,2023-06-03
"maybe………………


they showed the video game inside miles’ universe though so maybe the games are not a separate universe maybe the games we play are the same games they play in their universes


or maybe because miles saved prab’s captain singh and gwen’s captain stacy quit being a cop and miles ends up saving his dad in the next movie that it ends up creating a newlymodifiedcanon event where the captains get saved in each universe",2023-06-03
thank you,2023-06-04
"so is every single spiderman invited to the spiderverse city with the exception of milesanomaly and gwenby association

  
more or less yes

miguel validates if theyre at risk of messing up a timeline or not and if they arent he invites them to the society 

x200b

thats why peter b parker got the invite too cause even though he knows miles he will still do what is needed for the greater good   
gwen is a mixed bag shes too emotionally attached to miles to make that call so he only very reluctatnly invited her",2023-06-06
miguel doesnt say its his fault he just laid out the truth for him the spider wasnt meant for him he wasnt supposed to be spiderman if he was never bitten he wouldnt have been down there looking for the spider and peter wouldnt have had to save him if peter wasnt there to save him he wouldnt have wasted time saving and talking to him and wouldnt have had his focus split and would have escaped alive and destroyed the collider,2023-06-13
he says something along the lines of qué maravilla so hes just sarcastically saying oh how wonderful you brought me an empañada and speak spanish but i dont care cuz you  up big time,2023-06-14
"they were trying to get him to understand miguel was probably trying to give it the good old college try at the very least

remember gwen hasnt lost her dad yet either and him dying was supposed to be a canon event and yet when they talk about it with miles gwen just has this face of defeat and acceptance that it was going to happen

they were probably trying to replicate what happened with gwen with miles and even if they didnt explain miles had enough information about what was going to happen that the end result wouldnt have changed

he already knew that it was a canon event even if they didnt tell him when and he figured out spot was gonna do it spot already told him exactly what he was gonna do and he knows that spot can multiverse travel extremely quickly that gives him an increasingly small timetable to act if they didnt tell him the date hed still try to leave and theyd still have to contain him either way 

it seems miguel and co were in damage control mode",2023-06-13
ik theyre already making a spin off centered around gwen so who knows what other projects they may develop,2023-08-24
this is an actual joke made in the comics as recently as this year,2023-06-11
rimshot,2023-06-11
holy  lol,2023-06-10
that’s what i was thinking,2023-06-20
hair no hair at all thank ,2023-06-07
miguel is like bruce wayne if he was bitten by a radioactive spider,2023-06-04
more like hard  and a hardass still dont like him though too aggro so my instinctual reaction is to sneer at him,2023-06-03
maybe in his universe compound words don’t exist,2023-06-03
relevant xkcd,2023-06-04
also he used to be funnier and funner the post credits scene of the first movie presumably before he ruins a universe and loses his daughter is much more light hearted,2023-06-04
that would be one  of a twist but it would explain a lot,2023-06-16
right miguel has to inject himself with the spider genes,2023-07-06
hes not,2023-06-15
wdym,2023-06-15
why would someone pretend to be miguel,2023-06-18
peter b said it not miles,2023-06-07
that’s a weird setup though since miguel canonically has claws i think it was just a joke about his different power set miles also has different powers from the traditional spiderperson powerset,2023-06-18
how was the latin american dub i avoided it since i heard of that as opposed to marios latam dub which was fantastic asking mainly for ny sister and parents who i doubt will be able to keep up with the visuals while reading subs,2023-06-11
his impulse is iconic,2023-06-03
crimson is an all time favorite and one of the few comic series i kept because i had most of the alt covers plus i just loved the story now that i think about it i probably have it to thank for my current love of urban fantasy,2023-08-13
it always means  in the sense of an actual  like your mothers  which is a common insult but not a  as in acting like a  bc thats not a thing in spanish its just a versatile curse word and can be used in a lot of different ways  so yea kinda like  it but its a noun and not a verb,2023-07-18
cool i missed that figured they would have a sign  their attention to detail on things like this was amazing,2023-06-06
cant wait for his is the spot actually mephisto video,2023-06-04

i guess they need to give breathing room between madame web and captain america bnw i still cant believe sony is just sending it straight to a madame web movie,2023-06-13
that’s a great subtle nod to him becoming who he is and amazing foreshadowing to who he could have become the color choices are top notch in these movies and i always took it as green and purple secondary colors becoming red and blue primary colors as a way of showing miles becoming a “main character” going from secondary to primary,2023-06-07
correct blonde peter would’ve lived if he didn’t have to save miles,2023-06-24
ah that clears it up because the collider brought over the spider meant for the spiderman in that universe to miles’ universe right hence the “anomaly” comments,2023-07-16
lol same here the whole time i was like “yea tell your mom miles” thinking this would be an emotional scene,2023-06-03
same here i definitely did not expect that and it was set up so good,2023-06-03
i missed every single hint and am kinda glad that i did because the reveal was so much better that way,2023-06-04
"the number 42 appears a lot on and around miles and they dont make a point of highlighting miles universal number so when the screen pops up with earth 42 is kinda just merges with all the other 42s we see with him numbers fallen off the building from his first jump in the first film his jersey in this one etc

and the movie is just throwing a lot of stuff at everyone at that point its a great way to have people who noticed and those who didnt along for the ride i think",2023-06-04
it literally spelled it out on screen lol,2023-06-03
exact same thing happened to me lol thought it was just me ,2023-06-03
curious if that was post malone again haha,2023-06-04
eh it’s funny but they used that in the first one,2023-06-05
that same line was in into the spiderverse as well,2023-06-06
post malone made it into both of them,2023-06-03
yeah rewatching the first film literally right before this one paid off but i didnt get to finish it in time  wouldve been better seeing the first ones ending again,2023-06-09
i think its really just him and miguel goes way back he was there when miguel collapsed the other universe,2023-06-03
i do wonder if the spidermen recognize peter parker as the default spidersona its clearly not strictly necessary considering the miguels pennys and gwens in the room but there certainly seems to be more peters,2023-06-04
"i wonder if most spider universes exist before one more day style events keeping peter and mj apart  sounds like they’re mostly post gwen but peter b had a pretty big canon event just be glossed over in his universe

edit not necessarily glossed over miles helped him through it just as he helped pivatr",2023-06-03
i think in the original spider verse peter b is from 616 so he is the default spiderman,2023-06-07
would default spiderman really be a  run down spiderman though,2023-06-14
"i think in a sense they didnt want to go all out and hurt him they are still spider mans after all 

even miguel default action was to hold miles in a barrier for 2 days before returning him to his home after miles show that he wont let the canon event happen he didnt even need to explain things to miles yet he did it anyway hoping miles would understand his position as miles himself witness prav world almost collapse he only snapped later on when miles almost got away because everyone was holding back or colluding with miles",2023-06-05
that doesnt make any sense one of the defining traits of any spiderman is that how adaptable they are peter fights villains that are much stronger than him all the time so he always has to think quick on his feet and adapt to the situation to win it shouldnt matter if the bad guy miles in this case doesnt think like a spiderman because every spiderman is smart enough or atleast should be to quickly cook up a plan to catch the bad guy,2023-06-02
"i mean i like that reasoning and i also recognized that theme in the movie however it‘s just too unbelievable with hundreds of them if it was like 5 ok but with 100s just make o hara count to 3 and they minigun him with webs and gg

but yea suspension of disbelief",2023-06-03
this movie was cribbing pretty hard from rick  morty not complaining tho,2023-06-04
absolutely this it’s a version of sunk cost fallacy and it keeps folks stuck in scams and cults all the time to acknowledge that they are wrong means acknowledging that all they gave up was done in error too painful,2023-06-04
"the loved one dying and the police captain dying are two separate canon events 

ohara referred to the police captain one as asm 90 which would make the loved one dying af15",2023-06-05
it’s the year,2023-06-07
depends on the adaptation in the orignal comics he came from the future so he was named 2099 in this case i think its probably the universe number,2023-06-07
eh dont beat yourself up some people are just dicks for no good reason,2023-06-06
it makes sense that was basically kingpin’s motivation in the first one to have his wife and kid from another universe sub out for his family that was killed,2023-06-05
the whole point is that miguel is clearly wrong about the canon events gwen’s dad quit being captain and her universe is fine that’s the first hint that something else is causing the destruction of these universes and miguel’s ego is leading him to believe that what he did was the sole cause of it in the next part they’ll figure out an alternate way of saving as many people as possible im pretty certain of that,2023-06-04
"it doesn’t make him a villain or evil and i think the movie missed the mark by not addressing the situation with the nuance it deserved 

i dont think the movie is trying to make him a villain just because one character says he isnt really doing what the good guys would as for nuance thats what the next movie is for this is a twoparter after all they wont address and wrap up all the themes in a neat bow during one movie",2023-06-04
ooh good call,2023-06-12

"have you seen the short with spiderhan called “caught in a ham” where it shows him in his own universe before he gets  into miles’ universe and as he’s being  into the portal he says “a portal to another movie’s timeline i hope i didn’t miss the first 62 minutes” 

he makes his first appearance in into the spiderverse exactly 62 minutes into the film",2023-06-02
okay seriously this was the one scene where i could barely hear the dialogue it was kind of annoying and i thought it was just the theaters speakers sad to see that i am not alone,2023-06-03
this is all the theaters’ faults btw the sound seemed to be super dynamic in the film and i think a lot of places didn’twon’t take that into account when they screen it,2023-06-03
i feel like this was intentional but i dont know why theyd choose it,2023-06-04
this is why i need captions,2023-06-05
yeah the audio mixing on this was a little janky i managed to make it out but it was off,2023-06-24
"normally i’m fine with letting actors speak with their nativeconversational accents but it shouldn’t come at the expense of not being easily heard by the general audience coming from a spanish speaker 

i felt the same way about spiderpunk and indian spiderman and other random dialogue throughout the movie the sound mixing needed improvement for dialogue to be understood better especially when they’re making fast quips and speaking over each other at times",2023-06-03
yeah man the movie was an experience for sure had me cracked out trying to decipher audiovisual storytelling but as a spanishspeaker yes and no that’s kind of how spanish is regularly spoken amongst spanish people,2023-06-05
happened in dolby too,2023-06-03
i went to imax too and could barely understand the dialogue several times throughout the movie,2023-06-03
i was at an imax showing too which i dont usually go to so i wasnt sure if it was that,2023-06-03
same it was annoying because the theater near me has meh audio so i drove further to the imax one for better audio,2023-06-04

he did miss that one moment in the movie where he says “there’s no where left to run” and then miles jumps out of a window and he goes “my bad guys there was somewhere left to run”,2023-06-05

"the mumbattan segment had the audience cheering throughout every little aspect of that segment was extremely well done the creators clearly put a lot of thought and care into making it feel authentic and not just some stereotypical representation 

the entire movie was as well received here as anywhere else",2023-06-07
"lines about traffic made me feel so seen theatre loved the whole mumbattan sequence the visual style was fantastic and there was a lot of love in it small note but i appreciated them naming pavitrs love interest gayatri you tend to see similar and semistereotypical indian names most of the times so it was lovely to see them use one thats both very real and not in the standard namebook for indian characters really appreciated the representation

sidesidenote but im an international student at a university in canada the connection between pavitr and miles felt like me and one of my closest friends theres a connection between poc that felt so accurate in the portrayal of how both of those characters talked to each other",2023-06-08
i kept thinking that they were going to pan to the side and see tom hardy transforming,2023-06-03
never seen venom so didn’t know where spot was lol,2023-06-05
i don’t think they explained what he was injecting himself with i think there’s something morlun going on,2023-06-04
i think it’s far better if miguel is genuinely a hero who’s simply hardcore and is doing what he believes he has to do to protect universes he doesn’t need to be a twist villain,2023-06-05
somebody said there was a clip of him and mysterio from far from home during the uncle ben part no idea if that’s true or why that would be a canon event for him anyway though,2023-06-05
i mean you’re not wrong that literally is where his name comes from the basic concept behind the character was a mix of morbius the living vampire and kraven the hunter with a name and design based on both but a backstory wholly unrelated to either similar circumstances lead to the creation of gwen poole a character with a similar name and appearance to gwen stacy and wade wilson but with the completely original backstory of being a girl from the real world involved in a marvel universe isekai,2023-06-07
"the first time i dealt with this was dead mans chest i was heated and a dumb teenager

im now 30 and a year seems pretty short and im content",2023-06-04
same just got back from the theater and i am still mad,2023-06-07
first glimpse into the dark void of capitalism,2023-06-04
i was 11 so not rlly that young just had strict parents ,2023-06-04
i think too young for star wars,2023-06-04
"i will say that is a great cliffhanger spot in a lot of different media but with this movie being specifically about the opening up of the multiverse it wouldnt have landed quite as well if thats where they did it now the reveal of the other miles as prowler that would have been a great spot to end it

that said i liked where they ended it it closed out gwens arc and set up the sequel quite nicely",2023-06-09
 that was me too every few minutes i thought this is it nah it just kept going but i was glued to my seat couldnt move my eyes anywhere else,2023-06-08
i had no idea this was a part one so when they kept introducing all this stuff at the end i kept think  are they going to tie all this together in 5 minutes,2023-06-05
same here there were like 2 other scenes i thought were gonna end the movie also,2023-06-02
the creators compared this movie to empire strikes back so if the next one follows the structure of return of the jedi itll start with gwen  co rescuing miles from the prowler before the final battle with the spidersociety and the spot,2023-06-03
just saw it knew basically nothing very disappointed the first one was such an amazing complete story i just feel unsatisfied felt like this one wasnt as well paced as the first one either so that just feels like salt in the wound,2023-06-11
this movie ended like a good 5 times before it actually ended hahaha i had the exact same thought i already knew it was ending in a cliffhanger so i was expecting it to end any moment,2023-06-02
yeah they really made the music swell on each scene and i just kept waiting for that hard to black,2023-06-02
couldn’t have said it better myself i was expecting cut to credits soon as peter made it back to what he thought was his universe,2023-06-02
i was thinking to myself  they are goijng to butcher the ending and try to close every lose end in the last 10 minutes because there are too many villains then it happened ,2023-06-03
literally had me stressed the whole last 30 minutes thank  i wasnt the only one they just did this to us with fast 10 too,2023-06-04
i had to  the whole time and that was such a rough patch lol,2023-06-05
i watched it without my phone or any other method of keeping the time because i was getting my screen fixed at a repair shop near the theater and the entire time i kept thinking wow cant believe it hasnt been two hours yet,2023-06-02
oh man i thought i was the only one nailbiting about when it would end haha,2023-06-02
"holy  im glad i wasnt the only one  


i loved the mood after miles travels back to his home dimension but it really felt drawn out like it was going to end before miles gets home the pace was a bit strange it really felt like that should have been at most the last 10 mins of the movie or smt",2023-06-17
it really did i was sitting there like oh here we go cut to a cool ending shot nope more scenes but now oh nope okay but now nope okay now it ended right,2023-06-07
oh wow yeah this is exactly what i was experiencing,2023-06-11
yeah i felt the same,2023-06-11
i kinda wish it had ended when miles sees the mural to his dad and realizes that he’s in the wrong universe cutting it where they did felt a little bit off to me although i understand why they did it that way,2023-09-26
yeah im sure they said it was part 1 when they first announced it ages ago then they quietly dropped it from any marketing,2023-06-02
funnily enough my cinema showing left “part 1” in the title had no idea it was a twopartner beforehand,2023-06-04
which was a mistake,2023-06-02
"you and i have very different definitions of “hype” sir

i don’t find waiting a years for the end of what could have easily been a self contained plot very hype",2023-06-02
i also think ending infinity war when tachalla says “get this man a shield” would def be rough but,2023-06-02
so youre saying if they didnt make a 3rd movie it would still be fine without resolving anything,2023-06-03
there were so many of those moments in this movie i totally forgot about the one between miles and his dad while hes in costume but it was just as good i cannot wait to be able to watch this back to back with the next one to see all those moments pay off,2023-06-02
yup a lot of infinity war was in this spot progressively getting stronger  thanos gaining the stones,2023-06-02
good to know i’m not the only crazy person who went back to see it immediately,2023-06-02
bro there was a seizure at the ticket booth when i got to the theater tonight,2023-06-04
toronto,2023-06-02
"yah i was the one in my theater last night with a loud “what the  is this a joke”

that’s okay super excited to buy more movie tickets to see the rest of the movie i love not finishing the plot really uhh solid",2023-06-05
i only just watched it today and managed to avoid spoilers im not the type to yell or cheer in a theater but i legit wanted to let out a  damnit,2023-06-17
" like did you think that only an hour had passed at that point

yes i said exactly that to my family as we were walking out i really thought we were only an hour in",2023-06-18
"i didnt realise it had been that long i was  and then looked up wikipedia to see when the next one would be out and saw that it had a 140 minute of runtime

i immediately understood the split and was no longer annoyed i had no idea it had been that long",2023-06-22
fr i was not emotionally prepared for such a big cliffhanger tonight ,2023-06-08
im not opposed to a cliffhanger but they clearly cut it right in the middle which is obviously what a twoparter is supposed to do but it felt so jarring to end it at that,2023-06-08
"eh now were just splitting hairs theyre very comparable and essentially the same beats narratively empire simply ends on a more elatasad note but theyre very comparable see above lol miles is the han of his situation gwen is rallying the forces similar to luke and leia and there is the looming threat of whats yet to come the empire the spot 

to say they arent comparable because the endings dont follow the exact energy  in pacing is pretty pedantic imo",2023-06-04
dune doesnt have a part 1 in its title as well john wick ended with a cliffhanger not once but twice  the lord of the rings of course most people knows that its a trilogy but it does not show in its title too,2023-06-04
yeah somehow i doubt that “not being able to handle the heat” was an issue for this particular movie,2023-06-02
"no no we’re wrong for not suckling at sony’s glorious teet there is no room for critique either we loved every second of the movie and can’t wait for the sequel or we hated the whole thing and we’re using the ending as an excuse 

 reddit no room for nuance or thinking",2023-06-05
"they could’ve easily cut an hour and lost nothing of value

youve gotta be trolling",2023-06-07
"this viewpoint only makes sense if you think the ending is the only part of a story that matters and lord that’s gotta be such a depressing way to experience fiction

you got 2 and a half hours of amazing storytelling and you’ll get an extremely promising second half in less than a year you’ve more than gotten your money’s worth",2023-06-05
 thank you someone else noticed the  insane music composition it sounded like they were playing the movie off the stage for like 15 straight minutes,2023-06-03
"did you feel this way after infinity war

pirates 2

back to the future 2

matrix 2

dune

it

empire strikes back",2023-06-05
nice brag but youre an extremely slim minority telling people to watch this at home because nerds cant handle episodic storytelling is just doing people a disservice this movie is a fantastic theater experience and makes you stoked to see the sequel next year which is entirely the point,2023-06-03
"eh agree to disagree for this movie

as it was gwen focused started and ended with her and she went through a life changinghow you live your life changing arc",2023-06-04
"i did the same after the trailer für civil war showed that spiderman reveal since then i avoid trailers that are longer than a minute or are not the first teasertrailer whatever 

if it is a product i care about enough i even close my eyes in the theater when the trailer show 
made stuff for me so much more enjoyable even if it is movies that have no big reveals i enjoy not knowing for example the big action setpiece beforehand",2023-06-02
ive done this ever since i managed to see scott pilgrim vs the world and this is the end completely blind  i didnt even know the basic twists of those movies and for scott pilgrim i actually thought it was a completely different movie youth in revolt movies are so much better to me now that i cant piece together the basic plot from the trailers,2023-06-06
"literally every movie is more enjoyable the less you know about it havent watched a trailer for getting on 10 years only knew about doc ock returning in no way home because people on reddit spoiled it with memes after the trailer dropped lol that movie was incredible surprise after surprise

dont know why everybody doesnt do the same ",2023-06-12
me three,2023-06-04
"i get that not everyone who went tonight was what people here would consider “die hard” 

but the “casual” audience hasn’t yet seen this movie they will see it over the next few weekends what you described as your going to see evil dead i wouldn’t even consider “casual” you’re clearly an avid movie goer and therefore in a completely separate category",2023-06-02
"yea can’t agree more really hated the direction of the ending  near is ruining the enjoyment i had for the rest of the movie to me at the moment but i’m a little less upset now hearing it won’t be another 3 years until the second part and it’s instead slated to release this coming march

it was just objectively a terribly written ending i realize not every cliffhanger can be clean but it was like they didn’t even try",2023-06-02
sure luke  the gang are similar to gwen  the gang in that aspect  i’m fine with that leaving miles tied up like this would be like ending empire with han tied up in the thing before he’s iced between two really big things happening if you’re going to end it there it would’ve been better to end it with the vader ambush and han being captured miles realising he’s in the wrong universe at this point it feels like 23s of a movie as opposed to a really strong part 1,2023-06-03
yeah in the first movie miles is animated on twos or every other frame while peter b is animated on ones or every frame by the end of the movie miles is also animated on ones as a reflection of his growth and skills improving,2023-06-04
i understand the difference but theres a 0 chance that projectors show at 60hz in movie theaters im saying that theyre not going to be animating people at nonmultiples or fractions of 24fps because it introduces issues like judder,2023-06-04
castlevania arcane and edgerunners absolutely killed it for netflix there’s a few others that are decent but those go above and beyond,2023-06-19
dont lose your way,2023-08-14
it’s makes sense now since i read that but i was like that’s a noise straight out of the lego movie and laughed a little,2023-06-03
"same writers not directors the first movie had different directors the creators of both movies along with the lego movie and cloudy with a chance of meatballs are a team of two writers in fact most movies and stories in general are conceived by writers 

the problem is directors and producers who one could argue are significantly less detrimental to the creative process are the only names you hear that much other than the actors this is mostly because they fund the movies and the people with the money get their names plastered on everything no shade to directing or acting its awesome work but these stories you love and the scenes you remember were made by writers",2023-06-04
well im glad you saw it a second time even if that guy on your left mightve been a little annoying,2023-06-02
oh okay did you mind them using it for an official piece of work that will be making tons of money or you were just happy to see it up there also do they not need to credit you still for it,2023-06-02
did they attribute your work in the credits,2023-06-03
"one of the spidey variant like showed up less than a second but twice iirc is actually uncle ben from a universe where the burglar killed peter

well holland lost his aunt close enough,2023-06-03
makes sense given the bugle office was basically a recreation of the one in 2002 spiderman too haha,2023-06-02
really embracing the raimiverse there was an alfred molina “hello peter”  and “the power of x in the palm of my hand” line too,2023-06-04
still think he was the best in those movies,2023-06-03
great catch,2023-06-02
this along with the 42 on the spider really show how far ahead the writers were thinking,2023-06-04
such a sick observation,2023-06-02
you created me,2023-06-04
dude,2023-06-03
his final form was giving me the same vibes as the antispirals from gurran lagann cant wait to see how the inevitably over the top climax between him and miles will be,2023-06-04
this makes me uncomfortable don’t remember the right quote haha,2023-06-03
definitely some full metal alchemist gate  vibes from spot at the end,2023-06-04
"i had the same connection  the gate from fmab and antispirals from gurren lagann

also nge lilith a bit",2023-06-10
it reminded me more of the antispiral from gurren lagann,2023-06-18
when he was introduced the spot over his face gave me uzumaki vibes but i thought i was reading too much into this goofy character then when he powered up and his art went high contrast im pretty sure theres some inspiration,2023-06-15
apparently well be getting leopardan and supaidaman in beyond,2023-06-02
oof havent thought of pun pun in a little bit really does have similar vibes both visually and even somewhat emotionally,2023-06-05
its actually set up really well for miles to basically be the perfect point for miguel to focus his trauma on  miles is considered an anomaly hes wrong hes living someone elses life which is exactly what miguel was doing that ended up causing that universe to collapse  miguel hates miles because he sees miles as having what miguel lost  its a really welldone foil,2023-06-03
i think miguels character is underdeveloped we dont know much about his motivations or his origins but it was alluded to in this movie so im pretty sure this will be explained in the next one,2023-06-07
yknow of all the people that could be tapped for the role that arent simmons darin de paul is a top choice he is so expressive,2023-06-10
i dont really see things turning out any other way yeah miles nature is naturally abrasive but spot is the one messing with the fabric of reality and being a criminal few heroes would actually respect spot had they found him like that especially early on in their superhero career and especially being a spiderman,2023-06-20
no the peter parker who would have been bitten would be earth42 peter parker the peter parker who died in the first one was already spiderman and from miles universe still we already know spot isnt e42 peter parker,2023-06-04
wait he was i have to rewatch the movie i havent seen it since it first came out i just figured peter parker was spot since he didnt become spiderman like how miles 42 became prowler,2023-06-02
"thats not what i said tho

at first viewing of across i hadnt seen into since it released in theaters i did not remember a single thing from the 1st one my thinking was that peter parker was spot and should have been bitten but somehow the spider got loose and bit miles

since then people have clarified plot points from the first one elsewhere and now i know im wrong 

also i just watched into last night and its fresh in my mind now i know who the bagel guy was etc",2023-06-04
when were shown the scientists from earth 42 the prowler shadow is barely visible behind them,2023-06-20
i liked the wide far shot even more from their side,2023-06-03
"im in several fb groups with you and follow on insta this reminds me of the time rory kurtz randomly kept posting in this facebook statue collectors group im in i had to do a double take haha

looking for you in movie discussion posts on reddit will be my new wheres waldo lol jokes aside itll be cool to see you hopefully tackle this spidey trilogy at some point in the future

keep doing awesome work",2023-06-10

people have been pointing out how she has a trans narrative and the background colors and details in multiple places in her house are made to be the trans flag,2023-06-05
peter b parker will sacrifice himself for the baby remindme april 2024,2023-06-03
i was thinking more the dad than the kid  jeez,2023-06-04
i hate i learned what getting fridged means,2023-06-04
not so much peter himself as the idea of him having any sort of lasting happiness or any point beyond longsuffering martyrdom just look at the sheer lengths that writers have taken to prevent him from just marrying his true love maryjane because is she his true love if she keeps him from delicious miserys,2023-06-05
"this is a decade plus fight with the fans

around the early 2000s spiderman was clearly growing up into his 30s getting married being less strung out hints of maybe having a kid with mj most fans were generally okay with it having grown up with the character 

editorial specifically one guy felt spiderman was getting out of touch with his roots and wanted to keep the guy in his early 20s whose life is a mess and full of tragedy feel he had growing up singlehandedly retcons peter and mary jane as a couple extremely unpopular continues for like a decade

recent comic book runs hinted at undoing the retcon before yoinking it away again and once more spiderman is in this weird my life is a mess stage that most fans are getting old of very quickly like the comic editorial wants to freeze spiderman in amber and never change or grow",2023-06-05
i actually disagree that his assumptions arent wrong because of mumbattan the hole there is clearly a result of spots involvement with the collider but miguel is using it as further justification of his paranoid delusions regarding his idea of canon events if they acted on realities that quickly the two miles universes shouldnt exist by now since miles is an anomaly with powers from another world and miles missed the biggest canon event by not being bitten by that spider i think miguel is just flat out wrong,2023-06-09
ah ok that makes much more sense than my halfbaked idea xd,2023-06-04
"all of this miles was right when he said that accepting your spiderlife is going to be depressing as  simply because is messed up

also his life is a contradiction by miguels logic hes apparently both a spiderman that doesnt fit inside spidercanon because his spider was from universe 42 but also he does fit inside spidercanon because uncle aaron died and his captainachieving dads is predicted to die too so which is it is he not a proper spiderman whos breaking the rules or is he destined to hit all the canon beats of a proper spiderman

i think the 3rd movie is going to be about breaking the canon of what it means to be spiderman",2023-06-04
okay my thing is mary jane presumably works outside the home aunt may is dead in his universe and mayday has already developed her powers as a toddler so who can watch her without realizing that peter is spiderman,2023-06-21
meh it all tracks with what weve seen before in the mcu incursions can destroy universes and in the what if series we see strange try to break a canon event and the universe is destroyed as a result  miguel is correct and jessica even backs him up but what i think theyre wrong about is that theres no way around it thats going to have to be what miles figures out,2023-06-05
so long as paul isn’t a canon event everything’s gonna be fine lol,2023-06-10
"im imagining that well see it play out that miguels logic isnt entirely sound or correct and i hope we get to see it break down in this manner

i mean the three arguments of your dad dying is a canon event youre an anomaly because of the spider and if you break the canon your dimension gets glitched to destruction dont play together well at all

if our miles being spiderman is an anomaly and the universe corrects anomalies by glitching the dimension then this shouldnt be an issue miles dimension would have been destroyed by now earth42 would have been destroyed too because not having spiderman is apparently a huge anomaly

my thoughts so far are that miguel is enough of a narcissistis traumatized enough to have convinced himself that his entire world being destroyed was triggered by his own actions we have no real proof that this is the case",2023-06-03
i’m not sure miguel would have space for a suppository considering the massive rod up his butt,2023-06-05
so basically in miles’s case it’s just an unfortunate coincidence that his uncle ben and police capt just so happen to be his uncle aaron and his father,2023-08-14
is tony mcu spidey’s stacy,2023-06-07
"i guess ive been thinking of aaron as the source of his moral compass like he loves his dad but the constant flashbacks to the keep going kid scene sort of parallel uncle ben in a way i saw miles driving goal to be lowering the number of aarons in the world by making sure that good people dont have to resort to bad stuff to get by

it makes sense though that he might need a more lawful good inspiration to grow up and be the spiderman the worldmultiverse needs

one other thing  maybe i missed it  but i didnt follow the logic of leaping from uncles die captains die etc to my dad was just made captain so hes going to die now as a canon event again if miles is an anomaly how does a rule like that even apply to his story",2023-06-03
i assumed this was why they were somewhat selective about who gets contacted they only recruited the spideys that would be likely to go along with miguels perspective and spiderpunk just got in on cool factor i guess,2023-06-03
"i think none of the spiderpeople and cars thought to defy the negative canon events because they already went through their negative canon event  
from their perspective they’re thinking “if i didn’t go through this horrible thing i wouldn’t be here he has to go through his horrible thing too”  
what they’re not realizing is that their “darkest day” canon event doesn’t define who they are or where they end up they can still be heroes without a sad backstory",2023-06-03
or maybe its just all the other ones who defied it has gotten universes destroyed and gone,2023-06-07
"i mean yeah eventuality of death is one thing but saying this person is destined to be murdered at this exact moment and im going to physically stop you from saving them is an entirely different thing

like in some ways it calls into question what being a hero even is in this universe why save anyone at all if the act of saving a persons life can literally tear the universe apart i mean this is more of a freewill and how do you not become paralyzed when the existence of destiny has been proven question but its one that stories like this tend to ask",2023-06-10
i dont think mcu has ever had a villain introduced as harmless then developed to be truly villainous reverse is true though for loki,2023-06-05
sometimes it is the writers however is not an issue as simple as corporations bad artist good,2023-06-04
"you cant have your cake and eat it too
unless you get two cakes

i dont think this was a throwaway line and the two cakes are featured quite a bit later miles will find a second way without tearing down the current spider verse",2023-06-03
gosh i hope not,2023-06-02
yeah but uncle ben and captain stacy are both canon events lots of peters go through them both,2023-06-02
but regardless he was supposed to die at that moment apparently and hes supposed to be dead continuing from that moment,2023-06-02
its funny how people who actually read his comics loved the comedic take on him but all the people on twitter who are pretending to be fans of his are upset about it,2023-06-05
hes also a joke character and sometimes its better not to overdo it,2023-06-07
i actually reread it not too long ago and it wasn’t as bad as i remembered it being i mean it’s a mess but i didn’t hate it,2023-06-05
yes i identified it with the ok dad he says it often in brooklyn nine nine to holt,2023-06-02
i had the same reaction i cant believe i didnt clock that the whole movie i was thinking who is the voice of ben he sounds so familiar and then i read sambergs name in the credits and thought huh andy samberg was in this who the  was he,2023-06-03
spider sense also doesnt always work like in the case of venom who has spidermans powers peter cant sense him,2023-06-03
but considering ben reilly was born from at the time the most controversial story in comics and the current run is doing not too positive things for him so essentially it checked out,2023-06-02
"he was the 90s comic book version of serious which is basically overly edgy and tryhard aka everything rob liefeld ever drew

it seemed cool at the time but now its kinda cringe and super dated so hes basically mocking that",2023-06-02
well i’m talking about how the tone is strikingly different from “disrespectful you left our bout” to “i will destroy the multiverse as i sip my tea”,2023-06-10
"you guys aren’t really friends you’re always fighting”
“that’s because we’re not friends we’re family” gotg2",2023-06-04
incredible amounts of swearing including “” now shang chi probably said “” 47 times they all now have adult themes  innuendos etc but removed all the things that made them appealing for kids and family,2023-06-03
"you know they are gonna joke about it and her being white when they are a couple lol i am sure the same applies if miles meetswere to meet george and pulled thata cop like him definitely would givehim  the have her home by 9 spiel but black latino asian and nonwhite ethnic groups tend not to play that especially the older folks 


we may be more aware nowadays how their generation can be unnecessarily stuck in their ways about some things but i gotta agree with them on this one its definitely tacky in jobprofessional settings or meeting a friend or especially a partners parents always use formality unless stated other wiseie please call me so and so or mr was my fathers name

hopefully in the sequel when all this settles down they can redo introductions with a proper maamsir or mrmrs morales",2023-06-02
thats all they are to you eh,2023-06-03
"but the father would’ve died also if he was spiderman if canon is to be believed

so what’s the difference

imo either this miles would’ve been evil even if he got bit by the spiders or is he isn’t evil as prowler even though he wasn’t i don’t really buy it otherwise",2023-06-09
speaking of commercial endorsements there were a lot of very noticeable shots of zomato billboards in mumbattan with the whole chase even ripping through one of them,2023-06-08
 excellent connection,2023-06-21
would be interesting but maybe too predictable for this series loved the way this one started differently,2023-06-05
"i think the canon point is a red herring a lot of the story points are about shaping spiderman but what happens after theyre established

especially since the movies themselves are so optimistic that its dealing with the countering pessimism of miguel

i think both gwen and jeff will survive and prove to be much more effective tragedy doesnt have to define your life",2023-06-02
i mean didnt gwen already break a canon point she made her father retire from the force unless he doesnt end up retiring shouldnt her universe be collapsing,2023-06-02
think its gonna be jessica also what happened to pravith his canon point got altered but his universe seems to be fine,2023-06-02
wasn’t her father choosing to quit being captain proof that canon points aren’t absolute,2023-06-04
was about to be very upset about this comment before i read the second half of it if they break up gwiles ill cry,2023-06-03
shes just far too good of a character for sony to  off,2023-06-02
i agree she wont die but i suspect that movie will be set during the six months between when she leaves her dimension and before she meets miles again,2023-06-02
its likely spiderpunk,2023-09-12
miles has a while arc about not being fully open and honest with his parents as well as thinking he needs to followed other spiderpeople vs just believing in himself and his own judgement,2023-06-04
miles has a whole arc about not being fully open and honest with his parents as well as thinking he needs to followed other spiderpeople vs just believing in himself and his own judgement,2023-06-04
pavitrs universe seems fine after the canon event disruption tho or did i miss somethinh,2023-06-02
i was able to hear everything totally fine i wouldnt blame individual theaters because its probably more complicated than that but it was not universal for sure,2023-06-05
i didnt have any audio issue apart from having hard time to understand punk spideys thick accent but it was imax so maybe that helped because theatres generally  over here,2023-06-08
they’re pretty fun,2023-06-05
i was trying to spot the 94 fox spiderman did i miss him or just blended in with the 100 others,2023-06-03
i legit thought he was rorschach at first before remembering it was the wrong universe,2023-06-04
same i absolutely love this movies take on him i do enjoy the character no one takes seriously because on surface level hes a gimmick but if you really analyze him hes actually potentially very powerful or deadly trope also his origin being an echo effect from a dumb bagel fits the dumb villain of week vibe he has,2023-06-05
til he wasnt invented for the movie,2023-06-05
he was kind of lame and untimidating to me was he like that in comics miguel came off as more of a villain while not being one,2023-06-03
its like how the portal gun wand of hither thither in the dd movie is obviously just something the dm retconned into their inventory to let them get past a puzzle they botched but ends up becoming the key to winning the whole campaign because its actually a gamebreaking major artifact that shouldnt exist,2023-06-03
a broken clock is right twice a day,2023-06-02
im surprised he didnt ask for a huge call out during the credits for it i rolled my eyes during no way home at the selfaggrandizing how great he is section of the credits,2023-06-06
strong chance he pitched it as a solo movie without spiderman and lm jumped on using him,2023-06-02
he does learn to use a portal to slice through miles webbing at some point,2023-06-04
hes got the portal gun we all know from experience now how powerful that thing is,2023-06-03
even in the first fight i kept thinking all he has to do is teleport spidermans head in the path of a bus or close the portal on his neck i dont even think spot was seriously trying to  miles or he easily couldve by their second fight he wants enough power to destroy miles entire world and leave him desolate,2023-06-04
in comics originally he meant to be dumb gag character strong but dumb spiderman is smarter and predicts with spidey senses but this spot is literally on level of amazo justice league cartoon show but more op because power,2023-06-02
"wow mate that’s a throwback 


used to adore those books",2023-06-02
"shimazaki from mob psycho was also a teleporter with a great fight who lost only to the combined effort of everyone

you can search his fights on youtube and they are both amazing",2023-06-03
naruto shippuden has some cool teleportation like abilities that truly made those characters a powerhouse,2023-06-02
"the skulduggery pleasant books are great i wasnt expecting to see them mentioned here

i really need to continue reading the rest of those i hadnt picked it back up for a while since i lost track of which book i stopped at

this was before i started noting down exactly which chapter of a book or episode of a tv show i finished last",2023-06-02
obligatory read worm but read worm in a universe that rewards creative use of powers one of the closest things the series has to a teleporter is terrifying,2023-06-03
janemba from dragon ball z used an almost identical fighting style teleporting his fists punching goku through portals and stuff and it will never not be cool,2023-06-03
ive had skulduggery pleasant on my toread list for years now happy to hear theres going to be a good teleportation fight in it,2023-06-04
i stupidly thought spot was some jacked up variant of spiderman that got dragged into miles dimension never read the comics,2023-06-02
if you look closely at the sequence where they show the spider being teleported you can see the silhouette of someone wearing braids its miles from earth42 who instead became the prowler,2023-06-03
"makes sense im going on intuition here rather than detail

is the scientist character behind spot going to be some larger reveal or is his nobody persona part of the point",2023-06-03
i know this is a loose adaptation but doesnt the peter parker spiderman also die before miles morales becomes ultimate spiderman this coupled with the fact that miles already had his canon event his uncle dying in the first movie leads me to believe that sm2099 is either mistaken about miles being an anomaly or he has ulterior motives for targeting miles,2023-06-08
"so what youre saying is

the only way to stop the spot is with googly eyes",2023-06-04
i thought for sure the live action universe with the chinese lady was a crossover with everything everywhere all at once before someone told me its mrs chen from venom,2023-06-03
felt intentional to me it was great,2023-06-03
,2023-06-02
with a bagel,2023-07-04
i agree they serve no purpose if i want to eat bread im not picking the one with a hole in the middle at least with doughnuts theres the advantage of being sweet and easy to hold,2023-06-02
apparently there was a time when bagels as in zeroes was slang in new york for nothing or a failure,2023-06-03
everything everywhere all at once,2023-06-03
a very long title that won best picture recently get with the times,2023-06-03
wow you have to have a very high iq to understand eeaao the humour is extremely subtle and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewers head,2023-06-11
lucas wasn’t even involved with star wars when rogue one was writtem,2023-06-02
its too soon for that subtle of a reference apparently ,2023-06-02
"well sure that part could have been let out entirely but it was just a funny continuation of the joke from the first film

him being the bagel guy or not didnt actually change anything in this movie",2023-06-05
yeah the reason miguel is so convinced miles is an anomaly is his world already had a spiderman who died because of him while the spider coming over from another dimension deprived that world of its spiderman so the multiverse is one spiderman short,2023-06-03
seems like he never became spiderman,2023-06-25
uncle aarons apartment was also tinted purple in the first movie a clue to his identity as prowler,2023-06-08
it’s not often i mind being color blind but this movie made me really wish i could see all the colors,2023-06-11
"it didnt register to me until he glitched out and that slow realization hit me like a truck  


wait why is he gliching wait no no no no no no no no no no",2023-06-04
late to the conversation but the computer saying “42” completely flew over my head and i don’t know if anybody else noticed but the first hint that he wasn’t in his universe for me was rio’s eyes early in the movie her eyes are brown like miles’ but when he goes to 42 her eyes are green and that was when i first got suspicious,2023-06-12
i did notice his accent but did not connect the dots with his missing father makes perfect sense kudos,2023-06-06
also the signs in the background as miles is heading home have numerous references to spiderman villains since they wind up running the city including a vulture financial and an electro branded electronics store,2023-06-11
and like peter and peter b in the first one theyre voiced by different people who sound similarly enough that its possible to think theyre the same actor,2023-06-11
are those any kind of specific shoe are they just jordan 1s with different colors,2023-06-02
nike will just tell you to buy their nft instead,2023-06-07
she also didnt have earrings iirc,2023-06-04
he got that idiot at the copy store to lie for him,2023-06-03
you think this is bad this chicanery hes done worse,2023-06-04
chicanery,2023-06-05
that was a fun film,2023-06-05
oh wow i did not have time to clock that,2023-06-09
i’m also curious about that she’s sitting at a console for the ghm so it’d probably be a safe assumption,2023-06-07
the machine read his dna and inputted 42 because of the spider that bit him presumably altering his dna he briefly uncamouflaged a tiny bit of his eye for it to read and that’s when the machine quickly shows 42 as the destination i don’t think any character in the movie was aware that he was going there,2023-06-06
lol,2023-06-02
if a radioactive spider bites a fly does it become spiderfly,2023-06-03
i saw it but like i said im not remembering numbers on the fly its just numbers to me im more interested in whats happening are they gonna stop miles from going home lets see ,2023-06-03
i remember seeing the 42 on the go home machine and sort of realizing what that meant in the back of my head i was distracted enough by all that was going on that i didnt really think about it though and still got surprised,2023-06-13
okay but evidenced by the reaction of a lot of people in my theater people didnt catch on that miles didnt go back home until its explicitly revealed verbally good for you that you caught it but i didnt and a lot of people in my theater didnt like i said not everyone is paying attention to numbers,2023-06-02
" i caught it when he got scanned by the going home machine 

miguel says miles is a anomaly in his own world and his spider was from a different earth

he gets scanned so it would find the right earth he should be sent to the one his spider came from",2023-06-12
average redditor must find a way to disagree with something even when there’s no disagreement to be had,2023-06-10
nah he said it has a shot to be nominated for best picture which i agree with it just depends on the rest of the year but its not impossible toy story 3 and up were best picture nominees and there seems to be more nominees for bp each year,2023-06-02
you literally quoted them saying nominated not winning ,2023-06-04
"killers of the flower moon and color purple are shoeins for nominations and fincher’s the killer is definitely possible a24 is preparing a campaign for saltburn and maestro and may december are actingheavy movies from lauded directors plus rustin is practically built for the oscars a biopic about a black  civil rights activist planning the 1963 march on washington 

this isn’t even mentioning the lowerprofile movies that have a chance if they get good reviews challengers a zendaya star vehicle from the director of call me by your name and freud’s last session where anthony hopkin’s freud has a theological debate with cs lewis and tolkien focusing on his lesbian daughter",2023-06-04

"you dont want another season

greg weisman proved that he does nothing but blow his load when he gets the chance to continue dream projects young justice came back for two more seasons after almost a decade of waiting and all he did was introduce a dozen storylines bog the show down with a hundred new characters and proceed to never conclude any prior or new storylines that were introduced

if anything im happy for spectacular fans that it was young justices reputation that got tarnished and not spectaculars",2023-06-03
how did it end,2023-06-02
it’s fun a very andrew garfield energy,2023-06-27
i swear he said “wait are you talking about me” have no clue what line you’re referring to unless miles said it,2023-06-03
i am also kinda confused cus i saw an animated ps spidey but then they showed the actual ps spidey in his game model multiple ps spidey a ig,2023-06-03
"i mean they could’ve i believe greg weisman said he had no involvement whatsoever with atsv so it might’ve not been in the original plan

eta he confirmed this weekend that he was not consulted at all for atsv",2023-06-02
" no

you sat through that two and half hour movie use a little critical thinking",2023-06-06
infinity war experience was unreal in the theatre everybody in the audience quiet and looking defeated,2023-06-03
"that opening night experience is the heroine dragon i will always chase but never catch it hasnt been the same since infinity warendgame across the spiderverse was pretty close though

every now and then ill pull up live reactions of iweg just to feel something",2023-06-03
yes i can’t watch the next one immediately after but it’s till extremely pumped for the next one based off this movie fortunately i’ve learned patience and can wait,2023-06-11
prowler miles wouldve already sold it,2023-06-12
they should definitely add this to the next movie,2024-02-17
"suuuurrrre i mean i thought of that but in canon spiderman or especially tobeyverse who was the police captain

closest they got was willem dafoe… right",2023-06-04
yep pretty sure gwen’s is peter instead of ben and the usually gwen stacy is probably one as well,2023-06-04
"i hope not i hope they find a clever way to resolve the story within the parameters they set in this movie rather than backtracking on it  miguel was wrong about the rules of the multiverse is not a compelling resolution imo and would undermine the tension set in this movie

but at the same time even if they dont backtrack on these rules its still quite messy in general this seems to happen in almost every multiverse movie",2023-07-12
even the discs for the extended editions have more appropriate endings following the council of the ring mines of moria etc…,2023-06-03
i don’t see the correlation as you’ve laid it out i’m not the only one who has this opinion rotten tomatoes itself even calls it a cliffhanger ending the lord of the rings all three don’t end on cliffhangers that was the point i’d made i’m not sure what’s wrong about that opinion,2023-06-04
the only reason i realized that it was probably the venom universe was because of the venomint gum nothing else,2023-06-03
the audience whom i saw the movie absolutely roared when the spot appeared in mrs chens store,2023-06-03
not captain obvious to me i never saw venom so i had no idea who she was til this thread,2023-06-03
would have been helpful for me i had no idea who she was,2023-06-03
uhh yes,2023-06-05
he’s black  him,2023-06-12
yeah plus the credits mention insomniac’s spiderman 2,2023-06-02
i was wondering about this because the gameplay had the spider arms in combat and i was like “wait a minute that’s gotta be sm2”,2023-06-02
plus spiderman in the game on his screen whips out four mechanical arms during combat that didn’t look like the ones from the first game,2023-06-02
so wait both 1 and the miles game and 2 would count as fanfic in this universe right,2023-06-02
 that’s crazy lol,2023-06-02
idk why my mind went to the ps2 raimi game ,2023-06-02
holy  this detail is as cool as spider punk and that dude is reaaaaally cool,2023-06-02
ya ganke was holding a ps5 controller while he was playing on his bed,2023-06-03
yeah we also see him using the spider legs in a finisher move iirc which arent in the first one,2023-06-02
i thought you meant the first spiderman 2,2023-06-04
i mean its pretty obvious you can clearly see spiderman do a new moveset with new tentacles that matches the ones in the first reveal trailer,2023-06-29
make him a streamer as he streams you can see his roommate sneaking out the window in the background hastily putting on a spiderman suit but hes got an audience of like two halfinterested people so nobody notices,2023-06-02
they probably have it a bit different lord and miller said in the past that miles universe is supposed to be very close to ours but with superheroes,2023-06-16
i was surprised to see a clip of spectacular when miguel was explaining the spiderverse and then was so stoked to see him walk up in the intervention scene,2023-06-02
same one of my favorite spiderman animated series,2023-06-02
wasnt that fake,2023-06-02
i regret giving my action figures to good will even had one that got stained with white out but i pretended it was exposed skin as battle damage i miss those days,2023-06-02
apparently captain stacy died in his universe since we see and hear him mourn him in that sequence talking about a captain close to spiderman dying so curious as to the time gap between season 2 of spectacular and seeing him here,2023-06-02
correct me if im wrong but i think its 2d animation with 3d lighting similar to klaus or paperboy i think they did the same thing for spiderham it helps make the 2d figure look a part of the 3d world,2023-06-02
i thought he mumbled something too,2023-06-03
thanks,2023-06-05
one was the video game monster from spiderman and his amazing friends show from the 80s,2023-06-13
yeah miguel namedrops the mcu’s universe number and dr strange during the fight with vulture in the opening,2023-06-02
you hear dock ock say hello peter too from no way home,2023-06-02
miguel references no way home in the gwen prologue dr strange and that little nerd from earth199999 mcu universe,2023-06-02
dr strange and that little nerd when hes talking about the multiverse getting  up lol,2023-06-02
nerd and doctor strange,2023-06-02
there was miguel at the start of the film mentioned doctor strange and that little nerd holland spiderman  up the multiverse a holland appearance is almost surely going to be likely,2023-06-02
called him the nerd,2023-06-02
also when a hologram of ock shows up he says hello peter and its the voiceline from nwh,2023-06-02
yeah it was even on the second trailer,2023-06-03
tom holland was shown as a footage when miguel was explaining the multiverse to miles,2023-06-04
“dr strange and the little nerd”,2023-06-07
and dont even get me started on dr strange and that kid,2023-06-15
"yeah it had me chuckling a bit
 
dr strange and his little nerd friend over on earth1999999999",2023-06-12
and tobey,2023-06-02
wasnt it scene from one of his movies or games,2023-06-03
theyre a little old but with some digital deaging shameik moore could totally be a liveaction miles and hailee stanfield could totally play a liveaction gwen,2023-06-02
hoping the beyond is hinting at beyond animation  would love to see miles pop into one of the live action universes even just for a scene or two,2023-06-02
would liveaction spiderham be john mulaney or a real pig,2023-06-05
wasnt the 90s animated spiderman the first spiderman story to introduce a spiderverse that would be interesting,2023-06-15
i was really hoping for 90s tv show spiderman or spiderman unlimited to show up,2023-06-04
"pretty sure they used the rift in the sky from no way home in the vulture mid credits scene heavily implying thats how it happened

and yeah it is a plot hole since dr strange wants to send the displaced characters in the mcu back to their respective universes by virtue that vulture is a mcu native it wouldnt make sense

at least across the spiderverse can give them something to fixthough they need to show him glitching in and out",2023-06-02
worth pointing out that he says hes against vulture spreading around alien energy weapons that blow  up but he was interested in the more lowkey tech useful for stealing rather than battle  especially a gadget vulture offered him giving him the ability to climb walls which has always been one of prowlers major abilities,2023-06-04
"hey shaft whats going on

aw nothing      lets find some hoes",2023-06-07
its literally the same character that shows up in this movie lol,2023-06-03
it would be another miles right i mean id love to see this one but that would be weird,2023-06-02
im really really hoping this is the case personally these cameos do nothing for me i want an actual follow up to his character from homecoming,2023-06-02
"hes 100 dying in the first movie he appears in 

theres no way donald glover signs up for a multimovie deal",2023-06-12
lol who tf dislikes jb literally the first time in my life i’ve seen this take,2023-06-04
james blake for the well educated,2023-06-02
danny glover of our era xd,2023-06-04
absolutely but not until it leaves theaters so he doesnt spoil it that reveal was one of my favorite parts of the movie,2023-06-02
they had the premiere in paris and it was nuts cheers at almost every reference joke it was mayhem havent seen a crowd so excited in front of a screen since the world cup,2023-06-02
mine too it was lots of fun,2023-06-02
sure didnt happen with me might go see it again but wouldnt be the same then again you know its gonna be fanservice galore right off the bat,2023-06-02
tbh i hate when the crowd cheers thankfully that was the only time they reacted,2023-06-02
you are correct,2023-06-04
edited thank you,2023-06-05
miles first appearance in comics was in august 2011,2023-06-03
yeah that specific episode of community season 2’s “anthropology 101” aired in september 2010 that was about a year before mile’s first appearance in august 2011 as taraxian pointed out,2023-06-05
im here to rep gotg3 which felt a lot like classic marvel,2023-06-05
"wakanda forever  i think people jusy look at it through rose tinted lenses because chadwick died if hypothetically the actor retired from the role instead of passing and they made the exact same movie that they actually did i dont think people would give it as much love as they have

the script was messy the cgi and effects were terrible in places ironheart was so messily forced in there i found namor underwhelming 

not to say there werent great moments in there there were but the overall final product was very meh",2023-06-08
wakanda forever was not good beginning and end were great but the middle was boring as  can’t have a black panther movie without black panther,2023-06-03
"multiverse of madness

they went to one other new york where red and green traffic lights were switched and pizza came in balls",2023-06-08
being in the same couple of years as eeaao and across the spiderverse just makes it look sad,2023-06-12
"same and as a christian bale fan and someone who doesnt read comics and even heard about the  butcherer with the nexrosword i was beyond hyped

what that movie came to be was such a dissappintment

christian bale couldve been a whole saga cillain ala kang or dr doom and if you use him for one movie ag least get thah one right for gods sake",2023-06-03
yeah ragnarok is in my mcu top 3 but love and thunder is in the bottom 3,2023-06-14
and it worked very fun time,2023-06-05
"the real fight starter is best multiverse movie of the 2020s across the spiderverse or everything everywhere all at once

i’m not giving an answer because i’m not sure i can",2023-06-12
shang chi was decent my only complaint was i found awkwafina insufferable in it,2023-06-08
im so glad someone else is saying it nwh was such a nothing movie and ever since it came out people keep on raving about it i barely see any negative comments,2023-06-06
dr strange was definetly fun wakanda forever started strong but tapered off was a touch long as well antman was not really good felt like a mess those had its moments both good and bad christian bale was soooo good,2023-06-04
"i disliked both dr strange and wakanda forever both had too much hype behind them but were underwhelming af

thor was the worst movie ive ever seen in a cinema

i thought antman was a fun movie with a lot of rick and mortyesque comedy and is the only one since spiderman that i watched twice",2023-06-08
i can’t believe you’re getting downvoted we now have two great examples of wonderful spiderverse films and yet people speak of nwh as if it was a masterclass in writing and story,2023-06-04
"i still really like both ffh and nwh but the spiderverses are betrer movies

nwh just hit the nostalgia jackpot so hard for me that i cant put it above spiderverse 1 since i saw that one at home and it‘s a different experience in a theater verse 2 clears nwh tho",2023-06-03
"i also thought no way home was bad it’s a small club but happy to be in it there’s a solid tom holland spidey movie in there that’s completely trampled by forced fan service we really didn’t need to see sandman and electro again i didn’t have any nostalgia for andrew garfield’s spidey and tobey mcguire was barely in it and didn’t look like he wanted to be there 

also they set the story up by making peter parker and dr strange act uncharacteristically dumb green goblin was great the hollandspecific story beats were great they should’ve just brought back green goblin and told a contained story about a really bad week for spiderman",2023-06-03
why you acting like no way home is fant4stick or x men origins wolverine level of bad,2023-06-04
every mcu movie is rated pg13 the very first one is about a womanizing billionaire man child that makes and sells weapons and straight up kills people the first time he takes his iron man suit out these movies have never been “all ages”,2023-06-03
gotg3 is definitely worth it best movie since endgame easily,2023-06-09
"the multiverse saga is what is happening right now and that name wasnt created until we needed separate distinctions in 2019 for the upcoming movies and the previous ones this wont be over until 2026 with phase 6 and they have dipped into plenty of multiversal threats so that is not true

the universe you are thinking of is called the infinity saga and that is absolutely complete with references to the infinity stones throughout the entirety of the 11 year span

infinity saga doesnt have to include the multiverse but it did include build up for the infinity stones 

i think you mixed up the saga names",2023-06-02
"i really like the batmans take on the hero origin story its not about why bruce becomes the batman you know gunshot and pearls in the alley

its about why batman becomes a hero instead of a monster who wants to punish an entire city for what hes lost turning from inward to outward finding meaning in it instead of being one long extravagant suicide",2023-06-06
same here last night was giving me tenet flashbacks,2023-06-04
yeah i saw it in dolby too and gwen especially sounded like she was quietly mumbling at times,2023-06-07
they mean altogether the issue being having to turn the audio back down for different movies in the same auditorium i haven’t seen a projector with separate audio track levels but maybe i’m wrong,2023-06-03
"it depends on the theater probably often dialogue is mixed to come through the center speaker so if the projectionist is able to turn the center channel up without adjusting the entire mix it should make the dialogue louder 

when i worked at a little indie theater we had separate amplifiers for each channel i’m sure the big chains have them too but i’m not sure what those companies allow their projectionists to do",2023-06-07
no your not allowed to mess with the mix at most theaters its my projectionists despise nolan films constant audience complaints we cant fix,2023-07-02
i saw the cure the night before and definitely had the same thought,2023-06-04
me on every single movie nowadays ahso this is the one,2023-06-07
"john wick 4 in dolby atmos was loud af especially the very first scene everyone at the theater was visibly shook

i saw spiderverse in lincoln sq imax and it wasnt loud at all for movie theater standards",2023-06-05
apparently some of the production staff have said its a theater speakeraudio setting problem,2023-06-06
link to the ones you buy,2023-06-04
thank  im not the only one i especially noticed it during the chase sequence where the audio feels like it should be coming from the back and the sides but all of it felt concentrated towards the front audio channels,2023-06-04
"this is exactly how i described it to guest services it literally felt like there were entire audio channels missing amc gave me two free vouchers and seemed pretty receptive to my complaints

had to go out and ask someone to turn it up about twenty minutes in because i couldnt hear anything

a guy working the theater agreed and thought the audio was messed up too",2023-06-04
saw it in austria and there wasnt an audio issue,2023-06-02
same issue over here in california,2023-06-02
had no issues yesterday so is def a problem with the cinemas individually but not the movie,2023-06-02
if you wanted to see it again they just sent out a new mix apparently,2023-06-11
thank you,2023-06-02
could be more then one peter usually ends up holding the corpse of his uncle captain stacey and gwen at some point,2023-06-02
right but they were very specific that there also had to be a police captain theyre close to die as well,2023-06-02
spider man canon includes losing ben capt stacy gwen and harry after he tries to  him of course  it was heartbreaking,2023-06-02
"yeah hes had a canon event now but thats not at all how that was supposed to play out if 42 miles had been the one bitten prowler in our miles universe wouldnt have died

so yes hes had a canon event now and so has 42 miles however to keep them connected our miles still needs to keep having more canon events since theres multiple but he wants to stop that  and not have his father die",2023-06-05
there are multiple canon events that was pretty clear not sure how this is upvoted it was really easy to understand,2023-06-09
he may have destroyed his for show and still had a second one i mean he did go around stealing parts,2023-06-02
maybe i’m wrong but i think you can use portals without wearing the cuff so he probably used the cuff he made for gwen to make a portal home put the cuff in the box to give to the captain and went through the portal without it,2023-06-03
use it to open the portal back home before taking it off and giving it to gwens dad,2023-06-24
personally i really wanted to see how tom did as a lonely poor guy spiderman and am kinda hyped to see how it goes that said you make a good point the same tropes are def holding spiderman back,2023-06-03
"fr i really like babyavenger spiderman

when i was 15 i got really into avenger fam fanfics fics where tony adopts peter parker and it’s just wholesome avengers being a family and trying to raise this genius dorky kid sometimes but not always it would have steve and tony be married as peter’s dads this was before winter soldier so that was the most popular ship in the fandom at the time lol and before all the avengers family angst

and then tom holland happened and it felt like all my teenage mcu dreams came true

of course i used to be a huge spideypool shipper but i stopped after holland because i just… i cannot picture holland and ryan reynolds being in a relationship together it’s too creepy and weird  so that basically killed that entire ship for me lol",2023-06-08
i mean these movies were kinda like a prequel im fine if they make the adult struggling spider man and end with him in a good note toms not a bad spider either,2023-11-04
read ultimate spiderman has a beginning and an end every important spiderman event retold cohesively miles first appearance came from this series too,2023-06-02
jm straczynski run before sins past and one more day disasters he keeps a healthy life married with mj and aunt may knows his identity,2023-06-03
"ultimate is always the goto place to start since its so easy to pick up and read in its own continuity and with an actual ending

but since people already recommended that here are some great runs in the main continuity i would recommend

j michael straczynskis run on spiderman 20012007 is really good it has a few noticeable dips in quality later on but the first two trades at least i would highly recommend it does a lot of new and exciting stuff with the character and has some really onpoint and quirky writing

roger sterns run 19821984 is fantastic has a bunch of really great storylines and crimedrama stuff

stan lees original run and the subsequent roy thomasgerry conway runs are also worth checking out if you can get past the slightly dated writing loads of great stories in there that pretty much every single spiderman iteration borrows from to some extent

also not a run but spiderman blue is a must read cant recommend it enough",2023-06-06
just throwing one out there but kraven last hunt was a really good read and can fill you in on the new game coming out,2023-06-02
i’ll be honest most of my comic reading is super haphazard and uninformed so take this with a grain of salt haha i loved superior spiderman pretty much all of ultimate but especially the intro to miles marvel knights spiderman which i think was repackaged with a different name eventually and then i’d say that run of amazing spiderman with stracynski other than sins past and one more day being dreadful was amazing some really great adult peter stuff,2023-06-02
i think that’s what new heroes are for or occasional resets and such that’s what miles was for instance but it’s okay to let people grow and change and introduce new options for the kids,2023-06-03
"idk if i agree with this whole take  the target demographic for comics has definitely shifted a lot over the past 60odd years since spidey first appeared comic books were originally sold at newspaper stands for kids to buy something when mom and dad  then grew into their own industry in the 70s and 80s and by the 90s the most dominant demographic when it came to actually reading comic books were adults who grew up reading them as kids

its gone back and forth since then but generally your average superhero comics tend to be aimed at a market between mid to late teen and adult thats especially where spiderman has lived for the last few years i think there is a lot of spiderman media aimed towards children especially most of the animated adaptations but if youre following spidey in the comics chances are youre not a middle schooler youre someone who has been deeply invested in the character for a while and if you tried to read the comics youd probably bounce off of it pretty quickly because everything requires so much status quo knowledge that will just bore you 

just one example  kindred was a character who first appeared in a 2004 run of amazing spiderman back when i was in grade school  its actually the alter ego of two people gabriel and sarah the twin children of an illicit romance between norman osborn the green goblin and gwen stacy before her back snapped in half in a story published 30 years earlier before i was born who aged super rapidly because of the goblin venom in normans blood who were brainwashed into thinking peter was really their father and that he killed gwen then in another recent story 20 years after the original one after ive graduated college and now work and live on my own its revealed that all that  i just told you big  lie not a word of it was true the actual origin of gabriel and sarah is that theyre actually clones of gwen stacy not her children and who was their creator an evil corrupted artificial intelligence copy of harry osborns personality from the time that harry osborn was trapped in  by the demon mephisto whose sole objective was to torment spiderman because it was revealed once that norman osborn sold his sons soul to the devil to be more successful in business back when harry was a child which retroactively explains why harry is constantly so miserable all the time and the harry weve known since another story from 2008 written when i was a middle schooler has actually been a clone while the original one is sending demon clone babies of his ex girlfriend to torment his bestie from high school 

im not saying this isnt for kids because the story is deep or edgy or too difficult and confronting for them  its just that kids really arent the target audience for spiderman comics right now because the series is written by hardcore fans of spidey who each want to make their own editorial mark undo or retcon or retell their favorite or least favorite stories and so everything becomes about trying to do something new or unique with stuff from 30 years ago which makes the comics really unapproachable for anyone whos not an entrenched fan or whos not willing to do a  of wikipedia surfing and backissue reading just for something to make some sort of sense to them

even though in the cultural consciousness spidey remains a wisecracking teenager trying to balance being a high school kid with new yorks greatest hero because thats what he is in most adaptations in the comics hes a whole  adult who has lived a thousand lifetimes hes been a reporter he revealed his secret identity and became a full time avenger then he was a high school science teacher hes been married to mj for years before giving up his marriage to save aunt mays life he got his phd when his body was taken over by doc oc started his own stark industries knockoff then got exposed for plagiarizing his phd thesis lost his company went back to couchsurfing had a thousand different relationships etc the peter parker of the comics is so far removed from our common understanding of spiderman that trying to keep that spidey alive in the comics absent a hard reset on the entire universe is a waste of time theres a reason that ultimate was so wellloved  because it quit trying to tread an awkward middle path between original spidey vibes and the growing and changing audience of spidey fans who want to see their favorite character get out of the rut hes been stuck in for 20 some years",2023-06-03
"no 6 year old wants to read about a peter with marital issues  the character is so popular because he’s very relatable to the target audience

i started reading spiderman when i was at that age this was around the middle of the j michael straczynskis run where peter was married which at that point he had been for almost 20 years already

i grew up with a grown up married spiderman being the status quo didnt seem to prevent 6 year old me from becoming obsessed",2023-06-06
i think part of it is that the spider bite grants superhuman strength so in a growing kid you get this growthmuscle spurt but i agree that adding two years to the gap between the first movie and this would have benefited it when his parents are talking to the counselor the first line of dialog is we know we have two years why not have him going to college within a few months makes the whole leaving the nest bits more impactful,2023-06-04
he looks old enough to vote,2023-06-11
"what you mean your problems in your 20s of being broke  and trash evolve and mature in your 30s and r0s nobody would ever want to read that im age 60 and still have the mental outlook of a teenager

  joe quesada probably",2023-06-05
"this dates back to before the marc webb movies when donald glover said he wanted to play spiderman there was a huge backlash from comic nerds and there was even a letter that one fan wrote that spiderman couldnt be black because there were no black kids like peter parker 

miles morales debuted in comics in 2011 and this controversy happened around 2010 or so i didnt realize at the time but miles likely exists as a clapback to the gatekeeping from the spiderman fandom
so his whole character arc about being an anomaly that wasnt supposed to exist and the whole theme that anyone can be spiderman is definitely intentional",2023-06-03
they still do it,2023-06-04
i think there are pretty clear signals that miguel is not in the right,2023-06-02
"they also literally showed in the movie that gwens universe was altered her dad is no longer captain and her universe didnt die

miguel is wrong his universe was destroyed for a different reason and he was so overcome with grief that he assumed it was his fault and took it out on all the other spider people

same with miles he got bit by a different dimensions spider he wasnt supposed to be spider man so his universe was altered 

it didnt get destroyed",2023-06-04
so you’re believing the dude who is juicing on some secret substance and had red eyes when he got angry don’t think he’s the most reliable narrator bud,2023-06-04
im sure co is taking it super well,2023-06-04
things don’t have to be meant as criticisms but this one is and it ain’t veiled it’s a meta movie about what makes a spiderman that quite literally can’t not be a criticism,2023-06-18
they mean you dont need to assume they got back together because theyre shown back together and literally have a child in this movie lol,2023-06-12
miles 42 looked so menacing with those dreads knots like man that dude runs the streets dont mess with him,2023-06-02
also in one of the worlds there was rain while in other there wasnt,2023-06-03
i did too but i thought they did a good enough job of selling it that i questioned myself right up to the point where his mom doesnt know who spiderman is,2023-06-02
i knew that earth42 wasnt his dimension but just though it was an oversight actually and someone missed a detail so it still got me in the end lol,2023-06-02
same especially since they made a big point of showing the 42 on the spider kind of hard not to catch on,2023-06-02
honestly it made me second guess like i caught that too,2023-06-02
once they said the machine sends you home based on your dna i knew where they were going with that,2023-06-06

same here i don’t understand how people missed that i guess maybe they forgot his universes number,2023-06-11
yeah i saw it and i was like that aint right but i didnt put the previous part about the world without spiderman together,2023-06-03
yep the scene of miles taking to his mom and you could see there was no rain in the windows vs the parallel of gwen hiding outside in the rain by the windows ,2023-06-02
1610,2023-06-02
that got me confused actually i thought gwen was eavesdropping miles and rios conversation about the identity reveal and then suddenly gwen doesnt seem to know where miles is so it was just a scene transition or something,2023-06-02
exactly how much enjoyment are people getting out of catching details that give away a twist are they getting the same amount of enjoyment by patting themselves on the back as we get by being genuinely mindblown by a good reveal,2023-06-12
spot created spidermiles by bringing the spider that bit him over from earth42 during a test of the collider spidermiles created spot by blowing up the collider at the end of itsv,2023-06-02
it was explained during the movie and also from the first one you can infer that it was from another dimension as the spider glitchedpixeled out,2023-06-02
funny it was the opposite for me maybe it’s because i drove for 2h to watch this movie in imax which i don’t regret but when i saw “to be continued” i was like “are you  serious”,2023-06-05
i didn’t this was incredibly disappointing and left me and my gf with a sour taste after an otherwise good movie,2023-06-07
 that you can still be left wanting more if you know its part i going into it,2023-06-11
just as a counterpoint and this is a very small sample size i know i went with five friends who all had no clue this was a twoparter and the ending got them in the best way they actually felt it was way better that they didn’t know so at least some people are going to totally dig it i was just shocked none of them knew,2023-06-02
i was thoroughly loving the movie up until the cliffhanger ending i just watched it so its fresh but its still souring my experience,2023-06-02
"empire strike back ended on a cliffhanger over 40 years ago infinity war did it to great success fast x even just did it last month

this isnt some new concept that audiences cant handle",2023-06-02
i mean for 2 years people said labeling the movies as part 1 and part 2 was a  choice because the sort of negative reaction audiences have towards that sort of thing sooooooo,2023-06-02
idk i think it will age fine  more people will see the second part in 9 months,2023-06-02
"100 pretty  decision imo on their part

100 not the beancounters probably calculated less people would see if if they knew it was a planned two parter because theyd just wait for the second part to watch it",2023-06-02
idk its not uncommon for the middle of a trilogy to have a cliffhanger ahead of the 3rd matrix empire strikes back pirates of the caribbean 2 towers etc people might not like it which is super fair but it has been done and 5 years from now people will be marathoning all 3 anyways,2023-06-03
"so the audience needs to know the rough outline of the movie walking in 

this is the story they are telling its not to be a soft landing for the audience",2023-06-04
yeah here i am two months late to this and feeling a little  off,2023-08-26
"they mention the third movie in the synopsis the cast and crew have spoken about it every online site has mentioned it 

at this point anyone walking in and acting surprised is at fault themselves there’s only so much you can do to slow down for those who refuse to do the bare minimum to pay attention",2023-06-02
i think they mean how that title made it into the first trailer,2023-06-02
i’m a massive spiderman fan and i don’t feel like it was well advertised or heavily talked about at all i had no clue this was a part 1 until the end happened and i definitely would have hated it less if i was expecting it,2023-06-02
"yeah the first trailer which had the part one name was released in december 2021 though it was originally meant to release october 2022

that said the first movie had its first trailer released in december 2017 a full year before the movie premiered so it seems they were following the trend",2023-06-02
what was the scene at by the time u came back ,2023-06-02
nah the spot is the scientist in the first film where miles throw a bagel at,2023-06-02
you really missed a lot if you didnt catch how clear they made who spot was lol,2023-06-03
they literally explain the context for this line and give the spots whole backstory in the movie this would make no sense,2023-06-03
tell me you took several bathroom breaks during the film without telling me you took several bathroom breaks during the film,2023-06-04
that would be brilliant,2023-06-02
yeah but there isn’t really a way for miguel to know that i’d imagine there’s a narrow window of time for someone to be spiderman and it most likely took a little while for everyone to catch on after the collider explosion,2023-06-04
"i suspect that part of that is because harrys been done to death 

hes a very important part of the amazing duology

hes crucial to the raimi trilogy

hes a major character in spectacular and ultimate cartoons",2023-06-11
venom was confirmed to be a canon event so that may very well happen,2023-06-02
a universe where norman obsorn name his son peter,2023-06-02
its never mentioned he doesnt exist in every universe its just that he isnt important in all of them,2023-06-02
yeah there’s so much action in these movies that i forget sometimes that spiderman in any universe is supposed to be very intelligent hobie building his own watch is right on brand,2023-06-02
thank you for pointing this out i saw that the watch given to gwen looked stylized but just assumed that he tricked out the watch given to him by miguel and that didnt make sense since he tossed it before he left thinking back on it this is definitely what happened,2023-06-02
yeah its why all the portals and the watch itself has the parts of the artstyle that hobbie has,2023-06-03
"i didnt realize this until i read your comment right now

definitely gonna have to think more on my rewatch i watched it a lil bit inebriated",2023-06-02
the watch he left did have project bootleg written on the screen so i figured he mustve been making his own knockoff version,2023-06-04
maybe someone said this already but when gwen activates the watch the screen say program bootleg hahaha,2023-06-10
i thought that the dropped watch would become a plot point again eg that miles picks it up and uses it to travel back,2023-06-10
oooooh so thats how he did it,2023-06-11
i didnt pick up on either point thats cool,2023-06-21

doing praxis like a true leftist would,2023-06-03
this is… historically accurate,2023-06-03
reminds me of forgetting sarah marshall where jason segals character just ends up knowing russel brands character is just really cool,2023-06-04
 are they setting him us as a  or just a really close friend for a relief reveal to miles in the next movie,2023-06-02
its a good way to differentiate him from the others in all the confusion,2023-06-04
"lets look at the walls they look normal

cracked me up",2023-06-03
haha beyond,2023-06-02
"it wasnt a flop but into the spiderverse way underperformed relative to its brand recognition and quality i get that it was hard to market but just about everyone who saw it was levitating out of the theater the upside was the next couple of years of people finding it having their socks blown off and the animators on twitter describing their labors of love

my favorite was a drummer mentioning how much they loved the three second gwen stacy drumming scene and the animator chiming in with all the experience and love she brought to it

i predict many many of these once theyre all done with beyond",2023-06-05
ackshually they went across and beyond,2023-06-02
honestly the obvious amount of love and thought that went into it brings me to tears,2023-06-10
i also loved that when he was more calm he was less stylised,2023-06-02
"it felt like the intro to superman vs the elite turned into a being whichof course is also the gist of manchester black

but i also got that 80s zine vibe as well as things like 2000 ad and judge dredd warrior magazine and maybe a bit of early grant morrison",2023-06-02
absoltuely love him to bits,2023-06-02
"they already made it they just need to do extra production changes till last minute

also things will change on how audience respond w across the spiderverse",2023-06-02
here,2023-06-02
its one of the directors interviews i saw yesterday when they talk about how cool spiderpunk was,2023-06-02
"

we just thought “what if that was actually what the character looked like” so we developed all these crazy technical tools they start with this traditional animation pass and then the tools that we developed can adapt all the different parts of him to all these different custom looks we created that are based on classic punk rock posters and we can assign all these body parts very distinct emotional beats wherever we wanted them to appear like sudden visual changes i think that process probably took two or three years to develop and we really only came together like right at the end",2023-06-03
"

 i think that process probably took two or three years to develop and we really only came together like right at the end",2023-06-02
gwen’s a clothes stealer she stole mile’s sweater at the end too lol,2023-06-02
"hey genki is sharing jordans too and miles isnt in a relationship with him

lets not forget that when the shoes on the other foot s",2023-06-03
yeah she was definitely wellchucked,2023-06-02
right but miles doesn’t know that when hobie’s name first comes up,2023-06-03
yeah i was worried by the rumours about the possible love triangle with him but nah my homie did the best helping both,2023-06-04
yeah i don’t think spiderpunk cares enough about anything to be in a romantic relationship but its certainly suspicious when we first meet him,2023-06-03
really hoping that he is playing big bro and helping her out,2023-06-03
yeah seeing everything else about hobie he seems like the type of guy who would be uncomfortable with his and gwen’s age gap for a romantic relationship,2023-06-09
i think the real point was gwen was unable to tell miles she couldn’t go home because her dad found out she’s been concealing things from miles on a personal and professional level being that his dad is destined to die,2023-06-07
children are the original anarchists,2023-06-02

he’s straight up the only one along with the girl in the lab that were actually on miles’s side meanwhile you got gwen saying hey let your dad die,2023-06-15

even got gwen a multiverse watch dude was planting a rebellion from the beginning,2023-06-03
his real intention ever since gwen roped him into the society was to infiltrate and undermine it,2023-06-03
dont enlist til you know what war youre fighting is such good advice,2023-06-08
when the hypocrisy shows itself he immediately quits and bounces back to his dimension love it,2023-06-03

they still called out some of the problems with the punk thing but respectfully,2023-06-11

he did say he was only there to look out for gwen  dude wanted nothing to do with miguels ,2023-06-02
when they were all slamming on his cage i got so much agent of chaos from him with how he reminds miles about the hands he just wants to watch it all burn down,2023-06-02

hahaha so true lets just say buddy antiheroes,2023-06-04
the worse part as an audience member it was getting harder to hate hobie because he was too dope,2023-06-02
i started feeling like a teenager again its truly the worst when your crush meets a much cooler more experienced dude,2023-06-07
eh hes only 19,2023-06-16
and also because he’s not blind,2023-06-05
just want to interject since the movie finally came out where i live and say that prowler miles is probably a mislead miles’s father dying was probably the catalyst for aaron to get his  together and work with miles on some vigilanteantihero justicerevenge instead of just continuing as a criminal,2023-06-21
"telling miles that he is what he is no mater what hes told

you know thinking about it now hobie was definitely told about miles being an anomaly threatening the stability of the multiverse and his punk side was already like ah yeah  the system",2023-06-04
"these movies have captured so beautifully the struggle for us teens of trying to both be with our friends and help them and care for them while being told constantly how we should act by adults finding the inbetween balance of loving both sides while dealing with all your other stuff and saving the multiverse from an enraged cow is incredibly difficult to write and im so glad they found the balance truly pushing teen writing and romance and the teen superhero genre as a whole to new levels

i just thought of something is miguel using alchemax tech it does fit with his dimension hopping and his spider…pods cocoons have the same vulnerability to the barrier at the mumbattan alchemax",2023-06-06
as long as none of the movie writers wrote for regular spiderman comics miles life with gwen will be long happy and allowed to move on,2023-06-10
shacking up with literal anarchy has to be the singlemost punk move in any universe,2023-06-03
wow do you know what comicbook thats in i wanna read up on this guy he seems so cool lol,2023-06-05
there is no confirmation hes  its just fan theories i see him much more as a mentor than a lover definitely,2023-07-03
the miles scene was super coded as a coming out scene and the one with gwen and her dad had some hella trans coding going on cant wait to see people get in a huff about that one,2023-06-07
maybe the big reveal will be that gwen is crashing at his place because hes  and theyre just good friends lol,2023-06-03
the mix is still the same when i last saw it but cinemas need to play it loud so it works i actually went in and asked if theyd heard about the audio issues etc and they said sony sent them a memo to play it loud in bigger screens and since then its been fine for my local,2023-06-24
im from the uk and it was also really quiet especially in the opening gwen monologue must be a movie thing,2023-06-02
i felt the same thing as well,2023-06-02
paris france as opposed to paris tex…ohh,2023-06-02
,2023-06-05
okc here,2023-06-03
you know what now that you mention spider punk being quiet i do recall noticing him being a bit low and missing some of what he said other than that i recall one line where theyre fighting on the outside of the train heading upwards and miguel ohara said something near the climax of that scene that i couldnt quite make out other than that nothing stuck out as being accidentally unintelligible,2023-06-02
dont blame you boss gwens a baddie,2023-07-04
spidermarx is the bestworst thing ive seen all week,2023-06-03
marvel legends spiderverse spider punk he’s on hasbro pulse ,2023-06-04
they decided to define him with specific colors so they could sell it he’d be disgusted,2023-06-11
reducing a character with so much aesthetic and charisma down into a funko pop has gotta be illegal,2023-06-09
must consooom,2023-06-20
she was the voice for mj in into the spiderverse but it looks like she was recasted for this one melissa sturm voices mj in across the spiderverse,2023-06-03
peter b is bulletproof thanks to mayday i honestly will not be surprised if part 3 ends without any major spider deaths spiderverse just isn’t that type of story,2023-06-04
if i remember correctly he also said that he didnt like consistency lol,2023-06-10
  same as said in this comment wasnt too sure what exactly frame you had in mind so i grabbed a few hopefully one of them is to your liking let me know if not and i can try again,2023-08-22
 here i took quite a few frames incase you liked any in particular,2023-08-22
the spider that got zapped across dimensions was making its way to bite its miles so i dont think the issue is miles morales can not be spiderman so much as this specific miles morales was not supposed to be spiderman,2023-06-20
yeah but then again so are most spiderman adaptations on some level its why so many spidermen adaptations are set while hes in high school in the og comics he was there like 30 issues which back then wasnt long,2023-06-05
yeah on the bluray release  it rearranges scenes and adds in the storyboards and animatics for stuff that didnt make the cut  originally genke was supposed to find out about miles powers early on and try to help him out by using a spiderman movie as a reference  i found a few of them here and theres a summary of the changes here,2023-06-15
yeah he was replaced in the subsequent season probably too expensive,2023-06-03
very loosely,2023-06-02
"its mostly been a fun little bit of trivia i pull out sometimes

honestly its just hitting me now how crazy it is that theres this lore surrounding miles and i can just stumble on people talking about it",2023-06-02
"it says venomint   
i didnt realize venom sold out to promote gum flavours",2023-06-02
definitely so fast i missed it there’s a million things happening in frame in that movie,2023-06-03
i’m also people,2023-06-02
sorry i wasn’t clear  i thought twins could be explain why she might have a prominent baby bump if she’s early in her pregnancy at the start of the film,2023-06-02
he uses heavy slang so tough to understand him at baseline let alone w quiet dialogue,2023-06-03
i watched it in a screen where audio is usually  and was still not perfect for this movie i could still hear every word in the movie i think people are getting too used to reading words as they hear stuff online that theyve started using it as a crutch wild theory i know,2023-06-03
"they teased with some spanish and i wish they leaned in more its a decent way of adding character flavor and if youre bilingual then you get the extra details

really we have subtitles so no one is boxxed out if they watch it other than the theater reward us for speaking two languages i say",2023-06-03
the spanish didnt have subtitles in america either i think they didnt add it on purpose,2023-06-04
did your theatre have subtitles surprisingly we did not have subtitles in our theatre here in surat,2023-06-02
"i like to think there are 2 routes the 42 universe can take either

peter gets bit has his own uncle ben moment becomes spiderman saves miles dad from whatever kills him and so miles grows up to be a normal school kid or 

miles gets bit no peter to save his dad so jeff dies and becomes miles uncle ben moment miles becomes spiderman

either way the universe forces a spiderman but because the spider is transported out of the 42 universe neither happen allowing miles to become prowler",2023-06-02
considering the spider is pulled from the universe right as its on top of a likely braided miles morales desk he probably was supposed to be the one who got bit if its true though morales look semi grown up already in the flashback if he was supposed to be a good guy what changed so much that made him into how he is now did his father dying impact him that much the city looked like it was going to  too i imagine things were bad for a while without any other spiderman around,2023-06-07
if a captain close to spiderman dying is a canon event,2023-06-02
my theory is were going to find out that jeff died in 42 because miguel was trying to fix the canon event,2023-06-08
so his dad is going to have a realization arch in the next movie,2023-06-02
yeah but he doesnt seem to miss his father he doesnt want to save him my theory is that he killed his father and doesnt want him to come back,2023-06-23
perhaps instead of miles dad finding miles standing over uncle aaron it would have been miles finding his worlds peter standing over uncle aaron which results in miles becoming prowler in aarons place,2023-06-04
they seem to be wrong the avoidance of canon events will perhaps wipe out the universe in question but its not guaranteed miguel and the spider society use a flawed simulation system to try and predict potential disruptions that could cause the elimination of that universe i think i get both sides honestly miles understandably has severe qualms over condemning a life because you think that dimension will be taken out but miguel has the weight of the multiverse on his shoulders and cant allow himself to risk billions if not trillions of lives to save a single one,2023-06-02
"we dont know but i think we know aaron is dropping off a stack of cash jeff was talking in his speech about how aaron and he were running a business

aaron we saw from mcu was a criminal miles in this one was a stone cold antagonist setting up for villain its too strong a thematic parallel to have him running as evil miles and likely on or leading the sinister 6 cartel mentioned in the background reel for jjj

id place a pretty large wager hes anti miles because jeff died not aaron",2023-06-05
aint no way this miles is not a criminal the colors the lighting the music the prowler theme song you gotta read the movie cues,2023-06-26
its the wallet that say bad motherspider on it,2023-06-05
part of the reason dune cut part one out of the marketing was because part two was not green lit until about a week after the actual film released,2023-06-03
" tends to make casual audiences stay home

i think that already happened in my area there were 10 people  me watching it 356 seats",2023-06-03
mi dead reckoning is going full steam with the part 1 name though,2023-06-04
it would also make sense if they keep the part one name around that may stop people from going to the movie in the theater since they wouldnt get the full story,2023-06-02
oh cool,2023-06-02
hopefully it isnt affected by the writers strike,2023-06-05
honestly don’t understand how this isn’t getting memed on like the sopranos ending,2023-06-09
people standards for movies dropped the past 10 years or so i’m sure even all the people involved for all their work into this pretty film if they respect filmmaking in any way know this was a bad way to end it,2023-06-09
both which is worse than the two separately,2023-06-04
i mean they were there at the end it would be weird if they just silently leave again at the start of part 3,2023-06-05
to be fair its based off of 12 reviews so far elemental is likely to get hundreds so this might not necessarily be a good indicator one way or the other,2023-06-02
trailer felt boring and formulaic maybe theyre going to pull a rabbit out of a hat but based on the trailer im not planning on watching it,2023-06-04
"totally but

1 across the spiderverse doesnt have an ending
2 this is likely definitely it for miyazaki the greatest living animator",2023-06-02
"a full length wallace and gromit stop motion iswas a very impressive technical feat

plus a lot of people myself included think the story of howls moving castle is a mess and sort of all over the place 

anime is way overhyped on reddit compared to how the average person feels about it

is wallace and gromit a masterpiece no was it better than howls i would say no what it does have is legacy and it was an impressive well made movie of a beloved franchise

its not some checkmate gotcha tbh",2023-06-02
because everything wallace and gromit is genius,2023-06-18
the oscar will be for part 3 amd this is probs hayaos last movie,2023-06-04
excellent point but i think miyazaki’s reverence in our culture has grown significantly because spirited away was the entry point for many into his work the academy as a body is also far more international than it was in 20012,2023-06-05
you know the oscars they don’t even  look at anime lol if your name didn’t even get a nomination tough lick for suzume,2023-06-02
"theres also wish the big movie disney has really been pushing as their this is our 100th anniversary movie

should it beat spiderverse highly unlikely but i can see the academy going that way for a new disney princess film",2023-06-07
i loved the last wish but i feel like we must have watched different movies this weekend if you think it even comes close to atsv,2023-06-04
yep the only animated movie that can give spiderverse a run for its money is  in boots 2 that was also an excellent film with the same animation style,2023-06-04
yah dude the oscar’s are   until the movie i wanna win wins,2023-06-02
yup because the academy goes “oooo pixar” and just doesn’t even comprehend how much time and effort goes into a stop motion movie but i guess pinnochio changed that so yay,2023-06-02
do you feel like movies like this are sometimes hard to rewatch like its hard to recreate that i am on a ride feeling the second time around i wasnt even high and this movie took me to places i never been absolutely loved it,2023-06-03
obtainable mysterious pocket snobbish clumsy workable busy exultant smoggy sort  this message was mass deletededited with redactdev ,2023-06-22
whos frowning on those,2023-06-02
agree loved jw4 but spiderverse is on another level my gawd,2023-06-03
why was it awful,2023-06-17
"oh wow easy year for spiderman then 

 in boots not winning is an actual travesty though",2023-06-02
its only flaw is that it’s a part 1 i expect the second one to get recognition,2023-06-02
"let’s be real here i loved the movie but how many of us have even had 24 hours to process it yet  most of the best picture contenders have not even screened yet much less been released to the public

furthermore anticipating that it has a chance as good or great as it is is just setting yourself up for disappointment even if it deserves it i think the first one is an all timer and it wasn’t nominated",2023-06-02
it takes a miracle for a superhero movie an animated movie or a sequel to be nominated for best picture but all 3 at once no way in  dont get me wrong i think the movie was fantastic and deserves all the praise in the world but thats just not how the academy awards work,2023-06-02
the year’s not even halfway over yet why should this be a lock for a best picture nom lol,2023-06-02
the bar is not very high so far we still got oppenheimer scorsese film and dune left to go to name a few it was a great film definitely best animated film but id bet my life savings it doesnt even sniff a best picture nomination ,2023-06-03
i disagree i liked it a lot but as a movie the first one is better this one lacks resolutions on the conflicts it presents its going to be a great 3rd movie but this one sacrifices its final arc resolution so the next movie can be amazing,2023-06-03
it might be a fun spiderman experience but i wouldn’t call it a good movie it’s way too bloated and it isn’t even over,2023-06-07
idk the plot didnt make complete sense  i mean the canon stuff and choices like a captain must die seemed odd,2023-06-02
yeah it came to the us in 2023 but for awards its a 2022 movie,2023-06-02
i only saw those two as well but  if you blink during this film you miss about 30 little details every frame was packed loved it but i felt a bit overwhelmed by the whole thing,2023-06-06
bruhhh,2023-06-06
very interesting perspective i appreciate the response i agree knowing that it was a two parter kinda left me waiting for the cliffhanger and it didn’t hit quite as hard as i think it was supposed to and i also agree that infinity war definitely left me with that feeling too despite knowing there was going to be two parts i guess i think the ending to infinity war was almost too shocking for me to comprehend at first which is why it hit so much harder but at the same time i revisit infinity war more often than i do endgame because much like i revisit empire more than i do jedi bc i think those movies really shine and stand on their own not saying atsv can’t stand on its own bc it’s beautiful and the story is really good but i think to get the full experience it’s a movie that will ultimately have to be a double feature upon each rewatch it feels like it’s leading to one big movie that just had to be cut in half,2023-06-04
see i did not know this was a 2 parter i had the same reaction lol threw my hands up flabbergasted like how could they do that,2023-06-09
thats him his spidey even has some braids and a bandana,2023-06-02
metro’s ig confirmed it so dope gives his latest album “heroes and villains” more meaning,2023-06-02
spot on ,2023-06-03
"i just noticed the dark pun there considering gwen stacy’s iconic fate

she falls for him alright hard

don’t know how i missed that during the movie",2023-06-04
spider gwen does move to peter parkers universe and attend the college he teaches at,2023-06-03
whoa i just got goosebumps,2023-06-03
please spiderverse,2023-06-11
if only marvel had some way of making actors look younger than they are,2023-08-18
tony was a huuuuuge canon event more impactful than most hes special,2023-06-03
im not convinced about the universe ending if a cannon event is interrupted i think miguels case is special because he broke the rules and tried to change a cannon event in a universe that wasnt his own i dont think miles saving his dad is going to effect nearly as much as they think it will,2023-06-07
yeah but miles is different because he is an anomaly so each step he takes disrupts the multiverse even more as evidenced on the effects on mumbattan after peter saves that captain,2023-06-05
i mean mcu spiderman still lost his uncle ben they just chose not to show it peter hints at his death in his first scene with tony in civil war,2023-06-04
maybe it was just the fact that miguel tried to stay in a dimension he didn’t belong to,2023-06-05
" but that universe is fine

well relatively speaking lol",2023-06-07
i feel like norman and ottos death are definitely canon events to tobys spidey tbh,2023-06-02
almost all as in pretty much every spidey in this film chased miles not the entire multiverse,2023-06-02
pavitr prabhakar canon event was caused by a multiversal intervention  but also disrupted by a multiversal intervention,2023-06-02
holland’s canon event either has to be the death of stark or the death of aunt may and especially probably aunt may considering she said “the line”,2023-08-14
we have no idea if he even had an uncle ben may could have raised him alone after his parents died,2023-06-04
what if miguel murdered them all right after lol,2023-06-03
as i understand it the canon events are the things that happen to every spider uncle ben and captain stacys deaths or their equivalents for nonpeter spideys are canon events because they always happen but the villains fates are not multiversal constants so peter peter and peter saving norman otto and max from death and curing flint and dr connors shouldnt cause any issue,2023-06-03
definitely got last of us vibes from this,2023-06-05
i think uncle ben is still the uncle ben and mays the gwen stacy tony could be the captain event,2023-06-04
tom holland’s peter has lost by far the most his parents ben tony may his identity i’m confused about what would be his canon events since most of his loss is because of of multiversal events and not because of “fate” so to speak,2023-06-03
i hope they retcon it that earth 838 assigned the number for the main mcu world incorrectly,2023-06-03
consistency has nothing to do with it the earth199999 that miguel mentions is not the same as the earth616 of the actual mcu movies and shows earth199999 is just where the events of the mcu movies and shows happen in the spiderverse franchise but they arent the actual mcu events that we have seen,2023-06-05
"i wouldnt say disney had nothing to do with the film they must have overseen everything and chimed in here and there since there are so many explicit connections to the mcu i was halfexpecting a liveaction tom holland to pop up somewhere the most overarching connection i can think of is the illustration of the multiverse being the exact same one used in loki and antman and the wasp quantumania

edit skipped a letter",2023-06-05
"in the watch that hobie gives her peter bs universe now reads earth616b

however the spidercide is said to be from the normal earth616",2023-06-05
wait what ive seen that movie so many times and never noticed that,2023-06-07
he also voiced miles morales in the ultimate spider man show,2023-06-14
what are the current worst problems,2023-06-02
 thank you i needed this in my life,2023-06-05
but mcu timeline in itself is an anomaly there’s no way to know what the original timeline is supposed to look like because of thanos’ use of the stones to  everyone and then tony’s use of the stones again to bring everyone back then we have loki who broke the timeline and wanda who interfered as well there’s a million ways to explain mile’s existence in the mcu verse,2023-06-03
we don’t really know if all the spiderpeople do that it can just be a result of how far they are from their original universe and possibly even the specific person the bands may just be a precaution since it happens often enough,2023-06-03
it didnt do much for me when gwen said her dad was one of the good ones i laughed hard to suspend disbelief for acab when her dad was gonna arrest her in the intro too,2023-06-04
i meant climax more in like a big final action fight upon first viewing you have absolutely no idea the chase scene is going to be the last set piece,2023-06-02
i suppose  i would’ve liked more insight into how he realized he needed to give up the badge but i can also fill this gap in my head myself,2023-06-12
miles is yet to be proven right and he is fine with killing the whole world to save one person terrible spiderman,2023-06-03
yeah its just that doesnt feel like a climax at first,2023-06-02
it should’ve ended there then i would’ve loved seeing more of miles as the friendly neighborhood spiderman the first film was about him becoming spiderman but this film didn’t really let us enjoy him being spiderman before being thrown out into all the multiverse shenanigans i doubt the third film will focus much on this either more of the hq would’ve been cool too but i imagine they’re going back there eventually but yeah this film would’ve worked better had it been cut shorter or made longer instead of ending right before the big fight,2023-06-03
hence why it’s gwen’s movie “as well” stories can have two main characters,2023-06-02
appreciate the thought out response learning about different storytelling concepts is fun tv tropes is something i spend a lot of time on lol,2023-06-16
too bad they’re missing out on some good movies,2023-09-29
thank ,2023-06-21
explain to me how this movie isnt a movie,2023-06-02
"it was sarcasm i was joking as that was jonathan majors its clearly not and clearly not disney film

the capitalized letters were suppose to emphasize it it in a sarcastic way but i guess that didnt come across as intended",2023-06-16
i had subs but they were in spanish,2023-06-09
"it blew my mind when they revealed spider hq was just a building up until that point i assumed it was the only thing that existed in that dimension like some kind of hub world  

it raises a lot of questions about what things are like in that universe",2023-06-03
i think its supposed to reflect the true nature of the spidey organization on the surface its an idyllic depiction of good and order but when you almost literally dig deeper you find pain and suffering miles literally crashes through the cogs of the machinery underneath the city and as the chase continues even the shiny facade of the city becomes damaged,2023-06-07
i was gonna say lotsohuggin bear in toy story 3 but your example is better,2023-06-05
"a couple of things

 hes using abilities spider arms idr that arent in the first game
 the minimap interface is slightly different
 the credits specify that its the new game

somebody on reddit here figured out that it was the first footage publicly released of the new game when the trailer came out",2023-06-06
hopefully he goes by andy,2023-06-04
that’s what it is in the comics i think originally it was a high end day of the dead costume that he uses because of the material,2023-06-03
i know he can use it just that he barely does and it also because if he did he  mostly lol,2023-06-03
i think his comic origin involved being framed for substance abuse and him trying to clear his bloodstream of it led to the accident that gave him his powers so maybe they’re doing a new spin on it definitely wouldn’t be ccaapproved though ,2023-06-04
"oh  youre right about the watch i thought that vfx on his suit looked weird

im calling it hes not spiderman he has to keep topping himself up to get his powers whatever they are and 2099 miguel died but since the 2nd time around he didnt try to insert himself into his life it didnt  the canon of 2099break ",2023-06-02
i’m sure he was glitching because without the watch you can’t stay in a universe that isn’t yours for long and i believe it was already explained he left his universe,2023-06-03
i thought his suit glitched because its holographic he didnt glitch like everyone else,2023-06-07
yeah and the miguel in the post credit of the first film wasnt jacked had a more accurate suit and joked before watching across i thought it was a redesign but after all the 42universespider callbacks i think those characters are not the same like this one died and miguel from this film took his place,2023-06-08
that is assuming what is he says about “canon” is true the only evidence for that in the movie is miguel’s statements of such,2023-06-18
calling it right now that  crack a lame joke too,2023-06-14
"i know that spiderman 2099 is a real thing dont be an  im saying miguel in atsv might not even be a true spiderman maybe he even took the place of the true spiderman 2099 who died just like the version of himself he tried and failed to replace

he starts subtly glitching out when miles shocks him on the train also shocking his watch hes not native to that universe",2023-06-04
and in the comics miles is not an anomaly they arent direct adaption they can make it so miguel is not a spiderman and it could be cool if it turns out his morlun,2023-06-04
reddit nerd power,2023-07-03
i though he was puerto rican like miles,2023-06-04
"okay i have a non fully thought out full on fan theory that is over the top too expensive and not really feasible 

 all of this hinges on the currentupcoming live action movie characters venom morbius kraven julia carpenter and madam web 

 gwen and gang help free miles from miles42

 madam web steps in and tells miguel to stop trying to stop miles

 madam web then goes on to explain how shes been working in a way like og karn master weaver to control the story of spiderman so that the story stays in tact and spot is threatening that web

 kraven morbius spot miles42 venom king pin maybe and other venoms maybe form a new inheritorssinister 6 along with their variants to start killing spidermen across the multiverse

 miles peter b spidertoby spiderandrew spidertom spidersydney sweeny julia carpenter from madam web gwen miguel hobie and all variants fight across the multiverse back 

 villains and heros travel between different words fighting each other some worlds have mini cameos some have longer scenes blah blah blah maybe we even see hobie meet cartoon hobart brown as prowler would be cool if spot could turn ppl into alternate versions of themselves

 eventually maybe morbius on some morlun energy venom or miles42 betray spot joining spiderman and they beat him somehow

this may seem like an insane story or something too ambitious buthavent the first two already been too ambitious and they wouldnt need to do much live action shooting but instead a lot of voice acting",2023-06-05
"all of my friends parents insisted on me calling them by their first names

its perfectly fine if they give you permission its just when you are meeting them its best to have a little formality like ive worked in ems and used sirmaam during the interview but after hiring it was ok to use the first name even with patients unless they also give permission",2023-06-07
"i did notice the radio spoke about the sinister 6 i wonder if these guys are in the sinister 6 or are like vigilantes who fight the sinister 6 

part of me wondered if the sequel would have miles help aaron and other miles to help earth 42 im not sure though",2023-06-07
for sure ,2023-06-03
wow thats insanely gross,2023-06-03
yeah they’res really only 3 major points to this film miles in new york chilling forced to leave territory turning point your uncle will die and we will incapacitate you escape next is new grounds “the self” where  be evolving i don’t see how that’s fast paced sure they’res a lot of information but fast paced no,2023-06-05
imax here as well was a tad chaotic but overall i didn’t feel lost more so “i got to watch this again so i can appreciate it more”,2023-06-02
i have to ask how did this movie get made in imax isnt imax a type of actual camera for live action movies,2023-06-02
is it normal that movies in imax dont use the full frame i watched it on a 1911 imax and there were black bars on the top and bottom is that the same in 1431 imax,2023-06-02
theres a disabled spiderwoman who makes that same exact joke in the movie,2023-06-04
i enjoy mom for the raiminess qualities but the parts he directed could not salvage the rest of the movie,2023-06-03
indeed — happy to help affirm,2023-06-07
im sort of surprised they were so blatant about it actually,2023-06-09
hes an emotional teenager who knows nothing about reality shaping magic its similar to a business major manager asking it to do something spiderman does not have the magical technical savvy to know what hes asking,2023-06-05
i think moreso gwens dad stepping down is evidence that miguel isnt right at least not totally,2023-06-02
i think there is a certain amount of modifications the canon can have and not all the canon events are canon for everyone so why cant it diverge more,2023-06-02
it probably doesnt have that because the film was originally written as one piece and then split into two when they realized it was way too long,2023-06-03
an emotional moment should hit right otherwise youre just talking to the audience someone yelling out  and people laughing is because it isnt landing its long and drawn out for a nonmoment i think we agree the idea of the moment is great and i like the idea of miles struggling to tell his parents that hes spiderman but him vocalizing it repeatedly is what makes it lazy storytelling miles and his dad have the exact same subplot in the first movie and it isnt a direct conversation but shown in the way they interact with each other,2023-06-03
i think the scene with his mom went on too long and didnt do enough but i also completely agree with you i really feel like i understand who miles is as a character now and i love him even more than i already did even if there were imperfect moments it was worth it in the end,2023-06-06
if memory serves he wasnt cowering at all he was taped to a chair but sure,2023-06-06
100  and i appreciate you saying that it is a little wild that spiderverse has been so beloved but im happy the franchise is finally getting its flowers i agree with you that it has some fun moments and the art style is visually stunning im just such a fan of the first movie and couldnt shake the feeling that spiderverse had potential for so much more,2023-06-05
thats totally fine and a stylistic choice like marvel movies do that a lot action and then lots and lots of dialogue my example was uncle aaron and miless relationship in the first movie and how it was shown how strong it was they hang out they talk about girls it sets up a joke later the move on gwen they spray paint it leads to meeting peter parker and the collider its so well done and just a tight story there is never a moment where they say how much they mean to one another  its shown,2023-06-02
youve picked horrible choices two towers for example brings about a lot of narrative closure they defeat one of the two main villains of the trilogy itd be like if they defeated spot in this movie and then next movie was focusing on miguel instead they leave 99 of things unresolved which is narratively unfulfilling,2023-06-04
spiderbyte knows where he is shes the one who didnt reboot the system when it was sending him to earth 42,2023-06-06
yeah that’s how it should be,2023-06-18
this proves you fundamentally do not understand spiderman and it feels just like the arguments made against miles since his creation,2023-06-03
nah i rewatched this one 3 times and i do think this movie has more fan service than the first however after the rewatches i like it more than the first tbh i think its movie of the year for me so far,2023-08-09
my b,2023-06-02
so miles earth didnt have a spider,2023-06-03
yeah i’d like to watch it again too in order to catch more the theatre i watched it in was definitely noticeable throughout and seemed even too extreme just to be mixing like it was almost the wrong version uploaded that bad,2023-06-05
"i understand but i meant gwen’s initial conflict with her father was the reason she joined miguel and is resolved by the end which is what led to her swapping sides for miles his capture is basically the “han frozen in carbonite” moment to kick off the third film and bring them back together 

and i agree best comic book movie ever",2023-06-05
that makes sense it just seems odd that a detail like his shirt color wouldn’t be kept intact for continuity,2023-06-11

when did i even claim that miles wasn’t true to himself are you bad at reading comprehension",2023-06-06
ah,2023-06-07
felt like a cliff hanger to a tv show season finale,2023-06-03
agreed so much this,2023-06-03
that is what happened,2023-06-05
yes it was american spanish and so the actual spanish that they spoke wasnt made up and the way they treated it was extremely accurate to growing up second or third generation hispanic in america sorry that seems like some lin manuel shtick to you,2023-06-04
"yeah ive been thinking about the film a fair bit  i left it disappointed in the cliffhanger and had to remind myself of the good parts

i will say that the animation and creativity on display is absolutely stellar and its easy to forget that there is not a dull moment visually the fight scenes are extremely creative in both choreography and how theyre shotdirected and even little moments like gwen and miles talking while hanging off the building is interesting to watch",2023-06-04
its a jessica drew film with gwen as a colead,2023-06-06
"that’s true but bookends don’t change the overarching story being that of miles and his story is widely left without any resolution and the movie doesn’t pace itself well at all to brace for that ending 

the saga starts with miles and while we jump into gwen’s temporarily in this film we are still observing and given far more priority to miles story who is also the forefront of all promotional material

i’ve spoken with 2 others who had similar experiences at their screenings fully engaged audience and mood nosediving the moment the credits land followed by 15 mins of confused people watching credits and googling things on their phones

all that said i still think once the final part comes out it’ll likely be a masterpiece as a cohesive trilogy

i just think this is a terrible precedent to set of not explicitly noting the broken up parts while also building up the main story to a climax with no resolve to it so you can break the movie into two parts that can’t stand on their own at all


it also felt a bit tone deaf to not include a bonus scene as well as have the very villain centric credit sequence for a very quirky character who just obtained  powers in an age where meta humour and marvel are two peas in a pod

everyone in my theatre was shouting “it’s not over the bad guy is making it end because he’s  now it’s a fake out” 

nope just an unexpectedly poorly timed ended for an otherwise flawless movie imo",2023-06-12
india we have intermissions for every movie,2023-06-03
maybe hes talking about the 1 year intermission between across and beyond,2023-06-03
exactly it then became a matter of trying to figure what was different about this universe at first i honestly believed jefferson was a bad person possibly abusive from the way rio reacted to miles talking about before the dimension reveal and then excluded him from her i got you and me to take care of line and when aaron showed up i thought it was maybe a case of she married aaron instead of jefferson it didnt matter that i knew he was in the wrong dimension there was still plenty of other stuff to try and figure out,2023-06-02
yeah when talking to friends who also saw it they said they either didnt notice until the intended reveal or if they did notice the numbers they didnt remember what miles home dimension was enough to connect the dots that 42 wasnt the right one for me knowing that he was in the wrong universe the whole time made me giddy wondering when and how they were going to reveal it,2023-06-03
yes they do the first time we see his universe in this film they number it its some 4 digit number 1016 or something like that,2023-06-12

"because miguels belief that fate is predestined is flawed miles represents the idea that fate is decided by actions not destiny miguels algorithm is a narrow cherrypicked model of universes that excludes all scenarios that play out differently something he labels as anomalies 

as others have said it is surprising that more spidermen arent on miles side i expect by the end of the final film many of them will be he isnt an egotistical kid for crossing fate hes just a human trying to do whats right",2023-06-04
"but miguels model of the world doesnt reflect all the countless universes where spiderman does save his captain

x200b

probably bc those are universes where there is no canon event for the captains death 

neither miguel nor the movie says that the canon events are all clones of each other or the exact same thing there are obviously deviations some of those deviations are going to be quite significant maybe even significant enough to not involve characters andor events we are familiar withpossibly even completely unrecognizable 

keep in mind that our real life universe yes usyou and me are actually canonically in marvel and from the direction of the recent mcu along with this movie and sony its become obvious that what i just said is actually canon too and we dont even have a spiderman lol nor canon events 

so yes some universes just simply dont have the captains death as a canon event 

i mean even in the movie we see that captain singh is a person completely unrelated to spiderman and gwens canon event was neither her dad nor uncle ben but rather her peter parker 

its very easy to imagine that theres even greater differences that completely exclude the captain altogether",2023-06-08
" everyone here keeps downplaying the interference and disruption of the canon events

in their defense miguel is almost certainly wrong 

otherwise one of either earth 42 or earth 1610 would need to be destroyed

earth 42 because it never got its spiderman once the spot transported the spider to our miles world or earth 1610 when miles interrupts the canon by getting his universes rightful spiderman killed

i think what the movie is leading towards is them realizing miguel is wrong maybe even malicious gwen realizes once her dad steps down as captain and that not interrupting the canon and thats how she ends up recruiting the rest of them to join her",2023-06-08
ahh thanks,2023-06-11
well how bout that,2023-06-15
"theres no resolution to the reaction but hes already decided to tell them and to try and save his father that turmoil is resolved hes no longer unsure about either 

i believe that he resolved that mentally very quickly after hearing about the possibility  not cocurrent with the films runtime running out  no turmoil to resolve except in your own head because of a need to defend a mediocre film",2023-06-05
endgame was mostly spectacle this film invests far more heavily than endgame did in grounded character relationships i didn’t love it because of all the multiverse flash i loved it because of what they did with gwen and her family miles and his family and gwen and miles together,2023-06-05
"who was the person who transported the spider to miles surely if were going by cause and effect it would be spot who actually causes the problems in the multiverse 

wrongbadly 

spot was the created by miles he was the guy who got donutted more or less in the last movie 

who in turn was created by the snowballed effects of a canon event which just proves me right even more that when you disrupt canon events the law of unintended consequences starts kicking in and snowballs into really bad things 

for example that a villain is created from a perfectly happy and law abiding citizen who had not a shred of evil fiber nor negativity in him that is so dangerous that it threaten the entire infinite multiverse now 

canon events that do not go the way they are supposed to end up having very bad consequences in the long run even by your own admission miles42 becomes a supervillain instead of a superherothats actually even worse than if he had just never became anything but an ordinary civilian lol 

and right now miles is going to disrupt another canon event all so he can save a single  life despite the fact that he sees right before him that earth42s ny is a hellscape that the likes of cartel gore videos on rnsfl cant even match up 

what a bad trade 1 life for the lives of countless others

only a  would make such a trade lol",2023-06-08
"they dont and you havent figured that out good job clap clap clap

x200b

",2023-06-09
"letting the multiverse die is def not okay and i dont see how it being okay can be extrapolated from me saying letting infinite people die is not okay

probably bc you dont understand the concept of infinity that you tried to cleverly rattle off of in your last comment 

you obviously think that you caught miguel in some embarrassing logical fallacy wherein he must admit that his mission goal is essentially killing an infinite amount of people however if thats the case and hes already infinitely massacring people then youve essentially reached the end sotospeak and it means that you cant  any more people therefore whether infinite amounts of people are dying via miguels logic or whether they are dying bc all of the infinite multiverses suddenly die makes no difference since infinite  infinite 

see its a rather uncomfortable and mindexploding concept isnt it 

i told you that you didnt want to go down this road",2023-06-08
"even if they had expanded and fleshed out pavitrs story i probably would not be able to relate to him pavitr is an indian born indian and i am an american of indian parents living in a white society with other minorities 

a person like pavitr doesn’t understand what it’s like to try to get your parents to accept your white girlfriend like miles and me the cultural jokes only really resonates with the experience of indians living in india and can be easily understood on a surface level by indians born and raised in america",2023-06-02
i get what you’re sayin but idk if i fully agree like yes he’s an american but that doesn’t take away his brownness as his ethnic background it’d be like saying “oh you’re not black you’re american” or “u ain’t a jew you’re british” or something idk it gets complex but hope my perspective makes some sense like you won’t stop facing racism against ur skin color just because you’re from somewhere else,2023-06-06
miles is the main lead without his arc ending there is no ending gwen is a side arc,2023-06-08
"alright sherlock calm down with your assumptions
if you reread the entire comment you can see it is in regards to the ending specifically not the movie as a whole 

thats what my 7 year old nephew who this movie is marketed towards was disappointed about he wanted to see him fight the spot or any sort of climax not wait a year for the ending

even if i hated the movie though what exactly is the point of commenting to me you can like it all you want",2023-06-02
maybe but in fairness the other gwens werent also spiderpeople so,2023-06-03
life saver appreciate it bro,2023-06-04
then i would put up into question if it is even possible task to do yeah he could try to change the canon event but he would have to change it in a large majority of the universes and even he he could get change a billion universes just by nature of this being a multiverse of likely infinite reach it wouldn’t even be a fraction of the amount of universes that exist is just not a feasible able task,2023-06-03
not everyone reads all those details online everyday,2023-06-04
i dont see how thats a response to what i said  iron mans injuries were selfcaused  presumably if it was something external he could try and stop he would have tried to save him even if he was told its impossible  even if he was told thay its a canon event  its only a canon event that if avoided causes the death of that universe according to the films writers  otherwise its just a familiar refrain and if some knockoff avoids the same fate no big deal,2023-06-06
he lost aunt may too,2023-06-07
ah sorry about that a misconception on my part then,2023-06-05
touch grass,2023-06-04
so you literally missed all of his character development throughout the movie,2023-06-05
i feel like that’s kind of the point spidey treats spot as a joke and doesn’t take him seriously that combined with the fact that miles doesn’t seem to care that he caused what happened to spot was the driving force that made him want to get more powerful and ruin spidey’s life,2023-06-05
i mean if thats the case pavitrs canon event being linked to something that isnt meant to happen is kinda bs,2023-06-11
was she the one in the robot i thought that was a different spider,2023-06-19
just watched it and i couldn’t agree more who is the main character in this movie it’s not at all clear,2023-08-08
i agree with you i think youre missing my argument im arguing that its not miles fault but miguel seems to have framed it as if it was maybe i misinterpreted the movie,2023-06-08
yes boomer,2023-06-17
"but mumbattan did begin to collapse you can say that its only partial collapse can be an indicator of hope or an indicator that miguels right you can do the logical gymnastics to go either way

miguels adamant about the severity of the situation because he incidentally contributes to the collapse of another universe  his mistake and his experiences tells him hes substantiates what he tells miles  you can rationalize that miles doesnt have to trust miguel but i dont want that perspective to remove miles from an important and critical decision with so much at stake including his own growth as a person

yeah i agree but again id like the filmmakers as well as us the audience to really think about this dilemma on its own terms instead of speculating on whether characters are right or wrong on some details  miles doesnt know for a fact that saving his dad would destroy his world hes holding onto hope that he can find some workaround to save both but that necessitates him risking the existence of the world because hes clearly prioritizing his dads safety over the notion that the universe would collapse  regardless of whether the others are right or wrong hes making a moral decision right now and moral decisions come with consequences regardless of which way you go  my concern is that the film isnt going to give miles those consequences  spiderman as not only a character but as an an idea is defined by loss sacrifice and perseverance  the movie is clearly asking whether he should be and i want the next film to actually give a prescriptive answer  but i want the answer to be grounded and relatable i dont want the movie to tell us that spiderman and by proxy us in the real world can have our cake and eat it too",2023-06-02
as far as miles is concerned if he has no prewritten destiny like the others since he was never meant to be as he is he can continue making his own destiny,2023-06-02
nope same kind of origin as the spider that bit miles in the insomniac video game  norman osborn made it in a lab,2023-06-03
that still doesn’t make him a villain lol the guy is right he’s an antagonist but not a villain potential to change into antihero by the end of the next movie,2023-06-03
i know im not arguing against that i just dont like the fact he became spiderman by mistake of a mistake,2023-06-03
good catch  so much detail,2023-06-06

"oh interesting thanks for the clarification i think you might be right on gwen and hobies relationship just took a quick google search to find out hobie is 

but surely you can understand where i was coming from 16 i mean thats legal and honestly my critique of real life still stands plenty of selfish people that are inconsiderate of others and everything to serve their feelings first

yes i have had platonic female friends having their toothbrush at your place and having them wear your shoes is not normal platonic behaviour it was a clear misdirect i see that now

also i think peter did get beta rolled what would your explanation for him resorting to turning to a lizard be he was obviously bullied and saw gwen as spider woman regardless of whether there was romantic interest or not he got beta rolled and gwens character helped facilitate that  he had no problem dying",2023-06-02

next we have mumbattan where spot activates the collider yikes now they really need to stop spot right

nope spot is barely mentioned any more now the priority is to keep miles away from his planet again where he just was and stacy was explicitly told not to do anything to him",2023-06-03

just a random thing that came up in my mind do you guys think this is a little bit of a romance film and if so who was to you going through more in the film gwen with her life and father and hiding the truth to her best friend or miles with betrayal and being alone,2023-06-03
"maybe on another rewatch ill understand better it seems like victim blaming to me

maybe this miguel dude isnt very chill and not a good guy after all",2023-06-04
they had a cutaway when it’s revealed that miles’ dad is meant to die that shows spot with a voiceover saying something along the lines of “i’m going to take everything from you the way you did to me” and it shows him causing some sort of destructive event that causes a building to fall on miles’ dad,2023-06-03

yeah but i thought it was a great callback miles dad running down the stairs after looking at spot’s portal was a better one tho,2023-06-11
did you happen to catch which universe that was that collapsed iirc miquel replaces himself in that universe and it collapsed i thought it was peter bs since he was there but by the end he was back with mj so i assume not,2023-06-05
wait is this confirmed does that mean peter b knew about the multiverse and the spider org prior to the events of the first movie,2023-06-10
i think the implication was that if peter doesnt grab the mantle in a universe or dies its up for grabs so yeah hes sorta default,2023-06-05
what makes 616 the default,2023-06-08
no clue why you’re being downvoted peter constantly has to adapt and use his smarts to counter his villains no way miles outsmarts that many spiderman so easily but it’s still his movie so let’s let miles have his victory and suspend our sense of disbelief since it was an awesome scene,2023-06-03
i think what also helps him escape is hes the only one with specific specialized powers venom and camouflage and most other spider men are relying on the same move sets to capture him,2023-06-10
in what way was it cribbing from rick and morty,2023-06-04
i mean hes clearly in a very futuristic world so its probably the year too,2023-06-08
i think you’re right but at the same time i’d that requires first letting say 10 universes collapse you just killed trillions of beings he still isn’t wrong for not wanting that blood on his hands it’s unspidermany for sure he’s lost his essence but it’s not an immoral position,2023-06-07

i saw it twice at two different theaters and at each one i had to call the box office to ask that they turn the volume up after they did it was great but before i could barely hear it i definitely think the movie audio itself isn’t that loud to begin with,2023-06-05
i almost left my seat to tell the front desk it was too quiet couldn’t hear a thing in the beginning as well as a lot of dialogue throughout the movie,2023-06-06
me too i blamed the quiet sound on my town theatre’s speakers but looks like it was the movie i think i’ll watch the movie again with subtitles when it becomes available on netflix to see what they were saying,2023-06-07
i thought this was intentional but now im not sure,2023-06-07
phil lord tweeted about it today feels like an issue with the dcp not the theaters,2023-06-04
"it wasn’t i didn’t have any problems when i went to see the movie 
cinemas just don’t care about this kind of stuff it seems like",2023-06-05
oscar isaac’s spanish accent was clearly not mexican either but maybe that’s how things are in the future we all sound like guatemalans,2023-06-03
didn’t happen to me in a regular amc no imax theater,2023-06-04
interesting just saw it in dolby and i didnt have that experience,2023-06-03
was that metro,2023-06-06
“i had a nightmare about that once but no”,2023-06-04
try breaking into a hq thats completely upside down,2023-06-08
the entrance from the elevator is upside down yes but the base seems to be designed to use all the space and spiderpeople are seen on all surfaces,2023-06-03
they are riding on the bottom of the elevator the tower is designed for spider folk so it isnt constructed with an up or down there is no difference between ceilings or floors kinda like enders game so the lobby is on what we would call the ceiling this film is cool in part because they play with perspective so much just like in the gwenmiles conversation in brooklyn earlier,2023-06-04
it’s a whole extra level watching it in imax,2023-06-04
probably the pair they drop with the 3rd one in march,2023-06-04
oh lol that makes sense idk why i had to know,2023-06-03
jesus though 2 hours even as a midwesterner i wouldnt spend 2 hours in a car just for a movie,2023-06-04
as a nonamerican  what do you guys mean when you say bay area is that a part of san francisco,2023-06-17
bay area huh so guys in it,2023-06-05
yep that’s what i thought guess i need to watch it again lol,2023-06-04
gayatris dad being inspector singh threw me off but she can very well have a hindu mom lol,2023-06-09
gayatri is also very similar to gwen stacey holds a few of the same letters,2023-06-23
movie tickets cost too much for my movie to hit me with “buy another ticket to see the last ten minutes of this movie before the next one starts”,2023-06-05
get punked,2023-06-04
yeah but at that moment you also kind of think i really hope they’res just a little more leg to this film and they’re is,2023-06-05
11 in 2018 that makes you onlydear  how old am i,2023-06-05
going in to this movie blind really was such a pure experience,2023-06-11
yea the empire formula was really transparent i wish movies would stop stealing that exact set of beats as a sequel the devils rejects is probably the worst empire remake i’ve seen,2023-06-03
thought it was going to end as soon as gwen found out he’s in the wrong universe it was reminding me of the good old days of return of the king with all those endings except with a huge twist,2023-06-03
"i knew it was a 2 parter just couldn’t pin point where it would end 

my brother didn’t know and it was honestly funny hearing someone go “yo where the rest of my movie at”

i don’t think i can last long on this cliffhanger definitely my favorite movie trilogy",2023-06-07
"  i already knew it was ending in a cliffhanger so i was expecting it to end any moment

 i  love just watching a movie and not knowing all the details beforehand its beautiful",2023-09-02
closing out with the drums though perfect,2023-06-03
i didnt realize the movie was going to be 2 parts until we saw the prowler then i thought its been about 2 hours im not sure how were gonna finish all these story oh dang,2023-06-11
had the same reaction i was thinking “how the  are they going to wrap this up” followed immediately by “oh they aren’t”,2023-06-04
vin diseal also has super powers that came from a car biting him,2023-06-24
yup earliest trailer says part 1 at the end,2023-06-04
"why i loved that i didnt know it was going to be a pt 1 

it was such a good surprise",2023-06-02
theyve got a big story to tell which cant be contained in one movie simple as that dont want people sitting in the theatre for hours a lot of people wouldnt go if the runtime was around 5 hours i know my friend wouldnt,2023-06-02
i would maybe agree if not for the last minute addition of alternate miles thats compelling enough that im down for a movies worth of interaction with him alongside the conflicts with both the spot and miguel,2023-06-04
do you think infinity war or empire strikes back are good movies both of them would feel wrong without sequels but are good movies that stand on their own imo,2023-06-20
nah not in canada,2023-06-02
tbf im ok buying more tickets i mean it was amazing all the easter eggs in almost every scene 100 the best super hero movie since endgame,2023-07-01
yeah they blue balled us that hard kinda hurt the film in my eyes,2023-06-17
"its not pedantic leia and luke are on a ship doing nothing han is locked in carbonite there is zero plot action taking place the movie ends with them looking into space

this movie ends with miles charging his finger on the chain to break out and gwen rallying other spidermen to his dimension its more than pace the movie ends mid third act",2023-06-04
the fact that those would have direct sequels never at any point was a secret also they all had an actual end and denouement for each one this movie didn’t,2023-06-16
dune did in its title card at the beginning though,2023-06-25
"yet you acknowledge that the only decent reason for removing “part 1” from the title was because they were afraid it would scare off audience members

which is it

audiences tend to be warier if part 1’s because nobody like a  cliffhanger ending i dont know why this one is catching such a pass from everyone in existence many people here are somehow flipping it into something “exciting” that this movie has no closure or ending whatsoever",2023-06-02
"i’m really not if you really like spiderman and just want spiderman stuff thrown at the screen for 2 hours this movie is probably a great experience

if you want tight and efficient story telling to deliver a satisfying narrative this movie is not it i got so bored waiting for the movie to stop wasting time but it just kept going",2023-06-07
"the  i did i got half a movie for full price lol what

and the ending is a very important part of the movie i don’t hand out good ratings to movies with bad beginnings or bad middles either 

it is a depressing way to experience ya adaptations that’s for sure but most grown up movies don’t end like dragon ball z episodes",2023-06-05
i knew this was only part one so the entire last 30 minutes or so i was like is this the part where it ends i hope not i want to see miles fight the spot okay the music seems pretty climactic maybe this is the final shnope were still going good i dont want it to end yet okay its doing it again but surely it cant end nno no that was the end okay uh i guess see ya in 8 months or whatever,2023-06-07
awful examples none of those movies ended without resolving a plot thread there is a difference between leaving room for a sequel and creating a twopart movie this fell into neither category this was ‘dragon ball z tune in next time’  that’s not how movies work this movie simply wasnt finished before it was released,2023-06-05
nah that just means were guaranteed more animated spiderman,2023-06-03
i dont see it as 23s of a movie the story this movie wanted to tell was finished when miles escaped miguels universe and gwen resolved her conflict with her father everything with miles after he escaped was more of an extended preview of part three like if empire kept going and showed the droids knocking on jabbas door,2023-06-03
everything i learn about these movies just makes me love them more holy ,2023-06-07
"i know 24 is the long standing standard of movies but its not exclusively that anymore even if it is almost all of them 

i am not saying spider verse was a 60fps film but there certainly have been some movies that were i guess if the projector  screen can easily be set for a given rate of the movie no reason to not match it though i said that the screen refresh can be x so long as its more than y the fps of the media and 60hz is what most people have for their tv so i just defaulted to that for an example",2023-06-04
but i feel like having a good writer wouldn’t matter if the director wasn’t good and the writer’s vision couldn’t be implemented i agree that good writers matter but without a good director i don’t think the movie could ever be good,2023-06-06
it’s a collaborative process not saying the writers don’t deserve credit lead writers should also be included on info like directors and lead actors but good writing can be obscured to oblivion with  directorial vision and wooden acting and similarly amazing acting and direction can only do so much with a bad script everyone has their unique role and none of it would work without everyone working on it,2023-06-20
yooooo dude what’s up i had no idea that was you hahaha nah both experiences were so fun,2023-06-02
i’m just happy to see it up there tbh i don’t mind at all,2023-06-02
nah,2023-06-03
so flashpoint spiderman,2023-06-04
thats a pretty sick costume honestly i thought he was going to be that one beerbelly spiderman in a polo shirt,2023-06-04
imagine how emotional itd be if he discovered a world filled with the nephew he wasnt able to save,2023-06-15
his uncle was dead prior too though,2023-06-03
i was looking for a lego elizabeth banks,2023-06-03
"the power of x in the palm of my hand” line too

i was the only person who laughed at that in my showing and i wasnt sure if it was too subtle or if everyone else in the theatre just wasnt a true believer",2023-06-18
when,2023-06-13
that actually goes back to miles’ comics and is a reference to jackie robinson,2023-06-04
“aww why’d you create him miles”,2023-06-05
and i created you,2023-06-28
i was thinking about the creature from dont open your eyes ,2023-06-14
yes i was thinking the same thing,2023-06-11
tfw miles accidentally creates an origin story for antispiral,2023-06-18
could you stop talking about you holes youre making everyone uncomfortable,2023-06-03
and judging by the way spiderpunk launched gwen from his guitar like that scene from flcl i refuse to believe the director isnt a huge gainax fan,2023-06-18
man what would i gives for miles and crew going full gurrenn lagann with supaidaman,2023-06-03
"looks like its finally time for me to make a supaidāman costume

sword vigor",2023-06-16
"this is also the reason miles42 has to hate miles1610 since its implied the spider was about to bite him before it was taken through a portal

its strongly implied that miles42 was going to become spiderman and save jefferson from dying while miles1610 was likely to follow aaron into a life of crime if the events of the first movie hadnt happened  the portal caused their destinies to switch and when miles42 finds out about this hes going to feel some type of way cf the show counterpart starring jk simmons",2023-06-03
nope they did such a great job with the characterization that they modeled the mcu character off of it,2023-06-12
nah yeah remember in the beginning right after miles gets bit peter parker gets killed by kingpin and all of new york mourns also remember aunt may from miles dimension exists already too and is mentioned in this movie she moves to florida,2023-06-02
"i know its not what you said but its the only way that what you said would have worked given the information already presented to us in this movie

the spider didnt just get loose it was sent from earth42 meaning that the person it was supposed to have bitten would have also come from earth42 they would have had no relationship to alchemax or miles unless both they and the spider both managed to fall into earth1610",2023-06-04
yup absolutely getting a print of that once the 4k bluray is out,2023-06-03
yeah i agree i thought the far wide one was breathtaking,2023-06-13
and the city that looks like a reflection,2023-06-09
thank you ,2023-06-04
itll be fine fun even just not memorable probably,2023-06-14

"youd have a harder time finding a spiderman that wouldnt sacrifice themselves

the problem is they can never get to the point where the sacrifice matters",2023-06-04
"nah something a little darker

his canon was broken when he was inspired into happiness by the anomalous miles morales spiderman this is foreshadowed by the head spiders own attempt to be happy in another universe so it wont be long before his own universe begins to unravel",2023-06-04
as long as the writers dont all have mid life crises at the same time hes safe,2023-06-09
remindme 2 years,2024-04-03
i just lold at work thanks for that,2023-06-05
this the fans desperately want to see some progression but marvel wants to maintain the brand and what they know works and now marvel has so many new young spiderpeople like gwen and miles youd think marvel could take their boot off peters throat and let him age but noooo,2023-06-05
"but remember the buildings and people near the event started glitching like miguel’s universe when his was destroyed  spot’s holes has never caused other universes to glitch out yet and it’s not like the portal threw buildings and people from another universe to glitch out in mumbattan  there just seemed like a sudden energy wave that caused everyone to glitch out similar to miguel’s memory  plus the quarantine spider team seemed experienced and knew what they were doing and seems to have slowed the glitching  

also whatever miguel’s tech used to predict canon events is crazy accurate  it’s one thing to just say these are canon events by history it’s another thing to say miles’s dad will die in exactly two days from now from a multiversal villain  plus the spot vision with both india officer and davis overlapping each other implies this is a sort of “fated” event but that doesn’t really say what happens if you stop it

yeah miguel is misinformed in something but personally i think it’s a very unsatisfying conclusion to just be “miles right miguel and every other spider person wrong”  that would make every other spiderman tv show etc in the future be like “why didn’t the spider society prevent their tragedies from happening”  i feel it has to be more nuanced than that and how they’re going to push that theme of “anyone can wear the mask” as this fated canon thing goes against it  also remember peter b was present when miguel’s universe collapsed so he agreed with miguel’s conclusion after witnessing everything that happened",2023-06-09
i will say one thing that bothered me was when miguel was talking about how being spiderman is about sacrifice no one pointed out that it’s self sacrifice not sacrificing others,2023-06-04
a friend i saw the movie with expressed the potential theory that miles is fine to break canon because hes the original anomaly thus theres no need for him to follow the canon because none of his life should have happened in the first place,2023-06-05
yeah i’m thinking the same thing miles saves his dad breaks the spiderman canon law and multiverse of spiderman no longer has a tragic law that must befall spiderman,2023-08-14
in peters universe the prowler runs a superhero daycare,2023-06-21
incursions literally come from being in the wrong universe thats straight from multiverse of madness miguel  a universe because he wasnt from that universe it has nothing to do with canon,2023-06-20
the incursions cause destruction because they catch the attention of the tva which then destroys them incursions by themselves have never been shown to cause the end of a universe,2023-06-20
you honestly just spelled out my thoughts for me better than i could hard agree cos miguels logic doesnt make sense as far as weve seen,2023-06-03
i mean we sorta see the destruction the lack of a spiderman in evil miles morales universe does,2023-06-03
maybe what’s eating mumbattan before they leave was just coincidental effects of the spot and not spidey india’s universe falling apart  this probably didn’t occur to miguel because of his worldview,2023-06-04
my read is more just that there are 3 losses every spider endures comics 616 pete is ben cpt stacy and gwen holland pete has iron man aunt may and arguably mj but i can also see it just being ben off screen or something in his next movie spiderverse miles has lost his peter and aaron so i do think there is another in store in beyond,2023-06-08
i did see someone else saying that in this thread but for my two scents it doesn’t match up he’s not law enforcement and additionally there is no daughterromance plot element in tony and peter’s relationship,2023-06-07
miles is the anomaly but i think the canon event helps the universe correct itself to no longer be anomalous like miles morales became spiderman so peter parker died but now he has to go through the canon events police captain uncles death that makes him spiderman and bring the universe back into balance,2023-06-03
i guess but my issue with that is that no variation of spiderman should be ok with it i feel like it goes completely against spiderman as a whole,2023-06-03
also miles already had his canon negative event he lost his uncle he doesnt need more tragedy  it wouldnt surprise me if miles loses his uncle again after bonding in earth42,2023-06-04
what writer made it clear that they wanted to happen tho nobody sane would actually be okay with this unless theres a paycheck involved,2023-06-04
what if you bring two miles,2023-06-04
true but i still feel like something needs to give as in order for miles to be successful in all he still needs to lose something along the way,2023-06-04
getting the two cakes meant miles couldnt swing back home so he ended up late emotionally hurting his parents messed up the words on the cakes which was the whole point of the second one and got into a heated argument with his parents getting two cakes wasnt a magical solution and if miles just saves everyone its a very boring overarching story i think the canon event will coursecorrect for whatever miles does maybe his mom dies in his dads place,2023-06-19
ahh gotcha thanks i’ve only ever watched spiderman in the movies and not read the comics so i don’t know his history,2023-06-02
isn’t gwen stacy death also a canon event,2023-06-03
"its possible he was supposed to die as a result of spots action but its also possible he was supposed to die in this specific way at any given time without spots interference

what was not supposed to happen was miles saving him

now i dont know whats the truth because on one hand pavitr universe started disappearing as a result allegedly of miles action but on the other hand gwens dad didnt die and her universe is fine

to be continued in beyond the spiderverse ",2023-06-02
 twitter is a  im curious how theyre even mad about it its clearly just silliness,2023-06-07
" all the people on twitter pretending to be fans of his are upset about it

so in other words just another day of the week",2023-06-10
the little narration he does looking at gwen’s portal is what finally got me he sounded like “serious peralta” way too much,2023-06-02
whats the most controversial story youre referring to id like to read into it ,2023-06-03
"they played him for laughs but its at least clear from his visuals that they had artists on the movie that are suckers for that 90s style me too scarlet spiders design was always one of my faves maybe the writing was lame but the 90s attitude is kind of infectious for some that dont mind the corniness so id say it was less them mocking the character for being cringe and dated but more just poking fun at the inherent campiness

miguel too immediately looked badass right when they revealed this movie and spiderman 2099 was a 90s publication as well",2023-06-05
you are misremembering ben reilly was no never cringe hes story was sad and tragic despite all the  he got he still didnt stop being a hero,2023-06-04
ben wasn’t really that 90s edge it was more kaine or 2099 that embodied that more  he was basically just peter but with different problems,2023-06-04
i would say what did it was miles saying he didnt remember him and that he was a low tier villain,2023-06-10
"from the get go he considered himself spidermans nemesis and assumed just mild teleportation would be enough then he got schooled and took it personally

but once he realized his potential power he went full villain similar to jaimie fox electro pretty much going full crazed with power",2023-06-25
"sorry but swearing should not be an issue when it comes to children period the words arent the issue the reactions of outdated almost exclusively american people to them are they also did it here and there in the movie you just saw so

as for  innuendos yeah theres not so much of that and since its a natural part of being human i i dont see what the issue is as long as nothing explicit is saidhappens

marvel movies have gotten a bit more mature some of them anyway but they are indeed still targeted toward and appropriate for children of all ages",2023-06-04
oof yep the daggers were hard,2023-06-02
"she was more a few weeks ago  these days  

i cant continue to open myself to people  it lets them in and thats how i get hurt",2023-06-03
"the difference is the environment people are raised in in universe 42 brooklyn is literally burning the sinister six apparently runs a cartel and likely controls everything when miles father dies he may feel there is no point going against the system that is in place especially when his uncle is a part of that system and influencing him therefore miles joins said system in order to get his

now if miles with powers loses his father he knows he has the ability to fight against evil he  would continue to fight crime in order to prevent more loss basically their conviction to do good would become stronger",2023-06-09
"i think the difference is the uncle event 

in 42 from what it seems dad dies uncle aaron becomes the influence in life and the mentor and is “evil” or at least morally not great 


uncle aaron dies and dad dies there’s no bad influence really from uncle aaron no figure to influence so i don’t think miles would be evil 

it’s a combination of the two the father dying and then miles looking to his uncle the other “father” figure for guidance and aaron’s influence not being a positive one that leads to prowler miles",2023-06-11
i prefer that i keeps the story beats of heroic duty across universes showcases that miles is a canon hero and more importantly ignores the evil counterpart trope,2023-06-20
"ding ding miguel nearly feeding on vulture in the beginning makes me think he’s benefiting off “keeping things cannon” in some way plus his extreme design change from the first movie plus all the hints they dropped “you’re the only spiderman that isn’t funny” “claws are you sure you’re spiderman” 

there’s  afoot",2023-06-03
" especially since the movies themselves are so optimistic that its dealing with the countering pessimism of miguel

there are couple of reasons im unsure even miguel is so cut and dry 

1 he refused to use deadly force on vulture even though this version of vulture is one of the most dangerous weve seen

2 hes having his society try to capture spot not just let him  people even during the chase scene hes asking them to hunt him down so im not fully convinced miguels decided  just let spot massacre everyone but he very much does not trust miles to make the right decision if faced with a hard choice",2023-06-04
"canon isnt a red herring it is the central challenge of the movies the fate that they defy 

gwen already broke canon by baring her soul to her father thus making him quit the force thus saving him from tragic death

its important to note how gwen saved her dad—not through heroism but by connecting with him and being honest both gwen and miles are fearful that their dads  families could never understand and its this fear and avoidance that leads to the tragic canon deaths in other universes the very idea that honesty and oneness with those you love violate canon is the perverse logic the heroes reject

the idea of canon events being necessary to shaping who spiderpeople are will either be discovered to be outright false or theyll come to the epiphany that the outcomes of personal growth matter more than how they get there

spiderman and gwen fall in love and gwen dies is canon and it will be broken in beyond the spiderverse theyll break canon first with something like miles connecting with his family and jeff survives see that it turns out okay and therefore decide to take a chance on love knowing that their fate isnt sealed

the theme of defying canon are in the title beyond the spiderverse our heroes will no longer be bound by the rules miguel enforces",2023-06-17
there might be a part where the canon point falls apart a little bit if miles is himself an anomaly and therefore a disruption of a canon event then why would he have to adhere to canon events in the first place if hes not a real spooderdooder he doesnt have to follow the spooderscript,2023-06-05
this is a great point and in my head i am telling myself theyre commenting on the spiderman comics editors office constantly having to make peter mistake and not able to grow haha,2023-06-03
i think the death of someone close to spiderman robs those characters uncle ben captain stacy gwen of their agency they are pawns in someone elses story someone in this movie said being spiderman is about self sacrifice  gwen could still die but it would be her choice and not as a victim i hope it doesnt happen but i can see it making sense,2023-06-06
yeah gwen doesnt have a captain to lose anymore since her dad quit so that canon point shouldnt happen to her now,2023-06-07
“nah i’m gonna do my own thing”,2023-06-17
i think thats what made her realise that canon points can be changed which is why she decides to go save miles,2023-06-03
just watched it the spideys are trying to fix it i’m guessing it might’ve worked or is still trying to be fixed seeing as pravith is part of the band,2023-06-02
yeah no way she’s dying at least i hope  definitely one of the best spidermen  her whole arch would’ve been a great stand alone film,2023-06-03
but that arc doesnt get realised as he never reveals himself to his parents  he has an underlying turn the spiderman story upside down arc running throughout both films so far,2023-06-04
i dont think we see pavitrs universe again and it is just mentioned in passing  he is on gwens team by the end so things probably arent that bad but a quick sight would have been nice especially since these movies have such a great visual storytelling aspect to them  its almost certainly a major aspect of part two though,2023-06-02
the spiderpeople place some pylons and theres a throwaway line that they either got there in time or can contain it for now,2023-06-08
kinda miguel had to send a crew in to patch that reality hole which is fine and dandy but apparently if he breaks another canon event their world might collapse leading to the destruction of everyone,2023-06-11
and also going to be involved in upcoming hollandverse movies so probably worth watching,2023-06-06
first one is second one is a mess imo,2023-06-07
i didn’t see him but i did see spiderman unlimited,2023-06-03
i didnt see him but im pretty sure i saw the 90s buff doc ock as one of the imprisoned anomalies,2023-06-10
i didn’t catch that particular iteration either but i’m gonna go again this weekend,2023-06-03
it’s in the last season,2023-06-04
i saw him i think no no i did i think did see spider horse though,2023-06-05
yes he’s very lame he’s essentially a “joke” villain the movie played off on this a lot by calling him a “villain of the week” as that is what he tends to be in the comics and the series usually easily bested once spidey has wrapped his mind around the portals and trusts his spidey senses that’s why it’s exciting to see him become sinister something about the pathetic guy getting revenge that makes a really intriguing villain for me,2023-06-03
when he started getting more spots and turning black he got really freaking scary,2023-06-04
an easy solve that was actually kinda touched upon in spiderverse was that you can simply make it have a limited number of uses the spot had to go find more spots,2023-06-04
he does at least seem to be a sincere fan of the material,2023-06-03
i don’t recognize that name and this appears to be a common sentiment regarding him is it just morbius and the films or does it go even deeper than that,2023-06-02
"hes been right quite a lot and hes the reason a lot of what you love exists as well theres a reason hes the man they thanked in no way homes credits he helped produce the raimi and webb films

hes been responsible for a lot of bad  as well but the way people online villainize him is silly",2023-06-04
no,2023-06-02
he is a portal machine gun,2023-06-16
theres a sequence that miles predict all of his portal punch and kick so i dont think what youre saying would work,2023-06-28
spiderman actually cant use his spider sense against the spot because his attacks start in a different dimension at least this is how it was in the comics,2023-06-05

"shimazaki gets minus points from me in this context bcs hes not just a teleporter  he has superstrength endurance telekinesis etc

in that while he spams teleportation like a chicken on crack he still heavily leans on his secondary powers as well 

theres something terrifying about spot in that his power is simply you dont know where hes coming from next and thats it its simple with an extremely broad range of applications  everything is a weapon and i have loved that about the way he was animated in this film",2023-06-03
first thing i thought of too clearly this dude hasnt seen shipp spot was so awesome cant wait to see miles win him over by acknowledging how fun it is to fight him,2023-06-07
if you do reread stop at the original ending and dont start the revived series its absolutely awful ,2023-06-04

"it’s not  he’s an awkward nerd and so are a lot iterations of spiderman plus their builds are somewhat similar his voice sounded on point and he even his personality wasn’t that of a malicious person — he was only robbing them because he needed the money and that’s all accompanying a plot that involves the multiverse

it really goes to show how brilliant the people in charge here are because that’s the perfect way to throw people off expectation wise not only is it easy to assume  be a nobody you can also assume he’s one of many “bad spiderpeople” especially with his face not explicitly saying if he is or isn’t a spiderman",2023-06-05
oh nice catch totally missed that among many other things probably,2023-06-03
the latter im pretty sure theyve revealed his real name is the same as the character from the comics dr jonathan ohn,2023-06-04
he was the scientist with round glasses from the first film — seen standing next to  behind olivia octavius a lot of the time whom miles also threw a bagel at,2023-06-07
you get both uncle aaron is his uncle ben there is also a separate police captain death,2023-06-19

"this thing in the movie was pointless

no it wasnt heres why

oh so you think youre smarter than me or something

bruh",2023-06-12
i think youre getting caught up with the word interpretation as it is used here the interpretation is that spiderman hit him with a bagel they never changed that they just built upon it a retcon would be if they killed off a character and later decided that character wasnt dead and brought them back i am confident they had this villain planned out since the beginning and they are not altering the events of the previous film at all,2023-06-06
i mean he was visible in different scenes too — he was the guy with glasses in the collider room with kingpin and the one peter initially thought to be the head scientist when laying out his plan — him being the spot is a new reveal yes but not one that changes his history all that much,2023-06-07
"i think i just felt a bit  cuz that was like a really funny joke that people remembered and like reminding people about it i dont know it felt kind of lazy

reminds me of in that spiderman movie when they played that tony stark built this in a cave with a box of scraps clip and were like hey you remember the guy was jeff bridges was yelling at well now hes back",2023-06-05
yeah i get it now i went and bought the bluray of into last night gonna watch it tonight so i can have fresh in my mind before my rewatch of across,2023-06-03

he got displaced at the same time as the other spidermen and his spider",2023-06-25

 dude young justice introduced a few new plot lines but there was also every indication that it would keep going the cancellation was really out of nowhere because hbo is actively trying to be another reality tv machine now ugh,2023-06-05
i disagree about young justice but even if i didn’ was a very different show from spectacular spiderman from the start i wouldn’t assume it would go in the direction that one did just because the same show runner is involved,2023-06-03
theres a semicliffhanger of a season ending no ones about to die or anything but a bunch of unresolved stuff is up in the air so to speak then the rights switched to another company and the show was cancelled,2023-06-02

whats crazy is that andrew garfield was after spectacular spiderman so spectacular might have inspired amazing spiderman a little",2023-06-27
you’re right i mistook miles line for his,2023-06-03
he did yup sadly pouring hours into both fire emblem engage and persona 4 has given me the ability to recognize his voice anywhere,2023-06-06
"dont quote me on this but i believe hes said the pie in the sky plan was to do 5 seasons and a few directtodvd movies as the characters move into college the films were going to be slightly more mature stories one of them being gwens death

i remember i saw it with a friend in a theater that was at the back of this big busy mall  when it ended the theater was so quiet we got up walked all the way out the mall for like 5 minutes till we got to our car got in and sat down for like 30 seconds before finally breaking the silence like dudewhat happens now,2023-06-05

yeah he did something about staring,2023-06-03
and the donald glover connection,2023-06-02
dont even get me started with dr strange and the little nerd from 199999 iirc,2023-06-02
"yeah so does this confirm for us that different universes just number things differently since multiverse of madness claimed mcu to be 616 whereas it had previously been designated 199999 as is referenced in spiderverse spiderverse also gives 616 designation to peter b parker but if different people give different numbering systems then comics could still adjust the numbers for spiderverse peter miles gwen etc

thinking of this also just made me realize that the movie claims miles is an anomaly but also canonizes the ps4 games where miles is a spiderperson",2023-06-02
which iman vellani will surely be happy about because according to her she kept pestering kevin feige because he has designated the mcu as 616 in the movies when its canonically earth199999,2023-06-08
whats really either confusing or interesting is the fact that the any prowler is there based on what we see in the across miles from 1610 is the only miles who becomes spiderman because of the multiversal spider since peter was the spiderperson for that universe already theres no suggestion that any other miles becomes a superhero though perhaps some become villains like in universe 42 it does seem that the prowler exists independent of miles being spiderman since aaron was already prowler before miles gets bitten in 1610 and though just as a  and not as a costumed supervillian in 199999 we of course dont know yet if the donald glover prowler in miguels custody is the one from 199999 but lets assume he is it would be interesting to see conflict of 1610 miles 42 miles miguel ohara and the spot breaking the structure of canon events and starting a new cycle where a miles coming into a spiderpersons life is a canon event starting with a spider biting 199999s miles attracted through the multiverse by the various multiverse shenanigans happen in 199999616,2023-06-02
i thought he said “that little nerd” referring to tom holland,2023-06-02
nah he said little nerd so i think it was referencing holland and nwh as a whole,2023-06-02
yeah its his scene when captain stacy dies and same for tobey and uncle ben,2023-06-03
miles ends up in the realreal world and meets phil lord and christopher miller,2023-06-21
spiderman unlimited is in the front right behind miguel when they all confront miles,2023-06-06
spiderman unlimited is definitely in it hes usually in the front of the background characters once they get to the spider society,2023-06-05
"it’s not though he straight up says they have very little information on how the multiverse works earlier in the film

the characters being out of their universe in the first place already goes against what the movie set up — not all of them know peter parker is spiderman not all of them die either

who’s to say people didn’t get sent out of the mcu if there were people coming in like hawkeye said in avengers — doors open from both sides",2023-06-02
could be different universe,2023-06-03
yes mcu miles,2023-06-02
"my current thought is that at the end of “beyond the spiderverse” this miles will be pulled into the mcu as a live action character would make sense for two reasons

 there will already be specifically established backstory for the character and emotional attachment to the audience because of it they also wont have to rehash the same origin story all over again

 with it being rumored that holland will be the lead in avengers secret war it would make sense for them to introduce a certain multiversal “wristwatch” forgot the name they gave it in this movie",2023-06-03
irl miles needs to be played by an afro latino so i hope its another actor,2023-06-02
my brother for some reason probably because i was constantly playing his music while we were all stuck in quarantine,2023-06-04
i wish my crowd was like that they laughed at jokes but that was about it the group to the left of me kept getting up and down and left before the movie was over the girl next to me on the right when the movie was over said well that ending was  like it was  2007,2023-06-02
gotg is phase 5,2023-06-09
i went in skeptical thought it was going to be terrible came out very impressed i loved the movie and thought it was great despite some obvious flaws i agree with your take on iron heart and felt the movie would’ve been much better off without her but that wasn’t a big enough problem to make me dislike it but namor man i felt they handled him pretty much perfectly up till the ending which i’m a little conflicted about making him into this weird foreigner was such a good treatment for him and his underwater world was so beautifully crafted i understand the criticisms and agree with some of them but in the end the way they handled boseman’s death was really well done the theme of letting go and moving on was pretty powerful i thought,2023-06-19
only the beginning was good imo the ending was horrible with the  power ranger armors,2023-06-03
its not like they had a choice in wakanda forever given the situation i thought they really did a good job exploring the loss and made it central to the film instead of just casting someone else as black panther or completely tossing chadwick boseman aside and move on it might not have been the most entertaining mcu film but its a very respectful one,2023-06-04
wakanda forever was an avatar 2 knockoff,2023-06-05
yea it was a good movie not a black panther movie,2023-06-03
i havent seen wakanda forever but that actually sounds like a funny inverse of the first black panther i loved the entire 2nd act but was really bored by the beginning and most of the end,2023-06-11
eeaao was a little too overwhelming at times and it could have been shorter for me even atsv could have been a tad bit shorter but it didn’t overstay it’s welcome that much itsv was just the best balance imo,2023-06-12

"the whole movie could’ve dealt with the fallout of peter getting unmasked

i mean ffh ended with that big a reveal and then nwh only used that as a very flimsy excuse to jump into multiverse shenanigans

i genuinely thought this entire movie would have involved peter on the run public perception ruined because of mysterio vulture and scorpion could have shown up and perhaps kraven the hunter could be out to get him i think that was the original plan 

then perhaps as a sideeffect of slyvie killing hwr in loki you could have an indication of things to come and end the movie with the villains from other worlds coming in here

this is all speculation but i was just wondering what the movie would have been if covid hadn’t happened",2023-06-05
amen there are dozens of us,2023-06-04
i literally said it in my original post you know what wolverine and fan4stic have in common with nwh…terrible scriptslaughable cgiunfunny jokesand character assassinations to a t…the only difference is that nwh has andrew and tobey so people give it a pass even if it’s a mediocre movie nwh was a great theater event…but is far from a good movie,2023-06-04

saw tenet opening weekend in imax one of the worst audio experiences ive ever had fingers crossed that oppenheimer will be better,2023-06-05
"no separate audio track levels just separate speaker levels vocals often come out of specific speakers so it is possible to isolate but it’s not 100 and would be a nightmare between shows 

turning volume up and down between shows is easy though you can set certain playlists to play at certain volumes by adding a macro so spiderman would play at volume 7 in whatever screen it was in while all others would stay at 5",2023-06-03
"i bought the loop earplugs for concerts and theyre pretty good theyre supposed to be designed for even volume reduction across frequencies

",2023-06-04
"i just ordered a 50pack off amazon i can link you the specific one i bought if you really want but i dont think theres a lot of variance between brands theyre just little pieces of foam that you put in your ears i would just buy whatever brand looks good at an online retailer or a local brickandmortar store

it does take a little practice to get them in most effectively i worked out two different tiers of sound dampening depending on how deep i insert them",2023-06-04
"ive been using these ones for concerts for like 8 years would recommend

its definitely more than one a family figure dies uncle ben uncle aaron gwens peter then a captain captain stacy namely and jefferson and captain singh were supposed to die gwen also implies her own father was next since he was a captain but him quitting changes things they even showed that the black suit was a canon event at some point,2023-06-02

eh he has come and gone so much in the comics i wouldnt consider it canon",2023-06-03

" every important spiderman event retold cohesively

 no it doesnt ultimate spiderman isnt even close to that at all and a lot of its story is a mess compared to 616",2023-06-04
"to be fair peter being a teacher while fitting to his personality was really unrealistic there is no way he could hold down such a job that needs structure with his life swinging around at random times to fight supervillains  those papers are not going to grade themselves

but overall sins and one more aside those were terrible in every imaginable way shape and form his run was fantastic  and yeah we actually saw some change in peters life  and it was so refreshing",2023-06-13
obviously i’m exaggerating dude point is in general the character works when he’s relatable to kids and tackling lower level threats and whatnot there is a reason the movies shows and games focus on younger peter,2023-06-06
i can practically hear it from him,2023-06-05
"this timeline isnt 100 accurate  the conversations at marvel editorial around introducing a black spidey happened around 2008 when obama became president

miles as a character was still in the looser design  iteration phase as his place in the world  his introduction were still being workshopped in 2010 when the donald glover spidey campaign was happening and they ended up drawing a lot of inspiration from him when designing miles final look because brian michael bendis who was writing ultimate spiderman at the time really loved the fan campaign

so really the glover spidey campaign cropped up at just the right time to intersect with existing conversations and ended up influencing the final design of the character and became a sort of cultural touchstone for it i dont think itd be accurate to say that miles exists as a reaction to the gatekeeping fans in 2010 but itd definitely be fair to say he exists in conversation with a lot of the core complaints of the gatekeeping fans around diversity and representation in media since a lot of that was happening around the same time that those controversies were playing out in the media as our first black president was being elected",2023-06-04
for sure but i think the themes they’re exploring are going to lead to something more complex than “change is good” especially with regard to miguel whose origin is tied to forcing change,2023-06-02
miguel is almost certainly a morlun stand in and i expect a twist there so its not really some meta criticism theyre just adapting the original story in a unique way spider totems and the way the original comic story played out is way too convoluted for a mainstream film the path theyre taking here with the inevitable miguel heel turn and secret bad guy plot seems more cohesive and will have a better payoff,2023-06-02
"what i understood was that the captain dying is the canon event not a specific captain  her universe didnt collapse because someone else will get the promotion and shell still fail to save them

could be wrong though",2023-06-11
there’s still a universe out there with no spiderman like we saw in earth 42 and it clearly ended poorly for that new york,2023-06-04
every spider man movie in the last 20 years has been about what makes spiderman spiderman and what it means to be spiderman but do your thing what do i care theres always someone like this in any discussion about comic book movies its either not a good comicbook movie or a jab at previous works,2023-06-18

i caught onto the machine using the wrong number but it confirmed it for me when rio went miles you changed your hair,2023-06-02
you also couldnt see the action figure on the shelf that gwen put there in the beginning of the movie,2023-06-04
i noticed universe 42 and then questioned if i mixed up the universes i also didn’t catch on until she didn’t know who spiderman was despite the fact it’s stated earlier when she asks what he did to his hair,2023-06-04
same i was like ahah i knew it,2023-06-04
i had the exact same experience,2023-06-02
same here i went oh i didn’t think that was his dimension and just assumed i was mistaken and when rio commented about not knowing who spiderman was it clicked,2023-06-03
same bro and i then whispered it to my friend when rio didnt know spiderman,2023-06-03
same i like that they didn’t rush anything but they definitely dragged a lot of things unnecessarily,2023-06-03
"i think the third act was a bit sloppy for me

to co ready with empire strikes back  that ended on a cliffhanger but you get like having the big third act showdown with vader and the team reuniting to give it a sense of finality
with here you have miles having his dark night of the soul moment on the elevator but then he instantly completes his arc when he drains miguel and jumps off the elevator

but then the film still has a half hour left

so when gwen wraps her arc and reunites with her dad it feels disconnected because at least for me there wasnt a big showdown to sell it as her story wrapping

and then miles has his i learned by lesson moment with rio but it feels disconnected due to the distance from the elevator fight

i personally would have re edited the neuva york scenes so that there was a distinct moment where miles lost and then other moment where he does some self reflection to win as opposed to what happened where it was essentially one solid action set piece until the elevator climax

i also would have added some more time to gwen getting kicked out of the spider society",2023-06-05

same hopefully it isnt another 5 years for the next movie,2023-06-11
"yea i just have personally never met someone who said “wow i really loved that this movie had no ending”

in my experience nobody ever really “likes” a cliffhanger ending they do their job make you want to see the next part and obviously the confirmation of a next part is exciting because who doesn’t want more of these films but they are objectively at the bottom of the tier list of “quality movie endings” and this one was as messy and as rushed as they come",2023-06-02
i totally  with the tbc left me wanting more,2023-06-02
it felt almost exactly like the end of infinity war  people near me on opening night were having an absolute meltdown when it closed in on thanos  then cut to the credits  there was about a minute of stunned silence followed by a wave of wait what  had to explain to the ones sitting by me that part 2 was already filmed  coming out a year later  same reaction last night when to be continued popped up onscreen  the average moviegoer really has no clue about all this stuff we spend hours discussing online,2023-06-02
oh that for sure was me and my friend i dislike watching trailers for movies i know i will most likely watch so i try to steer clear of any spoilers didn’t know it was going to be two parts and it shocked me in a good way as well made me realize i wanted more and that i was genuinely excited for the next movie to see how it all goes down  the build up was insane and now i’m curious how the next part will be,2023-06-02
all they had to do was put pt 1 in the title  it wouldnt have hurt the box office and we would have all known going in it was a two parter,2023-06-03
i’m right there with you here’s to hoping they don’t fumble the bag with part 3 and being mildly annoyed in the meantime,2023-06-03
"both empire and iw were self contained stories that set up future self contained stories

that can not be said about across it has literally no ending or closure to the plot that is started within the film it quite literally just cuts off at the middle point of the story with no wrap up whatsoever",2023-06-02
"fast x did it in a terrible way thats the perfect example of how not to do a cliffhanger theres not even a semblance of closure or arcs the movie just stops like they ran out of money

empire strikes back and across the spiderverse at least have some resolution with the characters and what theyve gone through sure theres more story to tell but you still feel like you watched a whole movie that just leads to something greater",2023-06-04
fast and furious is a  cash grab franchise so if you want to compare this movie to that then be my guest,2023-06-11
"the negative reaction audiences have to these kind of movies isn’t the “part 12” in the title though it’s the  cliffhanger endings and having to wait years for any kind of closure to the story

they removed the thing nobody cares about and kept the thing they knew people wouldn’t want cuz they were scared if they advertised it as what it actually was that it would cost them money in ticket sales

this is clearly hyperbole but as someone who was expecting a full and cohesive plot the way they advertised this film comes across very bait and switchfalse advertising akin to me",2023-06-02
"i mostly mean how the conversation around the movie will look in these 9 months or longer pending delay of discussion surrounding it

i expect right now we are in the honeymoon phase of everyone thinking the new content was the best thing ever and being once again wowed by the excellent animation and that a lot of people are giving it’s very weak final act a pass and even going out of their way to praise it just because they are hype

i think once more causal audiences see it the narrative around it will be more in line with being disappointed in the ending than excited by it",2023-06-02
"the same bean counters who ambiguously split it into 2 parts to double profits knowing the reason audiences don’t show up to 2 parters is because nobody likes half a plot

"every single one of those films you just mentioned is a much more self contained and stand alone story than this movie they all feel like movie 2 of a trilogy

this movie feels like they took movie 2 of a trilogy decided they didn’t have 2 more self contained stories to tell and figured they would just split one story into 2 movies instead

sorry if this doesn’t get across i’ve been trying to find the right way to put how it is different than any of those films for days now it’s not easy but i truly believe they aren’t the same",2023-06-03
"could have pretty easily put part 1 in the title tho and i’m pretty sure everyone knows they didn’t because they knew it would scare people off

that trailer never played in cinemas,2023-06-02
agreed i even follow some of the creators on twitter and other than posting bts work and a few promo tweets none mentioned this being a part 1 of 2 sony is fairly stringent with their marketing and promotion for their ips so it’s not crazy to believe if they wanted people to know this was a part 1 of 2 they would’ve gone out of their way to make it known instead of doing was seems to be the opposite we’ll see how it plays out i guess,2023-06-03

plus the spot says see you at home spiderman inferring that his home dimension is indeed what we see,2023-06-02
was it really  i wonder if our miles will get a venom then,2023-06-02
 now i want to see a fight between venom and miguel in the sequel,2023-06-15
nope not every universe has peter parker or miles morales their infinite their some where dead pool dont exist and no ultron also etc,2023-06-02
that is peter not spidermen and hobbie is a eletrician not a scientist so its  a  pull specially since he does no tech,2023-06-03
hed rather build one from scratch than take the chance miguel left a backdoor tracking function in his old one he wasnt able to find and disable,2023-06-03

he refers to gwen as his drummer i believe so i think the implication is more that theyre good friends and she plays in his band sometimes,2023-06-02
"she says she never really made a friend besides miles other than crashing at his place sometimes theres no implication of there being anything between them and she explicitly has feelings for miles but doesnt hesitate to introduce them etc

hobie obviously considers her a friend but i guess she just never really let him get too close emotionally because of how she is after her peter  now dad",2023-06-02
plus a london accent is the best way to depict a punk stereotype,2023-06-07

i mean gwen is homeless so,2023-06-02
at that age its practically law she will steal your hoodie 3 oh to be young and in love does anyone know the track thats playing in the background when miles and gwen meet and swing through the city its so nice,2023-06-06
i hate it when girls steal your clothes its gwen tho so ill give it a pass,2023-06-11
she havent gvens clothes,2023-12-22
i never liked him poor ganke,2023-06-04
hes spiderpunk shes spiderspunk,2023-06-09
"hes also a jealous young teen lol

he cant just ask hey are you dating hes got to speculate and assume first its a story trope definitely",2023-06-03
i think the initial problem with that situation is how pavitr talks about gwen and hobie he intentionally makes miles and us believe gwen and hobie hadhave a thing going on hobie even literally crashes into the scene 1uping miles i was so glad hobie ended up being amazing but it was clearly intentional by the writers and i didnt appreciate it lol,2023-06-05
to be fair theyre both really young people and the carefree type emo rock kids so im not surprised if gwen had a fwb relationship with him or at least did that one or two times she was broken and lonely and she knew she couldnt go to meet miles so theres no guarantee gwen wont sleep with hobie during those months,2023-06-04

iirc he says something about gwen mentioning miles pretty early on i think in the end its sus but simply platonic,2023-06-07

"it’s definitely meant to be ambiguous enough to be humorous but hobie calls gwen his drummer and she was homeless without a dimension to go home to


i think they’re friends who people think are  around but aren’t totally normal for band mates to just crash at each others place in the struggling punk scene",2023-06-02
the laugh i laughed when he got called out for hypocrisy and said “i don’t don’t believe in consistency”,2023-06-02
i loved how they were going to force a jealousy love triangle between him gwen and miles but thats not we get instead miles takes the feedback hobie gives him and it helps him in the fight against miguel,2023-06-03
i think he still had some of the superficiality associated with the punk movement saying stuff like ill do it but not because you told me to to miles early on i had the impression that would be his punchline so i was pleased when he helped miles and gwen hit all the authentic punk moments they needed,2023-06-03
" how often do you see actual anarchist ideology depicted as cool and good in media rather than just crusty and naive or hypocritical

the way the rebel watch makes a tunnel that looks like a scrapbook fanzine literally cutting up the page of the comic with scissors,2023-06-03
not from the beginning from when miles showed up you can actually see him pilfering the tech he uses to make it when they’re on the way to meet miguel but playing it off as messing with stuff,2023-06-06
he was joking also did you expect an anarchist punk to like capitalism alexa play propagandhi,2023-06-03
yep he had zero interest in it and just wanted to look out for gwen dude was the absolute coolest and im really glad  be coming back in the next one,2023-06-02
ive never been into ultimate comics so i have no idea what the story is with his dad but i cant imagine keeping spiderman away from one of the defining losses is any better for the canon than him possibly actually saving him spidey kinda has to try and still fail and anyway he already lost his uncle they showed that as a defining moment for raimi spiderman and he never even had a captain stacey and he also won in his equivalent of the night gwen stacey died so like it just cant be bad to let miles try,2023-06-09
maybe its just me but i associate the name norman with america i dont know any famous british normans but i know norm macdonald and norman osbourne,2023-06-02
id guess the same place as wesley snipes,2023-06-02
no he’s definitely a spider man i read the spiderman 2099 comics back on the 90’s,2023-06-02
"and miles directly questions it something like are you even a spiderman in the chase scene after commenting on 2099 using claws

i know nothing about the comics but was just reading about how there are these villains the inheritors who are vampires with a history of feeding on spidermen miguel seems like one of those to me",2023-06-02
its definitely weird and its possibly a glaring plot hole if they stick to the comic books canon like miles miguel is also explicitly not a standard spiderman miguel is from the future and peter parker as spiderman already exists in his world too,2023-06-08
i laughed at miles commenting on how he was cool under the mask too,2023-06-03
"see the solution is simple my cheat code is to also start crushing on my crush’s crush

if my crush likes that person so much they must be cool af

eliminates all those annoying negative feelings of jealousy plus i then had something in common with my crush that we can talk about lol

did this all throughout high school worked like a charm to keep me from feeling down also helped me feel like a cooler person who isn’t bogged down by jealousy i don’t like feeling jealous makes me feel  ",2023-06-08

"ooh that’s a good theory they’re vigilantes but they’re not as effective as spiderman would be they think the miles that waltzed in is a classic doppelgänger the intimidation and “evil” look of them is because that’s the universe they’re in and the vigilante heroes they are that’s definitely their direction

i can see the reasoning behind this even more because they set up a lot of dominoes that need to be toppled over they have spot as a multiversal threat that needs to conclude and they have miguel’s hunt for miles that they need to conclude if they write miles42 to be an actual villain then we’re beating a villain at the start of the movie moving straight to miguel after that then moving straight to spot after that",2023-09-03
hes like an alchemax enforcer in the comics or something like that no,2023-06-08
spiderpunk 2022 i think its his only solo book outside of crossover events i had a hunt around and the only reference i could find on google to him being gayhaving a partner was a poorly written blog review that took explicit pains to mention how much they didnt care about politics before ragging on the book for being a leftist wet dream so i dont know how much stock id put in their reading,2023-06-07

with great power comes the workers with their courage resolution and selfsacrifice who will be chiefly responsible for achieving victory the petty bourgeoisie will hesitate as long as possible and remain fearful irresolute and inactive but when victory is certain it will claim it for itself and will call upon the workers to behave in an orderly fashion and it will exclude the proletariat from the fruits of victory  the rule of the bourgeois democrats from the very first will carry within it the seeds of its own destruction and its subsequent displacement by the proletariat will be made considerably easier,2023-06-20

very true,2023-06-20

what captain close to tobey’s spiderman died though,2023-06-04
but alternate42 miles didnt have a spiderman so his dad dying isnt a canon event its just something that made 42 miles turn into the prowler with i assume heavy influence from his uncle,2023-06-04
i thought it was interesting the watches said “cannon” event like it’s their own tongue in cheek way of describing the events without going too 4th wall,2023-06-03
"i get what you mean i think were also going to see gwen show that the inflection point hinges on the captain or uncle choosing to die or not gwens dad chose to stop being a cop and it appears to have saved his life not that every spiderman loses a captain but it definitely seems theres a lot more going on that the algorithm doesnt understand 

im expecting more variants of aunt may setting the world straight with infinite wisdom bc maybe thats the love miguel needs",2023-06-02
"the way i understood it is that the big issue is there are double spidermen in 1610 peter gets killed before he can go through his cannon events then miles started going through the canon events and would counteract the multiversal fragility in 42 i think the spider was meant for peter not miles we see other spiderpeople who arent peter parker in the spider corp but we dont see a single other miles morales as far as i could tell i think there are many universe without a spiderperson but if theres is a spiderperson they follow a set of canon events if those events are altered from someone  or knowledge from another universe thats when reality starts to crumble 42 got dark and messed up because there was no spiderman but its reality didnt start to unravel because there was no alteration of spidermans canon events bc there was no spiderman 

i dont know if miguels prediction system is flawed but i think the was he dealt with miles definitely was he could have done a couple things 1 just send miles back to 1610 and let his dad die tell him he did a good job helping in mumbattan and that hed give him a call when they need help with spot when miles dad is dead that universe is good and he can say hes sorry that happened there was nothing they could do",2023-06-02
"yo major update

i rewatched the movie and the scene where spot is talking about how he took the spider 42 from earth42 it shows the spider hanging directly over miles42 antimiles so im convinced that miles42 was supposed to become spiderman and maybe eventually will when the cannon is somehow fixed like the fact gwens world doesnt vanish even when miguel saves the dad from dying early but allows her to leave has to also mean something",2023-06-03

a big reason that spirited away was the ghibli movie to break through for a nomination in the first place was because disney was its distributor

the ending thing and mixed feelings on that are a fair point but otherwise i really dont see anything else coming close

i dont even see suzume getting a nomination this year your name and a silent voice didnt even get a nomination",2023-06-04
makes the most sense to give it miyazaki this year and then the next to beyond whenever it drops,2023-06-04
imo it did have an ending to gwen’s story which is how it started while also being a part 1 movie so disagree personally,2023-06-04

some yes some no this movie along with the first has a lot of charm and rewatchability so i don’t think it’ll be an issue whereas a movie like logan which is love is very somber and full of dread which makes it harder for me rewatch i think if you go into it trying to relive the feeling of watching it the first time you’re setting yourself for disappointment go at it with a blank mind and you’ll enjoy it every time,2023-06-05

i may be in the minority here but i managed to watch it 3 times over this past week i’m not crazy i swear  i just loved the first movie and was so excited for this one and loved it every time shout out to the amc membership because i wouldn’t have done it otherwise unfortunately today’s the last day it’ll be in imax where i’m at but my recommendation is sit as close to the screen as possible makes it harder to see everything in certain scenes but it really pays off for the “i feel like i’m on a ride” scenes,2023-06-08

"ill try be brief

i thought everything about it was so arbitrary and that basically nothing is accomplished in its ridiculously long runtime i love jackie chan films but if police story was three hours long id probably have a different opinion on it

i felt like none of the attention to detail from the first film has carried over for the sequels but they at least had some memorable stunts yet somehow this fourth one does more while none of it leaving any impression 

the john wick sequels have always been pushing the limits of credibility but it feels like its fully jumped the shark with a magical blind man with perfect aim magic bulletproof tuxedos and a magic pistol that reloads quicker its just  and cartoony in a way that is not endearing to me especially while its trying to be super slick and ultra cool

its not that the action scenes are weightless but its all so rehearsed that it looks like a dance and never a struggle john wick is rarely dispatching foes with creative efficiency anymore but instead often going for obtuse judo grappling and rolling them around

ive thought that the deeper and deeper into the assassin world weve gotten the more its all felt like it was made up on the spot the first film is a tight slickly choreographed revenge film and the sequels are not that at all theyre written by a stuntman and it shows

ehhhh canon event means it happens to everyone,2023-06-04
i actually think miguel caused an incursion and all this stuff about canon events is his own paranoid delusions trying to justify him instituting a twisted version of the sacred timeline hes in denial that he should have known better since he already had multiversal tech and is lashing out in an attempt to make sense of a reality that he considers cruel and unfair,2023-06-09

"in a manner of speaking but we know from how mcu time travelalt dimensions work that those universes branched off as soon as they imported into the mcu timeline

isnt uncle ben his canon event,2023-06-02
true true i just thought if the spot didnt cause his captains death another villain from that universe or a natural incident would have theyll surely get more into the nature of canon events in the next film,2023-06-02
no it was confirmed he did he also has ben’s suitcase in far from home you can quite literally see his name spelled on the top,2023-06-04
would be funny if they all just end up as prisoners at the hq after everything they been through,2023-06-03
if it is a specific person we can guess uncle ben is the main canon event that pushes him to become spiderman since we dont get the origin story its probably because it pretty much follows the raimi storyline but from what we had seen its not only uncle ben that might push a person to become a spidermanwoman such as spider gwen so i assumed it was a event where loved one dies that push the person to become a spider person what it is varying across the universes,2023-06-03
"theyre not gonna retcon it lol sony owns the rights to just a handful of characters in comparison to what disney owns if disney says their franchises main universe is named earth616 then its earth616 theyre not gonna let another studio decide what universe number their films and shows take place in 

miguel said earth199999 because in the spiderverse movies peter b already hails from earth616 even if that was changed to earth616b for this movie specifically its simply that in the spiderverse franchise and the comics the events of the mcu happen on earth199999 but that has no bearing on where disney decides to place their own franchises main universe which is earth616

also note that despite changing peter bs earth number from the first movie into 616b the other earth numbers in the film are kept the same as their comic counterparts gwens earth65 miles earth1610 miguels earth928 pavitrs earth50101 for example with no additional letters to differentiate them",2023-06-05
at this point i will just say that every universe makes their own numbers for the others so they dont necessarily line up with our numbers but they sometimes do spider verse uses our designation for the mcu but then they call miles universe 1610 which is the ultimate universe also apparently asm90 is a universe instead of just an event that happened in 616,2023-06-09
occam’s razor man it’s the same until they explicitly tell us it’s not the same,2023-06-05
why are you making it more complicated than it is,2023-08-18

iirc its in aarons flat the tv plays a quick clip of donald glover in community wearing a spider man costume its fully animated,2023-06-07
"it would take a really long time to list all of the issues but ill give three highlights

the spidey editorial team has a rule that peter can’t get married they have routinely set him and mj up and ripped them apart most recently she randomly got married to some brand new character off panel

he legitimately has not won a single fight by himself other than thugs one time this run im not joking he got his  kicked by vulture because vulture was extra angry that day and norman osborn had to save him

this week they killed off kamala khan in his boom randomly literally someone did the math and shes been in 197 of the run but they killed her off to keep peters suffering and guilt going",2023-06-02

" hard to suspend disbelief for acab when her dad was gonna arrest her in the intro too

you can believe that a thousand multiverses exist where people with spider powers act as benevolent vigilantes but you cant accept that there might be a single universe where a cop father was conflicted enough about almost arresting his own daughter as a  suspect that he might learn and grow from the experience",2023-06-11
"her dad was right to arrest her she’s literally a  suspect and he was there when she killed peter

being a bad cop would be letting her get away with literal  because she is his daughter its why he quit being a cop when he chose not to arrest her at the end",2023-06-07
imo its better for not having the same old super hero climax trope gwens arc was nearly perfect storytelling snuck into an actionoriented genre flick and was super refreshing,2023-06-02
honestly i dont see why there has to be a big final action fight a lot of the usual inner battle stuff with superheroes is that they try to live as distinct people being the hero and being the regular civilian this was the climax to an unmasked part of her character,2023-06-04
hey im late commenting but this entire movie is about breaking the spiderman super hero trope and clichés that encompasses the typical story beats,2023-06-12
yeah but usually the two main characters have similar amounts of character development and satisfactory conclusions a lot of the miles and parent drama felt a tiny bit rehashed from the last film and a little repetitive throughout this film when looking back on it the scenes with miles and his dad in the first movie were one of my most memorable cinema experiences yet they’re still not on the same page emotionally that’s not where i thought their relationship would still be even though it’s completely understandable because of the whole secret identity thing,2023-06-03

i dont know if the unstable particles came after that but is fun to imagine the high tech of the fantastic 4 became so mundane that random costumes are made with the fabric",2023-06-03
right i was wondering why was miguel glitching,2023-06-02
"i could see this miguel being a unique “out of canon” type like miles except he broke bad instead of good

the more i think about it the organization feels a lot like the tva in loki…",2023-06-03
yes its just that at that point its assumed 928 is his universe  its not made clear if it was the universe he tried to join or his original that got wiped or possibly even both,2023-06-03
im pretty sure miguel was from earth 42 and he was supposed to be bitten by the spider that bit miles and thats why hes such a  to miles,2023-06-05
nope he is supposed to be mexican unless they changed that in the movie which would make me sad personally,2023-06-04
sounds like just things happening i dont see the personal stake or character growth for miles in this anyhow how does your multiverse shenanigans relate to kang as spider verse ties to mcu,2023-06-06
"yes miles first reaction to seeing universe 42 was being horrified at the state of new york with no spiderman he feels guilty

how about spot amazing villain i think miles is gonna talk no jutsu him",2023-06-07
" turning point your uncle will die

dont quote me on this but im pretty sure miles uncle already died in the first movie",2023-06-12
i would butcher the explanation myself but animation has been filmed in imax prior to this it helps that most imax projectors are using digital film if i’m not mistaken,2023-06-02
i don’t think ours was 1911 and don’t recall black bars so you may be onto something but not sure of a way to confirm that ratio easily,2023-06-02
i yelled when i saw her very cool representation,2023-06-04
"he’s a super genius that works with machines and  knows what else and should understand changing something mid way through is going to  it up

like  try turning on your car and replace a part in your engine while it’s running and see what happens it doesn’t take an einstein to add 2 and 2 together  

plus if someone finds a genie lamp or a monkeys paw and wishes for something and it  up who are you going to blame the wish granting device  no it did it’s thing and the warning label is clear as day  it’s whoever made the wish’s fault for not thinking about exactly what they want before they say it or simply walking away",2023-06-05
i mean yeah its spelled out explicitly that at the very least gwen believes this to be the case,2023-06-02
"yeah that’s my complaint about this film too a lot of the parent drama felt a bit rehashed from the first film nothing changed between their relationships except what miles being slightly more confident as spiderman

it was starting to get a little repetitive with their back and forth especially when compared to other scenes where not much is happening either it wasn’t even remotely resolved in this film so it feels more like wasted screen time",2023-06-03
hey i mean it worked for me and no one in my audience seemed to be disinterested or yell out  ill keep it in mind for my rewatch and see how i feel i guess,2023-06-03
"he was webbed to the chair but was literally leaning against the door by the end and in the same scene he discovers his electrified powers and bursts out of the webs  could have chased his dad down  

throughout this movie he does far more speaking and standing up for himself than he did in the first one that is literally showing  not telling telling would be another character saying wow miles you sure have grown as a character look at how much you express yourself",2023-06-06
"yeah i think it boils down to the simple fact of show dont tell like you said it was surprising the writers of the first one didnt keep that same motto 

it may have been you that mentioned it but someone called back in this thread to the scene of miless dad trying to tell miles about uncle aaron so much more weight in that scene i guess no movie will ever be perfect though",2023-06-05
youre right uncle aaron and miles relationship felt strong certainly it was shown that they care for each other greatly what i dont see is how two characters having a heart to heart about how they feel about each other and being explicit is a lesser way to communicate a similar bond with similar characters,2023-06-02
"miless earth earth1610 did have a spider it bit his earths peter parker we and miles watched him die in the beginning of into the spiderverse he wasnt supposed to die

the collider that kingpin and doc ock built brought the spider from earth42 over to 1610 in one of the test earth42 doesnt have a spiderperson because of this

that anomalous spider bit miles which led to him being present at the fight that 1610 peter died in

its also why the send home machine sent miles to earth42 instead of 1610 his dna was changed by the spider bite",2023-06-03
i think it’s just ground breaking in art and style although the story isn’t original we’ve all seen some version of hey your  has to die so that the universemultiverseomniverse can live but the  art jesus… the animation the color design i have to watch this at least two more times to register everything i was seeing the camera direction yes camera direction it did a great job of never giving us uncanny valley which a lot of animated films tend to due it gave us the feel that we were watching a film and i seriously forgot at times i was watching something animated and not real because of the realistic touch of the angles things were presented in i too felt like i was in the fight as miles was fighting all of the other spider people,2023-06-05
"also and this might just be me but you are incredibly aggressive for a fun summertime movie its like watching goonies and then having a conversation with you where you flip a table 

goonies °° ",2023-06-06
bruh its led by spidergwen and will feature silk and spiderwoman,2023-06-06
how did you feel about spiderman india,2023-06-03
only 9 months thankfully assuming it doesn’t get delayed for some reason or another,2023-06-03
sorry i was still talking about the first movie it comes up a lot in the first movie but universe numberd dont come up,2023-06-12
"it really doesn’ clearly doesn’t follow that scheme 

movies can have different structures they can have different types of endings 

this one is called a cliffhanger and it’s perfect it ends at the right point where a lot of things are tied up and the door to the next movie is opened 

it was a 1010 ending",2023-06-12
well there’s evidence all other worlds crumbling after facing the same actions vs hypothesis thinking you can change this putting your world at risk to test your hypothesis is twisted,2023-06-04
"thats the thing though neither miguel nor the movie says or implies that one disruption is all thats necessary to give an eventual result of universe destruction 

in fact nothing at all even tries to quantify what is needed to eventually destroy a universe only that when you do disrupt a canon event it may eventually snowball into a universes destruction and that secondly and most importantly doing enough disruptions will destroy a universe 

i think of it this way its like repeated exposure to radiation of unknown typequantity 

everytime you take a hit of exposure you may or may not have taken a fatal dose but you keep on doing this and eventually you reach the limit of what your body can tolerate 

some bodies can tolerate an abuse the likes of which the most sadistic of nazis cant torture outothers will drop dead at the first one 

same thing with the universes maybe universe soandso has a nice big tolerance for canon events going haywire all the time but considering just how many universes there are its undoubtedly going to get to the point where you find a universe that cant even handle a single one going wrong 

miguels mission even as strict as  it may be is basically that we cant take any chancesat all",2023-06-09
found a comparison scene his reaction is also different,2023-06-15
"i agree with this opinion the most and pretty much sums up my issues with the movie as a classic spiderman fan and comic reader the 1st act was great but as soon as miles starts universe hopping it becomes no logical and becomes the easter egg movie spider verse is probably the close we are going to get to the intial interaction of ultimate miles on a large scale the gwen stuff was great and relatively close to the comic origin

this movie has the same human aspect of the characters that i enjoyed in the tasm movies this movie tries to include everyone and it just doesnt work endgame was praised when it came out because of movie hype its no different here its just the way most people enjoy media now a days im not saying the movie was bad just painfully average most people like the guy that talked about there being nothing like it is just wrong this isnt even the 1st multiverse movie on this scale its popular because spiderman name is on it this movie wants to be miles  his amazing friends instead of being like the 1st movie mainly focusing on miles the ending is playing on a group of spider people and it just doesnt work because we all know they cant all be fleshed out in 1 film the main 3 from 1 worked this does not when almost every 10 minutes its introducing new characters to the audience to what feels like to sell toys im watching spider verse for miles and to some extent gwen  peter b everyone else is extra

tldr nwh handled the multiverse stuff much better than this  because this movie wanted to do that it took away from miles  his family along with spot visuals  score can only take you so far in a few months everyone will be out of the honey moon phase because this is many 1st exposure to the spider verse  most people probably dont even know madam web but this is just as much as a spectacle as endgame following the same beats practically but id rather watch this than endgame tbh unfortunately for me this was nothing new as a spiderman fan or fiction fan in general",2023-06-05
"tf spot literally says he created spiderman by transporting the spider from 42 he explicitly states that in the film go watch it again he says it when they arrive at the broken supercollider 

are you seriously saying spot was somehow a lawabiding citizen before he became the spot he worked for the bad guys in the first film he became the spot as an unlucky consequence of his actions

your entire grasp of what is a canon event is so warped from what even miguel explains in the film there is no longrun for a canon violation it has a very visceral and noticeable impact when you change one miles universe not crumbling is a sign that miguels explanation is wrong 

and no i said they swapped destinies miles wouldve become the prowler had it not been for the spider when he first meets spiderman in the first film his spidersense changes from the prowlers purplegreen colour scheme spidermans redblue so it was either or

youre still doing it by the way still trying to headcanon a way into making miles be the villain here while criticising the directors at the same time im clearly responding to a child here so im not gonna bother wasting my time anymore",2023-06-08
"i understand infinity dont condescend to me im enjoying discussing the moral dilemma of this movie with you

i agree that infinity people dying one at a time or because the multiverse is destroyed is the same amount of dead people infinite but those are both bad scenarios and should be avoided im not supporting miles destroying a universe by saving his dad im supporting his attempt to save his dad and his universe the only party that wants to let infinity people die is miguel",2023-06-08
"yeah thats fair and i agree with that too you bring up some good points about the differences between indians and indianamericans which can be expanded into a whole total other convo about what representation looks like and how specific it should get and thats really interesting

theres a lot in miles story we can relate to as american born indians which is super cool and at the same time even if pavitrs story wouldnt be relatable if it were fleshed out i still enjoyed seeing spiderman india and mumbattan on the big screen lot to love from the movie",2023-06-02
no it doesnt,2023-06-06
even gwen’s arc was unfortunately rushed her dad goes from arresting her to hugging and accepting her in the span of two scenes,2023-06-10
you did you like the movie or not the suspense is killing me,2023-06-02
i mean tbh he’s kind of on edge when he meets miles and yells at gwen and him that because of them he’s been having to go into every universe and fix things up he blamed their kingpin collider event for disrupting the multiverse and having a whole bunch of anomalies appearing everywhere… so it seems like he’s already being tasked to jump into the infinite multiverse to keep order of things he was given this power it’s his responsibility you can see that he’s pretty stressed out,2023-06-03
"my point was that just because miles already had a canon event doesnt mean he couldnt have more as the other spidermen have had several the hole in miguels theory is likely what will be explored in the third movie that because miles is an anomaly already he doesnt adhere to the canon like other spiderman universes his universes spiderman died because of him which caused the events of the first movie since then he has already positively altered one spidermans universe and negatively altered pavs due to disrupting canon

im guessing the ending will be multiple anticanon events for a normal spiderman with gwen surviving his dad living and his universe remaining in tact but until the movie or reading a comic it may or may not follow we dont know",2023-06-06
no i dont think i will  this film could have been better if the films writers didnt make miguel into their mouthpiece about people rejecting miles  so i think ill stay at home instead and read classic 80s spiderman comics on my computer  and occasionally post more things that would upset the writers of this film,2023-06-04
noo that was penny parker from itsv the blue avatar girl was on the right of the roof next to pavitr prabhaka,2023-06-19
"my issue here is largely in the way those consequences were presented to miles specifically by a biased source who miles nor the audience have any reason to trust implicitly miguel didnt destroy a universe by saving an uncle ben he destroyed a universe by replacing someone whod already died assuming that he did destroy the universe and wasnt just at ground zero when some villain made a mistake mumbattans partial collapse could easily and most likely be the result of the multiversal sentient hole that just tore its way back into 1610 and gwens dad quit the force eliminating his canon death as a friendly cop but her universe is just fine when she leaves it granted miles doesnt know that last one but the other two alone are reason enough for him to not drink the kool aid immediately

i also dont ascribe to the idea that spidermans character is defined by loss and sacrifice to me his perseverance is his main identifying trait sometimes that manifests in his ability to push forward despite losses sure but more importantly its his refusal to ever give up or accept that he cant accomplish something  always try to save everyone even if he ultimately cant so asking miles to let his father die goes against what defines spiderman miguel is asking him to allow someone to be killed and no spiderman would ever do that

its relatively easy for the other spiderpeople to cosign this because their losses already happened believing that your failures were preordained probably goes a long way to alleviating some of the guilt they all have to carry everyday but even then they all still got to try and theyre demanding that miles justgive up which if he did do that would prove that he really wasnt meant to be a spiderman at all",2023-06-02
im not really concerned with destiny in the situation presented more so miless growth and the consequences he would be facing,2023-06-02
"im assuming then that would have been the backstory behind the earth42 miles had everything gone accordingly and so then the main miles that the spiderverse movies focus on really is an anomaly

we now have to wait a whole  year to see the conclusion of this trilogy ",2023-06-04
every spiderman thought they were chosen by chance if miles actually was that makes him more spiderman than any of them imo,2023-06-03
punk doesnt care about color you absolute twit lol,2023-06-06
"

dude gwen has a strict morals shes not selfish if she was she wouldnt be a spider person if she couldnt hand stress or manage herself 

she is always portrayed as a sweet calm professional and caring character 

and yes ive have female friends over who forgot  things after a stay or left stuff for safekeeping like keys and stuff it dosent mean anything like someone said do you think an anarchist would pick a hotel for his friend 

she considers their feeling and keeps em at bay or clears stuff up 

if its any comfort the whole movie is her avoid all meta  miguel introduced 

last thing the poor child wants is to betray miles 

the whole movie rolls like gwen  makes a friend and to an extent remains distant she only brings a dynamic shift for miles no one else  

peter is written that way in this particular context he probably felt like he wasnt doing nuff 
we also dont know if he did that to himself or if her was experimented on",2023-06-02
not a mr and thanks that makes me feel great,2023-06-05

"i think the person above meant infinity war

but this film was originally written as a single film and then when they realizes how insanely long it was presumably close to 5 hours considering this one was 2 12 they split it it was all animated as a single film as well so the second part comes out next march after they finish the last touches

when it was first advertised they even announced them as parts 1 and 2 but switched the names later to make the three names into across and beyond sound nicer when watched in the future   
this wasnt a cash grab it was literally a no one will pay to see a 5 hour feature film moment",2023-06-03

i have a theory hes going to be wolverine he doesnt banter lead move or fight like a spiderperson and his story screams way more im trying to give my loved ones death meaning which is a wolverine thing more than spidey,2023-11-05
"he’s not a “bad guy” spiderman’s entire arc is about using his power selfishly all the way back to tobey animated universe in the 90s and comics before then and suffering the long term consequences adopting the core value of “self sacrifice for the greater good” notice how all of them except the anomaly this universe’s miles agree with him on a philosophical level albeit disagreeing with how harsh he is being on miles who didn’t ask for this 

we relate to miles we’ve been over his shoulder for two films his family his struggles etc so we want him to succeed so whenever something opposes him especially an angry giant looming brute we reflexively oppose him if you listen though miguel explains as much that the problem is that if he “breaks canon” entire universes collapse and could take others with it if not the entire web it’s a risk he won’t take because he and the others are all past the point where trying to have it all has cost them it’s not that he doesn’t care about miles’ dad or the pain of the loss but that they believe it is a necessity or reality itself is at risk quite to the contrary they make it a point to show that he’s wracked with guilt and haunted by his decisions  

miles is unique in that he uses his outside the box anomalous thinking if you will approach to “you can’t have your cake and eat it too” is to “bring two cakes” will he pull it off or will he smash up both cakes like he did bringing them to the party the theme is all but spoon fed to you 

even when miguel has miles pinned to the train and he’s at his angriest he’s still just trying to stop miles when let’s be real he could have ripped him apart as easily as her tore that train up he’s not a bad guy he’s just trying to do what he thinks is the greater good rather than having a multiverse uncle ben event 

sorry for the wall of text",2023-06-04
"yup 

less buff design but definitely miguel",2023-06-08
new theory miguel is a version of miles,2023-06-15
we saw that he had to use some injection that wasnt explained maybe it gives him spiderlike abilities but cant make him a true spiderman,2023-06-15

couldnt be peter bs  even without them directly showing it wasnt by mj still being around peter b is in a version of the normal universe while miguel is from 2099,2023-06-27

theres also multiple spidertotems in a given universe look at mayday parker or spiderwoman there are even some universes where a version of black widow qualifies,2023-06-15
comic book lore thats the og comic book universe and has been the default for decades,2023-06-09
one of spiderman’s core traits is that he’s always having too much fun even in serious situations he’s had a lot of villains “escape” temporarily because he’s quipping so it makes sense to me that miles who was desperate and going 1000 would be able to get away,2023-06-03
yeah i really enjoyed the movie and that scene  just that the other guys theory didnt make any sense,2023-06-03
i think hobie might have the same power set as miles since he taught him how to use venom more effectively and was able to break through the force field,2023-06-18

take infinity war and imagine if the the movie ended right when tachalla said get this man a shield instead of the more climactic finish we ended up getting

i really respect the creative decision tho and loved the movie outside of that choice",2023-06-02

personally i would have cut everything that happened with miles and talking to his “family” at the end and saved that entire plot point for the beginning of the next film would have made the end point being the wrap up of gwen’s arc rather than the introduction of conflicts coming in the third movie would have been much more self contained of and a stronger stand alone story imo the way they ended it nicest thing i can say was entirely too messy",2023-06-04
"just watched it last night and had this exact reaction and i searched here to see if it was shared

that was exactly my thought walking out like this was good whyd you stop ,2023-07-02
thank you i dont know why everyone is either ignoring this or twisting it into a good“exciting” thing it wasn’ was a movie with no final act,2023-06-05
what is the closure or ending in this movie though,2023-06-05
" i dont know why this one is catching such a pass from everyone in existence many people here are somehow flipping it into something “exciting” that this movie has no closure or ending whatsoever

that is completely baffling indeed i think the visual style is doing the heavy lifting rightfully so but it should come at no surprise after the first one and even there i actually think they overdid it a bit with all the craziness and acid trip visuals the first one felt at the right level of over the top",2023-06-02
"not “only decent reason” just a reason

empire strikes back was also very much a part 1 type of film not sure i’d call the writers cowards for not putting those words in the title either

i don’t mind the lack of closure because every part of this movie was exciting even if it wasn’t the ending if the movie ever at any point felt like it was stalling or saving things for later i’d have an issue but so far there’s been nothing in this movie that felt like padding nothing i’d be willing to cut it did what a middle section of a trilogy is supposed to do it expanded the world deepened the characters and set the stage for a climactic final chapter",2023-06-02

they’re just trying to minimize your valid argument without any actual validity themselves to do so

its rare you see a bad director making a movie with an incredible script the studios definitely underappreciate writers but they know what to do with a good script when they see one,2023-06-06
if anything id say the opposite  it doesnt matter how good the director is if the script is trash youre not going to get a good movie  meanwhile a poorly directed film can still have a very interesting story if its wellwritten,2023-06-12

respectfully i disagree miles42 was unlikely to be spiderman peter42 most likely would have been miles1610 only became spiderman bc aaron found the subway hideout nearby his workplace at alchemax and they initially transported the spider which escaped the presence of any spiderman likely would have protected jefferson saving his life and keeping miles on a good path but at this point i think miles42 is supposed to be beyond it and has been driven by loss to become callous and for all purposes evil,2023-06-22
 okay,2023-06-05
fully agree with everything above this movie was art,2023-06-14

"the difference is miguel tried to force the universe to change for him instead of changing for the universe peter b learned a lesson on being happy that allowed him to grow

miguel refused to grow and accept be just wanted to take  theres a fundamental difference which is why i dont think peter b will have issues unlike miguel",2023-06-05
"the way i read the comment you replied to is that they the movie creators did it to spite marvel because of how much they marvel  on peter despite all fans wanting him to grow its very evident that they marvel are invested in peter misery  even though its something that we literally anybody besides marvel editors including the makers of this film who finally gave him a win all want to move past

i would think that was evident given that this version of peter actually does get to be happy with mj",2023-06-05
"i dont specifically know about that 

marvel has been more than willing on a number of characters to allow them to grow and change quite a bit the issue with spiderman is we can literally trace it to the editor joe quesada who has said his decisions were to maintain spidermans roots quesada then moved to head of marvel editorial in general

the problem is quesada feels spiderman being down and out all the time in his 20s is a core part of the character in the same way a lot of superman fans dont particularly like superman being dark or going into grey antihero territory in this case the superman fans are 100 right superman is and will always be about hope and making a positive change on the world but quesada on spiderman is wrong spiderman isnt about tragedy its about moving on and growing from the the major events in your life that shape you",2023-06-05
"yeah people are really going the “easy” route 

what miguel is saying isn’t necessarily wrong but it’s because from a certain perspective he’s given up the idea being that spiderman will always try to do “both” like pavil was going to but they typically fail and because of his particular failure having catastrophic ramifications miguel no longer even believes in trying to do both 

people are way too harsh on him which is an obvious outcome because people are gonna side with the protagonist over the character that disagreesis opposing him

miles is “ironically” remaining true to the core of spiderman because his anomalous nature has allowed him to be kept out of the “canon” of spiderman so he hasn’t become jaded to the consequences of trying to eat your cake and have it too but like someone else in the thread mentioned it’s not as easy as “just get two cakes” as we see in the beginning of the movie where miles does get two cakes and both end up ruined i would really hope they don’t make it as simple as “miles was right” and there is a more nuanced and well written answer to the conundrum presented by canon events and their consequences on the spiderverse",2023-06-10
i thought it was implied but voicing that specificity of it being self sacrifice is incredibly important,2023-06-05
that would still be a bit depressing all you other spidermen have to have tragic lives but this guy right here he can do whatever,2023-06-05
"i was pointing out two types of ways to bust a universe that were shown in the movie

miguel  a universe up via incursion yes but he also claimed that breaking a canon event will have a universe ending effect all the same which we have also seen in the what if series with dr strange",2023-06-20
"have you seen the latest dr strange its specifically stated several times in that movie that incursions destroy universes

the tva also destroyed universestimelines but via a different method unrelated to incursions",2023-06-20
i think it kind of played out in miguel’s “intro” scene where he says something along the lines of “because i’m the only one who can do it” the dude has convinced himself that his way is the only way and seems unwilling or unable to listen to any evidence or information that contradicts his worldview and position on how everything needs to go down hence the commenter that said he’s a narcissist is spot heh on it’s his way or the highway,2023-06-03
i’m guessing that miles’ universe not having a spider man means there’s no canon to break leaving him open to save whoever he can then they’ll realize that all universes without spidermen are also “open” so gwen miles spiderpunk form a team dropping in to help those worlds too hoping they somehow turn spot an he uses his portals to help them get between universes,2023-06-18
toby was never even close to george stacey and he even won when the goblin threw his girlfriend off the bridge,2023-06-09
"perhaps because it’s just history for them 

it reminds me of the doctor who audio drama ‘daughter of the gods’ in which an alternate timeline accidentally gets created when the 1st doctor and his companions are knocked off course meaning that they never showed up on the planet kembell to prevent the daleks unleashing their time destructor on the galaxy 

but after the doctor’s future self arrives to explain what’s happening the 1st doctor is unwilling to correct the timeline because he learns that katarina  one of his companions  is killed in that original timeline the 2nd doctor on the other hand  while uncomfortable with the situation  sees it as the only way because katarina’s death was some years ago from his perspective and he’s processed and accepted her passing at that point",2023-06-03
i mean i assume there are millions of spidermen who wouldnt go along with it they just didnt end up there,2023-06-05
tbf in the movie miguel says some canon events are good and some are bad not that there’s only one bad canon event plus uncle aaron was his uncle ben loss that’s in addition to the “a police chief close to spiderman dies saving a child from falling rubble” canon event in other universes it’s captain stacy for him the captain he loses happens to be his father,2023-06-09
one more days writer is widely known he was in support of the decision and didnt want peter to divorce mary jane because it would make him feel too old,2023-06-04
i was expecting them to mention that and it only really came up with gwen saying that in every universe gwen stacy falls for peter parker and it doesnt work out but they dont elaborate on it any further i assumed from the first movie her peter dying is the equivalent to gwen usually dying but this movie seems to imply it took the place of her having an uncle die im expecting them to have the gwen death scene happen in the third movie for miles but flip it on its head somehow,2023-06-04
gwens universes captain might have to die in the future but somehow gwens dad gave up being a captain so perhaps that future captain in gwens universe is bound to die yes guess well have to see,2023-06-02
they’re pretending to be longtime ben reilly fans who are upset he wasn’t done justice,2023-06-08
the way he yelled when gwen threw him in the portal sounds like a sound clip cut straight from a b99 episode,2023-06-02
i thought he sounded like spiderman noir at first then i realized it was andy samberg and then after the movie i remembered the weekend update where andy samberg did an impression of nic cage beside nic cage,2023-06-11
clone saga where he was first introduced as an actual character  basically one of the most infamous spiderman stories of all time because of how long it was random unresolved plot points thrown in constant reactions everywhere etc etc,2023-06-04
the stupidass ben reilly stuff its why i quit reading spiderman as a kid,2023-06-04
yeah that’s why i’m like this film was quality enough for this to be overlooked the “ultimate” spot was so worth his buildup,2023-06-10
i can tell you don’t have kids if you think cussing and swearing around them is no big deal pretty  and low class imo,2023-06-04
" i cant continue to open myself to people it lets them in and thats how i get hurt

thats gwens arc too",2023-06-15
"i don’t really buy that i think that anyone that could be spider man is like inherently a good egg  

also i would be careful of falling into the trap of assuming things are the same in this world that jefferson’s death wouldn’t have been something that changed aaron into being a better person as well or whether he was ever a hardened criminal in this world 

but even if this miles is a villain he’s not evil doing shady stuff certainly but i don’t think this dude is out killing people

idk i think about rio’s speech to miles about protecting that little boy and making sure he is safe and loved and never forgets who he is and then i think to the end of the movie and how miles is literally faced with a version of himself that is lost and adrift who has forgotten who he is

and i can’t imagine the movie is going to say “yeah  that evil guy” i think antihero",2023-06-09
"is there any indication that both aaron and jefferson were supposed to die

it seems like miles dad dies no matter what as his canon event",2023-06-11
it’s actually jared leto’s morbius,2023-06-03
"there’s  afoot

its just due to the nature of how miguel gets his powers in the comics he doesnt get them via a spider bite so his powersabilities are different",2023-06-03
all of miguel’s powers are from the comics though one of which is his spider bite he uses to paralyze enemies i don’t think there’s a grander motive beyond him accidentally becoming a fascist,2023-06-03
tbf spider cat has claws,2023-06-03
i’d rather him just be a pessimistic pragmatist than the real villain miles being the catalyst for him to change similar to what he is to peter b parker,2023-06-05
"i hope not its a little too cliche plus they already call him a ninja vampire spiderman so they must know about that already

id like the idea that across universes all spidermen are indeed good but carry with them the saying that the road to  is paved with good intentions with the defining characteristic is that they keep going despite it all like in dnd as well the alignment chart splits good up into lawful miguel neutral miles and chaotic hobie note that hobie didnt take a side in the fight just helped miles understand his powers more and then peaced out before the chase i think he sees the good in them both and understands theyll both stop at nothing to try to do good so when he saw the immovable force meeting the unstoppable object like shirazawa in godzilla he decided to just let them fight knowing good will prevail in some fashion",2023-06-03
i personally really hope not would make him generic and less complex than he is at the moment,2023-06-04
its certainly possible but i hope it isnt true i like the idea that hes genuinely doing what he feels is the greater good even if he is incorrectoff the deep end at this point the fact that peter b was there to see the one universe collapse definitely makes me feel that his story is real even if he misinterpreted it,2023-06-05
"that would be so much of a weaker plot 

oh no hes not a traumatised spiderman who lost his way and is truly certain his path is the only path he was just a cartoonish plain vilain being evil for the sake of being evil pretending all along ",2023-06-17
spiderman 2099 always had claws,2023-06-05
tbf it’s possibly that he tried to jump timelines between the first and second movies,2023-06-07
canon not cannon,2023-06-05
"canon isnt a red herring it is the central challenge of the movies the fate that they defy 

the canon point is only what miguel mentioned hes definitely hiding something i just dont believe him at this point which is what the whole notion of canon point is about is based on what he said",2023-06-17
"yeah similarly why doesn’t earth42 start disappearing once the radioactive spider from its universe get warped into miles’s
wouldn’t the creation of a spiderperson be a canon event",2023-06-24
kinda the point from me and others is that gwen already lost her peter which should be her canon point it shouldnt have to be losing her father as well,2023-06-07
"i did just realize that if they decide to go with canon points being real and consequential it might be that shell go to miles universe miles dad will find her and  basically beg to go with her and theyll bond and he will be her captain

if they go with canon points not being consequential that doesnt explain why mumbatten started to collapse perhaps miguel isnt as much of a well intentioned character as we are led to believe maybe he is the one destroying universes to try to make every spiderman go through tragedy aka making sure everyone has the canon points that he wants them to have something that supports this is the fact that he needs to gather spiders to bite him often which implies he isnt a real spiderman to me",2023-06-03
the keyword i think to latch onto is how canon events are based on models layla when asked when miles dad would die says something to the effect of the model says two days models are inherently based on presumed givens which could very well be misunderstood phenomena by miguel,2023-06-08
i have a feeling they have a whole bunch of spidermen there holding the spot isolated,2023-06-03
"as a character he completes his arc of not being willing to open up to his parents but obviously fails because of the ending not sure about spoilers i can write here

but he does absolutely complete his arc of wanting to follow and looking up to all the other spiderpeople to turning on them and being proud that he beat them all 

this definitely isnt a complete story but as a film i think it can stand alone for both miles and gwens arcs",2023-06-05
ahh i see so that pylon thingy keeps the universe in place i assume so as long as you can take care of the universe by putting the pylon and keeping it in check it will be just fine even if you change a canon event,2023-06-08
not sure that’s the case,2023-06-08
i didn’t like the first one but thought the second one was hilarious,2023-06-07
when was this i was looking so hard for both of them,2023-06-04
he was giving me bill cipher vibes  goofy voice overwhelming power sinister motivations,2023-06-03
exactly how i feel,2023-06-05
it seems to me like arad is a fan of the source material but is also just not a great producer in that he just keeps meddling in the films,2023-06-05
he was the one who  up venom in sm3 and got in raimi’s way iirc so he’s done a lot of damage overall,2023-06-02
hes been a producer on the spiderman movies since the first trilogy hes allegedly responsible for some of the most frustrating elements of these movies such as venom in ts3 and the amazing spiderman 2 being a setup movie for the sinister six,2023-06-03
you cant convince me otherwise avi,2023-06-02
and these portals arent color coded so its hard to keep track of which one leads to which,2023-06-16
there was a sequence where miles got stuck in spot for a few seconds wasnt there if spot was in full control of this powers and ruthless there he had an opening there,2023-06-28
naw he already demonstrated he can sense the attack pattern he got used to it just pull or bait him out,2023-06-05
i cant understand what theyre trying to say,2023-06-04
they think spot not weak gag d rank villain when he is in comics,2023-06-03
shimazaki won in the end besides mob,2023-06-03
yeah miles1610 basically stole miles42s destiny which miles42 might wind up holding against him,2023-06-03
theres a billboard above the spots apartment when gwen and miles are investigating it its an ad for a movie called all of it always all over the place the ad even has a bagel on it,2023-06-14
you noticed in his original benign form he looks like a googly eye or a cow or a dalmatian but in his apocalyptic form his colors invert to be the everything bagel,2023-06-04
but then everybody who saw this and didnt know would have to do that instead of just having one person comment the meaning of an abbreviation that almost nobody uses,2023-06-11
right it’s literally the first result in google,2023-06-04

someone just replied back to me somewhere else saying that they are the jordan 1 high og stash and yep it checks out,2023-06-03
i thought so too but ive been comparing them to real pictures of 5s and it just doesnt match up but it really does look like it,2023-06-02
but you didnt say it negatively affected your viewing in the previous comment i thought you were saying in a roundabout way im the  for not noticing it thru out the movie im not arguing anyway it was a wonderful film and i want to watch it again to catch everything in the background i didnt get to see in the first viewing,2023-06-02
"any good twist will feel obvious in hindsight you do that by putting narrative clues in ahead of time that people are likely to overlook at first glance but gain significance once you know the twist

but someone is bound to notice the clues even if most people don’t there’s no real way around that other than not putting any hints in but a twist that isn’t set up at all is a cheap twist so you really shouldn’t go that route for the sake of guaranteeing a surprise",2023-06-07

i do remember the 5 seasons and dvd movies being talked about but i feel like i read that they weren’t going to do gwen’s death endgame was peter and mj getting married but i could be misremembering all of this as well,2023-06-07
"oh yeah and we have to remember that this was a few years before asm and just shortly after tobey maguire spiderman so to show an accurate gwen stacy portrayal was actually new and showing mj as a flirty friend who was not interested in peter at all was a fresh take i loved it so much 

but i do think that gwens arc in spectacular spiderman was leading up to her tragic loss she was so pure and was going from side character to more prominent glowup character and mj was close to her   she probably wasnt going to make it",2023-06-20
"no but since youre clearly too proud to admit that you dont get it ill help you out

if you cant understand why its messed up that this legion of spiderpeople forcing other spiderpeople to go through tragedy then no wonder you misunderstood the movie

part of the job is that they cant save everyone no one is arguing that but these spiderpeople dont even try and have resolved themselves to let people die thats miles issue thats why before he teleports he says were supposed to be the good guys

does that help ya",2023-06-07
that’s exactly how it happened for me too it must be a canon event,2023-06-09
so reading wikipedia he would have died in sm4 but he didn’t haha because that movie didn’t exist,2023-06-04
but wasnt it established in the movie that there are canon events in every spider man universe that when disrupted cause the universe to become undone,2023-07-12
me too,2023-06-06
he was when they introduce a video game enemy hes right behind saying something like did anyone talk about me,2023-06-08

"miles1610 is the anomaly not the general idea of a miles morales spiderman its implied he stole the destiny of miles42 and thats why jefferson42 died and earth42 is a dystopia

"prowler could have just been randomly transported like how mcu’s vulture got transported into the venomverse kinda out of nowhere

though i’m not sure if 1610 miles is the only miles that becomes spiderman because we clearly see insomniac’s spiderman and miles is a huge part of his story i think they just meant that he’s the first one to be bit by another dimension’s spider",2023-06-03

you should have kept this one to yourself,2023-07-12
"there is

edge of the spiderverse 15 for her origin story

she also appears in the original spiderverse event

after spiderverse she starts branching off on her own

there’s a 5issue spidergwen miniseries followed by an ongoing series that lasts 34 issues

following that is another spidercrossover spidergheddon

then gwen continues into a new spidergwen ghost spider series which lasts for 10 issues

that series ended in 2020 just off a quick search i don’t know if she’s had any further adventures since then but this should be plenty to get you started on her

edit there is also the more recent spidergwen gwenverse miniseries from last year i think that’s the latest thing with her",2023-06-03
to call it a mess compared to 616 is laughable,2023-06-04
ah yes 616 clone saga holds up so well,2023-06-04
for 23rds of the tobey maguire trilogy hes out of high school as an adult in half of the andrew garfield movies hes also an adult in the 90s animated series the most popular cartoon hes in college already and has a career at the daily bugle the most popular spider man game of all time has peter as an adult out of college in the middle of his career as scientist most of peters most popular renditions are him as a young adult i think its disingenuous to say that media focuses on younger peter,2023-06-10
donald glover stand up bit about that whole uproar about spiderman,2023-08-10
sure i think theyll do a great job telling a complex story i think its still a very clear indictment of the modern spiderman problem which is wellknown among pretty much all comic fans which lord and miller clearly are,2023-06-02
that fact that they show him juicing secretly and talking about how hes different from all the rest i thought was a clear enough sign that its not even a heel turn hes a tweener at best right now haha,2023-06-02
i certainly hope not 2099 is my favorite spiderman ,2023-06-03
"but the universe wasnt destroyed it still exists

dreads are not permanent not sure who told you this,2023-06-04
braids was the word i was looking for,2023-06-02
reminded me of the boondocks kid,2023-06-02
also her eyes are green in earth 42 if you didnt catch the stuff with the machine,2023-06-03
i figured she was playing dumb to tell him it was okay with her for a second,2023-06-02
i thought it was gonna be a reveal that miguel time traveled back and erased the spider yes i know thats  but even though i caught the earth 42 thing i still thought that,2023-06-02
when i rewatched the whole film again i saw the braided miles in black and white in spots flashback regarding the spider i gasped that miles42 was there for a brief moment early in the film,2023-06-02
oh shoot i didnt notice rio commented tha hair change i thought only aaron did,2023-06-02
same,2023-06-02
"i fell for it till the actual reveal of his dad graffiti on the wall had completely forgot what number our miles was from i was shook

jaw dropped couldn’t breathe for a second",2023-06-02

part 2’s scheduled for march 2024 they worked on the simultaneously,2023-06-11
" wow i really loved that this movie had no ending

the movie has an ending though it just also has more story to tell",2023-06-02
"yes im left feeling so unsatisfied that they just stopped halfway through the movie i was enjoying it all basking in the glorious animation and heart touching character moments yet they pull a deathly hallows pt 1pt2 i went in expecting a whole story start to finish they delivered that the first time around and that was what i was expecting 

having to wait two years for the other half of the movie is just so  frustrating and i feel bamboozled into giving something i love my time and attention that shouldnt be the case 

so damned unsatisfied right now after leaving the theater its a feeling that wont leave me and i dont expect it to until in another couple years when we get the finale look im hyped af for the conclusion but stringing that hype for an additional year or two when the expectation was a complete story idk man i may have waited for the third movie to come out rather than being left with this hollow feeling of  thats it for however long itll be",2023-06-04
"in my experience nobody ever really “likes” a cliffhanger ending

i liked it many might not but they arent objectively bad you subjectively didnt like it there is literally no objective good or bad here 

the ending was  awesome closed the gwens father story had miles try to end his story with his parents but realize hes in the wrong universe and opened up the story for the next movie i dont agree with calling it rushed either the entire earth42 part was perfectly built",2023-06-17
this dude loves edging,2023-06-03
nah cause infinity war had that climax and it was a “oh  we lost moment” this was like of the credit rolled right when tachalla says “get this man a shield”,2023-06-02
"at least some people here have the common sense to know this i’ve been berated by multiple people for not knowing this was a “part 1” because i didn’t go out of my way to look for the information before going to see the film

in case anyone here is still confused following news of a movie religiously before it ever comes out is not something the vast majority of moviegoers do if you like to that’s nice and i’m happy for you but treating it like an expectation is asinine",2023-06-02
which is funny because infinity war was also initially revealed as part 1  2 before they changed it prerelease to just be infinity war and witheld the title of the sequel until later,2023-06-03
tell it to ‘em,2023-06-03
amen its strange how people mention those movies in the same breath when this clearly doesnt conclude anything,2023-06-02
"this movie has 2 resolutions with one or arguably 2 or 3 not resolved 

gwen with her dad miles with his parents decision to tell the truth completed two story points and 23 were left opened 

went into this completely blind couldnt figure if they could wrap this up in time then realized they couldnt right about the time when planet 42 was revealed and gasped but still hung on to the possibility that it would all wrapped up to the end",2023-06-03
across had gwen reconcile with her father miles go on a journey of self discovery seeking what he thought he wants seeing the reality and attempting to find his way back this is not at all dissimilar to esb,2023-06-04
i’m not arguing that fast x is wellwritten i’m pointing out that audiences don’t get angry about these things that movie’s still making a  ton of money despite the surprise megacliffhanger,2023-06-04
youre in the minority bud take the l and save your energy,2023-06-02
i think the weakness of this movie was miles as a character i love him but he is always defined by how he is different from peter and other spiderpeople to lesser extents this ending felt like such incredible closure for his character as he is no longer defined by others and expectations but is making decisions for himself is so powerful and i finally felt like i understood miles as a character i do with it was a little more complete but they did so much right that i can easily move past the cliffhanger even long after the hype fades,2023-06-06
"
this movie feels like they took movie 2 of a trilogy decided they didn’t have 2 more self contained stories to tell and figured they would just split one story into 2 movies instead

that actually is what happened apparently  when this film was annouced intially with part 1 they said their reasoning was what they were writing got too long",2023-06-04
yeah im inclined to agree i guess im more arguing most movie goers are used to this than if it was a good idea or not and again the 3rd movie is as of now a year away so it wont be standing alone for too long,2023-06-03
"they have reason and they’ve communicated it clearly 

at some point you just have to stop with the handholding",2023-06-02
it played before no way home,2023-06-02
"a venomsymbiote spiderverse story would be pretty cool if they continue miles movies after the next one

maybe the symbiote can coordinate across multiverses as a hivemind and tries to take over multiple spidermen simultaneously",2023-06-04
judging from the multidimensional megacity of every kind of spider person full of sci fi super tech im thinking theres a through line of science genius in the spider myth miles is trying to get into that advanced physics program after all,2023-06-03
spyderbyte is literally projecting herself across realities while munching on doritos and youre saying only parker smrat,2023-06-03
its a different dimension hobie is bound to turn out better anyway in fact he was the original prowler before aaron davis,2023-06-03
"the 616 hobbie brown the prowler is a brilliant inventor who make his own tech started as villain but redeemed himself and became ally of spiderman

maybe you got mixed up with max dillon electro",2023-06-03
well he did build all of the prowler tech in the 616 comics he was the original prowler,2023-08-13
weak,2023-06-11
ooh that could also explain why he joined in the first place he just needed to figure out how the watched worked so he could replicate it,2023-06-04
theres a more practical reason illustrated in the movie gwens watch was disabled remotely by miguel when she got go homed avoiding tracers is a side benefit,2023-06-05
we saw that peter was unaware that there was a tracker in it when he and miles were hiding in the mechanical area so hed be right to be suspicious,2023-06-05
there was a backdoor tracking function they used it in peter b parkers watch to find miles during the chase sequence,2023-06-12
"still wondering if thats a shoutout to tom wilton
",2023-06-19
but whats with the tooth brush and cardigans just a bad habit,2023-06-02
"she says she never really made a friend besides miles other than crashing at his place sometimes theres no implication of there being anything between them and she explicitly has feelings for miles but doesnt hesitate to introduce them etc

thats what came to my mind as well 

like if she was with hobie it wouldnt make sense for her to lean on miles and pursue but the jokes had me confused 

i think shes keeping a friendship a close one where she keeps an emotional clearance or maybe cool boi hobie is ",2023-06-02
wasnt the never made a friend besides miles thing before she met hobie,2023-06-02
yeah hobie was pretty much just johnny rotten and i am here for it,2023-06-15
you are trapped in my dense musculature  i was probably the loudest in my theater,2023-06-05
the next movie is beyond the spider verse in 2024,2023-06-02
all things considered its not that bad but i need it yesterday lol,2023-06-02
no problem,2023-06-02
not anymore she said she’d be right back,2023-06-02
mona lisa by dominic fike,2023-06-06

my girlfriend in high school had 2 sisters and they would steal my clothes from her so she would steal more had a whole  womans soccer team walking around in my hoodies,2023-06-15
yeah but pavitr seems to be a fan of romance and shipping when miles and gwen are together he gets giddy over their tension and the whole willthey won’t they without even knowing them for long so pavitr could just be exaggerating gwen and hobie being a thing he just seems to like to theorize romance regardless of what’s actually going on,2023-06-15
aren’t they all also 15,2023-06-04
my read on it is that gwen has an enormous crush on hobie who just thinks its adorable and ignores it in order to play a big brother role for her,2023-09-24
crazy how you hit dislike for that,2023-06-03
in the comics this hobie was homeless before he got bitten by the spider so its not like youre that far off,2023-06-08
"hobie is smart enough to know that shes still hung up on miles and that messing with that is only gonna lead to drama he doesnt have time for

if you rewatch it you can actually tell hes been planning to undermine the society and free gwen and miles from the beginning",2023-06-03
also gwen is the same age as miles a teenager in high school and spider punk is a grown  adult,2023-06-04
this sounds like miles rationalising things for his sanity,2023-06-11
twice it got him out of the cage to begin with and then again in the fight,2023-06-04
i love how they both just instantly love each other lol i dont think miles could hate spider punk even if he tried,2023-06-04
im glad that there was no romance between miles and gwen,2023-06-15
i feel like the superficial part is the spidey humor coming through he believes but he also can use that to take a laugh,2023-06-05
great movie,2023-06-12
yes people talk about his quips and try to use them as evidence that hes inconsistent in his ideology but if you look at his actions he very much practices what he preaches i mean theres a strong possibility that his canon police chief death was him killing the chief since people have picked up that he wears blue shoelaces and that is apparently code in punk subculture that that person has killed a cop i feel like thats a level of detail that has to come from someone who is deep in punk culture,2023-06-21

"actually it was working out quite well in spain until fascists invaded and the us and uk refused to help thinking that a fascist spain might be good for business

also anarchy isnt just one ideology theres a ton of different schools of thought that all have disagreements only thing they agree on is that anarchocapitalists arent real anarchists and are trying to steal the word to seem cool just like they did with the term libertarian

and finally can you guess who that antifa violence was targeted towards because if you have even a decent grasp of the history of fascism you know it is entirely warranted",2023-06-02
oh no not property damage,2023-06-03
"any ideology coming into power wouldnt be peaceful dude the civil rights movement wasnt all nonviolence change doesnt just happen with mlk you need malcolm xs too 

its like people forget that in order to live the way we do people died for it listen im no anarchist but i think a ton of people can understand the  the establishment angle of anarchy considering where our world is at also lamenting property damage makes me think you really dont have your priorities straight my spidey sense is telling me you probably said that about the george floyd protests too

also linking antifa which arent all anarchists there are tons of ideologies present there is completely disingenuous antifascism isnt just the realm of anarchists communists absolutely despise fascists too not to mention they helped many citizens in charlottesville when those dudes with torches were chanting hate i get the feeling youre on a bad path",2023-06-04
goofy downvoting over different opinions,2023-06-03
i loved how they wove the classic punk style in everything associated with himeven hobie himself was cut out of newspaper in some scenes,2023-06-05
"he also lays the foundation for the watch he gives gwen by telling miles to just make his own watch

there was a lot of subtle touches in this bombastic movie",2023-06-09
bro probably thinks ancaps are real anarchists,2023-06-18
"which also explains why he’s looking out for miles beyond just “ the system”

gwen cares about miles and he cares about her so he cares about miles’ wellbeing",2023-06-06
i think miguel would have let him attempt it if he didnt stop a different canon event from happening,2023-06-14
what about the norman conquest,2023-06-03
im not saying that spiderman 2099 as a concept doesnt exist or that astv miguel isnt based on him but that its a misdirect something like the real spiderman miguel was the one who died and current miguel is juicing on some  and tech after figuring out a way to universe hop through technology ala alchemax to find a replacement for his family as kingpin was,2023-06-02
nah he do have fangs and claws in the comics as well and not an inheritors,2023-06-03
miguel was a drug addict that tried to genetically clean himself up and got his dna merged with a spider thus the fangs and claws i think it was more of an audience relation joke since 2099 doesnt have any of the normal spiderman powers,2023-06-04
thats probably how the next movie will handle it the writers are very clearly setting up miles and gwen to end up together and i think gwen said something like “it’s no what you think” when miles was asking her about hobie,2023-06-04
i know im late on the reply but this is a  awesome and healthy approach to these feelings good on you,2023-06-15
"wym

besides gwen didnt have a home to go back to and shes also his drummer band member",2023-06-29
at war with them but works for them he gives himself his powers to counteract an addictive drug his boss doses him with then uses those powers for a mix of crimefighting and iirc light to moderate revenge meanwhile alchemax wants to either dissect him to figure out how to make more of him recruit him as a corporate raider or both,2023-06-08
is he i haven’t read any of the comics,2023-06-08
ah thank you i think the original commenter just meant that spiderpunk had a  partner as in he worked with someone  because i couldnt find anything particularly explicit about it either but i guess thats what headcanons are for lol,2023-06-07
i wonder if beyond will address the spider at all and reveal that someone purposefully sent it after miles in earth42,2023-07-10
redditors are incapable of not sounding kinda smug,2023-06-07
i got the cancel culture reference but dont get why miles had to apologize over baby powder,2023-06-02
"haha i thought that was interesting because i always hear “i didn’t have a scooby” 

but in the movie they said i don’t have a scooby doo probably to make it clearer to an american audience",2023-06-03
i watched in inox with subs,2023-06-03
i actually think he is a villain theres a whole third movie left i 100 think theyre going to focus on the concepts they introduced late into this movie universe 42 and the fall out from miles 1610 getting powers instead of that variant,2023-06-09
we’re meant to fill in the timeline because captain stacy didn’t die before the end of spectacular spiderman either,2023-06-04
the watches said canon,2023-06-04
you make a very good point on aunt mays being basically nonpresent in the film aside from cutawayflashback scenes theyll absolutely capitalise on her plural lol in part 2,2023-06-02
we may still see gwens world have problems when her dad doesnt die the time hasnt come yet or he dies anyway because he tried to save a kid without being a cop,2023-06-04
i guess she technically lost a captain but hes not dead just not a captain,2023-06-13
"youre onto something for sure

 we see other spiderpeople who arent peter parker in the spider corp but we dont see a single other miles morales as far as i could tell

this called my attention too i noticed they always talked about other local spiders but never specifically about peter parker peter is the most consistent individual to become spiderman but others will do the trick

  i dont know if miguels prediction system is flawed but i think the was he dealt with miles definitely was

definitely he likes to think hes the most levelheaded of the spiders but hes the most unstable and emotionally compromised hes unable to deal with miles maturely because hes projecting all his selfhatred on him he thinks miles will doom trillions of lives because he did he thinks miles will be selfish because he was and he thinks miles is fundamentally a mistake because he was the original mistake stellar character work",2023-06-02
now u got me thinking about how there are miles morales in some of the spider society spiderpeople’s world like in ps4 spiderman and his miles morales in their respective games and story,2023-06-03
are you listening to the musical cues are you looking  the colors also he literally is in the prowler costume lol wut,2023-08-29
restraint seems pretty difficult to use though,2023-06-03
"keep in mind that i absolutely loved across the spiderverse when i say this but miyazaki ain’t like other anime directors he’s regarded  as one the great artists currently living in any medium but especially in animation 

also he’s now in his 80s and this movie took about seven years to make so it’s’ probably most likely his last feature film",2023-06-04
that sounds like you want to give an oscar to miyazakis movie which you havent seen because of miyazaki rather than the movie and then give beyond which you havent seen an oscar because of across how about we wait and judge movies based on their own merit when theyre actually out if across deserves an oscar it should win regardless of this being miyazakis last chance to get one we dont know yet if his movie will be a contender,2023-06-06
i don’t disagree about gwen she gets a complete arc but the ending still feels intentionally unsatisfying because no one else does,2023-06-04
thats not true at all id easily rank him in the top ten most wellknown directors in the public eye,2023-06-09
yea probably right but i fully believe that the mario movie doesnt even come close to this one in terms of animation its absolutely beautiful no doubt but this movies animation is just so varied and beautiful and interesting to look at and i feel like its slight more complicated as well these are all things that imo should be considered when selecting,2023-06-02
"those were actually both movies that were dubbed and distributed by pixardisney thats almost certainly the only reason they broke through for a nomination while other movies that also got a lot of buzz your name a silent voice and slightly smaller features like weathering with you and even other ghibli movies didnt

the spirited away bluray has a huge disney presents logo on it",2023-06-04
what’s wrong inside out taking the statue or my snide comment about the academy in general,2023-06-03
"you literally stole these words from my brain when i was reading through these comments across the spiderverse is so adventurous fun and has some mindblowing ideas that make the rewatch easy i’ve rewatched it three times now 

logan on the other hand is a beautiful movie but  did the depressing aspects of it make me dread the rewatch still the rewatch was amazing but definitely tugged heart strings again",2023-06-15
i have a screen in my house cant wait to check out out again in a couple months,2023-06-08
so nobody important,2023-06-11
it’s kinda understandable sometimes even itt this was an excellent movie but people are saying it’s gonna win best picture or that it’s a lock for some other award and these types of people usually aren’t watching the other movies that get best picture noms my brother is like this and then complain when a superhero movie doesn’t win,2023-06-02
thats not what he said,2023-06-02
 dude,2023-06-02
why are we pretending that scorsese only makes slow artsy dramas you do know his biggest movie is goodfellas right,2023-06-03
this was half a wannabe family drama and a  copycat no way home calling it cinema is disgraceful,2023-06-03
this was the post credits scene we deserved in nwh,2023-06-16
"i could see tony filling the police captain role in peters story but thats a stretch

specifically tony heads the avengers which are a kind of world police again its a stretch",2023-06-04
well yeah every spider loses someone akin to tonys status but the result of that is huge for the mcu,2023-06-04
i wonder why they didnt call it nexus events,2023-06-06
hes young theres still time for him to lose more people that will fulfill canon events,2023-06-05
"two conflicting points to consider while theorizing

1 we saw pavitr prabhakars universe starting to collapse after miles broke the canon event there so theres some truth to the importance of canon events unless we have another explanation for what needed to be contained in that scene

2 in contrast gwens universe seems fine despite the event being seemingly averted in her universe her dad quit the force and is no longer a police captain unless another captain shes close to dies who or her dad somehow still qualifies for the canon her universe has broken that canon event seemingly without consequence

quite the conundrum of evidence to piece together",2023-06-10
those are the good disruptions ,2023-06-08
it shows that spidermen go through multiple canon events,2023-06-02
pretty sure it’s just initials on the briefcase but iirc yes ben got a spoken namedrop at one point,2023-06-19
makes sense,2023-06-03
it makes a ton more sense for every universe to just have their own numbers for what each universe is why would earth 838 call earth 199999 earth 199999 instead of earth 616 its not like earth 199999 calls itself either of those numbers,2023-08-18
im not,2023-08-18
 confuses me tbh but nwh loki and multiverse of madness was dealing with the multiverse stuff though different dimensions not timelines and the thanos stuff is different timelines,2023-06-04
these universes have constants the cop always seems like a hard ,2023-06-11
it didn’t feel that way though especially when following miles and his own twist about being in the wrong universe and meeting his other self i think the last we should have seen miles was when he disappeared to earth42 have the last part of the film be gwen and her story last shot being her own team behind her ready to help miles leave the twist for later would’ve been a badass way to start the next movie,2023-06-04
"this is a 2part movie not episodic 

also what you reference  in boots as a good movie but the entire shrek series is just nonstop lampooning of fairy tales aka drawing on preexisting characters 

and again not only is it not remotely episodic but where is gods name are you getting the idea that its anime",2023-06-02
yeah this movie had the same vibe as nwh and loki in the way that they all are basically “maintain status quo” vs “have free will”,2023-06-05
the timeline thing he shows miles also looks exactly like the one behind hewhoremains in loki the spidercorps is essentially another tva,2023-06-15
he was pretty upset that the console scanner was trying to scan him to determine his homeworld so you guys could be on to something here,2023-06-09
"its not just things happening spot is a threat to the multiverse in similar ways wanda and ultron a whatif are madam web working to make sure timelines stay in tact while making sure spidermen hit the right inflection points lines up perfectly with kang and helps makes some sense as to why the tva never got involved with miles but more so why miguel took up a personal mission to keep timeliness in tact miguel is a  to madam web as much as  morbius loki morbius is to kang

theres plenty of growth for miles but what makes miles growth so important is that he inspires the other spidermen to do better peter b takes a whole conversation mid fight to tell miles this in both movies",2023-06-06
yeah i meant his pops,2023-06-13
thanks for sharing the article is the experience that much better compared to normal cinema planning on going for imax when oppenheimer drops,2023-06-02
her name is sunspider and she has ehlers danlos syndrome ,2023-06-08
i dont think those types of conversations are inherently bad but as far as a script perspective goes having too many of them just slows the movie down the focus should be gwen and her dad having that drama miless thing this movie is being an anomaly his growing up is the first movie,2023-06-06
into the spider verse is pretty much perfect,2023-06-12
i think it just slows things down to have a conversation like that multiple times its fun to see two characters enjoy their time together like gwen and miles swinging around town in this one rather than having to verbally confirm it like miles and his mom havent really done anything together shes a one dimensional mom character so it feels like a missed opportunity to not explore that some more shes a big part of this movie but just a talking head,2023-06-02
jessica drew film with gwen as a colead,2023-06-06
hes cool not enough screentime though im sure  get more in part 2,2023-06-04
we havent really seen a dimension that crumbled due to action by their own spiderman though only dimensions crumbling due to the action of travelling spidermen miguel entering another universe miles in pavitrs universe if anything the fact that other spidermen have entered miles universe in an effort to stop him from trying is in itself a catalyst for the universe being destroyed if miles is an anomaly isnt his fate also an anomaly maybe hes destined to save his captain and miguel is the person who risks jeopardizing that,2023-06-05
very nice  now lets see the part about saving his father,2023-06-05
"tbh strong disagree the movie focuses very heavily on the personal relationships of miles and gwen gwens arc is almost exclusively driven by this and miles arc isnt i have to save the multiverse his arc is i have to save my dad

as far as the ending the ending wraps up with 2 main notes gwen reconciling with her father and miles seeing uncle aaron again followed by a version of himself who lost his father its completely rooted in and driven by the grounded interpersonal relationships not some cosmic thing the way endgame was

i certainly am not going to tell anyone they are wrong not to like the movie art is subjective but i do think that the complaint that the movie doesnt invest in miles and his relationships enough is straightup wrong they drive everything he does and everything that happens and they remain the main stakes throughout the film shifting first from his relationship with gwen as the main stake to the life of his father",2023-06-05
"i understand infinity 

im sorry but you really dont actually and again youve demonstrated it now just right here 

it wouldnt matter if they die at once or die all at the same time once youve reached infinity details like that arent even details theyre noningredients into whatever it is that you were pondering 

also thats just the problem with miles hes at a fork in the road and its either choose one or choose the other but you cant have both 

this is exactly why people like you need to stop being coddled either by hollywood or the people in your life bc you evidently dont realize that sometimes theres no good way out of things and all solutions actually kinda  and theres going to be some amount of sacrifice or pain regardless of what you do you just have to determine which one was do the least damage and give the most good in return meanwhile a small child like miles is too immature and childish to realize this very simple truth and instead him and apparently members of audience like you just keep on thinking that theres still a way to get out of this with no losses whatsoever as if you can somehow think of some clever and smart solution that totally nobody else has ever tried before that will give a perfectly happy ending like the fairy tales",2023-06-09

"yeah is honestly a good conflict because both sides are technically in the right while miguel seems to be forcing himself to continue his endeavors through he seems to know they are in the morally shady side while also in the pragmatically correct side because objectively one life for an entire universe is an easy call 

while miles is correct because who would let someone you love die when you can stop it",2023-06-03

"i like that those consequences were presented to miles by a biased source  in the case of miguel his decision making is both emotional and logical  lylas provided a model the logic to miguel of how the this multiverse operates and miguels experience and failures the emotion substantiates that understanding of the multiverse  so yeah he is biased but thats real  were surrounded almost entirely by biased sources of information  miles working off of real but incomplete information is real and important

i agree with regards to always trying for spiderman  but that effort and perseverance is only meaningful in the face of failure and having failed  with regards to gwen i already wrote in my initial post that shes implied to have already understood and accepted the necessity of her dads death  her realization later in the film that he avoided inevitable death doesnt diminish her strength in character to push through that sacrifice and still try to do the right thing

i understand that youre empathizing deeply with miless feelings and decision making and it feels like youre reacting to my post as if im saying miles is doing the wrong thing  thats not my position nor my point  my point is that miles the character is given a moral dilemma that is very meaningful and important to think about its one thats pretty fundamental to how weve engaged with the idea of spiderman for decades  itd just be a shame to make everything work out without lasting consequences regardless of which moral position the filmmakers and writers decide to take",2023-06-03
"i just dont see it

in that situation miles functionally has no real choice the decision is such a foregone conclusion that even miguel knows its a non starter

hello miles you have never met me or the vast majority of my compatriots but you have to allow your father to die because the world might end otherwise

might you arent sure

well no but im likepretty sure i mean i did it once

so i should allow my father to be killed because you think it could be a bad thing

uhyes",2023-06-03
youre not but his circumstances clearly weigh on him hence the speech to his mom at the end,2023-06-03
"umm relax please she is a little bit at least in my opinion dont get me wrong she definitely has all the values of all the other spiderman and respects the job

but im guessing youve only seen the movie once there are tells in my opinion for instance at the start of the film she plays the drums on her own the rest of the band tries to reason with her and lets her know she is not making any effort to meet her half way and as soon as she gets to the beginning of the conversation she leaves instantly and rudely

miles parents are very sceptical of her now that can just mean they would do that to every girl but my guess is that might not be the case

when miles swings through the city he often has fun light hearted conversations with the people gwen not only doesnt talk to anyone but she uses her webs on civilians try to think of a time miles ever webs a civilian

her choice to see miles knowing that the meeting could mess up the multiverse is selfish as is leaving him out of the loop which leads to the canon problem

she waits for other characters to approach or make the first move and when she has made a clear mistake she gets defensive in contrast to miles who faces his problems head on and often is the character to start conversations with others

i get she is a teenager but selfishness is selfishness  no she doesnt want to betray milesjesus when did i ever say this but she obviously does when only taking into consideration how she feels

i was mostly agreeing with you in the previous post the only thing i was looking for clarification was on the beta rolling of peter",2023-06-02

woah i didn’t realize the symbolize with the cakes although they did say at one point of the film “you can’t have your cake and eat it too” so ,2023-06-04
that’s something i loved about this movie miguel is hardcore but he’s not a bad guy or even wrong he’s trying to save miles’ universe miles clearly thinks there’s a way to save his dad and his universe we’ll see who’s right but neither side of that argument is villainous,2023-06-05
"miguel is also hiding something something big hes lied to miles directly twice already

first he called miles the original anomaly thats a baldfaced lie given that his own backstory he replaced himself from another universe miguel is the original anomaly and he knows it

second he said he knows for a fact that messing with canon events will always cause the universe to fall apart  he also knows this is not true because miles exists and both his universe and earth42 also still exist and both seem to be completely stable as well pavitrs universe seems to have not fallen apart given hes in the band at the end yes that is from the intervention of the other spiders but it proves that even an instability is fixable

i speculate that miguel had a bigger hand in the collapse of the universe he took over than he lets on and hes projecting his own failings onto miles",2023-06-12

"yeah i had been expecting miguel to be a straightforward villain but when he was explaining canon events and the impact disrupting them can have all i could think was you know i can understand where hes coming from when miles was fighting all of the other spiderbeings i thought that with a little bit of reframing he could easily be the villain he turns away from his friends and is willing to sacrifice a universe for personal reasons when he talks to his mom in earth 42 and starts going on about how he beat all of them and is more powerful than any of them i really felt like he was channeling villain energy

needless to say im definitely excited to see where they take all of the characters",2023-06-19

i think he means in universe so like 616 is the default for us cuz its the one weve been reading since we were children but if you actually exist in the story and are from another universe it wouldnt have the same importance to you,2023-06-20

"lol if donald glover never did his whole “glover for spiderman campaign” then bendis is on record as saying miles would never have even existed

it’s the entire reason the character and all his comics runs exist

i’ll repeat that the reason miles morales exists is because it’s based off donald glover’s wish to play spiderman and that’s a chief reason he was cast as the mcus prowler

showing him and miles staring at each other isn’t just a sweet moment it totally works as foreshadowing that a miles can be a prowler somewhere in the multiverse  and even if it was initially accidental i’m sure this wasn’t lost on the filmmakers by the time they got to shooting and animating",2023-06-06
it’s also very plausible that they wanted to pay homage to the person that inspired the creation of miles morales while also foreshadowing a future event like sam jackson as nick fury,2023-06-05

also a dolby but i sounded like only the front speakers were working

definitely not lazy just surprising,2023-06-03
what did infinity war resolve that was also intended on being a part 1 as well but they changed it its got an ending but still needed a second part to finish what happened they could have put a to be continued but that was implied i do feel they could have done a similar thing to infinity were it ends with them all having failed a similar ending could have been done and ended it a bit earlier when we find out the universe switcheroo and then start the next one with gwen putting together a team to resolve it,2023-06-02
"i simply don’t think this story being told needed 5 hours of runtime

as i said they must have a big story they want to tell and needed to do it in 2 parts doesnt matter if you think it needs it or not though yes we can keep our judgement on if they actually needed a third movie or not but personally im glad we get more 


this first installment was 2 and a half hours long

into the spiderverse was only 1h 40m",2023-06-02
never understood downvoting someone over their opinion i personally disagree and was perfectly fine with how they ended things here but that doesnt mean you dont have the right to hold that opinion,2023-06-02
"yepif this movie wants to be taken on its own then its a movie with a really weird structure 

the main conflict for most of the film is about the spots increasingly escalating threat level but once we have the exposition about canon events that becomes the main conflict and the fight with miles trying to escape nueva york is functionally the climax of across

but then the movie just kinda keeps going for another 30 minutes expanding on the fallout of that climax but doing the exact opposite of resolving anything besides gwens relationship with her father

the final stopping point seems really arbitrary

otherwise this is an amazing film and im only mad because i have to wait until march for the next half of this movie but this is still bugging me",2023-06-07
imo there is none besides gwen’s family situation,2023-06-05

that being said all the art was fantastic and i truly can’t take away from the how the film looks that would be an injustice",2023-06-02
"strikes back was its own self contained film with at least some semblance of closure to the ending

"i loved this movie just massively disappointed in the ending and you’re being wildly disingenuous right now pretending infinity war and this are the same

infinity war  that isn’t a cliffhanger the conflict is resolved thanos won that’s like saying rocky 1 ends on a cliffhanger because he didn’t win 

if this movies comps are going to be the second matrix and pirates that’s really not great contact to keep",2023-06-07

nope its still peter but he retired settled down with mj and got a daughter who became spidergirl and bonds with the venom symbiote after everyone on earth got powers and peter didnt feel any responsibility anymore because he wasnt special,2023-06-08
indeed — it’s a commonenough theory that gets heavily downvoted at rmarvelstudios that the main universe peter may not have had an uncle ben or that if he did they weren’t close that he died  separated from may when peter was young and that peter became spiderman in spite of him not because of him the director and writers made comments on the release of no way home that seemed to support this theory although not many paid them much heed,2023-06-03

the movie is so good with its specific thematic conflicts it’s mostly man vs self man vs toxic superhero ideology which is so refreshing and incredibly well done,2023-06-05
see i felt that it wasn’t implied because in the scene miguel is talking about letting family die letting acquaintances die not just letting them die but preventing spidermen from saving them,2023-06-05

"yes i did its said by the illuminati but we have to assume that they have full understanding about whats causing universes to end

lol real fans know ben has no fans,2023-07-08
"as someone who likes ben reily thr character has never read his original comic but has thoroughly enjoyed ancillary media with him in it my ultimate middleman take was a bit much but it really do be like that for him

i think the salt is primarily due to how hes bring handled in modern continuity and a need for him to be done justice to rectify it all and balance the scales so to speak",2023-07-24
wdym overlooked his personality changed as he got more powerful and absorbed more dark matter idk see why its a problem,2023-06-12

"i don’t really buy that i think that anyone that could be spider man is like inherently a good egg 

spiderpeople being corrupted isnt something new to the character miles falling off the path out of desperation isnt that far out there i also think hes fully capable of being redeemed

also i would be careful of falling into the trap of assuming things are the same in this world that jefferson’s death wouldn’t have been something that changed aaron into being a better person as well or whether he was ever a hardened criminal in this world 

nothing so far has indicated that aaron is any different he has excess money talks to miles about a security job and immediately ties up and intimidates him until shown otherwise there is no reason to believe hes good its very likely he passed on the prowler mantle to miles in universe 42

but even if this miles is a villain he’s not evil doing shady stuff certainly but i don’t think this dude is out killing people

i agree i personally think  come around to the good side in the third movie

idk i think about rio’s speech to miles about protecting that little boy and making sure he is safe and loved and never forgets who he is and then i think to the end of the movie and how miles is literally faced with a version of himself that is lost and adrift who has forgotten who he is

lol i said this in my first comment yes i think rio was absolutely foreshadowing this event",2023-06-10

methinks inheritor in disguise possibly…,2023-06-03
theres too much meta commentary wrapped up in the term canon for it to be a complete fakeout this is about spiderpeople rejecting the narrative tropes theyve been stuck with since their inception as comics  writers and audiences for insisting these things play out the same way over and over again theyre forging their own destiny as it were,2023-06-17
i mean they specifically say the canon point is losing a police captain in a specific way,2023-06-07
thats the thing though  spiderman has several canon points death of a beloved unclepseudofather figure uncle ben uncle aaron etc is a key canon event but it does not preclude other canon events that happen later on in a spidermans life death of a stacy  either gwen or her father or both,2023-06-17
miles even tried to call  on the mumbhattan thing i think it is technically just a consequence of spot and his meddling and not the world collapsing due to a cannon event disrupted miguel is just using it as such,2023-06-03
"my theory based on almost nothing is that the canon points alone aren’t key it’s the way spiderman reacts and is shaped by those moments if the same lesson can be learned without the exact scenario playing out the acquisition of that wisdom continues to tether these people together

even crazier theory maybe miguel is projecting by saying that miles is the greatest anomaly miguel is secretly the greatest threat to the canon he lied about the universe he acted as a replacement in collapsing but he realized that the only way for him to have enough wiggle room to maintain his pocket dimension was to make sure that all the other universes were perfectly aligned i think the truth is that all these dimensions have more flexibility naturally as we saw with gwen and her captain",2023-06-03
that’s what we saw last yeah,2023-06-03
that may not be the case as the doc oc spiderman was definitely at the mumbattan plot hole but then in the sector 4 for the chase scene or they just have shifts or something,2023-06-04
"those are good questions i dont think the movie answers outright unless i also missed something

the pylons put some kind of net on the hole spot made that started glitching buildings to contain it it seemed like i might even be wrong and those pylons are just for the spot holes but it seems unlikely to me theyd already have the tech to deal with spots powers

anyway gonna have to rewatch or wait for the sequel to know for sure",2023-06-08
it is quite literally the post credit scene of the most recent spiderman movie,2023-06-08
he actually got a lot of screen time when miguel was first chewing outexplaining things to miles spiderman unlimited was sorta just off to the side swaying back and forth,2023-06-05
that is a perfect comparison,2023-06-03
i was thinking of gravity falls when they first introduced the time travel police trope funny you mention bill because after the movie i wondered why my brain went to gravity falls instead of the 100 other shows that have played with the same idea,2023-06-04
yes i kept hoping that wed get a bill cypher cameo in the middle of all the chaos,2023-06-03

"i dont think thats true either in miguel oharas understanding of canon events neither miles is supposed to be a spiderman the difference is that in prowlermiles universe there isnt a spiderman at all which most likely leads to jefferson davis early death and sets miles42 on the path to become the prowler whereas universe 1610 had a spiderman and his being bitten directly led to the death of his universes original spiderman in either path though miles1610 was never going to end up as the prowler

miles42 is probably not going to see it that way though and the tension between their characters is still there just in the sense of looking at an alternate evil version of yourself but not necessarily what you should have been",2023-06-04

yeah especially because the implication is that miles42 was the one who was originally meant to get bitten by that spider before the portal,2023-06-04
i think that’s a good point the most consistent allegory of the multiverse generally but also specifically in the mcu and across the spiderverse is a grappling of questions about determinism free will vs fate the spiderverse and the 199999 spiderman stories put the good guy in the position of fighting against destiny on the side of free will we know of three miles morales 1610 42 and 199999 mentioned by aaron in homecoming respectively those universes have a spider from another universe it’s spider going to another universe and the central point of multiple multiversal incidents it makes sense that those are the universes to disrupt the spiderman canon and to build a new one that includes miles and more free will,2023-06-04

it concludes gwens character arc by almost making her the main character which i thought was a clever way to get around the middle movie has no resolution problem sure they still have to save miles etc but the movie starts with gwen and ends with gwen and shes a completely different person by the end theres a clear emotional story that was resolved here,2023-06-04

"regardless he has a point and is technically right in theory what you’re talking about could work but a society like that wouldn’t work in the long term nor would in thrive anarchy in and of itself doesn’t thrive the spiderpunk himself basically acknowledges this “i don’t like consistency” major problem with his ideology is that by standing against everything you also in a way stand for nothing instead it comes off as you standing for whatever a moment in time in history is considered the underdog which is not entirely bad some of the best moments in history are moments when the underdog rise haitians against the french the civil rights movement and what happened to the jews against the ’s and their freedom and so much more but what after that you still need a thriving society that stands for something something more than just standing against everything 

regarding the movie and its message and it’s antagonist migual yea his methods and cruel and obviously the movie is gonna show a message with him being in the wrong but if it hadn’t been him it would have been someone else say what you want but his ideology created order and a home and a place for all spiderman’s to thrive and grow this is way more than anything spiderpunk would have or clearly would have ever done the movie itself shows this because guess who is the one that founded the spiderverse miguel not punk who found all the other spidey’s miguel not punk who’s trying to save more universe threw lw and order miguel not punk

as cool as punk’s character is and me even appreciating the fact that he actually not only talked but walked the walk as well and wasn’t just miguel’s lacy people like him or people with the same ideology all have the same thing in common and that is they don’t create anything they just criticize and teardown society’s the moment it has one flaw or mistake via anarchism that have been or are established who knows maybe their has to be a balance of things and that’s simply the way  or whatever your belief is aloud the universe to work call it harsh but i have a hard time respecting anyone who doesn’t take themselves seriously and just goes around standing for nothing which is why s much as i enjoyed punks character the movie and the message it has i came out respecting miguel far more than anyone else possible only 2nd if not a tie to miles

in theory people would side with joker based off a movie and would be against a rich dude who literally has access to everyone’s personal information beating up on the poor but that’s not reality i’m reality we would want batman to continue doing what he’s doin despite how harsh it is",2023-06-03

"to be honest though i think it being a stretch fits in perfectly with the theme of these films

we see a universe without spiderman and its pretty obvious that that universe was supposed to have the miles morales portrayal of the character but spot kingpin and doctor octavia interfering led that universes spiderman to go without powers being bitten by that spider is a canon event but that universe didn’t get the memo so why is it still around

ill tell you why its because miguel is wrong

hes grieving the loss he experienced and lashing out at the multiverse because of it hes trying to hold the entire multiverse in a twisted version of the sacred timeline and he doesnt even realize it he cannot accept any other outcome because he believes that the only way for spiderman to be the hero each universe needs is if they follow a strict progression of events he has to believe it because if he doesnt hed have to accept the one thing he already knows

that his loss is his own fault

the man already had multiversal technology so he must have known what would happen but instead he came up with some tragic spin that allows him to deny any wrongdoing that he never could have predicted that his actions would have the results they did but he had the technology he knew

he caused an incursion

think about it all these references to the mcu in this film especially to doctor strange specifically theres no way sony didn’t intend for us to draw a line from that oft talked about concept in multiverse of madness directly to what happened to miguel

and maybe we can take this further maybe the glitching is a symptom of an approaching incursion one individual displaced from their reality who doesnt mesh with that reality acting like a magnet drawing in their own reality until the two realities are occupying the same multiversal space attempting to coexist in a way that they werent meant to do

this would imply that miguels watches and wristbands are capable of turning off that pull allowing a spider to exist in that reality but also preventing those realities from colliding



anyway i think the idea of tony being hollands police captain being a stretch is exactly why miguel is wrong because miguels mental state is rapidly deteriorating and hes seeing paranoid connections where theyre not and i feel like thats what is going to close out or end depending on what happens to him his arc in the next film  either realize the error of his ways and help miles stop spot or  end up killed because he refuses to let go of his paranoid delusions",2023-06-09
either that or captain america steve rogers,2023-06-04
"because miguels wrong and nexus events are different

miguels experiencing paranoid delusions about how the universe works and we know that because the biggest canon event of all the spider biting spiderman does not happen on earth42 youd think that would cause that universe to unravel youd also think that miles being a spiderman on 1601 would cause his universe to unravel but it hasnt in either case i think miguel experienced an incursion and is in denial about it

as for nexus events they dont cause universes to unravel if theyre disrupted and in fact the tva specifically controls nexus events to make sure they happen an extremely specific way not because the universe ends when they happen but because a new universe is born if it doesnt happen in a very specific way disruption of canon events causes that issue to get canceled very different",2023-06-09
"1 we saw pavitr prabhakars universe starting to collapse after miles broke the canon event there so theres some truth to the importance of canon events unless we have another explanation for what needed to be contained in that scene

i think a good explanation is that spots shenanigans are causing a breakdown of reality there the collider didn’t destroy miless universe a year ago but it did threaten to and spot is partially responsible for the machines existence so we have no idea what he did when he booted the thing up 

2 in contrast gwens universe seems fine despite the event being seemingly averted in her universe her dad quit the force and is no longer a police captain unless another captain shes close to dies who or her dad somehow still qualifies for the canon her universe has broken that canon event seemingly without consequence

i think a bigger contrast is the universes of both miles miles has been an anomylous spiderman for over a year with no consequences to his universe and prowler miless universe missed out on the biggest spiderman canon event in that he was never bitten by his radioactive spider and thus there is no spiderman maybe the method of acquisition of powers isnt set in stone but the acquisition of those powers definitely is",2023-06-10
but the canon events were related to character growth due to a goodneutral person dying not related to the villains they fought,2023-06-03
also uncle ben and his parents died way before the muitiverse got involved so its reasonable to assume they can be canon events easily miles from 1610 his universe just happen to have most of the canon events lined up expect for the spider being from a different universe,2023-06-03
doesnt matter the mcu main univeree is earth616 because its not the same multiverse as spiderverse or the comics im not having this argument again im right youre wrong end of discussion,2023-08-18

this does not makes sense why would miguel want to ensure canon events which is he who remains comes on top miquel is doing kangs work for him if changing canon events causes universes to die which means hes not conquering anything hes suiciding shouldnt kangs multiverse shenanigans cause everything to die cause hes always been changing things then why didnt he who remains cause the destruction of mcu because hes always been changing stuff in sacred timeline unless kang has figured out how to change stuff without causing incursion or hes a higher being he shouldnt be able to change canon events and if he cant change canon events then whats the point of kang hes whole point is he can put his  in any timeline and shape it as he likes it these canon rules seem to limit the stories,2023-06-08

i don’t think that was conveyed in the movie so it’s a bit presumptuous that miles believes that is the case even if the catalyst of a world’s destruction is questionable i think the point is that the risk is too great,2023-06-05
you dont see that bc movies do best if they arent much longer than 2 maybe 3 hours or so except for rare exceptions so that they cant show all the different possibilities and instead hope that the audience is smart enough to understand that when they tell that canon disrupted  bad things it means bad things regardless of who is the one doing the disrupting its kinda easy to figure out,2023-06-08
"miles arc isnt i have to save the multiverse his arc is i have to save my dad

his goal isnt this till the end of the movie roughly the last 20 minutes spot directly shows him this future when they travel to mabhattan miles goal for a decent amount of the film is seeing his friends from the last movie and being a part of the new team i have to save my dad isnt his main focus until miguel tells him he has 2 days to live the wanting to be with the others was an excuse for him to jump to other universes it wasnt even really to help gwen he just wanted a watch once he leaves after being unground the movie tone shifts from being about miles and his family to miles interacting with other spider ppl 

nwh  spider verse 1 still managed to focus on their respective main spiderman opposed to switching between gwen miles prauf miguel then back to miles hes there yes but he isnt impacting the plot again until the end of act 3

the movie focuses very heavily on the personal relationships

most spiderman movies are focused on this front and center this isnt the case the movie focuses on the spectacle just as endgame the relationship at the beginning with gwen and her peter worked because it allowed for context when captain stacy finds out the plot rather have her jump into different universes than resolving the issue on screen gwen  stacys relationship being made up after a year of her being gone is unearned then she proceeded to leave again to get miles back to his dimension miles has a better structure when it comes to his family because it leaves on a high not after he talks to his mom probably is the same as gwen opposed to confronting his issues he goes to jump in other universes uncle aaron arc was complete in the 1st movie bringing him back at the end does nothing besides showing its a different universe yes miles hugs him obviously because he missed him but he this version of aaron isnt the same leaving with that version isnt going to change any relationship dynamic not even with his mom you said it yourself

followed by a version of himself who lost his father

which contradicts this statement 

ts completely rooted in and driven by the grounded interpersonal relationships not some cosmic thing the way endgame was

the entire ending of the movie is cosmic stuff miles got bit by a inter diminsional spider he attempts to go home yet ends up in alternate world where his dad died which how we dont know this is no different than the avengers going back in time to get the infinity stones miles parents get closure at the end remind the viewer they are present instead of miles going back to his actual universe and revealing himself to his mom and preparing to fight spot instead they rather take us to a timeline that will mean nothing by the end of trilogy simply because of tension and spectacle  the movie 1st priority is the spider verse unlike the 1st the 2nd being the key part of a good spider man film being humanization then 3rd being spot",2023-06-05
"i get that infinity people dying is infinity no matter how it happens it seems like youre suggesting id be okay with infinity people dying in the story if it happened a certain way i wouldnt be

it is a simple truth that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few that doesnt always mean submitting right away to whatever apparent option does the least harm it can mean doing everything in your power to see if there is a better way then even if you fail youre at least sure you did the best possible thing

i definitely dont think there will be no losses i can see gwens dad stepping in and dying to save her or miles trying to sacrifice himself only for earth42 miles to complete a redemption arc by taking his place or the heroes changing miguels mind so he and the other geniuses in the spider society pool their brains and braun to figure out a solution that requires only miguel to die heck across the spiderverse foreshadowed gwen herself dying

i certainly hope the writers think of something i havent whether or not anyone dies anyway miles might need to learn harsh reality but miguel definitely needs to learn that life isnt all doom and gloom loom at him the man is miserable and hasnt dealt with the loss of his loved ones well at all compared to the other spider people like when peter b parker says that without uncle ben dying he wouldnt be spiderman hes still sad about it but hes accepted it as a part of his past that made him who he is today miguel broods and seethes over his mistakes and losses by himself and his only friend is an ai he doesnt even like talking to something has to give him hope again even if miles also needs to learn that not everyone can make it out of a catastrophic choice alive",2023-06-09
ethinicity isnt dependant on the phenotype idiot,2023-06-06
"it’s a great dilemma to write because it brings upon validated reasons to be closedminded and openminded closed to make sure events happen they are vs open to being aware of a tragedy and preventing it and finding a way to fix everything there’s also a clash of good vs good— 1 guy saw the tragedy that can happen if anomalies exist the other guy sees a tragedy that’s about to happen and it’s his responsibility to save the person not turn a blind eye on it they’re both seeing their own tragedies and wanting to prevent them from happening and we get a good vs good out of it it’s really wellwritten


speaking of goodwriting

miles says sometime early in the movie
“i can have 2 cakes and eat them too”


and it seems like the 2 cakes he can have and will be able to eat are saving his dad  saving the multiverse unfortunately his foreshadowed 2 cakes did not end up being the ones for his dad’s promotion party but the 2 cakes being his dad’s life and the fate of the multiverse are probably better tasting cakes anyway",2023-06-03
"thats the choice others want miles to make but its ultimately miless choice to make  its a difficult choice one with no real strict moral answer  its the kind of stuff we face in the real world  have miles get put through the ethical ringer and coming out with a strong conviction is what i want to see but i want to see that choice made by his character and i want that choice to have real consequences just like ours do  giving him a way out where he can have his cake and eat it too betrays growth

edit  insomniacs marvels spiderman also explored this dilemma between peter and multiple characters specifically aunt may and ock and the game took a stance and i loved the story for it  not because i agree with the moral position the developers made peter take but because it asked a meaningful and difficult moral question and it had peter make a decision and we got to experience that decision  we get to internalize the challenge and this characters thought process and we get to contrast it with our own as we contemplate the challenge for ourselves",2023-06-03
wait how does this respond to the point of my initial post  his monologue to his alternate mom is was him reflecting on his identity and the concept of fitting in or belonging to a community or to a set of expectations and i loved it  but its not an answer to the moral dilemma the movie set him up with  its a great progress in character but its clearly not the lesson yet,2023-06-03

"the issue is that so far we have only seen universes collapsing when a visitor breaks the canon miles by saving the father on the bridge that isn’t his and miguel for supplanting his alternate in a universe that isn’t his 

there is nothing we’ve seen that is concrete that miles saving his own dad in his own universe would break canon rather than just be him writing his own story it’ll be definitely interesting to see where they go with this in the next film",2023-06-04
"yea in that same scene miles comes in and says “unless you bring two cakes” it shows how he is trying to “do both” the same as when during the canon event the spiderman holding the bus exclaims “i can do both” even though we know that he would have failed 

the thematic argument seems to be “what makes spiderman who he is the fact that he tragically fails “do both” or that he tries” is miles right that they should try to figure out a way or is miguel right that it’s too dangerousselfish to try and risk breaking canon 

i think this will be further explored since so far the only canonevent universe collapse we’ve seen are caused by “glitch”anomalies in a universe they are visiting one where miles breaks canon in a universe he’s visiting and one where miguel also breaks a universe that isn’t his there’s nothing concrete so far to suggest that miles saving his own father in his own universe writing his own story would cause the universe to collapse",2023-06-04
miguel first starting jumping universes after the miles got his powers itsv postcredit confirms this so miles is still the earliest anomaly we know of though i guess technically the spider that bit him was the anomaly first only making miles an anomaly after it bit him,2023-06-15
also the subsequent dimensional incursions in the first movie had no real sideeffects either even though multiple spiderbeings were absolutely interfering with canon events,2023-06-12
"i dont think thats foreshadowing that he cant do both i think it just foreshadows that he cant do both by himself

its been pretty clear through the entire movie that his parents are extremely supportive and even giving him a lot of the benefit of the doubt when it comes to his unexplained behavior even when they see gwen and clearly dont approve of her they still choose to handle the situation pretty gently and accept that completely stopping him is not the right thing to do plus he seems to have established a working peer relationship with his dad while being spiderman so he doesnt even have to resolve the issue of being seen as a criminal vigilante his dad already accepts spiderman as being generally a force for good

if he tells them the truth i imagine most of these problems will solve themselves he wouldnt have ruined both cakes if his family knew he was spiderman because he wouldnt be working so hard to deliver the cakes be spiderman and keep his identity secret all at the same time

also low key im expecting after he tells them his parents will accept him as spiderman but also say hes still grounded other than spider emergencies  


edit gwens story highlights this things were going pretty well for miles he was involved in the community has a confidant and as mentioned before established a working relationship between spiderman and the police gwen on the other hand is isolated and alone having an extremely hard time connecting to or being open with people around her which is causing extreme difficulty for her things dont start to look up for her until joining the spider society along with the theme of miles writing his own story theres also a theme about opening up and connecting to others and working together instead of being a solo act all the time even in miguels opening fight he tries to go solo until its clear this isnt working and calls for backup and even lyla knows this as she had already called before even miguel was ready to admit he needed backup",2023-06-14
did they get ruined sure the writing was messed up but two yummy cakes were still delivered and edible  maybe im looking in to it too hard but it seems like foreshadowing that it can be messy but you can have both cakes and eat them too,2023-07-04
you need better friends,2023-06-17
yea i mentioned that i also mentioned both cakes were ruined in the process lol,2023-06-11
well technically miles wasnt even supposed to become spiderman in the first place,2023-06-15
yeah but i wasnt sure if that was literal or a hyperbolic reaction to the fangs good point though it could be keeping something at bay maybe hes more manspider without it,2023-06-15
not really i think its more what you happen to pick up on id clocked that it was sending him to earth42 and then realised that was where the spider was from only because of context in the movie rather than anything i knew beforehand again its just down to what  you notice  theres so much i missed in the first film,2023-06-07
ha and i completely forgot about two minutes later and was taken by surprise when miles realized he wasnt in his universe,2023-06-04
why does tbis have so many upvotes and is deleted,2023-11-10
i dont think thats right i think its miles world event that makes the multiverse possible in the first place he is technically the root cause of multiverse,2023-08-10
miguel had him pinned to be fair to him miles seems to have some interesting variations as being invisible and electricit,2023-06-05

him saying he isnt going to reveal his secret identity just to reveal it a scene or 2 later was one of the few things thay i found dumb in the movie,2023-06-11

iirc the wga strike doesn’t affect animated movies so it should be good to go,2023-06-05
i know i’m late but  that scared the  out of me just because the rest of the movie’s sound was lacking ,2023-06-07
and a little bit as miles was swinging and hearing the echoes of what people had said to him throughout this and the last movie,2023-06-06
"it’s kinda astounding the effort and talent that went into making this top tier movie— and somehow so many people had a somewhat bad experience because of the sound 

especially at the beginning i couldn’t hear any of the dialog worth a darn  maybe my ears adjusted a little after that but it still wasn’t good sound mixing  i just can’t understand how that could end up being a problem in multiple theaters … all that talent going into this movie and people can’t hear it",2023-06-11
i think my theater took the advice because it certainly seemed louder than other screenings ive seen on their main screen might have been too much because the bass was shaking the projection at times or most likely the pane of glass in front of the projector,2023-06-05
every time i go to an indian movie i remind them that indian movies are mixed 15 decibels louder so cut the volume by 15 decibels which means the final volume is 13 the original,2023-06-08
i mean it did sound a bit like a slangfree tipperary accent like my own mixed with isaac’s own — to say he mainly used his own accent with a twinge of irishness,2023-06-03
i know that — i just mean the sort of voice isaac gave him,2023-06-16
big disagree on that it’s closer to dune part 1 than endgame and iw infinity war actually completes the hero’s journey for thanos and manages to have a proper climax spiderverse ends right before what is the climax structurally speaking still really enjoyed it but it’s also why iw’s ending felt more organic,2023-06-03
i could not disagree with this more infinity war is a complete movie thanos goes through a twisted version of the hero’s journey and wins it has a beginning a middle and an end it’s not half a movie like this effectively was which i’m not saying is bad just different if we didn’t know the avengers were going to make a comeback and win for the outofuniverse reason that the good guys always win infinity war’s ending would have been fine as a true ending it doesn’t end in the middle of things like across the spiderverse does,2023-06-05
wow i disagree so hard this movie felt like the third act was about to start then it just ends infinity war goes through all three acts cleanly and ends in a satisfying way,2023-06-03
"fun movie trivia fact

when christopher markus and stephen mcfeely wrote iwendgame they put all of the plot beats onto sticky notes and pasted them around the walls in the writers room it was originally one long story but they realized it had to be cut down and thats why they had the sticky notes so they could literally point to a spot on the wall and say here here is where we should divide it

also fun movie fact stephen is the guy who wrote the chronicles of narnia films",2023-06-04
it’s not infinity war concludes thanos arc he gets the infinity stones and snaps you obviously know there will be more but the arc that started at the beginning of the movie ends in this movie it’s badly done as the arc is cut short no arc is resolved at all,2023-06-07
i think one thing we can agree on is the movie slaps regardless how ya feel about the cliff hanger,2023-06-02
im with you it was definitely extremely well written ive never been so disappointed and surprised and excited all at once,2023-06-03
they could have literally wrapped it within 30 minutes  how does it constitute an entire new movie,2023-06-03
"it resolved the fight with thanos with him snapping half the world you missed that there was a conclusion there it sets up the sequel but it finished its arc actually if it wasnt that the good guys need to win you could just end it there 

if they had done iw like this movie iw would have ended with everyone arriving in wakanda and thats it no fight no anything",2023-06-02
" its got an ending 

no the ending is literally the cliffhanger  put the pt 1 like infinity war to manage expectations  this ending was blue ball city",2023-06-03

"strikes back ended with han imprisoned luke reeling after a devastating reveal and the entire gang at their worst place ever fans were  back in 1980 the semblance of closure you feel watching it now is thanks to the fact that you’ve seen part 3 you have the comfort of knowing exactly where every loose thread on esb is heading

meanwhile this movie gives gwen a fairly complete arc which helps it feel like just as much of its own movie to me as esb did 

who exactly do you think is vader in this comparison the closest thing to a vader reveal in this movie is miles realizing he was never supposed to be bitten and like luke he deals with this problem before the movie ends the other parallel i could think of is realizing the other version of him became the prowler once again we see miles deal with that before the movie ends",2023-06-02
"wait now you love the movie that made you miserable and felt like a waste of money

as a person who likes both pirates 2 and 3 i can tell you its basically the same as bttf2 the conflict being watching jack try and fail to weasel his way out of a supernatural deal with the devil thats it that was the plot of the movie still self contained,2023-06-09
if you guessed it during the movie i kinda don’t count that but also many didn’t including me and other adults i went with,2023-06-05

"the important part wasnt that gwens dad quit persay yes hes now not the captain but its that gwen grew she took life lessons and opened up to her dad again

had she taken the miguel path hed have died either because she didnt grow or because shed have let it happen  miguel has put everyone around him on a path to suffering because theyre rightfully afraid of destroying universes but the problem is they arent growing or learning from anything theyre just assuming its all set and can only be on way

spiderman india had a line that sticks out  i can do both as hes trying to save the captain and the bus with his girlfriend  hes trying to be everything everywhere all at once he cant

spiderpeople have limits and only by acknowledging them and reaching out asking for help can they change things and grow  miguel refuses to grow hes the embodiment of holding on so tight it all slips through your fingers

theres also some very obvious issues with his theory in some of the stories presented like mcguire and garfield we never see a police captain die  we lose uncle ben sure but theres no seen canon event of a police captain like captain staceydavis dying

so by his own interpretation of the canon those universes should have collapsed but they didnt miguel is just too blinded by self hatred and regret to see hes wrong hed doing something good for bad reasons and getting it wrong in the process",2023-06-05
"its a lesson wed do well to teach more of in life all too often we get stories idolizing the singular hero who wins the day alone

like tony the revolutionary billionaire genius doing the work of thousands in his mind  but thats rarely how it happens in real life  theres one guy who might get the glory but he alone didnt pick up the company and carry it upon his back across the finish line doing both the design work the fabrication and the base level research

we do see some of this with tony leaning on jarvis in the first movie to find the right alloy mixes but that fell away and never got shown in the later movies

so the idea that miles seems to be pushing that while you can go it alone friends make the impossible possible is really where the story shines brightest",2023-06-05
right that’s looking at the trolley problem ans actively keeping someone from saving their loved one to save 10 people on the other track wheress miles wants to stop the train,2023-06-16
it also seems like miguel was only recruiting from people who had already had their tragic canon events happen he didnt want to recruit gwen because she hadnt had her police captain moment yet,2023-06-07
"possibly i think miguel is similar to dr strange in a sense that he thinks his vision is the only way and there is no alternative maybe because hes unwilling to accept that he  up or cant have his own happiness miguel did try to have his family back and  it all up 

but personally i dont think its a plot hole but an intentional character flaw miguels word isnt law thats why miles is trying to do otherwise well find out if miguel is wrong he probably is",2023-06-02

"idk to me a lot of the stuff with aaron feels like an intentional misdirect 

also we are shown in the first movie that he cares primarily about his family jefferson dying in this universe could have entirely set him on a different path it’s consistent with what we know about the character although that might be different in this universe 

i also don’t love the thematic implications of the only reason this miles is evil is because he didn’t have superpowers one year ago around the time his dad died assuming the timelines are aligned with our miles and the “major death” occurred at the same time

i also don’t view superpowers to be any different to the techno weapons kit he has tooled out as prowler if he would’ve been a hero with superpowers i think he would’ve been a hero with the expertise and intellect to create this tech they seem thematically identical to me",2023-06-10

"if he was an inheritor he would feed on spider totems not vulture though

youd think that due to the hundreds if not thousands of spiders at the base he wouldnt just need a couple more

"this is about spiderpeople rejecting the narrative tropes theyve been stuck with since their inception as comics

which was my original point miguel is a stand for the status quo and canon spiderpeople are allowed to be happy and not have tragedy always define their life its why peter b parker is actually happy

i think miguel will find his own happiness as well",2023-06-17
thats what miguel and co said which is why i think its a red herring nor does every close character always die ben for sure seems to always die but for sure in raimi and garfield didnt have gwen stacys dad die nor does gwen die in raimi,2023-06-07
i think the mumbhattan blackhole appeared because all those spiderpeople were willingly sacrificing gayatri,2023-06-26

"the first appearance was in ultimate fallout 4 august 2011 s02e01 where donald wears the spiderman pjs aired september 23 2010

the concept of an african american spiderman was first discussed a few months before the november 2008 election of barack obama as president of the united states marvel comics theneditorinchief axel alonso describes the catalyst when we were planning ultimatum we realized that we were standing at the brink of america electing its first africanamerican president and we acknowledged that maybe it was time to take a good look at one of our icons

miles morales was created by writer brian michael bendis and artist sara pichelli814 bendiss thoughts about the character and the way he looked in his first appearance were heavily influenced by africanamerican actor donald glovers appearance in spiderman pajamas in anthropology 101 the secondseason premiere of the television comedy series community this was a reference to an unsuccessful online campaign that attempted to secure glover an audition for the lead role in the 2012 film the amazing spiderman bendis said of glover he looked fantastic i saw him in the costume and thought i would like to read that book so i was glad i was writing that book",2023-06-02
the image was a reference to the online movement which failed to get donald cast as the amazing spiderman but yes did inspire the creation of miles,2023-06-03
youre waiting for his what now,2023-06-12
glover is sadly too old to really do spiderman and especially miles these days,2023-06-05
i really like that as a plot point miguel is set on the fact that miles was never meant to be a spider man because it was the universe 42 spider completely missing that in universe 42 the spider was always going to bite miles meaning morales had always had the potential to be a spiderman it wasn’t some fluke this would also explain why all other abnormalities glitch but miles in his home universe doesn’t all miles moraleses have the potential to be spider man in any reality so just because the powers came from another universe it isn’t really an abnormality because miles is always potentially a spider man,2023-06-06
dont forget the video game version as well we saw insomnias spiderman peter parker in the movie as well i wonder if we will get to see insominias miles morales in the next part too,2023-06-07

even though he loves his miles he isnt a stranger to fighting those he loves to save everyone from them if theyve gone down the wrong path the only problem is determining whether or not that path is actually wrong with otto and mister negative in his world they were doing bad things in service of taking down norman osborn ultimately a good goal but the ends dont justify the means",2023-06-11

theres multiple different canon events they had this movies 616 spidey peter b parker also say he lost a police captain there are supposed to be many different canon events in a spidermans story an uncle ben equivalent dying a gwen stacy equivalent dying a police captain dying the symbiote showing up etc,2023-06-04
probably hasnt happened yet  jefferson davis and captain stacy both can be inferred to exist in the mcu on the other hand the idea falls apart a bit when you consider that at least in the comics there are frequently multiple spiderpeople from the same universe  just like miless own where there was a previous spiderman before him do all the canon events have to happen to each spiderman even if theyve already happened to a different spider in their same universe,2023-06-02

"as a follow up on their comment and for anyone else interested in reading edge of spiderverse 2 2014 specifically is spidergwens introduction with the others being spotlights on different multiversal variants and that mini series leads into the first spiderverse event  funnily enough issues 1 and 5 are spiderman noir and peni parker respectively so reading the whole mini series might be appealing anyway  for digital reading marvel unlimited is probably the best option or if youre into physical copies the newest edition of the spiderversespidergeddon hardcover omnibus has both the events in a proper reading order which was an unfortunate issue with the first spiderverse hardcover release

as for spidergwens stand alone material they got most of whats been released but there are a couple more odds and ends to mention  for simplicitys sake im just going to copy the listings from the two omnibuses which are fairly comprehensive the first of which is sadly already out of print

spidergwen omnibus
edge of spiderverse 2 spidergwen 2015a 15 spidergwen 2015b 134 spidergwen annual 1 allnew wolverine annual 1 spiderwomen alpha and omega silk 2015b 78 spiderwoman 2015 67 and spiderman 2016 1214

note here that the annuals can probably be read whenever the spiderwomen crossover minievent is after the 2015b series issue 6 and involves spiderwoman and silk and the spiderman issues from the miles morales run are a crossover starting after the 2015b series issue 15

spidergwen ghost spider omnibus
spidergwen ghostspider 110 spidergeddon ghostspider video comic ghostspider 110 and annual 1 king in black gwenom vs carnage 13 web warriors 111 and material from amazing spiderman 2015 1

for this one theyre pretty much in order with the exception of web warriors which is a spidervariant team series set nebulously but sometime soon after the original spiderverse event  the material from the amazing spiderman issue is just a couple page prelude introducing it

there are a few other cameos with other spider people during nick spencers amazing spiderman run but those are more a tiein to his story than gwen  lastly there have been two recent 5issue mini series that did not come out in time to be collected yet and those would be spidergwen gwenverse and spidergwen shadow clones the latter of which has one issue left to publish  based on what i remember of marvel unlimiteds publishing schedule you should be able to read everything except the most recent miniseries digitally",2023-06-16

so many people are saying this was gwens story but it clearly wasnt her story in this movie is great but she is not the mc i actually felt satisfied by the ending because the whole movie is people telling miles who he really is who he should be but the climax is him standing up for himself making a multiverseshaking decision telling his parents who he is but then it twists that he told the wrong parents and he is absolutely boned the final shot of the og spiderverse team coming to save him gave me chills that will long outlast any feelings of weird pacing,2023-06-06

personally i think this ending was way better than spider verse as that movie actually had a weak ending it was all about how he wasn’t ready to be spiderman the his dad told him he loved him and all of the sudden he mastered web slinging and can defeat kingpin never sat right with me this is so different miles earned it in this movie by showing his emotional growth aka “making the hard decisions” as well as him vastly improving his practical hero skills,2023-06-07

"the spiderpunk himself basically acknowledges this “i don’t like consistency”

hobie had very little screentime and when hes not being used to help forward the plot by giving miles advice hes using it to as all spiderpeople do crack jokes only he does it through the lens of anarchism andor antiestablishmentism using this one line to go even the anarchist knows hes a hypocrite is stretching things to the point i have trouble taking you seriously

major problem with his ideology is that by standing against everything you also in a way stand for nothing instead it comes off as you standing for whatever a moment in time in history is considered the underdog

just say you dont know what anarchism is man itll save everyone time

if it hadn’t been him it would have been someone else

and all the spiders were just following orders right

say what you want but his ideology created order and a home and a place for all spiderman’s to thrive and grow

clearly not as we can see with the exclusion of miles and the threat of exclusion and how much convincing it took to include gwen miguel built a panopticon on the same level as kang in loki

this is way more than anything spiderpunk would have or clearly would have ever done

the act of building something is not in and of itself a good thing but even aside from that youre still wrong the movie ends with gwen literally building a team of spiders to save miles and that team included hobie who can honestly be said to be a big part of the founding of that team considering how he helped gwen after she was excommunicated

they just criticize and teardown society’s the moment it has one flaw or mistake via anarchism that have been or are established

again you just dont know what anarchism is

i came out respecting miguel far more than anyone else possible only 2nd if not a tie to miles

then you didnt understand the point of the movie  hes a sympathetic character yes but he is very clearly coded as a fascist you probably also unironically say thanos did nothing wrong

in theory people would side with joker based off a movie and would be against a rich dude who literally has access to everyone’s personal information beating up on the poor

remember when i said i have trouble taking you seriously yeah we crossed that line where youre just being silly the joker isnt an anarchist he stands for chaos and murdering anyone and everyone he wants to on whatever whim he has at the moment bruce wayne is a problem with society in that he is a billionaire who obviously doesnt contribute as much as he could and batman is a problem in that he lets insane serial killers like the joker live assuming our broken judicial and carceral systems will actually do anything to fix the problem neither of these things being true mean that people think the joker is the good guy actually unless were talking about the joker in harley quinn who kind of seems to have been rehabilitated in a really weird way but thats a comedy show

i’m reality we would want batman to continue doing what he’s doin despite how harsh it is

what reality bro this reality the one where batman is totally real no the  i dont want batman in this reality i dont even want our current judicial and carceral system because it doesnt fix the problem its barely a bandaid over a gaping wound in society batman is more effective than real cops because he actually catches bad guys but even in fictional gotham hes only an attempt at treating symptoms rather than trying to solve the systemic problems in society",2023-06-03

"his take was significantly more nuanced than just deriding marvel and more lamenting how companies like disney have significantly changed the model for what films make it to the big screen and that its having a large effect on independent cinema 

scorsese was in the generation of artists fighting to have cinema seen as a serious artform he thinks the major thing lacking is the unifying vision of an individual artist and i find his points hard to dispute

"yup seems very likely to me that miguels universe suffered an incursion due to his presence in it we were told in multiverse of madness that thats exactly what causes incursions  people being in the wrong universe for too long

those statements aren’t contradictory at all miles is being driven by his personal relationship with his parents  a threat to his parents the cosmic stuff is just background to facilitate that the movie’s 1 priority absolutely was not multiverse stuff it was the personal relationships between miles and gwen and their parents miles doesn’t even leave his own universe until like over an hour into the film,2023-06-05
"it seems like youre suggesting id be okay with infinity people dying in the story if it happened a certain way i wouldnt be

and thats why you shouldnt have brought up the infinity thing again i told you you didnt want to go down this road but you insisted and are still keeping on running down this road and thats why youre stuck like a hmaster in a wheel 

you brought up this infinity thing to try and discredit miguels mission and logic but you failed to realize that even if you had been successful in that attempt which you werent but thats too much right now then you would simultaneously be discreding miles and his logic at the same time you didnt prove miles right you actually proved him completely wrong 

also no offense but thank  theres a writers guild and professional writersbc holy  is your ideas bad and awful lol

jesus man

like theres no real way of saying it nicely but thank ya what you just put out there is precisely why some people should stay in the audience and others earn their spot behind the scenes like  man if any of what you wrote happens thatd prolly  all the goodwill that sony marvel and disney built up for spiderman over the last 10 years

if i had to guess and i’m going to assume that what 2099 says is 100 correct and he isn’t misinformed on what happened that lead to the destruction of that universe miles being an anomaly himself will help him prevent the canon event or perhaps something in his adventure through the 42 universe will make him except from that happening perhaps someone important to him is a captain in that universe and since he’s both 1610 and 42 it will count as his “canon event”,2023-06-03

facts miguel isn’t a reliable narrator and i think he’s not even a spiderman,2023-06-04
there is a big question mark since miles shouldnt exist in his universe he already had a peter parker spiderman till spider 42 bit him,2023-06-05
i got the sense that miles would have failed his dad had gwen not intervened since gwen intervened and miguel explained how everything worked miles now has the opportunity to save his dad saving his dad would cause a dimension failure like we saw with the indian spiderman except there it seemed contained and we didnt hear anything bad about it after so it doesnt seem like a big problem if youre prepared,2023-06-05
also if miles is an anomaly why should the canon moments apply to him,2023-06-16
i think it’s also a meta conversation about the direction of spiderman stories a lot of fan have complained the last couple years that too many spiderman stories for too long keep beating spiderman down and just be constant suffering,2023-06-05
i like to think that spiderman is an absurd  the sense of albert camus he will fail to do both but he will always keep trying knowing it to be fraught,2023-06-05
"maybe but i feel like theres some unreliable narration from miguel here  yes lyla is the one who says it but presumably he made her and we dont know how long shes existed doesnt it seem a bit weird that he would have been able to  conceive of design and construct the watch within a couple days of the original collider event also its been barely more than a year since the first movie and hes supposed to have his tragic i replaced myself in another universe backstory and the entire establishment of the spider society within that time  


i mean its a comic movie so all things are possible but i wouldnt be surprised if he had some interdimensional shenanigans before the collider incident and the collider incident is just what motivated him to become the protector of the multiverse  


even if everything did actually happen after the collider event miguel effectively did the exact same thing that kingpin was trying to do which even the peters parker from the first movie knew would cause universe instability so its likely that hes either wrong or lying about canon disruptions being the main cause of universe collapses hes projecting his own failings on miles his own logic breaks down pretty quick when you realize that universe42 not getting a spiderman already disrupts canon and neither it or miles universe have shown to be at risk of collapse",2023-06-15

4 figuring out why gwens universe wasnt destroyed when her dad quit captain three possibilities that i can see he unquits gwen bonds with miles dad and he dies or canon events are a lie but miguel for insert evil reason and miguel intentionally started to destroy mumbatten
5 probably another cool 10 minute fight scene with miguel
6 teaming up against spot includes saving miles dad or failing to do so
7 doing something with the romantic tension between miles and gwen this would probably happen right before the big act 3 battle i assume but worked on all movie before the big breakthrough moment

i mean if you rush it you could fit that all into maybe one and a half hours but at that point you need a new movie so another 225 hour movie is good to let the movie breathe",2023-06-03
well have to wait until that movie comes out to really judge that  it seems they want to build something between prowler miles and spider miles that would take longer than 30min,2023-06-03
i was talking about infinity war having an ending,2023-06-03
well im willing to argue that its potentially half of the greatest film ever produced butyeah that half is a problem,2023-06-07
"yeah it really suffers for basically stopping at the end of the second act it felt like when a netflix episode just ends at a random point and not the end of a movie

movies like empire and infinity war all managed to tell complete stories but they ended in failure while this movie kinda just ended miles didn’t real fail and the villains didn’t win beyond is gonna have to do a lot to convince me that this needed to be a two parter",2023-06-06
just got out of it this movie has no climax and no denouement what a disappointment it’s beautiful but i can’t call a movie with no ending a good movie,2023-06-16
been saying the same thing for days now most people apparently don’t see it the same way,2023-06-05
"the movie didn’t end with that though what you just described was the final act

the movie ended with the crew that escaped in the falcon setting out with an defined note on their next adventure rescuing han and preparing to defeat vader in fact you can go look it up it’s been well documented that empire was originally supposed to end more like this film did right as luke got picked up by the falcon and with no closure

they ended up deciding that audiences wouldn’t take to it and went back to add in the ending sequences to let people know that while yes there was more to come this portion of the story was now over

i don’t feel like that ever happens in across we just are in the middle of the plot and then “bam” it’s over all the sudden you also absolutely do not see miles “handle” anything to do with the prowler that is also cut off and not shown",2023-06-02
we dont see miles deal with that what are you talking about actually if we had seen miles deal with that that would have been a much proper ending for part 1 resolve at least a conflict and then be ready for the final showdown in his universe,2023-06-02
we did not see miles deal with either of those in this movie this movie had no climax for him to actually resolve those,2023-06-16
what in incredibly disingenuous conversation waste someone else’s time if you can’t comprehend criticism,2023-06-05
"theres a line in homecoming that implies that uncle ben died relatively recently  when petes talking to ned after he discovers hes spiderman and trying to get him to keep it a secret pete makes a passing reference to may having recently dealt with something pretty bad although its left somewhat ambiguous  

ned may cannot know i cannot do that to her right now you know i mean everything that’s happened with her i please

i think youre right that his death was unrelated to peters origin though  at least not in the same way  theres never really any implication that pete has any guilt hanging over his head about it",2023-06-03
indeed — the way it was written by the end supported the reading both of ben having died years ago or left years ago as why wouldn’t one still use a suitcase if they could — those can be expensive,2023-06-03
" commonenough theory

i didn’t deny anything i just noted that the theory does have solidenough grounds to it for some people to believe it — and that while the writers originally intended for the mcu peter to have had an unmentioned uncle ben that they may have changed their mind by the end of things based on their own comments on the matter with all the focus on the multiverse the concept of a peter who became spiderman in spite of his uncle rather than because of him is an interestingenough one",2023-06-05
oh yea,2023-06-13
"theres also some very obvious issues with his theory in some of the stories presented like mcguire and garfield we never see a police captain die we lose uncle ben sure but theres no seen canon event of a police captain like captain staceydavis dying

maybe im misremembering but doesnt garfield lose captain stacy in asm1 i thought it was even one of the scenes on the spidercomputer when miguel is talking about losing a captain as a canon event",2023-06-05
"miguel refuses to grow hes the embodiment of holding on so tight it all slips through your fingers

man even with all these advanced tech he still is a spiderman with all too familiar flaws trying to do too much alone 

hes filled with a tower of spidercharacters and what does he do  i alone have been shouldering these responsibilities like bruh are you hearing yourself",2023-06-18
but then mumbatan spiderman doesnt make sense he was clearly part of the team and hadnt had his captain event,2023-06-14
yeah by plothole i mean his conception of the multiverse and canon not necessarly the story established by the writers but yeah miguel is probably wrong i just dont know how haha i hope some interesting theories come up,2023-06-02
a thing you may be missing is that universe 42 has no spiderman in it because miles is suppose to be spiderman meaning miles 42 has no super hero to look up to like 1610 miles which had a spiderman his whole environment is different they would be on par with each other with one having powers and one having advanced tech but they were raised in different ways,2023-06-14
can agree plus that would be a major copout to his established character,2023-06-04
captain stacy did die in andrew garfield’s universe he was stabbed by the lizard they even replay that scene in this movie,2023-06-26
and leaving a drop of symbiote goo behind,2023-06-09
bag man was also apart of the chase sequence just not for very long,2023-06-20
miguel is a liar he is not a genius he is not funny has no webs and even miles asked him if he was actually spiderman,2023-06-19
yes but that would have been a different person in new york it wasnt going to be miles42,2023-06-04
"he said he helped build it but the only thing we saw was him after the fact

he doesbt look exactly like spiderman we saw his face but not every peter parkeror spider person looks the same

the trex the car the twelve billion other spider people


 gwen herself worked with olivia and she never noticed",2023-06-25
"2011 not going back from ep  


couldnt see me as spiderman but now im spittin venom",2023-06-02
"theres more to donald for spiderman though 

that was a fan hashtag meant to stir buzz for a casting due to the whole rebooting of the spiderman movies in 2010",2023-06-03
super interesting thank you,2023-06-05
yeah it would also call back to the first movie and peters funeral anyone can be spiderman,2023-06-11
im thinking thats going to be a twist it comes off that way then revealed that he was indeed not meant to be bit and the moral will be you cant let destiny control you,2023-11-13
"thats a very good point but at the same time i cant see insomniac spidey not agreeing with the possibility to save jefferson if there was even the slimmest wildest chance that it wouldnt cause catastrophe he let may die but that was because there was only a single dose and if he used it on her thered be none left to replicate

though that does beg the question as to where any of the other miles spideys are since theres not exactly a shortage of them

now theres an idea for the sequela whole team of miles in addition to gwens expanded spidey gang",2023-06-11
thats very mature of you dude props,2023-06-07
idk what you’re mad at but clearly it’s not about me anymore lol i hope this meandering rant made you feel something again mate,2023-06-13
i dont think theyll resolve it at all if it is a mixing problem theyll have to fix that and then send it in that sounds like a lot of work considering that they are receiving rave reactions from everyone no matter this problem  or the bad ending they will probably just ignore it,2023-06-02
so was pav supposed to choose between a potential gwen event and police captain dying event at the same time and then lose both of them that’s  up man,2023-06-09
was miles the first nonparker spiderman to get a significant ongoing series assuming ben reily and kaine count as parkers because clone,2023-06-21
bruh tom lost  everything ,2023-06-04
i think for tom it was losing tony swap leader of a police force with leader of a policing force,2023-06-04
oh that could be it too didn’t think of that,2023-06-04
missed your comment and wrote this exact same thing lol,2023-06-03
technically black aj1s but same energy,2023-06-03
but didnt the characters come to the realization miles was sent to the wrong universe before that moment how could you have still not realized at that point,2023-06-02
what youre pretending like theres no urgency to get back to miles dimension as if spot isnt there after threatening that   miles family none of what happened implies that the next logical step of the movie isnt getting miles asap and going to save his father from spot,2023-06-04
not only was that resolved but miles decided to trust his family with his secret at the end of the movie,2023-06-03
yeah it started with gwens story and resolved it at the end,2023-06-02
"infinity war analogy isn’t totally accurate because the entire movie was building up toward a battle for their existence and the film gave us exactly that and the heroes lost 

people wouldn’t complain about this movie if it ended with the battle with spot and miles subsequently loses in fact i think it would be praised for this decision like iw was despite seeing your favorite superheroestheir loved ones die

the least they could’ve done is not end the movie in the middle of its climax and cut it either shorter or make it longer it’s not satisfactory in the narrative sense unless you think this film is gwen’s story and it’s obviously not just that",2023-06-03
then the final scene should have been with her and her dad,2023-06-11
"very true but the odds of it being pushed back for two years are very slim considering they started working on it some time ago

i wouldnt be surprised if it slipped a few months though",2023-06-07
no but that delayed satisfaction is gonna be amazing,2023-06-03
but what happens with miles is the resolution of his character arc in this movie its his big climactic moment,2023-06-07
couldn’t put it any better myself thanks for not attacking me for having an opinion,2023-06-02
"i agree this wasn’t “gwen’s story” it was too messy to call that without further elaboration it was a hybrid gwen and miles story the thing is gwen’s arc had an end and mile’s arc was still being expanded on as the credits rolled not hard for people to then default to “it’s gwen’s movie” it’s easier to do that and excuse the poor writing for miles ending than it is to pick apart something they enjoyed

i simply don’t agree about how it made me feel but glad it landed for some",2023-06-06
"so youre acknowledging that gwens character arc is complete youre just saying it doesnt count

nobodys arguing there was no cliffhanger just that the movie clearly anticipated the half a movie complaints and gave us some significant closure with gwen to make up for it you can not appreciate it but thats certainly what the movie was doing",2023-06-05
"i mean the core of spiderman across its many incarnations has been its emotional core

tobey with uncle ben and his guilt over lying to mj and indirectly killing harrys father

garfield with gwen and her eventual death

holland and aunt may  growing close to mj only for her to forget him

miles with his father and uncle aaron

you dont have to be dawsons creek to have characters with a sliver of depth lol",2023-06-05
have you seen fast x comparing it to across the spiderverse theres a clear distinction between a cliffhanger ending and a movie that just stops,2023-06-07
if you think a reddit thread is the majority then im not sure you know what minority means,2023-06-11
"couldn’t disagree more 

i’m honestly baffled as to how you find a movie with no end has a “better ending” than a beautiful and self contained story truly can’t comprehend

also i think you need to go watch the first movie again his dad doesn’t just “say he loves him” the whole point of that scene was to parallel the speech that peter usually gets from may after ben passes at least that’s what it screamed to me especially since it came right after uncle aaron’s death

edit he also didnt “master webslinging” there are entire parts of that scene of him traveling through the city showing his inexperience the one that jumps out to me off rip is he swings too low to the ground and has to come in running to get back into the air with momentum as well as a lot of his movement being jumping based rather than swinging the scene was him getting better at being spiderman it wasn’t some night and day transformation like you’re playing it to have been",2023-06-07
miles bucked the hard decision in favor of the greedy one though,2023-06-11
"going to once again state that the vast majority of movie tickets sold don’t include the person purchasing reading the synopsis on the theatres website

just because you go out of your way for information that you have to go out of your way to find doesn’t mean it was well advertised

there quite simply is no good reason why they couldn’t put “part 1” in the title or marketing other than that they were scared audiences wouldn’t buy a ticket because they didn’t want to see the  ending we got straight up blatant false advertising

they purposefully went out of their way to remove any mention or trace of it being a part 1 years ago and have leaned heavily into marketing it as it’s own stand alone film for years now",2023-06-02
"welcome to the world of comic book movies  first time here

mcu went from a fairly realistic world to the one we live in at the start of ironman 1 into a galaxy traveling civilization in the span of about 10 years  no one seems to complain about that being unrealistic",2023-06-21
tbf what other metrics does a teenager have to go off of other than making his own gadgets which they do,2023-06-21
yes its like they think miles has super powers or something like that,2023-07-07
" and youve got a moonlight reunion

it’s not guilt she’s aware that on paper it could make miles jealous but it’s only a platonic connection she’s nervous about miles getting the wrong idea which he does for a while though she clearly stated to miles at the beginning their connection was different,2023-06-03
i think because she wants him to not feel weird because yeah hes  lol,2023-06-02
she is when she meets miles,2023-06-03
fantastic news hopefully the writers get paid so we can get more quality movies like this one going forward,2023-06-02
writing is still not finished btw,2023-06-03
well mj is usually working as an actress or model so she could theoretically be pulling enough money if miguel paid people how is he acquiring currency from each universe,2023-06-10
 between 15 year olds is wrong wild take,2023-06-07
while whispering use the palms truly the best mentor in the movie and he wasnt even competing,2023-06-08
did they show chris pine spiderman endorsing products in the first film or was it just the christmas album,2023-06-02
huh interesting really wonder how they are going to explain why universe 42 didn’t fall apart,2023-06-04
"to be honest i think that while miguel isnt 100 right hes still onto something with canon events a dimension might be able to bend and accept some changes to the canon like an author adjusting the plot after it goes in a direction they didnt quite expect but bend it too much and the whole thing comes tumbling down no way home was probably able to escape an incursion due to canon events being met and and the gang actively trying to fix all these multiversal beings while mumbatten was suffering from it in a matter of minutes due to spots influence and a flagrant violation of a canon event 

we were told in multiverse of madness that thats exactly what causes incursions  people being in the wrong universe for too long

id argue its not just that its also doing things that causes ripples in the canon the more things you do or the more impactful they are the bigger the ripples until they become waves until they become tsunamis the stranges that caused incursions in mom were either repeatedly and actively sabotaging other worlds by murdering those stranges or heavily implied to be doing stuff they shouldnt have 

i was also rewatching across the spiderverse last night using a  camrip that had popcorn munching asmr but thats besides the point and i noticed that when miguel was talking about the universe he destroyed he was working with another spiderman trying to save everyone as the dimension collapsed maybe it was peter b parker due to the dialogue but what if it was that universes spiderman like no wonder it all went to  he did more than just defy canon he ripped the pen right out of the authors hand and tried to write the  story himself",2023-06-18
agree with cap was the rogue side in the civil war,2023-06-05
"comic books and their movies anime and telenovelas hace similar characteristics they have a beggining and a zillion episodes later continue rehash reboot again and again theyre tv also esthetically

whats the problem its still the same product its just not really cinema",2023-06-02
agree to disagree,2023-06-06
"i agree with the last part any movie i see better have writing more clever than stuff i come off up with off the top of my head

so i believe that if the multiverse is infinite then miguel letting one person die per universe is still letting infinite people die if you mean to say that is still preferable to letting the universes die since that infinity billions per universe is greater than the other infinity one per universe then i understand that i just see letting infinite people die after not trying very hard to think of ways to save everyone as a failure by a hero whose stated goal is saving as many people as possible

and again miles is only wrong if we take it as an absolute fact when miguel says theres no other way miguel the guy who wont try anything else wont let anyone else try and who spiderpunk doesnt trust i bring up that last bit because every other character loves spiderpunk and he helps gwen and miles so i trust his judgement more than miguels miguel is unreliable

also did the indian spidermans universe get destroyed i know it came close but i think i remember them saving it right if not the movie really glossed over that",2023-06-09
you arent both you are just othered by other americans,2023-06-06
i wonder if in universe 42 miles’ dad already became captain and died that would mean that the canon event he’s supposed to experience happened already since he is the spiderman of 42 who’s been absent from that universe,2023-06-03
yeah i understand that but thats not the story beat im concerned about per my initial post,2023-06-03
"also i can see you edited your post on peter he did it to himself in the movie that isnt an opinion

imma stand with ya on that one 

i feel better knowing gwen wasnt bonking hobie

same thats just good writing with misdirects",2023-06-02
yes i think about you all day ,2023-06-15
i think you might be genuinely slow,2023-06-19
her canon event was the pete in her universe dying though right just like original spideys event was uncle ben dying it doesnt have to be a police captain,2023-07-11
we dont know that spidergwens dad says he is going to quit but if he has a big hero moment he could still die before he officially quits,2023-06-12
perhaps thats the loophole in spiderverse universal laws that will allow miles to have a good ending,2023-07-11
miguel’s entire universe jumping collapsing story seems like it was one of those where he’s definitely omittingbending the truth my gf pointed out that he doesn’t have spiderman abilities either he shoots weird laser webs has claws to grip instead of sticky hands was never shown reacting with spidey sense has that weird fangvampire thing going etc,2023-06-05
yeah i fully expect him to be revealed to be morlun disguising himself as a spiderman you can see him turn vampire when fighting renaissancevulture for a split second his eyes turn red when hes angry and gwen even refers to him as a vampire but the good kind at some point i think they will manage to defeat the spot at the beginning of the next movie and then miguelmorlun will be the actual villain who tries to make sure that spiderpeople exist in all the universes so he can  them dry eventually,2023-06-08
miles should exist spidermiles should not,2023-06-10
miguel did say they can stop a dimension failure with luck and that sometimes they arent that lucky who knows what is involved with that luck but seems like preparation isnt the deciding factor,2023-06-06
did it show his universe collapse¿ i feel like it might not…i don’t think miguel really knows what he’s talking about tbh,2023-06-17
because while he shouldnt be spiderman its not like he shouldnt exist theres a good chance that miles would lose his dad even if he wasnt a spiderman and getting spider powers give miles an advantage of the potential of saving him which is what threatens canon there was a good chance that miles couldve turned himself into a prowler if spiderman of his dimension failed to save the police captain as this usually happens and miles already became a prowler in earth42 because his dad died especially when the first time he had his spidersense near peter of 1610 the color of spidersense was purple and green which are colors of prowler only to turn blue and red to match spiderman essentially rewriting miless destiny and since there were one original spiderman too many one had to go which explains while moments later after peter1610 discovers him he immediately meets his demise thats rough buddy,2023-07-02
exactly,2023-06-28

you forgot fixing the issues on earth 42 since its currently pretty messed up due to a lack of spiderman,2023-06-05
i am curious to see how they turn all that into a whole other 2 to 2 12 hours though because what they’ve set up alone doesn’t really feel like enough it feels like they’re already really close to what you’d think would be the final battle against the spot that’s not me doubting that they have a plan to be clear i’m just curious to see what else they have in store besides “time to fight the spot after saving miles” because obviously the whole movie isn’t gonna be just that,2023-06-05
"then the pacing is confusing  that was something that literally popped up at the end of the movie  i just dont see why they couldnt have wrapped up the plot that they gave us for 90 of the movie then throw out the prowler thing as a teaser for the 3rd  nothing in the prowler section felt like it justified an entirely new movie  that whole part was confusing anyway  

people just dont like getting blindsided by a movie that edges you for 2 hours and 20 minutes with no climax  for the record i never felt for a second dissatisfied after endgame 1 it was an incredible ending really  this felt lazy and cost saving",2023-06-03
sorry reading is fundamental  i agree entirely with your post,2023-06-03
i’m reading as much as i can and trying to debate people to figure out what i’m missing this is an amazingly beautiful phenomenally edited movie but it literally doesn’t have a conclusion how can anyone even say it’s better than the first one without watching the final act,2023-06-05
the closest thing that comes to this film in recent times is dune only difference is dune ends in the middle of the second act while spiderverse ends at the start of the third act so technically the movie is 23rd done i had the same question whether the remaining 13rd warrants a completely new film in case of dune dedicating the second film to the   other half of the story still makes sense that being said the fact that i had seen and accepted the just ends phenomenon of dunes conclusion previously i had warmed up to the spiderverse ending and it also made me excited for the upcoming film,2023-06-29
"the movie ended with the crew that escaped in the falcon setting out with an defined note on their next adventure rescuing han and preparing to defeat vader

this is exactly like how this movie ends with the rest of the crew making the choice to defy miguels wishes setting out with a defined note on their next adventure rescuing miles and preparing to defeat the spotmiguel

youre really exaggerating how little spiderverse resolves and really exaggerating how much esb resolves",2023-06-02
the central conflict of this movie was miles trying to get gwenhis other friends to help him save his father that conflict was resolved with gwen changing her mind and recruiting those friends to help save miles “resolve a conflict” this movie 100 does,2023-06-02

also that moment didn’t feel big or climactic to me because it already happened at the end of the first film they wrote themselves in a circle rather than advancing the plot introduced in this film",2023-06-07

i’ll compare it to other movies i have seen people keep throwing the infinity war ending at me like it was somehow the same or similar to atsv this simply can’t be further from the case infinity war had an entire fleshed out final act where the protagonists lost it stood on its own legs the day it was released and still stands on its own legs post endgames release 

the same cannot be said for atsv it has no resolution or conclusion by design it has no ending or cohesive final act because their brilliant plan was to make the final act a completely separate film without doing anything to even attempt a smooth transition i mean for  sake they were introducing monumental new plot points as the credits rolled man objectively  awful ending",2023-06-07
it’s incredibly simple to understand into the spiderverse was a better movie overall but this movie had a better ending ¯¯,2023-06-07

because the universe falling apart has nothing to do with spiderman canon ohara only thinks it does but mumbhattan was collapsing due to spot and oharas universe was collapsing either due to something unrelated to canon or due to how unstable living a full entire life in another dimension is he just had to rationalize it as his canon level break means no one can gwens universe isnt falling apart and neither is 42 because the whole canon thing is not nearly as  big a deal as it is ohara is the bad guy with good intentions thats the whole 2 movie arc,2023-06-05
yeah there must be a reason it didn’t immediately start to tear itself apart like mumbattan did,2023-06-05
probably fine since it never had a spiderman he cant break the canon timeline because he doesnt exist,2023-06-06

this is what gets me the actual irl spiderman canon is only that a close person to spiderman has to die for some its their partner for some its their parent or uncle for some its their best friend miles should have already had his moment  his uncle died and we see how that spurs him to keep going i didnt really follow why miguel made it seem like it had to be a parent and it had to be a police chief,2023-11-05
or after he officially quits i dont think the universe is going to care about that technicality,2023-06-14
he said that he already quit though,2023-06-15
i dont think comic book miguel has spidersense either but everything else you mentioned is definitely suspect,2023-06-06
i’m late to this but nothing about miguel’s powers is inaccurate miguel is simply a different spider with different powers that’s it his story is fundamentally different and not just a peter clone which is why i find it weird to make him the face of sticking to the canon miguel has talons on his hands and feet venomous fangs accelerated vision that affords him different vision abilities and organic webbing as he actually developed spinnerets in his arms he also has permanent red eyes that are light sensitive the only difference is the laser webs but that could just be because the filmmakers thought “spiderman from the future” would look cool with lasers and the injections seem weird other than those two things everything about miguel’s powers and biology is accurate,2023-06-18
"my gf pointed out that he doesn’t have spiderman abilities either he shoots weird laser webs has claws to grip instead of sticky hands was never shown reacting with spidey sense has that weird fangvampire thing going etc

miles also pointed this out in the movie",2023-06-20

i dont believe the feeling of wanting more is always a bad thing cliffhangers can leave an incredibly memorable impression and build up anticipation for the next chapter that feeling of uncertainty and anticipation is an exciting shared experience its why many people value weekly release schedules for tv shows over binge watching,2023-06-03
true thats probably an epilogue they can either make it a main plot point or have it be an epilogue and i think both could work equally well,2023-06-05

"bro i swear what you’ve just typed has come out of my mouth verbatim over the last couple days people are even going so far as to praise the ending of the film saying it “generates excitement” i didn’t get that at all it generated annoyance for me that they thought it was a good idea to spend the last 5 minutes of the film

my point about gwen is that spider people have succesfully snuck into the company alrady it isnt that far fetched to think another could and would have for the same reasons gwen did

im not trying to say this is the most likely theory but the whole movie shows that anyone could be spiderman so its obserd to say someone cant be because no one recognized them",2023-06-25
i completely agree i also saw online that the runtime for the third film is currently slated for an hour and a half i have no clue how they decided they needed to spend 2 and a half hours on what was covered in this film and are somehow planning to wrap up everything they left open within a much shorter film,2023-06-03

"across the spiderverse was already incredibly dense with plot theres no reason to think the pace is gonna slow significantly in the sequel in this one movie weve already seen gwens backstory and resolution to her personal conflict miles experience a character growth and is prepared to tell his parents whats going on an entire explanation of multiverse shenanigans and several characters being introduced fleshed out enough to be likeable and an entire villain backstory and powerup being laid out 

dealing with spot and getting out of earth 42 could easily fit neatly in the first half of the movie at this pace with the entire second half being dedicated to whatever the  is going on with miguel",2023-06-12
"i think the one movie could complete its dramatic arcs though while still setting up a cliffhanger for part 2 this movie set up relatively low stakes drama with him getting into his colleges and his grades and then higher stakes with the fate of his father after he becomes captain but none of those stakes are paid off in this movie i feel like what you are describing is better suited for a tv show and this movie should have resolved some of the drama we were invested in before setting up this earth 42 story for the next movie i really liked it and will probably love the 2 movies as a whole after beyond is out next year i just think watching the whole story would be better in one sitting 

this is versus a movie like infinity war that has a cliffhanger ending but the entirety of that movie stands on its own make longer movies tv shows or multipart part movies that can stand on their own instead of dragging out one narrative",2023-06-04
yeah no worries  glad you enjoyed it  i really dug it too  it was gorgeous and well done  i think just knowing ahead of time it was a two parter would have gone a long way with me and probably others like me while not detracting from the movie or its box office,2023-06-03
dune ending bothered me a hit on the first watch on the second watch it was right as rain spiderverse felt only a tad bit uneasy but the feeling of satisfacfion and excitement trumped it so sometimes going against the book can have very different results,2023-06-29

"you could have just said “no i didn’t feel the same way” and explained why

"not really the anomaly is specifically miles1610 getting bitten by a spider from another dimension when his world already had a spiderman not the idea of a miles morales becoming spiderman somewhere

the insomniac video game spiderman is a character in this movie and his miles morales is a major character in his story",2023-06-07
i believe what they’re going for unlike the original comic books is that more than one spiderperson to a dimension is practically unheard of — that normally it’s peter parker or miles morales or gwen stacy or jess drew not peter parker and miles morales and so on so forth in the case of earth42 it was meant to be miles alone only that his spider was taken by the spot — meaning he ‘created’ both the prowler and spiderman versions of miles,2023-06-07
"no lol

the point is miles morales is a spiderman like the comic version of miles is a thing in the same way gwen hobbie miguel peter ben reiley etc are all spiderman

are version of miles basically stopped that destiny for the original miles morales think of it like they traded genuine fates are miles most likely was supposed to end up like earth 42 miles since the spider was never meant for him 

both their peters die but they both take different outcomes because without the bite miles never runs into peter parker and therefore stays with uncle aaron which is technically the life are miles was supposed to have",2023-06-12
" they can look similar but they dont all look identical even the human ones

the point of earth42 is that its an upside down version of miles universe its logical that their peter would be similar to chris pines peter",2023-06-26
i guess i should say that my opinion is mostly based from reading the miles comics from his beginning his character has never been super well defined except for how he’s different from peter and even then it’s mostly by his raceparents this ending made me finally feel like miles was becoming his own distinct personality the way he never has in the comics or really even the first movie until now he could’ve been interchangeable from peter parker and the story wouldn’t be that different,2023-06-07
nope a work of art does exactly what it wants to it’s not there to cater to entitled schmucks who throw a tantrum over a cliffhanger,2023-06-02

i bet they got all in voiceanimation etc and just editing cutting stuff and some final render taking from another angle etc 

there might be additional voice acting additional scenes added but main writing jobs are already done

if there is a big story hole in the middle in the movie i think safe to assume that beyond will be delayed for another year",2023-06-07
" miguel also owns whats left of alchemax right

when did they say that",2023-06-20
"so lets see

 beginning middle and end check unless you really think its impossible for a movie to be a two parter and even if you dont the first spiderverse movie fully fits into that niche 

 themes arcs conflict and enemies all present 

 spiderverse explains itself well and is perfectly enjoyable for someone who isnt a fan of spiderman but otherwise if you think that a movie literally cant be based on anything and has to be wholly original youre joking yourself looking at the top 10 highest rated movies on imdb 8 of them are based on something else 

 saying cheap lazy stuff like the multiverse seems like its just trying to avoid having to say real criticisms of the movie there are tons of noncomicbook movies that use the concept of alternate realities and multiverses

and seriously dude  in boots is reliant on a ton of stuff its a sequel to a spinoff of another series which draws 90 of its characters from fairytales and myth just from the recent movie

  in boots himself

 the big bad wolf

 little jack horner

 goldilocks and the three bears

plus countless other references in jacks collection 

youre just gatekeeping the concept of cinema and making arbitrary exceptions for movies that you like",2023-06-02
now that is the mystery comicbook miguel had underwent gene therapy with spider dna by accident or by sabotage depending on canon and thats what turned him into spiderman of 2099 i dont think he ever needed to continually inject himself with a serum,2023-06-06
i assume it was something to keep his vampyric powers in check,2023-06-09
"yea i just personally feel it was very poorly executed and the only excuse people can give it is “i’m excited for the next movie”

like yea that’s what any cliffhanger is meant to do that doesn’t mean this one isn’t objectively messier than basically any other cliffhanger i’ve ever seen everyone wants to act like it’s “my opinion” but i have objective reason for why i feel this way

just feels like everyone wants to sweep it under the rug",2023-06-29
"that i can respect but it doesn’t mean the ending of this movie was better than the first it just means it had a larger impact on you personally

i’ll would sit here all night and argue with you why it objectively isn’t a comparison between the two but that seems like it would be a waste of both of our time

i don’t have any issue with your opinion and am glad that you got something out of the movie that i think it was sorely missing happy for you boss just simply am not in the same boat",2023-06-07
and art is worth nothing without someone to admire it i simply don’t in this particular case of this particular film lot of good art  writing for an ending,2023-06-02
i have only a limited memory of the original 2099 comics run but there was a point where miguel actually became ceo of alchemax idk how closely spideverse is following the comics but given how much money miguel has at his disposal i wouldn’t be surprised if he still owns alchemax or some variation of it,2023-06-21
"and is perfectly enjoyable for someone who isnt a fan of

ah yes i forgot this one these streaming series have fanboys fans a loyal base obsessed with it with every episode they want desesperately to call them movies because the main objective is to justify the childish obsession around a teen in spandex tv is small movies are big tv comes out like machine gun bullets marvel movies are a missile james cameron",2023-06-03
i mean yes objectively on paper the cliffhanger shouldnt really work but thats not how we engage with art right everyone sees what their general reaction is towards the ending because the entirety of the film is really well done especially visually people have been more open to the kind of haphazard ending it slapped onto the film,2023-06-30
maybe it is just my personal opinion but i view these movies are character driven so having an undefined main character is a glaring flaw to me into the spider verse is otherwise such a groundbreaking incredible movie that in spite of that i couldn’t really fault it but i am so glad they finally made miles a really unique character in this movie and that deserves major props,2023-06-07
again your entitlement is only a reflection on you not the film which is already a critical and commercial success grow up,2023-06-02

"nah def not just your opinion my best friend has been saying the exact same things to me for days he also has been accepting the points i’m bringing as valid and agrees that the movie had an objectively  ending

he said and i quote “i gave it a 1010 not because i thought it was perfect but because it had a lasting emotional impact on me” and i respect that feeling i just can’t respect using an objective scale or excusing things away as “perfect” when they simply aren’t a lot of it just comes off as sensationalism to me and not genuine",2023-06-07
a lot of imperfect things have critical and commercial success it’s ok to say it’s a good movie i personally think it was a good movie i just also personally think the ending was objectively handled like  i dont know why you’re taking it so personal,2023-06-02
"i dont do american rethorics

yes my position is that is tv in the big screen like hollywood serials from the 1930s were tv before tv was invented in the cinema i was thinking that looks like a big tv thing its the same screen but i feel i should pause it to grab some chips and go back to this or that or watch the next episode and look another superficial conversation filler i guess they need it for syndication ah no again im in a cinema uh",2023-06-03
