i was very disappointed that the fighters from the music planet didn’t do some choreographed fight musical scene i feel like that was a real wasted opportunity they just fought like any nameless grunts very meh movie but i had a good crowd,2023-11-10 04:27:25
very messy just didn’t capture my interest one nitpick i have that i don’t see people talking about is how easily captain marvel solved hala’s problem like not only did it make the whole movie pointless but it makes it seem like she didn’t try all that hard to fix it like apparently she was trying to do lol,2023-11-10 08:53:51

so carol danvers is disney princess right she married to a prince she sang and she has animal sidekick,2023-11-10 03:06:33
"i’m not an mcu person and i haven’t seen one since end game except guardians 3 i watched on a plane and honestly i thought this movie was kinda fun reading articles and headlines i expected this to be absolute garbage based on what people were saying and i don’t really get that it’s not great but i thought it was a good time they didn’t dwell on things for too long and the actionfight scenes where they would teleport in and out was enjoyable 

some threads had people claiming they walked  out halfway through and saying it’s the worst mcu movie they’ve ever seen i can’t speak to that but man people seem exceptionally harsh on this it’s like they’re trying to outdo each other by exaggerating how bad they think it is i thought it was fun and fast paced and had some cool scenes this is from the perspective of someone who doesn’t really have much invested in the mcu for what that’s worth",2023-11-10 18:47:20
the dress carol wears during the dance with prince yen is beautiful and the closest we will ever get to a disney princess from marvel studios,2023-11-10 03:11:01
"not a terrible film by any means but just very mediocre and forgettable the mehvels the middles maybe the most wait for disney of all the mcu films 510

the good

 iman vellani really carried the movie on her back her squealing and oh my  was a bit annoying in the first act but once she chilled out a bit she had an infectious earnestness and enthusiasm that helped the film a lot

 kamalas family were hilarious

 they let brie larson show off a little more personality and levity here which was good

 a few decent action beats

 it moves fast i could barely believe it was over when it ended a backhanded compliment perhaps but it was nice to see an mcu film zip by so breezily

 i respect it for having 2 of the weirdest scenes in the entire mcu  the dancing scene and the flerken scene i think tonally they do create some issues but at least theyre trying to do something different and these scenes have actual personality rather than just being generic formulaic slop

 no idea why people are saying the beast cgi was bad i thought he looked pretty great

the bad

 the plot is just completely paperthin and close to being actual nonsense and to make it worse its powered by so much boring expository dialogue i was just mentally checked out as soon as they started waffling about jump points quantum bands etc tedious

 villain is one of the mcus worst their motivation is actually really interesting on paper but the film seems almost terrified to engage with it in any sort of nuance for fear of making carol look like a bad person or sloppyreckless superhero it just feels really glossed over i suspect this was more fleshed out in earlier cuts of the film zawe ashton deserves way better

 some of the editing was pretty choppy it was very obvious where stuff was ripped out of the movie

 body switching gimmick wasnt used very creatively great idea but they didnt do much worthwhile with it and the film was totally inconsistent with when and how they swap i guess you just have to check your brain at the door for the sake of movie logic but it was noticeable

 the tone is a trainwreck perhaps a problem with the film being blatantly cut to pieces but it rushes way too fast from deadserious scenes to insanely goofy ones proper mood whiplash

 monica gets the short shrift here feels like a passenger in the story compared to the other two not great for a film called the marvels

 one of the mcus most forgettable musical scores literally cant remember a single thing about it

 nick fury felt like a totally different character from secret invasion just a quip factory

 brie larsons autotuned voice made my ears bleed thank  it was short

 i thought the vfx were mostly fine but those shots of the ship flying when carol took over near the end looked horrible   super fuzzy and smooth like a bad video game cutscene

 the final scene and midcredits scene are gonna confuse so many people who havent seen the d shows or have just a passing interest in the mcu  though going by the box office none of those people are actually gonna see this one theatrically",2023-11-10 13:50:10
"why is every single opinion that isn’t “this is literally the worst film ever” being accused of being a paid shill

things are allowed to be okay or flawed without being the worst thing on earth

i never thought i’d say this about a mcu movie but it was way too short the first act is much too rushed and needed more room to breathe you can tell the movie was edited to death would have been much better as a second carol solo movie before doing a team up in the third complaints aside i enjoyed it for what it was,2023-11-10 03:37:03
"better than antman quantumania for sure 

spoiler free there is no post end credits scene so after the midcredits you can leave",2023-11-10 03:10:29
"so much of this movie is positively  bonkers a musical planet man eating cats with pocket dimensions in their belly going on a rampage set to memory  cgi kelsey grammer beast kamala somehow knowing the exact nick fury speech

but really the film can be summed up in the scene where carol reveals her sing language husband can speak because hes bilingual if this gets a laugh out of you like it did me youll get some enjoyment out of this if you groan heavily may as well leave it aint gonna get much better

other than this this movie was clearly edited to  in the room and some parts werent clear as someone who didnt watch ms marvel how did kamala use her powers without the bangles but overall had a good time larson is allowed to tap into her charm here parris is good vellani great but yeah the movie around them is otherwise an entertaining frankenfilm

carol danverscaptain marvel  became a disney princess in the land of songs married to a kpop idol s

kamala khanms marvel  doing her best nick fury impersonation to recruit kate bishop for a young avengers team up 

monica rambeau  utilizing the “multiverse saga” by zapping herself into the xmenverse

"just watched it thought it was awful tbh
had a few thoughts though regarding the kree

1 why didnt they just move to a different planet

2 how the  didnt it turn into an icy wasteland without a sun nor atmosphere

3 when they flooded the seas on hala why didnt it tsunami or tidal wave

4 why didnt they use uninhabited systems to rebuild hala

ps how do the deaf or mute comunicate on sing planet do they just break dance at people",2023-11-19 14:47:09
this looked like a made for tv crossover movie reminds me of power rangers the suitsmakeup looked low budget,2023-11-11 21:29:41
"as an casual mcu viewer  its absurd that im expected to watch and remember 3 movies and 4 tv shows to fully grasp the plot of one of these now 

like they should expect that not everyone going to watch their attempt at a blockbuster is as invested in the universe as each other a little exposition would be nice 

i had to keep looking stuff up on my phone because i had no idea what was going on and it makes me even less likely to watch the next mcu movie and therefore less invested in the franchise a vicious cycle",2023-11-18 17:06:27
how fullempty was your theater mine was about 80 free seats,2023-11-10 03:34:57
"it’s both a movie that has too much on its plate for its runtime and simultaneously would be ruined by being any longer the film has three leads one of whom has only appeared in her own tv show another who we only saw as a child in the previous film and has had the majority of her character’s status quo written in a different show it’s a lot of balls to juggle at once especially considering they have to introduce a new villain whose backstory is connected to the events of the first film the premise behind the film of the characters swapping places subplots ranging from using space cats as extradimensional storage containers for people to the “we’re doing a musical episode” planet plus setting up more things for marvel’s multiverse plans as seen in the postcredits

the best parts of the movie are the bits where they’re allowing themselves to have fun the musical planet the escape pawds sequence and just the small interactions between the three leads can be bonkers in a way that’s able to distract from the marvel formula we’ve been watching for the past ten or so years making a longer film to expand upon anything even the fun parts would make the film drag and lead to a worse product

i’ve seen all the shows aside from secret invasion hope that skrull emperor didn’t have a whole lot of backstory in that that i missed so i’m not coming at this from a place of confusion it has good things going for it but it’s taking characters we’ve seen only once or twice and throwing them in the mix with too many other new elements for us to fully take in any of it",2023-11-10 04:10:47
it was fine  didnt out stay its welcome  everything with the flerkens landed for me especially the music choice  the singing planet was creative but too jarring to work for me and it got annoying fast  action scenes overall were enjoyable  sheronan was completely forgettable and i think it would have worked better to start the movie with the backstory instead of just leaving me going huh until the 2nd half of the movie  after credit scene got a smile out of me,2023-11-10 12:59:24
that beast cgi was some asylum films level ,2023-11-10 03:10:17
"i still have an issue where the mcu clearly doesnt understand the power level of its characters despite showing it in earlier things why didnt captain marvel merely fly through all the bad guy ships as soon as she saw them thus saving the skrull home and then afterwards the waterworld weve seen her do it and yet nope not to mention she could have tried the sun thing years before but that one i can let go

also of course we have an enemy that counters light based powers how about we send anyone who doesnt have light based powers at her they even had valkyrie in the movie if its gonna be a full girls get it done thing at least go fully into it not to mention her and carol being so friendly despite maybe exchanging 5 words before this on screen

coulda been worse at least it was a little fun and the xmen showing up is awesome i liked it better than the last one",2023-11-19 23:36:32
iman vellani is hilarious,2023-11-10 04:50:39
"as a fan i liked the movie i loved the twisted fighting scenes and the comedy was good from kamala it made me laugh a few times out loud  


the cringe thing about the movie for me was the singing planet it just didnt make any sense for me  


the villan wasnt even in the movie that much and i was confused about her reasons at first untill we saw the flashback about captain marvel destroying the supreme inteligence i dont remember seeing her do that in anything was it the last movie i didnt think it was in there so felt like i missed something  


other than that it was a good watch and tied up a lot of things excited to see deadpool 3 which i think is where the mcu will bring it back into line they are obviously going through a phase of change and this shows i the recent movies not being all that good  
i still think this movie is better than love and thunder and about the same as dr strange 2",2023-11-10 12:55:05
"i liked it i wasn’t a fan of some of the lines being super quiet and it was kinda odd

"horrible editing in the first act this poor film got demolished in the editing room

boring uninspired villain whose plan is the same plot as spaceballs

kamala khan and her family were fun and brought some charm to it brie larson was so checked out though i don’t blame her",2023-11-10 06:22:01
i didnt hate this the marvel formula has gotten pretty stale and this might be the most generic villain in the history of the mcu but i still had some fun with it vellani puts this movie on her back and carries it the cats needle drop got a good laugh out of me it was nice to see blue frasier having said that the mcu is going to crash and burn if they cant figure out a way to change up their formula fast its starting to feel really lazy,2023-11-10 03:05:56
its as okay as every other marvel movie is its just that society is now starting to reject these they put even less work into the characterization than usual but there were a few fun scenes like the first switcheroo fight the musical planet and the cat thing plus it was only like 90 minutes instead of a two and a half hour chore its fine its whatever,2023-11-10 09:12:05
"the hate was overblown it has a lot of pacingediting issues but it is far from being the 3rd worst mcu film

iman vellani is perfect teyonah parris has some really great dramatic scenes and brie delivers some quirky  silly lines that i wish the film pushed harder her surprisingly few interactions with fury were great and its a shame he barely gets to do anything

honestly they should delete secret invasion because not only is it godawful  worthless but fury from the show and this fury are like two different people if you delete the show then it works better because hes just the same depiction from the original captain marvel

the khan family are icons and im glad they were in the whole movie as opposed to just the opening

darbenn is lame but her motivation is serviceable zawes performance is as good as it can be with a script like this definitely a phase 12 villian ouch



also i dont get the reviews claiming this film has pandering female representation

they never mention they are women once in the film no girl power scenesnothing

really confused legit professional critics said that these imaginary scenes bothered them

like complain about the original captain marvel all you want guys but these scenes

they dont exist lol",2023-11-10 03:40:31
"i hate the new tone of the mcu the movies used to be drama with a hint of comedy now it’s the other way around this movie  kamala khan is cringe annoying not funny…there’s nothing believable about her as a super hero she doesn’t even have the athleticism going for her i hate her character even if it’s true to the comics instead of one annoying sidekick she has her whole annoying family

the singing and dancing planet was ridiculous and not in a good way

the villain was lame the end fight scene was lame there was no real buildup or payoff it just sort of happened is she stronger than thanos

captain marvel’s costume was awful usually the mcu costumes get better as they go how did hers go from captain marvel and endgame to the boring suit she had on in this movie

210 almost walked out multiple times couldn’t wait for it to end",2023-11-16 04:08:41
"feels like people are trying to say nice things about this movie because they like iman vellani and i respect that but honestly i thought this movie was a complete mess awful villain pacing all over the place forgettable action  the humor had me rolling my eyes constantly 

i honestly went in with an open mind after seeing a few threads about how the reviews were overly harsh but after seeing it i’m not sure they were harsh enough i recognize i may not be the target audience for this movie but this is bottom tier mcu content imo",2023-11-15 20:27:58
walking through wanda’s magic wall is the worst origin story in the mcu,2023-11-16 01:05:47
"movie didnt bomb because its a bad movie movie bombed because no one cares about the characters anymore the mcu is just a bunch of guys now theres no characters that you really care about despite most of them having multiple appearances by this point and they just dont wanna see marvel movies anymore

people cried when spiderman got dusted when tony died in peppers arms

no one is shedding a tear over captain marvel or falconbuthesgotcapsshieldnow

marvel shifted from making movies about characters that we care about so that were interested in ensemble films to making movies that are strictly 2 hour advertisements for an ensemble film theyve gone full dc in 2016  vomiting out midatbest movies to sell us the next movie instead of making us care about the people in the movies were currently watching so we want to see them with other characters we care about at least thats how ive felt with lately every postendgame movie that wasnt spiderman nwh

will be curious to see if they can pull out of the tailspin better hope they can because superman legacys casting so far has been amazing the last thing marvel needs rn is competent dc movies coming out to  up the space",2024-01-07 14:20:40

"a few brief points

 it was funnier than expected laughed quite a bit
 iman as kamala is a delight as always as is her family
 nice to see carol relaxed and showing more personality opening up more and so on
 all the flerkittens were adorable and that whole escape sequence was wild
 i figured there would be some multiverse shenanigans but i didnt expect beast to show up especially not that particular version cgi could have been better but it was a midcredits scene
 one of the few times the villain had an objectively good as in positive motivation but going about it in all the wrong ways i expected the marvels to all team up and reignite halas sun after cutting short the confrontation somehow
 we could see the young avengers bit coming a mile away but i didnt expect kamala to be the one rounding them up",2023-11-10 03:38:03
"all the praise summed up

its fun

its funny

brie larson is a disney princess i may be the only redditor pointing this out1

kamala is the star valid

but jesus what low standards rmovies has when it comes to blockbusters feels like we just eat up every last crumb of turn your brain off its not supposed to be oscarworthy slop",2023-11-10 08:48:18
i consider myself to be an intelligent person yet throughout the film i frequently struggled to follow the plot and had little idea of what was happening is this the film’s fault or should i get my brain scanned to make sure i’m not succumbing to a neurological disorder,2023-11-10 05:49:29
another marvel midmovie the antagonist wasnt interesting 23 marvels are uninteresting the only interesting part is the after credits scene and thats it really 510,2023-11-10 22:42:29
went in with low expectations it was a fun movie lots of funny parts im glad the 3rd act wasnt another cgi battle,2023-11-10 03:36:16
one of the worst edited films i’ve ever seen had no clue what the  was going on watched fresh meat and i couldn’t help but laugh every time the villain was on screen she was so over the top brie larson did not give a flying  and was acting like a hyperactive child at times kamala was the only good part left halfway through what a  this franchise has become also captain marvel was essentially a warmongering genocidal  wasn’t very easy to root for her,2023-11-15 17:31:50

"your main villain who does the world ending action by slamming her two maguffins together is not once stopped by just throwing her hammer to the bottom of the ocean or something

or just have capt marvel grab her and fly her to space she can’t fly what’s she gonna do

or have one person in a big ol space prison and another grab the person they swap and bingo bongo they’re in space prison

this movie had some heavy  shoes to fill given how op capt marvel was in endgame and they never use her full potential she was worried about not being strong enoug her one time and restarted the sun super easily",2023-11-10 03:09:11
"i feel like at this point marvel movies are a litmus test for whatever you want to see the marvels has clearly been tampered with and edited to shreds and if you want to criticize it you can certainly focus on that and if you want to enjoy it you can certainly find the fun in here and if you want to like it it is a perfectly fine movie with three charismatic leads i think the main problem with this whole phase of marvel is that these movies feel like theyve lost their impact or any hope of standing out of the now 30 show and movie crowd 

i had an okay time watching this movie i love the trio of leads and the concept of them switching is kind of fun yet chaotic its a bit too chaotic to highlight the action really well in that first house fight sequence and the rules of the switching are really poorly defined and later in the movie feel like it happens when its a convenience thought it was odd we got a whole really fun imo training montage of them figuring it out then the second it comes time to use it on the ocean planet they  it up 

but its sequences like that montage or the really fun memory scene where this movie is the most comfy brie and iman are so charismatic and fun to watch in the previous movie carol was dealing with memory loss and brainwashing so she didnt get much of a personality and when she shows up since then its usually to punch and dip so it was nice to see her get to let a little more loose here teyonah is great but her character is a bit more reserved and low key 

the villain had kind of an interesting idea where brie just shows up to her planet and destroys its economy and refuses to elaborate honestly kinda crazy that that wasnt captain marvel 2 because i feel like they really set us up for a major annette bening villain and then yadda yaddad it in this movie but the villain isnt given the time or the writing to stand out as anything more than a ronan clone

the main problems with this movie are how it feels so pasted together it really feels like now that marvel has set this long term precedence but also used most their recognizable brands that they arent calling their shots as well anymore and so a movie like this that has two tv shows of backstory and is also setting up major plotlines in the future suddenly feels less like its own thing and more like its in service of the big picture and the plot of this specific thing takes a backseat to that it feels like things were cut out rearranged or added by people that arent the creative force behind it and thats very distracting

overall it was a perfectly good time at the movies i got a few laughs a nice surprise here and there but its not in the top half of marvel content and it feels a bit disposable 610 for me

ps that was definitely kelsey grammar right

"so after all the people talking up how good this movie really was in rmarvelstudios i thought id give it a try and watch it on disney

my rating 610disappointing

the bad

1 no backstory  no proper backstory or introduction of our characters we have 2 new superheroes and you cant assume everyone has watched the shows but nothingwe got a new space station but no explanation of what its doing we got jump points everywhere with no explanation of where they came from and how earthlings are using them we got a villain with no real introduction we got bangles with again no real backstory either no real explanation of how the entanglement worked who are these 300 year old people on the space ship
2 poor editing  the number of times where sequences occurred with huge jumps in between was jarring one sec captain marvel is on earth the next shes on another planet like seconds later one sec captain marvel is on the moons surface the next shes up in the sky touching a jump point
3 underwhelming story captain marvel destroyed a computer and all of a sudden shes blamed for destroying the atmosphere sun and oceans of an entire planet  they went from a straight to z without any explanation and everyone is like yup she did it now we just gotta beat up the villain who has no powers of her own so its 3 superheroes a teen girl vs a kree girl with a hammer yeah those odds look really bad
4 messed up power scaling as usual the power scaling is so inconsistent its laughable captain marvel able to explode ships by flying through them able to jump starts suns byexploding through them but she struggles to fight a single kree warrior she instead spends the entire time turbo charging the villains bracelet with her powers even when she gets the jump on the villain shes not able to do any damage to her punches smashing into the space ship nothing hurts her apparently we never even got to fully understand monicas abilities and when its a 3 on 1 why is everyone attacking the fricking bangle it makes no sense that 3 superheroes are only able to hit one small part of a persons body
5 random  just happeningwhat was up with the cats and the space station i cant even tell what damaged the space station was it the cat eggs then the cats all saved the humans just a big   then the planet where everyone communicates in song another big cringe 
6 since when do the skrulls have their own planet the entire secret invasion series was about them trying to relocate the skrulls and coming to the conclusion theres no place or planet for them we dont even learn where they went to with valkyrie are those ten gonna join the million others on earth now
7 that endinghonestly i felt nothing after losing the new character we knew nothing about and that too why did it have to be closed from the other side again another big  also they never show what happened to the planets that had their atmosphere and water stolen lastly why is captain marvel keeping one of the bangles

the good

1 ms marvels acting and dialogue were actually entertaining as was her brother and dad the mother got annoying
2 special effects were fine not sure what people were criticizing
3 i like that theyre trying to tie in mutants now but its kinda weird how its being done",2024-02-12 03:27:25
well this threads gonna be a  show but i enjoyed the movie was it high cinema no did i have fun yes is a movie allowed to be that yes it is in my opinion i’ll probably remember the “memories” scene longer than a lot of other bits i saw this year,2023-11-10 03:46:39

"my very personal opinion

1 this movie deserved the dismal box office weekend it got
2 there was no character development
3 there was no emotional investment opportunities
4 acting was wooden and robotic except iman vellani but one can only see so much fansimp
5 nick fury  wheres the fury wheres the angry man reduced to a pitiful weak clueless piece of acting that is just totally offkey
6 singing planet was the ultimate cringe i know in the comics it was a planet that communicated through poetry and rhyme this songdance routine was like they decided the dancingsinging in miss marvel needed a part 2 huge pass from me
7 the casting for darbenn was totally wrong imo zawe ashton excudes zero animosity and has very limited expressive range she ties with malekith for worst mcu movie villain
8 flerken scene was funny just about the only saving grace of the whole movie
9 postcredit scene was more exciting than the entire movie",2023-11-13 13:25:19
this is a wait for it come out on disney and watch while you’re doing something else kinda movie,2023-11-10 03:51:17
did we watch the same movie i love marvel but man we really have lived through the golden age of marvel movies it seems this was so average like it’s not terrible but jesus marvel have really lost their way isn’ also try staying away from youtube reviews they are all extremely negative and massively biased i feel like they almost need to hate on all marvel properties to keep staying relevant  watch the movie or better yet wait for it to come out on disney part of me thinks it will be out on streaming pretty soon to boost sales figures then make up your mind,2023-11-11 03:10:45
"it wasnt good

its just another marvel movie but unfortuantely one of their worst ones the action cgi and effects are solid and there are some good performances but it was mainly boring the narrative feels sloppy and none of the characters were interesting the direction was okay but it felt a bit all over the place the humor is pretty rough and some dialogue is really bad 

overall nothing much and was mostly boring

410",2023-11-10 03:05:41
"i enjoyed this movie and the action from the three leads including brie larson of course was awesome why on earth did these great action scenes look so lackluster in the trailer 

but weve seen two captain marvel solo movies and we still dont know what kind of personality this character is even with the exception of her first solo movie where she was “on her way to finding herself” captain marvel definitely felt like a stoic and harsh character in endgame i didnt think it was that bad 

but captain marvel in this movie it was just like “brie larson having a good time on a movie set” its so odd that one of the most important characters in the marvel cinematic universe doesnt have a consistent personality and im sure this isnt the actors or directors fault how many more years will we have to wait to really learn about this character",2023-11-10 10:08:24
"honestly not as bad as people make it out to be i’m not saying it’s perfect but it’s enjoyable some of the more creative fight sequences i’ve seen with the stitching even though it wasn’t consistent 

also iman is a treasure i really hope big things for her",2023-11-10 03:22:21
"forgettable villain but honestly had a blast with the rest appreciated the tight runtime even if it did make some sequences feel choppy edited considering the simplicity of the story i think the runtime was a wise choice

i just wish the writers put more effort into the villain it’s quite bizarre that after a decade of mcu villain criticism the writersproducers think that this is acceptable the actress did fine but the writing and character design were pretty meh",2023-11-10 03:54:19
"the action was smooth and the pace was steady  the story was  is going on and why

the singing planet interlude was dumb and nothing that happened in it made sense  it only existed for the one joke and the give the characters their comic costumes scene  the villain was one dimensional and left no impression  the main macguffin is never actually a point anyone really cares about other than to say they care about it  most of the events have no reason to occur  why did the station break down and the climax comes out of literally nowhere  it was never built up to or even hinted at it just suddenly happens  and i dont even know who was moving into that house at the end was it danvers  the khans both

this must have a whole other movie that actually makes sense on the floor",2023-11-12 06:02:32
i went in skeptical but genuinely wanting it to be good  i am still in disbelief at just how bad it was  i’m not gloating  it’s super disheartening this is the worst mcu movie and it isn’t even close  no amount of astroturfing is going to change that  disney  the bed on this one,2023-11-15 02:22:45

i liked it,2023-11-26 17:08:27
this movie was straight up garbage comparably it made the first captain marvel look like a top tier shm i don’t know what all the people giving positive reviews are smoking but i wish i had some while watching this,2024-01-18 07:19:29
"holy  that movie was awful it felt completely soulless the plot was meh and a lot of the funny bits didnt land it was also just weird at times 

normally i dont think actors are at fault for bad movies but what the  was going on with brees acting in the field scene where she reveals the reason for the anihilator title ive genuinely seen better performances in highschool plays 

there were parts of the movie that i felt it started working its way towards being a good movie and then it would take a nose dive 

im not sure if it was better or worse than quantumania but it was certainly worse than morbius",2024-02-03 12:17:13
skrulls can’t catch a  break smh,2024-02-08 06:50:33
all the thousands of reddit comments here saying the hate was overblown made me excited to watch this on disney plus but now i see they are paid disney shills wow was this bad lazy filmmaking very slow boring start to the movie rushed plot and bad editing and pacing very weak villain dumb comedy moments one of the worst of 2023,2024-02-11 06:35:49
not the worst mcu movie but bottom 10 might be the most forgettable villain in the mcu so far,2024-02-14 03:04:57
"to me the marvels came across as captain marvels version of thor ragnarok it is significantly more lighthearted positive in tone and willing to take itself less seriously at times when compared to the first movie and i was in the right mood to enjoy that

i loved the change in tone for the most part but it does result in some questionable bits i think this one will be polarizing also partly due to the marketing which imo failed to accurately portray the feeling of watching the movie in a similar way to what happened to elemental like elemental it exceeded my expectations and i ended up more invested than anticipated

its biggest weakness is unfortunately the villain that character didnt really grab my attention and it kinda feels like some of her screen time was cut to make the movie shorter her motivations made sense but the plot focused on the consequences of her actions more than her as a character

i was actually stunned by the 3d it is the second best ive experienced this year and one should absolutely watch in stereo if possible the hyperstereo space shots were reminiscent somewhat of the spaceship bits from captain harlock  awesome theres a glorious animated sequence near the start that is stylized as though its in a notebook and it pops in 3d much like spiderverse 1 did in that format

as someone who generally just adores scifi imagery it was a true delight in that regard there were some visuals in space like those of megastructureesque spacecraft a biome reminiscent of the paradise at the start of valerian station vistas jump gates galore and planetary rings seen from an extreme angle which i really liked

although the movie grabbed me for much of the runtime there are definitely exceptions and some inconsistencies in the visual presentation the mcu generic empty field area does make a couple brief appearances and a few bits looked rushed or flat im guessing more reshoots or last minute changes occurred than for guardians 3 which seemed more visually coherent use of the imax aspect ratio felt extremely deliberate in a similar vein to guardians 3 but maybe even moreso in some places to the point where i dont know how theyll choose to crop certain shots for scope theaters lol

on a personal level i felt torn while watching in the sense that this may represent the end of an era for big budget fun comic movies or the beginning of a new one id like to see more but there is tough competition this month and im skeptical itll be profitable really feels like it could go either way for disney again a winner due to word of mouth overwhelming the marketing failure like elemental or an immediate flop like indiana jones the production value is high and it seems like a full tier 1 project  for instance the credits and even the post credits scene were done in full stereo 3d to the same quality as the rest of the production which is not the case for all mcu movies",2023-11-10 04:20:26
 the haters that was fun the villain forgettable sorry was just a plot device but the movies more about the marvels relationships and history anyways i’d watch it again,2023-11-11 23:04:34
there was a jack sparrow reference and it made me smile overall this got way too much hate for no reason not even the worst marvel piece of media this year 6510,2023-11-12 01:47:05
"this has no excuse to be this generic bland and still using the old mcu formula after 33rd films the boring and dull villain the good guys win in in the end the important thing being the post credits scene

and the production value felt cheap like it was filmed on a low budget or in a single set even gotg3 or antman felt bigger in scope but here like 20 of the film occurs in the villain ship and other 20 in the spaceship of fury and it’s just so boring

also why was brie acting carol as flashezra like an odd and introvert got when she wasn’t like that before and brie was still in fast x mood with the same hairdo and shirtless tanks

overall it was messy disjointed and felt like the season finale of a disney show not a 270m movie at this point it must be a disney scam",2023-11-12 07:55:14
"its a film with lots of fun bits i know thats become a dirty word in these replies that arent connected together very well 

i know thats not the most ringing endorsement but to read some of the advance talk youd think it was as disastrous as quantumania and it really really is not for all the marvels plotting issues main character tediously resists telling her colleagues about the villainous threat is not one of them i also think itll ultimately end up with less vitriol sticking to it than thor love and thunder and the eternals

this is a comparison that will probably turn off even more people but honestly the comparison that most came to mind for me was thor the dark world wait dont run away by which i mean that there is a great action gimmick the portalgravity redirection stuff in tdw the teleportation stuff here thats the highlight of a film with some messy storytelling

because the connective tissue between plot points is very flimsy i know people complain about the length of blockbusters and will be relieved that this one is so short but i think a few of these moments could have had a little bit of extra time devoted to linking them up more solidly in particular

 the skrull mayors anger at carol after the evacuation the fate of the watersong planet after they leave wrapped up in a single line at the end about how all the planets were fine the convenience and timing of their correct guess that the watersong planet will be the next place the villain goes
 the climactic threat starts off being a giant realitysplitting tear ripping matter off our sun and then switches to what might or might not be a different giant realitysplitting tear through which no material is flowing
 i wonder if the first body swap was significantly reedited carol takes the first one from the barren planet to kamalas house in her stride without mentioning it afterwards until after another one has happened it felt like the final film places that first switch slightly earlier in captain marvels pov than it was originally intended to be
 carol has been spending 30 years using that skrull gadget to try and get her memories back i dont quite buy that she seemed to regain plenty of memories of earth at the end of the first one i think that by the time shes lived longer in space than she has on earth shed realise that her attempts at memory recovery are probably hitting diminishing returns

fortunately the central trio helps paper over most of the cracks in the film carol gets more moments of lightheartedness than she did in her first movie she doesnt suddenly become a quipper but the complaints about the first film that shes free of charisma and personality dont apply here the film also comes up with a good reason why she didnt return to earth between the mid90s and thanoss snap monica gets to be more than just technobabbledelivering scientist and kamala is as delightful as in her tv series particularly in the best bit of the movie her animated fancomic sequence

also nick fury is back to being more entertaining to watch than he was in the astonishingly dull secret invasion which thankfully is never mentioned

the two scenes of tonal whiplash that i predict will probably get the most criticism

 first the musicalprincess dance scene it gets away with it because of monicas bemused what the  am i watching reactions of course i know that in itself will annoy the people who complain why can marvel never commit to being earnest and sincere instead of constantly winking at the the audience
 then theres the herding catsflerken kitten escape pods thing im not sure that really worked for me  it felt like it would have been more at home in a guardians of the galaxy movie than it was here especially since gotg3 had a big spaceship evacuation involving loads of animals

i misheard a line in the final scene kamala says did you know  has a daughter i originally misheard the name as ammit and wondered why she was talking about the goddess from moon knight then i realised it made more sense for her to say antman",2023-11-10 16:07:05

due to the lackluster trailer i expected to be underwhelmed by this film but i liked how the swapping of the marvels played into the action  still loved kamalas family and thought the singing planet was clever enough

why start of kamala in her suit in the opening fight but magically end up in civilian clothes at the end of it
why bring the family up to a space station then have it break down
why even have a subplot of a failing space station
carol reigniting the star was much more easier compared to how risky it sounded
why does the kree city look intact despite it going though a civil war that got rid of its oceans and put out it star

personally i wish they spent some more time in the some places while cutting off some of the fluff but i get the urge for movie makers to make it more wacky for general audiences",2023-11-11 09:28:14

only reason i dont give a full on negative review is that marvel really struck gold with kamala and her family they are a bundle of charismaand i kinda hope that now that kamala is really starting to become more than a street level hero that they still find some purpose for her family in future movies

but man oh man what is up with that cgi and that editing there were multiple times when i noticed a cgi puppet becoming the real actor and vice versa and at least one instance of a line that was very very obviously awkwardly edited in",2024-01-17 12:28:12

its aimed at a younger audience and is very much a carton disney style film

imagine if winter solider was a kids film instead of the serious film we got it could have been the 4th or 5th and it be fine like how thor became more comedy later on

this film lacked a proper villian to match caps powers its like seeing superman struggle fighting humans this film should have just been about captain marvel

the film isnt bad its just not what people wanted for comic book fans

making it longer might have helped too

but yeah just disappointed really that will have to wait so long for the next captain marvel film",2024-01-19 13:33:56

"i just watched this movie yikes it was even worse than i was expecting definitely a solid ftier marvel movie here are my thoughts about the movie

plot made no  sense at all

brie larson is super hot as usual but she was phoning it in this time and didnt seem that into it

carol danvers character was at least better than she was in the first film and in endgame felt a lot less like cardboard this time though still a blandass hero and still a lot closer to cardboard than a compelling character

kamala khan was endearing and was honestly the most entertaining character everybody else was wooden as  kamala was probably the only memorable character in this movie

iman vellani was clearly having fun being a part of the team shes cute and a decent actress and i hope she gets more roles despite being given a  script to work with shes jake lloyd and hayden christensen all over again with anakin skywalker good actors working with a lackluster script that said hayden was fantastic in revenge of the sith but i digress

monica rambeau is still a bland annoyingass character i didnt like her in wandavision and i didnt like her here either

nick fury is wasted not much can be said about him in this movie he couldve been written out completely and nothing would change it wouldve been better without him in it as there would be no lame black girl magic joke to be said

the villain was forgettable and generic basically a weaker and less threatening ronan clone what was her name again

the action and vfx were alright i guess not bad but nothing special

the kate bishop thing at the end was unneeded they blatantly rippedoff the credits scene from the first iron man and incredible hulk with the were building a team schtick

valkyrie didnt need to be in this

this was probably the most kidfriendly mcu movie by far lighthearted bright colorful cheerful no crazy violence no scary scenes not much profanity this couldve easily been rated pg

the song planet was  as  reminded me of the prince ali scene from the 2019 aladdin remake which is a good scene in that movie but musical numbers in marvel films just dont work

the switching places schtick between the three heroes was annoying and added nothing to the film

the scene in the ship with all the flerkens was pointless

as far as pandering and whatnot there honestly really wasnt in this at all that wouldve made the movie worse so the lack of pandering actually gives it a few points

its just boring as  honestly

thats about it very forgettable movie legitimately its like a child wrote and directed this movie mcu stans will rag on movies like godzilla king of the monsters from 2019 which is legitimately an awesomeass kaiju film especially for godzilla fans and then eat this trash up

edit for mcu stans coming in here you cant call me sexist or racist for not liking this movie i have no problems with the leads being women andor different races the movie just sucks",2024-02-09 02:38:31
i wanted to like it but its bad ms marvel definitely carried the movie the editing was very weird though and the writing left a lot to be desired plot barely existed  i feel lile the whole hala problem couldve been solved in a million easier ways not as bad as thor 4 no movie ever will probably be as bad as thor 4 but definitely on the very weak side of mcu,2024-02-09 20:37:46
"finally saw it on d sort of bummed was hoping i would really like it despite the bad reviews and box office run 

it was a mess awful awful dialogue whoever wrote that first phone call interaction between fury and carol should never be allowed near a script again disappointing performances and i know all three of those leads  sam jackson can act weird tonal choices throughout at the end of the day theyre probably lucky most people didnt see this because they could have tuned out of the mcu further",2024-02-11 02:53:54

"i liked it 610 

pacing was great kamala steals the show it does a wonderful job telling its story in the allotted time doesn’t overstay its welcome has the best post credit scene in years i thought the cast was good the directing was very good and the charm of the ms marvel series carried through to the big screen

negatives would be that there are some editing quirks that remove some of the logic — things happen that don’t necessarily make sense or that haven’t been explained on screen the singing planet stuff was cute at first but for me went on too long and crossed the barrier from funny to unfunny without crossing the mythical seinfeld “back to being funny again” point and the fight scenes were typical unimaginative marvel choreography by and large

it was a good time at the movies and i recommend it to anyone based on the shorterthanthetrend runtime and fastpaced fun",2023-11-10 21:51:32
"wanted to like this film but it was a colossal misfire would not recommend its a 2 out of 10 for several reasons

1 zero threat in the film and from the villain no one is in any real danger so didnt care if anyone lived or died
2 nick fury relegated to a lame comedic sidekick could have been omitted and it wouldnt have affected the bland plot
3 tessa thompsons valkyrie cameo made zero sense from a storytelling standpoint heres why she and danvers had zero interaction beforehand if there was one it would have been in endgame in the final battle so their meet up in this film was disingenuous what would have made sense and worked was if thor appeared because he and danvers had a couple of scenes together at the beginning of endgame
4 while brie larson seems to be an energetic and likable person and imo did well in endgame and fast x she cant carry a film on her own right now her acting in this film was flat and she acted like she didnt care to be in it and her upgraded suit was sadly a symbolic representation of her screen presence  colorless and lifeless

this film felt like the three female leads as themselves in real life had a slumber party where they took shrooms and hallucinated about some wacky space adventure",2023-11-11 07:08:33
wasn’t the disaster some of the reviews made it out to be but marvel needs to take some time off and really do some quality control i enjoyed it more than the last antman thor and dr strange films at least,2023-11-10 03:10:36

"marvel is getting neutered by disney they left the creative team mostly alone up until endgame and have taken it a different direction afterwards

more jokes more representation more “fun” less story less meaningful interactions less cohesiveness less pacing

i don’t like iman vellani’s kid character many will disagree with me but that’s okay

captain marvel was okay not a big fan of brie larson’s acting but it wasn’t the low point of the movie

the pacing of the story was atrocious and all over the place the skrulls were a moot point so was hala so were the kree the fights weren’t worth the lack of a meaningful plot and the lighthearted interactions while cute were extremely distracting

this movie will regrettably bomb and i can guarantee you it isn’t due to superhero fatigue or marvel fatigue it’s due to mediocre movies attempting to be blockbuster films",2023-11-11 04:19:58

 and dont get me started on the cgi this is phase 2 greenscreen level i mean they sometimes even forgot to remove the green shine out of the hair its a franken movie butchered together with all kinds content but structure character development story is barely there and not even funny",2023-11-10 07:07:05
"geez half the comments in this thread arent even about the movie just people  on anyone who found it remotely entertaining  

like the editing is very choppy and disjointed and they kind of just abandon the battle on the water planet too which is egregious  

still its got some good moments like randomly  turning into a musical for 5 minutes

"i dont really get the hate the villain has a clear goal that is interesting the performances are enjoyable larson is obviously getting better direction this time around vellani is the stand out the comedy mostly hit with some awkward jokes here or there but honestly there has been worse in the past plus they are connecting to the overarching plot points of the mcu young avengers multiversesecret war which was a criticism of the multiverse saga there are real criticisms to be had ex some  effects like monica putting the world together but it just feels like people are circlejerking hate i was frankly waiting for the movie to get bad and it didnt 610 a 710

honestly i think the mcu bubble has burst and people graded mcu on a curve that doesnt exist anymore if stuff like thor 1 or im2 came put today they would be getting rotten ratings in rt galore

this might as well be a tv episode or a holiday special has no business being a 250m feature the whole carol is responsible for actions plot is so underdeveloped that it doesnt even matter in the slightest and on the other side we have a teenager going head over heels for her as if carol is some beloved hero how do you expect me to connect to kamala fangirling carol without giving us a fully developed and likeable captain marvel yes iman vellani shined in her role and the trios entanglement offers some fun and thats it i didnt like brie being reduced to a side note in her own film she gets ideas from kamala and lets monica take decisions,2023-11-10 10:20:37
"not sure what to think of this film the everyone needing to be eaten by the cats scene genuinely got the best laugh out of me at the cinema this year on number 50 for the year the absurdity of it the film was just decent didnt even need to mention all 3 leads were females which was well done

but the plot was pretty basic given it was a short film and it seems each marvel film recently needs way too much setup knowledge from the shows stuff is just said on screen or done as if im meant to know feels like there were entire scenes deleted as well was really strange the acting was also pretty wooden by the cast and characters didnt react in the way they should given their situation

like this is genuinely the first time ive saw earth have a space elevator a space elevator no setup its just there and im expected to just accept that humanity has accepted its there in the mcu all along",2023-11-11 01:21:10

"it was pretty good 

i had faith in nia decosta from the beginning especially when it seemed like she actually understood what made carol tick it was a fun flick that reminded me of early 2000s comic book films but in a good way do i wish the villain was more memorable yes but combined with finding out she was a kree and the actress cast who hasnt been particularly good in much i was just hoping she wasnt in it much and she wasnt she wasnt horrifically bad but she was bland and largely a plot device that worked for me every single time they introduce a kree villain i know that theyre not going to be particularly interesting iman is hilarious and id like to see her in other non mcu comedies and action films imagine her paired with ryan reynolds or a screaming matt damon it could work tenoyah parris frequently makes me reevaluate my homosexuality and im glad monica got more fleshing out this time around i do wish they dipped a bit more into her relationship with carol and her grief over her mother being gone but i liked what we got

brie larson may end up leaving the role and if so shes leaving on a high note this was carols best showing as a character ever im including the comics because shes kinda boring there too for once she gets some actual  personality carol danvers as a character isnt very interesting as a kid i liked her stripperific outfit because it was the most distinctive thing about her there has always been a struggle to make carol interesting across the various shows films games and comics shes appeared in the problem was never brie larson the problem was other writers not knowing how to make carol an interesting presence i think they finally got it right

the fight sequences were fun the humor was very much my speed the chemistry between the leads was on point i thought every single character not named darbenn was utilized pretty darn well i like that it knew exactly what it was and delivered on being a fun breezy movie i will take this over whatever the  quantamania was supposed to be this was fun in a way that wasnt trying hard like love and thunder 710 looking forward to watching it high",2023-11-10 20:16:14
"i have no clue what i just watched the story felt like it came out of no where things left unanswered the explanations of what was going on was a jumbled mess the only good part was the mid credits scene to bring in the xmen i follow the movies but when they start mixing in whats going on with the shows nothing make sense if youre not keeping up  i dont think ive left a marvel movie more confused about what i watched than this one 

the kittens was probably the best part though

i’m sorry but i don’t know what the  was going on in this one it was the first time i’ve genuinely had the feeling that i was too old to be watching one of these it felt like it was made for tweens and pretty much no one else the singing planet scene gave me the same kind of secondhand embarrassment i haven’t felt since watching bad disney channel  with my family",2023-11-10 15:07:23

this is rise of skywalker levels of bad 

the film rushes to its conclusion as quickly as possible in the hope that you will not realise how bad it is making the postcredit scene the final scene of the film is evidence of that fact 


judging by the vague and limply positive reactions in this thread the editors at marvel have succeeded in their task make it short and sweet they should win an oscar",2023-11-11 01:43:03

"the movie was cut way too short there was so much room for the antagonist to develop and i rather she wouldve been approached as a desperate person trying to help her people that gets shown a better way in the end than a straight up tyrantvillain who dies a foolish death

that being said we see glimpses of what made the first two episodes of ms marvel so great more enjoyable characterization of carol and overall lightheartedness and comraderie thats been executed well only here and there in the latest marvel films

"i was suprised that marvel decided to release this movie considering the very vast strike that was happening i wouldve pushed the release date until next year  got the stars out to do press for a couple of months and get the buzz happening on this it makes a difference

 that being said i loved this movie i laughed kamala fan girling was awesome  i loved the relationship between all three of the leads 
i was reading that the villians motive wasnt clear but i dont know what folks missed in that they even painted you a picture 

i wouldnt have been mad about more back story on dar benn but not necessary 

carol danvers was sad this entire movie her character felt weighty this movie very different from the brashness of the first one this danvers felt like a person that is very much still grappling with the world she knew crumbling the new one she discovered crumbling and she cant quite get her feet under her 

i wanted more of those flash back  scene i wanted to see more of the times she did show up for maria and monica  

i felt like it was a little light on the angst between monica and  carol they need another movie to work thier  out 

and shout out to teyona parris  shes so dope and looks so amazing as photon 

the cats song with the flerkins eating everybody and the way they let you know that was coming clever and those switch scenes frigging great editing

it was fun it was action had some emotional beats that resonated with

i would like to see a directors cut of this without the hand of marvel or disney in it 

i want to know what the directors vision was before it got edited i would be curious",2023-11-20 03:47:51
i don’t think the movie was terrible or the end of the world like some but definitely on the weaker end fight scenes were good and i like the three main characters but everyone else including fury weren’t interesting to me haven’t seen secret invasion but he seemed almost like a different character editing was very clunky scenes didn’t flow very well and felt rushed one scene it seemed like carol was very far away from the other two when they switch with her and get held up by dar ben but then carol just flies in out of nowhere like she was super close by the thing with goose having babies just came out of nowhere maybe i missed it and they alluded to it earlier though it being the shortest mcu movie i’m wondering if they really gutted this movie to get the runtime down possibly to get more showtimes in fear it was going to bomb idk not really sure what they’re thinking but it felt like there was a lot missing i’m surprised at some saying it’s better than the original captain marvel movie i need to rewatch it but i remember liking that one more than this,2023-11-20 23:09:32
"i actually liked it 

but i can understand why people didnt like it so much",2023-11-29 03:14:42
just watched it dont really understand the hate for it its a pretty basic marvel movie if your issue with it is marvel fatigue then thats on you for continuing to watch something youre tired of id put it middle of the pack of marvel movies not great but not bad,2023-11-29 03:54:53
"terrible editing job and weak direction were prime culprits but these characters were never going to supplant the avengers captain marvel doesnt have the complexity or the charisma shes basically an omnipotent deus ex machina and theres too much pseudofeminist character arc redundancy in the marvel universe right now already that shes the most omnipotent such character doesnt necessarily make for an engrossing film

i feel like it would have been a much better movie if they didnt take it so seriously and politicize it so hyperbolically a kind of ragnarok version would have probably been way more successful and gratifying",2023-12-09 00:00:48
just watched it and loved it  i really liked the end credits scene  i knew i would like this tho simply because my favorite marvel movie is the eternals  i figured if that one was hated i would probably like another one that was as well,2023-12-10 04:21:04
"just saw the movie last week at the theater really liked it for the most part thought kamala  monica were great the parents  brother were great carol was weak not sure why brie larson doesnt connect with that character fury had a couple of good scenes the villain wasnt great the story was enjoyable couple of plot points made no sense or left unanswered questions but still an enjoyable movie definitely a girly movie

ive decided not to watchread previews of marvel movies before seeing them if go into a movie with no influence from the naysayers the movies are more fun this movie wasnt the quality of prior mcu movies but still had a good time with a few laughs",2024-01-02 02:40:21
"i finally saw it last night and i was blown away by how much i enjoyed it did not have a skrillex song and a disney princess moment in my bingo card for a marvel movie but here we are and i was grinning the whole time

i think the leads did a really good job and you could especially tell iman was having a blast with this despite an admittedly shallow 3rd act it was almost 2 hours of marvel fun way better than antman 3 which i felt like was super passionless and thor 4 where i visibly cringed at some moments

i think they should’ve marketed as it was  a fun light romp that is certainly rewatchable not this universe changing movie they were trying to go for in some of the trailers",2024-01-17 20:39:29
"pretty good movie overall the big bad really needed some work to be honest i get wanting to help your people while taking revenge on the one who doomed your planet but the way scenes were written the villain didnt have many qualities that would kind of make you feel bad for them

and once again like in almost every other mcu movie the villain just dies

at least they didnt directly tie it to kang so marvel really wont have to work around the ending and mid credit scenes kamala imitating fury was sweet but its kind of messed up that if they ever film a young avengers project theyre all pretty much going to be adults which they are already in real life

monicas mom is photon of the fox xmen universe or was she supposed to be playing someone else havent read much in comics about them",2024-01-18 05:51:35

"my review of the marvels

the marvels the latest addition to the marvel cinematic universe streamed into our living rooms bringing with it a kaleidoscope of superpowered spectacle this film while threading familiar narrative paths manages to elevate itself through its exploration of human relationships amidst cosmic chaos  
  
captain marvel often compared to superman due to her overwhelming power faces the challenging task of staying relatable in a universe where she could easily solve most conflicts singlehandedly this omnipotence paradox has been a narrative hurdle risking the characters descent into an unrelatable almost deus ex machinalike existence however the marvels counters this by weaving a story that focuses less on her powers and more on the intricate web of her relationships  
  
the standout element of the film is its portrayal of ms marvel she is not just a superhero but a vibrant endearing character whose familial bonds add layers of depth and relatability her innocence and connection to her roots make her a compelling focus creating a protective instinct in the audience akin to that of her mothers  
  
the dynamic between monica and captain marvel adds another dimension humanizing the latter through their shared history and emotional ties its a testament to the narrative that even a character as powerful as captain marvel can find grounding in the complexities of human relationships  
  
however the film falters when it comes to its antagonist the villains lack of a formidable presence and an underwhelming scheme fail to pose a credible threat to the protagonist undermining the tension its only when earths safety hangs in the balance threatening characters weve grown to care about that the stakes feel genuinely high  
  
while the movie excels in its exploration of relationships the traditional superhero elements — the grandiose powers and action sequences — feel somewhat routine a more menacing villain and heightened peril could have propelled this film into the upper echelons of the mcu  
  
in conclusion the marvels scores a 7510 its a commendable entry in phase 4 rich in character development and emotional resonance but it falls short of reaching the pinnacle set by the likes of guardians of the galaxy and the infinity war saga the film shines brightest not in its cosmic battles but in its portrayal of heroes who despite their extraordinary abilities remain profoundly human at heart",2024-01-19 10:15:07
"i really wanted to enjoy it i like the first one more than most people i would say i thought it tried and succeeded at doing something different

this movie felt like it was edited to  and back both storylines featuring the skrulls and the singing planet just disappear and then the movie kneecaps itself by killing the villain before the climax 

also i never understood the science behind the switcheroo or why it stopped just felt very random and was a plot point whenever the movie needed it to be",2024-02-10 21:32:53
"i went in with so much positive bias and im sad by the results it has bits and pieces of a good hero flick but you can see how cheap marvel studios is being 

  is this editing honestly absolutely terrible choppy as  makes a lot of the otherwise decent fight choreography way worse hops and hops and hops through anything emotional just  

 i want more monica  are we never going to get to know her or her powers more kamala and danvers have prequels to establish them monica got  all but 10 minutes ugh her character deserved so much better still praying for a better solo movie 

 cgi meh 
 fun fight scenes but with 0 stakes because everyone is op kinda made them boring 
 the relationship between the 3 needed time to become more complex but i see the vision monica adored carol and it must be hard to watch kamala do the same especially with how let down she feels carol could wrestle more with her split duties between earth and everyone else kamala could have her hero worship be destroyed then renewed as she sees carol for the flawed alien that she is
 the villain is incredibly cookie cutter but i still loved to watch her work 

it was fun kamala and her family were endlessly charming and cute i need a black female super hero like i need water to drink so i got a bit of that which was nice it was colorful and funny at times wonderful costuming carols dress love new suits also love 

but ugh so fast and shallow 

ill probably get  watch it again though",2024-02-10 23:12:48
"this was the worst movie from 2023 ive seen 

the mcu really did the heavy lifting for it for it to not end up the biggest bomb in history the script the direction and the editing were absolutely garbage the original captain marvel was actually a decent movie this is like a collection of tiktoks stitched together into incoherent and whiny nonsense",2024-02-11 09:02:29
"monica closed the anomaly but was trapped in an alternate universe in the process

yan was the only one of the aladneans to speak english if you wanted to talk to everyone else you had to sing aladna was a musical planet

captain marvel had to make amends for what she did to the kree she restored halas sun with her energy and prevented darbenn from taking earths sun she destroyed two planets did she attempt to destroy earth as well

the marvels disbanded after darbenns death",2024-02-15 17:59:08
"i thought the movie reminded me of phase 1  2 movie pure joy and fun i thought the three leads were pretty good this time the script gave brie larson as carol danvers more expressive so her back and forth with monica and kamala were pretty enjoyable  whether for fun time and sad time and felt like she genuinely enjoyed herself throughout the movie teyonnah parris felt like a good middle sister in this movie she expressed her disappointment with carol quite nicely though i wished they would delved into this more iman vellani as kamala khan is the one who glued this group together she brought fresh energy of excitement into this group and made it more delightful

the movie felt like a blitz on one hand 105 minutes for superhero movie felt refreshing on the the other hand some motives felt not as clear as i expected and i felt like conflict resolutions felt too quick darbenn has a bit of depth compared to ronan but still they couldve explored her a bit more

all in all the movie was such a fun time for me in my opinion it was good but not great and good but not bad pretty solid in my book",2023-11-10 03:05:16
"just when i think it cant get any worse it does i loved the ms marvel show but seeing the trailers for this film i really hated the way they represented her as this screaming cringy sidekick  she had way more depth in the show and all they let her do here is react instead of have any agency her final scene was the only time she truly felt like herself on top of all that if you have not seen wandavision or ms marvel this movie does a terrible job of catching you up  i walked into a witch hex they say it over and over but if i had never seen the show id be like huh what does that even mean integrating show plots with movie plots just seems like a massive failure in storytelling and marvel just  the bed in the least graceful way possible

anyway literally had no idea what was going on in this movie the plot was just jumping around and jumbled moving from one thing to the next often feeling like without explanation or time to slow down to give things moments feels like they had some ideas for random set pieces and just threw it in a blender but nothing stuck i laughed at a few moments but the overall experience was abysmal i was fighting sleep after about 45 minutes i kept checking the time hoping please  just let this end only to find that there was so much more time left

im a fairly big marvel fan but like the masses have seen a major decline since endgame theres been some bright spots no way home shang chi and i even have one i really like that most hated eternals but in a very short amount of time we have reached 00s dc and fox levels of bad  id rather watch green lantern or wolverine origins 10 times in a row than this again the first captain marvel movie was the worst at its time but ive grown to like it a bit more since than but i cannot for the life of me see this movie regaining any brownie points and quantumania earlier this year seemed like the absolute bottom of the barrell but there are at least things i appreciate about that movie modok kang there is nothing redeemable here this is not only by far the worst marvel movie but the worst movie ive seen this year and one of the worst movies i have ever seen

after that terrible candyman reboot and this i cant trust anything nia decosta makes ever again

"yesterday morning our friends and i were discussing what to do at night we were thinking of watching a movie and we discussed the marvels i remember texting him saying “if we’re truly truly desperate and have nothing to do we’ll give it a watch”

well we ended up watching it last night firstly the theatre was empty which was shocking weve never watched an mcu movie where theres barely anyone in the seats we all were confused as we didnt watch 3 tv shows that were connected to this movie it was horrible cgi is garbage not the vfxs teams fault obviously and the villain is also hot garbage

the weird thing here is the geeks over at the marvel subreddits love this i’m convinced they’d watch captain america taking a  for 3 hours and call it the best mcu movie since the last mcu movie 

do not watch this",2023-11-11 12:05:04
"why do so many comments say the exact same thing i mean literally wordforword the same the i had low expectations but it was good it was fun singing planet was my favourite etc 

in a world with so many different folks youd expect a bit more variety in the comments  again wordforword there isnt a comment of i heard negative things but xyz was quite nice because of abc everything is quite literally formula of those youtube bots or botted product reviews that copypaste the same thrases but in a slightly different way i dont even see this on any other rmovie comment section 

i havent seen a single person in mass that talk about the acting writing dialogue story pacing other than the ones criticising it there are many comments that do say like mine puzzled by why so many comments ignore the actual film but copypaste the same slogan overandover again again why are so many comments saying the exact same thing wordforword but never talk about the film itself like what was the writing dialogue consistency honestly what is this pr doing damage control due to low box office for such an amazing incredibly funny 710 movie as people say it seems to receive such low sales

feels like a bot army posting reviews than actual viewers having a conversation its just throwing me off anyone else scratching their head about this whole it was fun parade with zero substance where is the rest of your review",2023-11-13 04:45:29
kamala dancing to the beat on the music planet was hilarious im almost looking forward to young avengers now,2023-11-10 21:09:45
wow i recently rewatched thor the dark world  and it wasnt as bad as this at least the villain looked menacing and the cgi looked great,2023-11-12 13:58:59
"i just finished watching this and its honestly a 310 half of this movie made no sense whatsoever im really starting to feel like eternals was a better film than this

 for characters captain marvel is decently better and her character has shown some improvement i guess rambeau felt like those characters that over explains situations that arent understandable to the majority kind of like when steve would tell tony to speak english but worse and her powers made no sense and ms marvel the most annoying cringe character ive seen ever the fact that she got this role cause she was a marvel fan and not based on acting skills is disgusting

ms marvel in this movie is annoying and so are her parents which took my enjoyment out of watching this kamala serves no bigger purpose besides the  bangles which im assuming the bangles  the rings from shang chi are kang’s inventions which makes her character useless and annoying overall

the villain can be summed up as the basic “you took everything” villain which is odd cause she made it seem as if carol blew up her planet when really they didnt have air water and the sun though i did find carol’s vengeance flashback somewhat interesting how her anger towards the kree for what they did to her but they did it so basic that i didnt get to care about it oh and nick fury went from connecting all the avengers together to being a guy who tells jokes the entire movie 

the story overall felt rushed and some scenes were annoying and others felt like they shot the scene once and that was it and i still dont understand why the trio dipped when the singing planet lost its oceans i only give this a 310 because of the end credit scene with the xmen but i wish it were the xmen from the universe where wanda dream walked in",2023-11-12 22:42:03
a solid marvel movie with some genuine laughs that has the courtesy to move pretty fast it’s not perfect but it has at least one truly entertaining and cool fight sequence and a villain that mostly makes sense carol goes toe to toe with thanos but this bad guy of the week gives her a hard time  it it’s fine it’s truly a shame that the cast and filmmakers have to endure misogyny driven reviews because women dare to exist and be on screen,2023-11-10 05:16:42
"people who feel the need to defend this film because apparently this next addition of disney slop is some benchmark in some identity culture war must be knackered it must be hard to defend such rubbish

if you legitimately enjoy this film and this type of film from disney then praise it for what it dies right rather than basing your liking off of who doesnt like it

the film itself is another microwaved product thats no different to ones that were released ten years ago horrible editing direction and vfx work and a narrative so disjointed it felt like it just ended abruptly",2023-11-11 23:55:08
"its light and airy and ill probably forget 90 of it by next week but its still an enjoyable enough watch which seems to be the best we can hope for from most post endgame marvel the phenomenal gotg 3 aside  

the good

 iman vellani is a gem
 this will probably get me crucified on reddit but i like brie larson and thought she was great here
 the use of the memories from cats

the bad

 the stakes never really fully hit home were introduced to planet only for it to get wrecked 15 min later and then introduced for another only for it to get wrecked 15 min later why should we care even the earth threatening stuff takes place far away at the sun so it doesnt feel super impactful and then at the end i guess everything is okay because of a line of dialogue we never see either of the other planets again
 the villain is kinda lame and boring the general idea is good but man is she bland also how does a civil war make their sun die
 the entire movie feels like filler sure theres two teases at the end but for the most part it continues phase 4s problem of not feeling like were building towards something

the underwhelming

 the film squanders some really good ideas the singing planet is a hilarious idea but then they drop it after its admittedly fun introduction imagine how much fun the battle there could have been if devolved into a fully choreographed musical number what a wasted opportunity
 similarly the characters switching spots doesnt get a good payoff its introduction is again very fun but then they dont really do anything creative with it it felt like it needed some big third act payoff
 the end credits scene fell flat for me like as soon as they mentioned that rift led to another multiverse i knew exactly what the scene was going to be especially with deadpool 3 coming but man did they do in the most underwhelming way possible the character wakes up only to be greaten by cameo character is so cliche at this point and i guess this is a big picture gripe but are we going to persist with the fox xmen im so tired of every film now trying to include a big nostalgia play i was interested in seeing how marvel would handle the xmen going forward im hoping the fox cast is only for deadpool 3 and we can some interesting reinterpretations when the xmen make their full mcu debut",2023-11-12 06:07:53
i didn’t like it the villain pacing the cgi kamala’s parents cats and the decision on various scenes really baffling choices that were made 410,2023-11-12 06:52:16

"no one is pulling apart that db could have saved her planet really easily by just targetting other random planets with no one on and stealing a sun from an uninhabited system

then could have gone on the revenge bender
possibly the stupidest villian in the mcu

look i dont mean to attack the film by recent marvel standards this was pretty enjoyable its silly it makes zero sense and you just have to go with it and its enjoyable fun",2023-11-13 02:00:42

were they 

and what’s up with all these movies having only 5 minutes to train and figure things out like when they figured out how to coordinate their powers

the writing was bad the director was too amateur why do we keep giving this shiddy noob directors a chance",2023-11-18 06:30:51
this should be a fun thread,2023-11-10 03:07:58

box office bomb,2023-11-11 09:35:43
i was gonna say it’s the worst mcu villain yet but then i remembered the doctor who guy from thor 2 the second thor the fact that i couldn’t remember him probably speaks to him being a worse villain but bender is still really  just so forgettable but not forgettable enough to forget how  her performance is really fun movie otherwise solid 610,2023-11-10 06:45:37
wait so does the water planet just get genocided did i miss that they saved them or are they just ,2023-11-10 09:17:53
i actually enjoyed this movie like it could have been better and i think its missing some moments but ultimately what is on screen is fun ms marvel is the highlight feels like there is a whole  movie missing tho between this and the first captain marvel,2023-11-10 18:55:34
"i liked this one a lot 

i enjoyed how all the characters played off each other the situations were bananas in a fun way a singing planet complete with a disney princess musical number

it was pretty much a 2 hour excuse to let captain marvel be more of a person than a cardboard cutout there really isnt any defense of the plot because its pretty paper thin in true marvel fashion the villain is one dimensional but i thought the interactions between the main characters was fun 

7810 for me",2023-11-11 00:26:45
"just got out of the theater quick thoughts

 kamala khan is a sweetie pie and despite the world at large not liking her show or her movie i hope the actress knows it’s not her fault
 how tf did captain marvel destroying the ai overlord from her first movie result in hala’s sun dying feels like a separate thing stars die all the time
 captain marvel turning hala’s sun back on was also super anticlimactic that should’vecould’ve been a moment 
 cat gag was great
 uninteresting villain lady was strangely and quietly op or rather they nerf and buff captain marvel willynilly to fit the moment diving into a sun to restart it no problem beating a lady with a bangle and a hammer ahhhhh help me i need the power of team work 
 were monica’s powers ever really explained in another marvel show or movie i watched all of wandavision i do not remember this level of clarity on what monica could do",2023-11-11 23:22:49

wonder woman was a success and so was black panther but this movie wasnt movie wasnt sexism and racism cant be the only factors that led to this movie receiving a negative response,2023-11-17 22:27:38
"just saw it that was some of the most fun the mcu has been in a while nia decosta managed to bring a little bit of her own flair to the movie as well which really showcased in the opening animation and the fights sequences

villain was nowhere as bad as i expected and her motivation and plot were easy to understand zawe ashton did a great job in the role with what she was given

the whole cast had solid chemistry and as many have mentioned iman vellani is really the standout here as someone who saw iron man in theaters at 17 its fun seeing an actor like her be so thrilled on the mcu still the way we all were in phase 1 to 3

wasnt flawless but this was much more rewatchable enjoyable and frankly funny than a lot of recent mcu fare thorough had a great time with it

hats off to nia dacosta",2023-11-18 02:15:24
"it is very clear that everyone who worked on this movie was given very impossibly tight deadlines yet they deliver something decent in the end the movie feels totally like the first draft of something better

there are several things that are respectable in that regard each characters motivations are very clear which is rare in marvel movies nowadays it also seems they learned a lesson to not put woman power in your face like disney seems to do but actually put a vulnerability and human touch to each hero which actually makes them actually somewhat likeable some hidden political ideas on how captain marvel is trying to police and help everyone resulting in the destruction of 2 civilizations is a remarkable idea too

that being said the problem lies in the execution and linking those ideas together and im sick of movies portraying a smart character blabbering things that sound smart stop it on top of that some say a movie is as good as the villain and i think they completely miscast he villain she sounds like someone trying to be someone else nothing against the actress she just doesnt fit the ronan the accuserthanos kinda vibe that the movie makes her seem to be",2023-11-18 20:29:01
"a lot of mcu movies have been a bit meh recently so i didnt have sky high expectations but this was a really fun romp 

kamala adds joy to every scene shes in  when she started dancing i really liked carol monica fine she mainly added some nice character development for carol and some emotional stakes likewise the villian had a pretty decent motivation that directly tied into the main cast 

and the thing with furys pet was actually relevant to the plot brilliant and hilarious",2023-11-18 22:27:14
definitely a fun time,2023-11-23 04:41:40
i liked it better than quanumania and secret invasion,2023-11-23 20:33:33

glad i didnt pay to see it worse than expected  very bad cgi sloppy edits and weird pacing with forgettable characters,2023-11-10 08:26:55
 why all the downvotes no marvel didnt pay for comments i actually found myself laughing quite a few times and even felt the paintension between them  the antagonist was fine i get it seeing this unstoppable force destroy your planets creatorboss  cause the sun to die and the air to be poisonous would make anyone fill with rage  want vengeance  710 on my 1st watch,2023-11-10 10:24:33
i see a lot of earlyadopting hardcore marvel fans in the comments singing the praises of the movie and then ending it with 610  thats terrible wait until the rest of the world sees this steaming pile of ,2023-11-10 16:46:14

 what a slog",2023-11-10 21:34:54
considering how insanely powerful cap marvel is wouldnt it be easier to just put the other two in a secure location and just have them not use their power until its all sorted out cap marvwl can easily just take care of thr whole thing pretty easily,2023-11-10 04:18:10

"okay that was absolutely delightful kamala remains completely perfect and i will watch anything shes in 

i also now need to see the full musical backstory film i do not care what level of production values 

very fun film didnt feel like you needed a  of backstory either since they basically reintroduced our three leads in the first men minutes 

excellent build in that final fight too loved the choice to start with no music and build up to it 

overall its in the upper half of marvel films for me not groundbreaking but also doesnt overstay its welcome",2023-11-10 03:40:07
i had a blast iman is a star,2023-11-10 03:45:42
enjoyed the film overall although it wasn’t perfect it was definitely fun and they made some interesting choices,2023-11-10 04:24:20
most of the jokes landed and i really liked that the conflict wasnt with the team the three leads had a great dynamic but iman vellani stole the show,2023-11-10 03:21:11
"you know after reading the reviews from rottentomatoes i was worried how bad this would be…

but it actually wasn’t too bad it’s not a memorable marvel film but it is an entertaining one with a really strong performance by iman who i did not know about prior to this movie since i didn’t see ms marvel 

i was actually impressed with a few fight scenes as well as the cat scene where everyone is eaten by them",2023-11-10 03:23:19
"all cynicism aside i enjoyed it the space sequences looked great in 3d the quantum jumping was fun even when it briefly turned into a disney musical it kinda worked or that oblique cats reference by the way it must be  horrifying to be swallowed by one of those things

my only criticism is that it felt a bit too kid friendly that was my complaint about the ms marvel series as well and especially the inclusion of the parents that made it feel too family oriented but iman vellani is endlessly charming and its relatable to see the world from kamalas hero worship point of view and it goes without saying but brie larson is freaking fine as  that easily makes it watchable for me

it was fun to see them recruiting kate bishop at the end all the pieces coming together and the tease of the multiverse return of beast and its cool to come home and have the season 2 finale of loki waiting for me all in all not a bad night at the movies",2023-11-10 08:30:37
i loved it i cried but also probably because it’s my time of month the music choice for the comedic scenes were perfect,2023-11-10 20:32:27
i had a blast watching this movie definitely some weird editing but honestly some of my favorite action in the mcu i think nia dacosta did a lot of really interesting work and the switching was a really cool device also the entire sequence with the cats made me die laughing that was incredibly out of left field,2023-11-10 20:41:52
"i saw it and liked parts of it but was amazed at how much pointless filler was in such a short movie

to me the whole fury plot with the cat in saber was all filler the whole singinf planet was all filler even the villains motivation felt like filler the bangles felt like filler

i like the dynamic between them  but they did a horrible job at explaining why the powers did that it seemed a way to nerf captain marvel

my favorite was the after credits scene because beast was great but the overall movie was meg barely touched the lore even if it seems it should have",2023-11-12 22:00:01
"super fun start but holy  why are so many of these films not allowed to have good villains 

okay so her motivation is that she wants to save her planet neat weve seen that a million times before but its a good blueprint but she has nothing else going for her and then she just blows up

i thought wasting gor in thor 4 was the peak but i think this might be an even more bland villain

still had a good time watching it thanks to the fun action and good cast but the story is totally absent",2023-11-10 03:55:55
i enjoyed this one some of the loose ends could have been addressed like did the water planet get their water back overall the dynamic was great between the three leads it is bonkers at times and honestly yeah thats why i go to the movies,2023-11-10 05:33:28
3rd movie ive ever walked out of zohan the spirit now this,2023-11-10 18:33:58
it wasnt as bad as everyone was making it out to be by far the best part was the singing planet i couldnt stop laughing at how campy it was the power teleport  didnt make sense kinda seemed like it just worked when they needed it to otherwise they should have been teleporting nonstop with how much they were using their powers,2023-11-10 03:50:05
"i honestly had a really good time with this it was fun entertaining and had a nice runtime i absolutely adored every scene with kamala and the khan family i wish there was no villain at all or even any worldending plot i was happy just watching them interact and bond i wish the mcu would move away from needing a huge devastating catastrophe to show these heroes powers 

i used to be a huge mcu fan absolutely inhaling all of the news and easter eggs and rewatching movies over and over but like everyone else that kind of died postendgame so tonight i found the required mcu additions in the movie the post credits the tieins to other mcu products so cringe even worse were the fans gasping and clapping in the theater at every reference it was embarrassing and even weirder when fans were mad there was no second postcredits scene the trouble with the mcu these days is that everything is a setup to the next thing and nothing stands on its own anymore and these fans are enabling that 

also  was it just me or did captain marvel herself take a step backwards here in terms of characterpower development she seemed somewhat nerfed but also more insecure when she seemed so confident in earlier movies",2023-11-10 04:46:32
if i wanted people dancing like crazy i would watch a bollywood movie,2023-11-10 05:30:16
"im so confused theres 300 comments and only one negative everyone is like i enjoyed it it was fun whats going on

i saw it with a guy and he hated it i myself am a woman and i liked it but only because i like female characters i like captain marvel sersi shuri wanda yelena

i will enjoy mostly anything with captain marvel in it but still i thought the marvels was badly directed and written it felt like nobody was directing this thing the switching made no sense and so much of the movie was just a recap of the mcu monica got powers by walking through a witch hex wall and now she can see the electromagnetic field and also she was blipped during the thanos snap and she resents carol for not returning to earth it felt like reading a wikipedia article they spend too much time rehashing past events and very little time building a new story

i think there is a good story in it but the way its told just doesnt register for me captain marvel is a fascinating character but its almost like the movie is not told from her perspective we dont get to see carol living in space for 30 years we get the perspective of outsiders getting to learn bits about carol

i dont like kamala khan i dont like her family that seems to be everyones favorite part but its not for me its way too family channel and like they are trying to pivot into a different kind of mood

the action i thought was poorly directed only brie larson moves in a way that suggests agility

this could have been such a cute movie but it has zero personality",2023-11-10 08:07:41
this is the love and thunder of the captain marvel movies,2023-11-10 08:08:34
did tony cap and thanos appear in this movie like the trailer implied,2023-11-10 06:15:42
fun enough film it was certainly weird but a good kinda weird although i wish is was captain marvel 2 instead,2023-11-10 06:39:14
this movie was unhinged and i loved it felt like they could have cranked the insanity to 11 and then pulled it back either in development or post but man they did some crazy  for a marvel movie and i’m here for it,2023-11-10 07:28:40
for the record i do not support online weirdos hating on the film because it’s “woke” nonetheless i really dislike the film i’ve seen all of their stuff and i might have to watch some of the others again but i feel like this is one of if not mcu’s worst film… it’s a shame too since i was glad they gave nia dacosta this huge opportunity… but both films of this brie larsonheaded franchise have done nothing for me… maybe it’s just me ,2023-11-10 22:52:01
really had fun with this movie a very digestible and easy watch with some really great action sequences the three leads were all very charming especially ms marvel,2023-11-10 05:55:25
the singing thing was just terrible i’m sorry it wasn’t even good or sounded coherent i get it’s basically just talking but  it could of been cut out,2023-11-10 07:57:35
"this movie has the most underwhelming opening scene i have ever seen just straight up showing the villain and the macguffin without any tension that said this movie is actually good if you put it in the same category as the movie where nic cage choked a  possessed killer robot

about 15 minutes into the movie i realized that if i just ignored the logic and plot holes and even the villain part the movie would become a really goofy buddy comedy the song planet was surprisingly hilarious instead of cringe inducing

for the most part i think the cast knew what they are doing with the materials given the chemistry and acting are great there are some bonker scenes that suits the tone and the forgettable villain was a good thing because i could enjoy the silliness of the main characters instead of feeling bad for the wasted potential of better comic book villains

i don’t think marvel had thought of the ending even after finishing production because carol’s arc just ended unexpectedly while kamala’s ending was the rumored after credit from a few months back which also explained why there was only one pcs

some additional notes
 the compulsory wardrobe change for merchandise is so frustrating as the new suits all looked like downgrades of the originals
 i chuckled when zawe ashton said kneel 
 disney really made a film about the importance of an evil ai to civilization and also a film in which  militant destroyed a foreign region and just brushed it off for a couple of decades",2023-11-10 09:20:52
"theres a strong movie here but this has clearly been chopped up like crazy and rushed too fast also and this is a personal thing im sick and tired of the aliens in marvel to just be regular humans it completely ruins my immersion and i dont care if thats how it is in the comics its a crime against worldbuilding

but kamalas great and this movie reminded me that larson is a great actress thats been given horrid material over these movies",2023-11-10 16:05:42
correct me if im wrong but isnt monica in the air force before joining sword i dont recall her being a scientist yet somehow in this movie she is so knowledgeable about all this cosmic power stuff and able to determine the cause and solutions to everything seems like a stretch to me,2023-11-10 22:09:04

okay this was a lot better than i expected not perfect but a fun time at the movies,2023-11-11 03:06:53
i thought it was fun although i admittedly tapered my expectations a lot due to the mcus recent missteps and the seemingly lukewarmtobad word of mouth surrounding it i actually thought the action scenes were quite energetic and creative and the chemistry between the 3 leads was the films greatest strength everything else was serviceable enough to keep me engaged,2023-11-11 23:01:01
we had a great time  loved kamala and the flerkens the most  cool to see monicas powers in action  the musical number was unexpected and adorable  so glad i was not spoiled for the end credits scene,2023-11-12 01:30:53
"i wonder if women like this movie i’m a guy and enjoyed the first 80 minutes but then i think it transitioned into the nonsense cutandpaste ending we got in all of these movies

"i just got out of seeing this in imax 3d and i thought it was pretty meh there are certainly positive aspects to be found here and it isn’t the worst mcu film by any means but here are a few random thoughts off the top of my head

 the singing planet was like my own version of  everybody there annoyed me to no end

 the performances here were incredibly hit and miss i generally like brie larson but she isn’t that great in this film like everybody else is saying ms marvel completely steals the show

 the visuals were pretty good in imax but there’s a few times where the obvious green screen takes you out of it a little bit

 the gags are solid enough and they certainly aren’t as annoying as some of the jokes used in antman 3 or thor 4

 while i liked the postcredit scene it felt a little unearned and out of nowhere to me 

 it really felt like there were aspects of this film that were rushed or heavily cut the villain of this film suffers the most from this 

it’s weird because i didn’t love the movie yet i was strangely entertained a lot of things were generic but it was almost like a fun amusement park ride",2023-11-13 22:48:44
"so uhi figured based on the buzz surrounding it but not knowing any actual details whatsoever that wed be getting an xmen tease for the stinger maybe a quick offhand mention of the xavier school senator kelly getting a name drop etc
  
i could never have imagined what we actually got as soon as i saw that brief flash of blue and heard the very first word in that voice i sat straight the  in my seat  i hope he doesnt end up being a oneoff bone toss like reed richards",2023-11-15 04:51:18
"carol danvers is the mcu superman in the sense we are yet to have a proper movie that is an actual outlet for her to have a captain marvel adventure first one was her origin this one feel like the third movie 

how come in a super expansive well threaded universe we never got a captain marvel in space movie i can only assume the changes feige imposed on gunn regarding the direction of guardians 2 had to do with hoa space aspect of the mcu got shafted 

it feels like the kree had to have something beyond captain marvel the movie and guardians 

so universe rant aside the movie is actually fine a lot of the plot overall is bad some parts are not done that well ie kamala witnesses the skrulls get genocideed and then they sort of shake it off

if this movie had come earlier it would probably have gotten better reviews but at this point people will be tired i enjoyed more than i disliked but i can see people being exhausted of this without any of the old leads its not spectacular in way you have to watch it but many people would actually have enjoyed it post credit scene being the most worthwhile thing i guess maybe too little too late for that well see",2023-11-18 04:25:01
"felt like an overall 710

obviously was not terrible glad it wasnt filled with a  ton of jokes but also wish it was a bit more serious darbenn didnt feel like a menacing hero but i did enjoy seeing the 3 of them learn to work together

generally a lot of random things that just didnt feel fitting random valkyrie cameo random musical random cats everywhere was happy to see captian marvel blast through ships again since she obviously had to be nerfed for the movie overall better than quantumania for sure but nowhere close to as good as the loki series level of quality",2023-11-18 22:41:25
"i thought the movie was pretty enjoyable just had some comments and wondering what others thoughts were

1 did they imply a relationship between valkyrie and carol or am i reading too much and its supposed to just be a friendship

2 ok so after the final fight kamala puts on both bands and they close the hole but when kamala land son earth shes only wearing one band im assuming this was just a mistake due to re editing but right now kamala is supposed to have both bands

3 why can kamala handle using both bands when it destroyed the villain in moments is it because she has some noor dna",2023-11-19 05:59:28
this was hilarious a lot of good action sequences the marvels were great fury was great good villain with a real world forsaken refuge vibe,2023-11-10 03:26:32
an mcu movie has been out for like 12 hours and there arent even 500 comments here wild,2023-11-10 09:54:34
haven’t seen it yet but there is no way it’s worse than quantummania that was one of the worst movies i’ve seen in a decade that writing was horrendous that car scene at the beginning holy moly,2023-11-10 16:52:16
i just like seeing all the people who autohate the mcu switch up there attacks from this movies sucks before they even see it to marvel is paying critics and people are saying its funblah blah blah fanboys,2023-11-10 21:34:31
this was leagues above captain marvel at least carol danvers isn’t a plank of wood the movie is distinctly average i remember just being bored through whole thing better than antman 3 but overall pretty forgettable i’d be more excited for the xmen if they were being brought in at a time when the mcu hadn’t been reduced to a mere shell of its former self,2023-11-11 05:34:29
"all the good reviews described a movie that i wanted to see and i think there were all pretty accurate i had a great time the three leads were all great and played of each other really well marvel have carol the most personality out of all her appearances so far monicas story is developing really well and iman vellani continues to be perfect as kamala

i really dont know where the bad reviews are coming from i guess a few aspects are undercooked or maybe overcooked because of all the delays the musical planet for example i would have loved to see way more of that concept but i think early responses to that idea were so negative they were forced to edit that down",2023-11-11 14:55:13
beast looked atrocious why cgi,2023-11-11 16:55:47
"great marvel comedy as expected iman vellani steals the show as the wholesome fan girl 

the first act was a little rough i thought introducing the place swapping seemed a little more jarring than it should have been wasn’t sold on the baddie but i’d rather have a throwaway for something like this than an a lister 

since i’m not familiar with photon i’m not sure what her power set actually includes but i feel like we were playing very loose with who can and can’t breath in space

the cat scene was… a lot

whatever sins were committed though are immediately forgiven on account of the midcredit scene just give them to me marvel give them to me nowwwwwwww",2023-11-11 19:39:07
"i think people are being a little harsh i thought this movie was fun

overall i think people need to just lower expectations mcu had a great run with the infinity saga but maybe these movies going forward should just be viewed as mindless superhero flicks

they’re not bad movies just not anything special and i think that’s okay just work on the oversaturation and release regular content there is an audience for these even if the general public has moved away and interest has waned

every once in awhile we’ll get an across the spiderverse but until then i’m fine with a two hour superhero escape even if it isn’t the next best picture winner",2023-11-11 22:10:58

"call me basic but yeah this was actually pretty great i havent watched any of the tv shows outside of wandavision so im probably missing a lot but i feel it didnt really negatively effect my enjoyment of the movie

loved the singing planet and herding of the cats bit and the usual cheesy humor and quips worked better for this movie than other mcu filmsexcited to see more of kamala

solid 710 for me",2023-11-10 05:18:05
"not gonna lie i cannot for the life of me understand the hate for this one fixes so many universal mcu complaints it’s quick creative fun pretty good vfx great fights etc honestly one of the stronger mcu offerings in a hot second barring guardians 3 

i will say the flanderization of nick fury is brutal his character is completely dead at this point iman velani is the best casting to happen to the mcu since rdj as tony",2023-11-10 22:59:46

great movie 810 dont understand the hate blows away quantumania love and thunder and whatever dc released this year,2023-11-11 00:45:05
"i really really liked it was it groundbreaking no was the villain particularly memorable no but the dynamic between carol kamala and monica was amazing thats what made the movie all three of them played their characters great but iman really took an already great character on her show and went to another level shes seriously the best

the movie had a nice tone of serious but still absurd it felt like an early mcu meets guardians style like yes there were literal world ending stakes but it was for a world of dancingsinging people or hundreds of people may dieunless they let adorable flerkins eat them it worked what they did worked

usually the mcu sarcasm interjection sucks but kamala butting in was legitimately hilarious again that goes back to iman shes just so likeable in this role 

speaking of roles how can the mcu  fury up so badly in secret invasion while also filming this i guess that shows how there isnt necessarily a lot of communication when it comes to crossing over remember gunn being against thor leaving with the guardians in endgame anyway im glad we didnt see furys wife maybe secret invasion will be wiped clean

like i said the villain was forgettable but her origin was pretty interesting it was nice that it actually tied back to the first movie her intentions werent too bad either i mean captain marvel did basically destroy her planet so from her perspective she was right

the credits scenes were both amazing again iman killed it kate bishop is one of my favorite characters from the disney shows so i was excited to see her and of course how can you not be  hyped about seeing another xmen character especially since they kept grammer beast looked so cool

anyway i enjoyed it it was a fun ride and it was better than a lot of what marvel studios has given us since endgame",2023-11-11 05:05:29
carol had some really great character development here strongest mcu hero physically but based on her decision making actually did more harm than good which is an interesting angle to play for her and made her much more likable than the first film i really liked her arc previously didnt really need her in the avengers but now id really like her presence moving forward,2023-11-11 21:06:28
 this movie is actually pretty good the fight scenes in this movie are surprisingly sick i also really like carol and monica’s relationship in this movie  the trio of them were pretty great together i liked it,2023-11-11 23:00:21
the only marvel movies worse than the marvels are thor love and thunder and quantumania  the only advice for those who havent seen the marvels is  wait and watch it on disney in a few weeks,2023-11-12 02:29:51
i wholeheartedly thought it was an enjoyable movie i had some laughs the action scenes could have been better but i liked it,2023-11-10 05:37:04
"i can totally understand why people might not like it but i enjoyed it for what is it is silly and lighthearted it doesnt quite have that emotional weight but i liked the dialogue and the cast works well together

id put it somewhere around antman 1 in the list of mcu films thats middle of the pack but fairly good for phase 45

the lady sitting next to me was loving it and would say oh my  every time something cool happened or there was a cameo it was more endearing than annoying i wanted to respond back with i knooowwww

i didnt catch all the thank yous but i saw kelly thompson and g willow wilson",2023-11-10 05:59:27
"i really do not like the new mcu approach where you need to watch their tv series to understand the movies

just nope

as the film itself  dire am i the only one who finds kamala khan annoying",2023-11-11 23:16:33

just finished it and it’s better than expected,2023-11-10 06:00:00

dont worry guys this film wasnt made for you,2023-11-10 08:32:12
"dont understand the hate this movie seems to be getting its far better than i expected based on the early trailers

only thing that bothered me was did the kree civil war do something to destroy their sun i get theyre advanced butthats a lot

or was it it just a cosmic coincidence their sun started dying the same time they destroyed their planet anyway",2023-11-10 20:11:36
"kamala absolutely stole the show 

i really really enjoyed that 810 people were flipping the  out at the final scene and the midcredit scene 

music was a lot better in captain marvel though kind of disappointed they didnt follow that theme",2023-11-10 07:33:14
did i forget something from the ms marvel show how did kamala use her powers with no bangle at the end i thought maybe they’d say she did it by being a mutant but no explanation,2023-11-10 03:38:48
i liked the characters well enough except for captain marvel herself who is kind of an  don’t know if it’s supposed to be an allegory for militarypolicing sometimes being wrong or what i get not being perfect and the villain side demonizing her but there were simple moments of  behavior beyond that like her barely apologizing and brushing off triggering monica’s worst memories and that scene was the other issue the sudden tonal shifts they go from trauma to the training montage within a minute obviously enjoyed everything with kamala the most young avengers is gonna be good stuff finally another entry in the “where the  are the other avengers” category couldn’t have fury called valkyrie up right quick when they needed an escape plan,2023-11-10 05:35:20
is it necessary to watch msmarvel before watching this,2023-11-10 09:10:01

"finally watched it it wasnt that bad i actually enjoyed the chemistry between the marvels i really hated how carol didnt think on fixing  halas sun it took her less than a minute to actually fix it but she waited 30 years a villain and someone asking her to fix things

the end scene with kamala was poorly explained no reason for her to recruit young avengers other than make another movieseries

the post credits scene was fine i felt bad when the maria rambeau had no idea who monica was",2024-03-26 19:53:16
"this was a lot of fun loved the somewhat sloppy concept and the leads were fantastic together wasn’t spectacular but like someone else here said it felt much more like phase i  ii and much less everything since covid not perfect but def feels like a step in the right direction for marvel

"the majority will hate this movie but i didn’t hate it for a few reasons 

indian girl kamala carried the movie she was very charming and just genuinely funny

fight choreography between the 3 of them was a lot of fun their chemistry was great 

nick fury kate bishop always hype if they’re on screen 

it suffered from honestly bad story telling it was all very copy paste knew exactly how it was going the villain was annoying and they did those weird annoying cringe things that disney does now thor with the screaming goat ant man with the modok dude captain marvel with a planet where their language is singing ",2023-11-10 05:24:37
"when i say headlines saying it was the third worst film i was really worried
i also heard there was some change in staff or directors leaving which is normally not a good sign for a movie

but really loved it all 3 leads were great so proud of iman vellani and there were parts that were silly but not too silly that it breaks the tone of the movie or lowers the stakes going on

also love the cameo at the end i could be biased but i thought it was great",2023-11-13 05:21:31
"this movie had some amazing high moments

and some really low moments that honestly felt like could have been expanded and refined

you can see the trio has enough ability to make some of these scenes work but they must have had like 3 takes and called it at some points the reveal or carol creating the problem was just like people reading off a script there was minimal at most emotion you could have easily doubled the length of that scene added some real emotional dialogue

also where the  did the 2nd bangle go kamala wasnt wearing it",2023-11-10 03:20:02
"the marvels is a pitch for a pilot on kickstarter one might use to communicate the basic concept of an intended film  the movie its pitching could have been really cool had anyone taken the time to make it  but because it remains just preliminary sketches of moments and bits and pieces of action it lacks the connective tissue tonal consistency character development and stakes of a finished artistic project  i wouldnt even call this a movie  its barely a rough draft

here are the major problems the implied intended arcs that were not fleshed out  and possible solutions



problem 1  carols arc flows about as smoothly as a monkey wrench through a colon her emotional breakdowns are tonally and narratively inconsistent and her journey and consequently the movie as a whole lacks a satisfying resolution



intended arc 1

a carol follows through on her vow of revenge and kills the supreme intelligence

b this causes political and environmental chaos on hala

c she feels guilty and runs away from this uncomfortable consequence of her actions and tries to make amends by remaining in space alone doing good deeds feeling that she is not worthy to return to monica  she feels that seeing monica again will awaken sad feelings about marias death and her own guilt that she could not prevent it

d  she meets kamala and initially sees her as naive and a burden another annoying problem to deal with

e she meets monica and is initially put off by her emotional distancing and anger

f  carol tries again to distract herself from feelings of guilt with solitary violence  she views the switching as an annoying problem that must be solved

g  after seeing kamala try her hardest to save others and find satisfaction in even partial successes she begins to respect kamalas abilities and more seriously consider the benefits of working as a team

h by talking to kamala and seeing her family interactions carol is reminded of the good she can do in the world and the positive ideal she still represents  carol sees the value of family and community and begins to open up more to the idea of reconnecting with monica

i  she shares the vulca um skrull mindmel um mind link with monica and comes to an emotional understanding of the suffering and loneliness monica has also endured

j  she talks to monica about her mother and shares her feelings and shared grief

k  darbenn explains her motivations to carol and she is reminded of her guilt

m  she breaks down emotionally and admits to monica and kamala that she is responsible for the decline of hala  this admission brings them closer together

n  carol begins to see the switching as a potential strength starts to value the abilites of monica and kamala  a training montage reinforces the idea of the three as a team

o  the power of friendship prevails and the three are able to defeat darbenn

p  monicas sacrifice and kamalas admiration inspire her to make her own ultimate sacrifice by using more power than she has ever before to reignite halas sun



possible solutions 1

in order for a character arc to succeed there needs to be a rhythm with extra emphasis on important points namely the beginning inflection points and end of the arc  the transitions from each point in the arc should be smooth and believable

carol is a person who bottles up her emotions and doesnt like to show weakness so some abruptness is to be expected when she eventually breaks down to monica  she also deflects strong emotions with sarcasm and humor so some wry asides and jokes are to be expected

however the emotional break down is waaaaay too abrupt and extreme and it is ineffective because we havent seen any of carols inner emotional struggles up until that point  shes releasing tension that the audience isnt even really aware of until that moment and immediately afterward is back to taking nothing seriously

a and c needed to be shown clearly at the beginning of the movie to establish how powerful she is and how that power and the problems it caused on hala were isolating and that power alone was unable to soothe or address her feelings of guilt about both hala and monica

h i j and m are the important inflection points  there are a lot more than usual because this movie is juggling essentially carols relationship to three different characters if we include darbenn  h needs a little more time in the oven  it should have been spelled out more clearly to the audience that carol was noticing kamalas family interactions and admiration and that they were slowly having a personal effect

i was actually handled pretty well  if there was a serious conversation about carol and marias relationship and what her death meant for both carol and monica it would be fine but that  j discussion never really occurs in the movie at all so the group hug doesnt land like it should

m is not a bad scene in isolation but because of the prior weaknesses in c h i and j it has almost no emotional impact  and because it is immediately followed by horribly forced comedy from fury and carol when they are supposedly dealing with the potential destruction of entire planets of people they care about any minor impact her breakdown might have had is immediately undermined and cheapened and evaporates in a fog of saturday morning cartoon goofiness

the fight at o is horribly choreographed and shot  it should be the coolest fight in the movie  but the cuts are fast the camera is zoomed in tight and the spacing is ambiguous  its by far the worst fight in the film  the final strike is shot so poorly its hard to even tell whats happening   this fight should showcase the three using the switching power in inventive ways and falls very flat  it looks as if the final moments of the fight were hastily spliced together at the last moment using left over footage from previous scenes

p should mirror monicas sacrifice  it is a ludicrously overpowered feat that should have been a long drawnout special effects extravaganza a la thor holding the forge open  monica made a huge sacrifice  carol should have been depowered to some extent by the act even if she was able to gain it back in later films  there need to be stakes to an act that grand and important  it essentially is the closing of her arc and to borrow a phrase reigniting a dying star and resolving the feeling of guilt that is supposedly the primary emotional impetus for this entire movie turns out to be actually super easy barely an inconvenience



well thats enough rambling for now   monica and kamalas arcs arent as poorly handled because they are more minor characters but they also have issues that needed addressing so ill explain how they could be fixed later

the only reason i took the time to type all this out is that this movie had potential  i didnt hate it  its just unfinished and it feels like someone at marvel decided to splice it together last second based on a bunch of focus groups and test audiences instead of sitting down and taking the time to tie everything together cohesively and end it well  its a real shame because i like all three of the main characters and they deserved better",2023-11-10 18:36:09
"ya know what it was a fun movie the most well written no but it was funny action packed and some great crowd pleasing moments and i loved it it’s not supposed to be a movie that makes you think and it’s not trying to be that kind of movie it’s a dumb action comedy that knows it’s a popcorn flick 

better than ant man yes way better not as good as guardians 3 secret invasion a million times better 

i definitely understand why people won’t like it the humor can be overwhelming at times brie larson irl general marvel fatigue a lackluster boring generic villain once again although acting wise i liked zawe ashton in the role 

but the positives outweigh the negatives to me 

the cameos the music choices the fight scenes with them switching powers it was all great kamala stole the show from the first scene the flerkittens scene was just…amazing especially using “memory” as the song choice 

one of my personal favorites this year",2023-11-10 20:43:09
"just turn your brain off and have fun dammit eat your garbage

the singalong scene was 60 seconds away from losing me completely and walking out  overall didnt hate it but that dragged on waaaaay too long and hadnt earned the audiences trust enough to warrant it,2023-11-10 06:58:26
this thread is  from both sides,2023-11-11 03:46:12
just got back from seeing it was fun enjoyed it the original captian marvel movie didnt really hit it for me but this one did,2023-11-11 06:02:14
i loved this movie the marvels were amazing villain was super dumb and pointless but i’m ok with that,2023-11-11 21:07:09
"this movie was so much fun iman vellani teyonah parris and brie larson were clearly having a bunch of fun i laughed a ton during this movie it seemed like the writers were throwing ideas at the wall laughing and saying that sounds awesome lets do that then doing that and it worked i also like that kamalas family wasnt just in the movie for that one scene but they were hanging out on the saber base the entire movie

downside is this movie was clearly hacked to bits in the edit bay and the villain is a bit underbaked it could just as well has been any aggrieved kree

how much you liked this movie is probably correlated to how much you liked the twerking scene in shehulk when my girlfriend and i saw the trailer for this before little mermaid she leaned over and said i want to see that shes not feeling well atm but when she is feeling well enough to go out ill take her to see it again",2023-11-12 02:41:12
iman put this movie on her back and ran with it,2023-11-14 01:37:31
"is there any space to be someone who doesnt like woke messages being forced into movies but also thinks the brie larsoncaptain marvel hate has gone way overboard i feel sorry for her tbh i cant imagine what thats like to go through mentally and im impressed by her ability to show up id crumble

the movie is ok im surprised by people who say its great and also by the really bad reviews its a fine onetime watch i liked that they injected captain marvel with a bit more of a personality in this

im not overly sold on rambo i didnt like her in wandavision and found her to be meh in this

ms marvel is super enthusiastic which is contagious not sure i really buy her as a superhero but that might just be me also think her enthusiasm is the complete opposite of how people feel about marvel nowadays shes so excited to be thereim not sure the general public are anymore which is a shame but im also getting fatigued at this point

there was no one in my imaxx theatre when i watched this also though i did go during the afternoon it was surreal to be at a marvel film alone

the midcredits scene was so bad when will marvel  characters off and let them be killed theyve been doing this since i think thor 2 with loki and despite lots of people voicing their concerns over it they continue to do it so rambo isnt dead which takes away all the sacrifice and emotional heft of that scene and also her mum isnt dead well multiverse mum but come onyou know what theyre doing in fact they do it so often that when someone dies in a marvel movie i and i assume others dont feel anything because youre waiting for them to come back and that cgid beast woof that was some of the worst ive seen in a while no thank you

the villain was as forgettable as almost all marvel moviesshows

but if you switch your brain off and just go on the ride its a decent wee watch",2023-11-15 10:21:09
but monica still doesnt know what to do with those tossed salad and scrambled eggs,2023-11-10 03:56:28
my reaction to the movie was the same as the guy who made a chicken sandwich from scratch its fine iman vellani was the standout for me,2023-11-10 05:21:26
"read the sf chronicle review about women weeping on screen and forced girl power and what i saw was a fairly decent marvel movie that kinda quickly had to jump around due to editing and got crushed in the end by trying to quickly set up a multiversal connection andna ham  heart string tug that wasnt earned due to editingpacing

its not civil war but its also not thor 2 thor 4 quantmania ant man 2 etc",2023-11-10 06:49:05
fairly near bottom of the barrel marvel for me this coming from someone who enjoyed captain marvel for the most part very bland and by the numbers  poor villain ms marvels  shtick gets annoying as well,2023-11-10 14:57:10
this really wasn’t good bad plotcgiediting the only saving grace for me was kamala and the flerkens 410,2023-11-10 21:04:47
this movie knew exactly what it wanted to be and if you wanted it to be different youre not going to like it its that simple personally i like the absurdity of it all song and dance number awesome 3 on 1 fight scene sweet kittens running around even better best marvel movie ever nope worst not for me,2023-11-10 23:52:10
"the flerkittenmemory scene got me to genuinely laugh out loud for the first time since my cat died so this movie will always have a special place in my heart for that scene alone

loved the callback to kamala’s show with the animated fan art was it iman or brie voicing captain marvel for those lines either way super cute and changing into a captain marvel shirt before meeting captain marvel peak fangirl

the musical planet reminded me of guardians if drax and his whole planet can’t understand metaphors makes sense there are planets that go hard the other way actually now i need to see drax on that planet

characterwise carol’s journey reminds me of thor and loki like thor she started her first movie powerful and a little too eager for battle looked down on earth culture until she remembered it was her own lol then vowed to become its defender like loki she was responsible for a near genocidal atrocity and is now atoning i’m really curious to see where she goes next  maybe training kamala and the other young avengers

the beast cameo was spoiled for me but that got a big reaction in my theater poor maria has been overshadowed by xmen cameos twice now",2023-11-11 05:59:39
so guys are telling me the marvels embraced the thor humor thats what it sounds like to me here i hate all the thor movies except for the last two,2023-11-11 19:19:23
"i found it to be fun movie they had nods to comic stuff the fights were inventive iman vellani is born for the ms marvel role it felt right coming from the other captain marvel appearances you didnt need to watch the shows  to understand it other than one scene anyway 
the post credit scenes are amazing

my family and i were talking about seeing it again we enjoyed it so much today",2023-11-11 22:30:58

i expected to not like it but overall it wasnt bad  its a movie i would consider letting play in the background when its on tnt or tbs  id give it a 5510  kamala was my favorite part by far,2023-11-12 13:46:48
"went to see it today

thought it was ok the performances were good but the villain was a bit bland and the story was meh

solid 6 out of 10",2023-11-12 20:45:14
waitso we just witness dar benn rip a hole in spacetime and  herself using both quantum bangles we then decide to let kamala khan a kid keep both bangles,2023-11-13 02:24:55
still a better use of memory and cats than cats,2023-11-13 07:29:12
thats some op equipment that the villain had needed a  roll on that mega rare hammer and an amulet of  to even consider fighting against someone your people would call the annihilator loved the movie definitely had a good day at the theater,2023-11-14 03:14:24
" im so glad seeing other people who enjoyed this movie the only thing i was hoping for was a spidermanshangchi cameo spiderman because its nyc and a space craft just fell out of the sky and shangchi because i believe kamalas bangles and shangs rings are going to be connected somehow

but that doesnt make me disappointed at all the mid credit scene was great i even thought the cgi was pretty good compared to alot of what we had gotten recently 

breaking the movie down it was really good and those three piece combos the marvels were giving to darbenn were nasty",2023-11-15 05:43:49
i thought the movie was good and i kind of gave up on marvel movies during this phase im all for female representation where the characters are just cool and theyre not just there to make a statement the bonkers scenes were enjoyable i never watched the miss marvel show but she did a great job in the movie,2023-11-15 07:26:52
"this was fun  it’s not one of thr mcu’s best and the ending felt rushed  but i had fun watching it

the plot is nothing special nor is the villain  but i think it’s the characters and their interactions that i really quite enjoyed

the three leads work well together carol is being given more of a personality  also iman vellani is so freaking charming and likable

i need to see more of carol and fury together  brie and slj just have tons of chemistry together
 
speaking of fury this film makes secret invasion feel even more pointless and mishandled  not only does fury feel like a different and better character here than he was in si  but a big conceit from si is directly contradicted here as well

i can get why some might not like it  but the singing planet was so comic booky that i really liked it  and the fact that it was carol doing it brie larson had a lovely voice was a cool surprise

it feels like with the ending the mcu might finally be moving in a real direction again  we shall see

also side note that carolvalkyrie thing is gonna get people talking i suspect which is what brie and tessa thompson might want actually",2023-11-10 03:41:37
"i enjoyed it i love that it featured three female protagonists and a female villain with no romantic subplots go bechdel test

that said i think the script needed a little more time in the oven if you will some parts did feel a bit rushed the swapping concept started making sense only after i made the leap that it occurred when the characters used powers simultaneously and even that may be a slightly flawed perception of the mechanic and the villain could have used a touch more nuance on the other hand my partner enjoyed it which is rare for him lol",2023-11-10 04:36:01
this movie confirms a theory that kang will cause an incursion in deadpool 3 and bring the xmen into the main universe,2023-11-10 06:48:46
really came out feeling indifferent to it theres some weak stuff like the villain and some weird pacing stuff and its overall rushed but theres nothing i would say is bad,2023-11-10 08:43:02
"ms marvel and her family were the stars and the heart of the movie the bad scripts or direction coundnt keep her down

teyonnah is ok she had this nerdy black girl personality and did fine the post credit scene really sets her up in big way her missing her mom is very relatable

captain marvel just exist in the movie and is the biggest loser of the silly and wacky theme her story is too depressing and serious to fit with the silliness and wackiness happening in the movie while brie larson gets more to do like show more emotions it dont have the energy or just doesnt click she comes off as less charismatic than captain marvel and her acting not working i dont understand what is wrong she is great in other roles its blockbuster roles where seem she lose her entire charm and simply exists

also for a movie revolving around family and friendship there is no mention carols actual family than maria and monica even after 30 years she still dont have any new friends other than valkyrie which again happens off screen


the biggest problem with the movie is its pacing their is so much incredble and horrifying things happening but movie never pauses to acknowldge the magnificane or brutality of what is happening billions of people dying cosmic dertuction

carol litreally powers a dying sun back to life one of the biggest powerful thing a character has done in live action yet it is presented in such a casual effortless manner that you never feel the impact meanwhile thor harnessing a tiny star power in infinity war the impact it leaves

simply a sense of cosmic scale magnificane and horror that you see in space and superhero movies is completely absent from the movie

i have given upon carol its clear we will not be seeing her much in mcu until kang dynasty and i dont expect any miracles in that movie which already has so many heros to fix such underdeveloped unrelatable character carol just probably became top in the list to die in the movie considering mcu seem to have no idea what the character and personality is even after two movies and movie seem to be doing worse than morbius

ultimately a bad movie with the worst villain till now in mcu with big pacing issues with iman being the only good part of the movie",2023-11-10 13:47:20
decent movie 6510,2023-11-10 13:52:07
still no mention of eternals was that in another universe or are they just pretending that movie doesnt exist,2023-11-10 14:11:50
when i first heard about that musical planet a year ago i was too worried ngl but after actually watching that sequence its prob one of my favorite parts of the film so colorful and fun i didnt expect for it to be that good,2023-11-10 14:22:48
this was a very mediocre film sprinkled with occasionally decent moments i had some huge issues with the film spoilers pertaining to antagonist and a whole laundry list of gripes about the villains role and methods throughout fundamentally the villain is taking revenge against carol under the guise of saving her planet no complaints with this root motivation which could have been a rich and compelling storyline but the character we could have gotten and the one we got are worlds apart which becomes apparent as more layers are added in one scene during badfaith negotiations with the skrull she outright tells them that she is going to be  away their atmosphere and theres no reaction or mention of this whatsoever until it actually happens which was mind boggling to me and seems to be one of many victims of edits and rewrites that were glossed over somehow the portals employed magically know that theyre intended to  up air water and the sun respectively despite no discernable difference between them the antagonists only combatrelevant abilities appear to be a particularly strong hammer the wiki from the comics indicates it as being a very capable tool but the movie only shows us a hammer thats kinda strong actually and a gauntlet that absorbs the marvels light based powers only when directly blocking them so somehow despite knowing full well the entirety of the antagonists combat prowess after reviewing the first fight the marvels explicitly acknoledge how this works so they definitely know they are still incapable of working around a single arm even when attacking as a threefold unit choreography flashy though it may have been i could not take any of the following combat encounters seriously when its painfully apparent that theres no reason this plotline should have advanced beyond the first planet and then at the end when the villain is already in the process of accomplishing her final goal of taking sol she takes the other gauntlet and kills herself with it for no reason she knew it would  her with the energy released and she was already accomplishing her goal so what purpose did this serve besides undermining what little character and motivation she actually had lastly throughout the entire film she had an air of extreme urgency leading her to be reckless which was never once explained ,2023-11-10 14:35:47
what can i say it is a captain marvel movie,2023-11-10 14:36:17
i legit laughed at its fine its carol when they were falling at kamalas house weird pacingediting issues overall a 510 but the post credits scene is a 1010,2023-11-10 15:34:57
"iman stole the show she was excellent overall not horrible and not great but there were things to be enjoyed

hope to see more of these characters soon in the context of a better screenplay",2023-11-10 16:15:37
"this film was incredibly poorly edited it was so choppy it also probably wouldve worked better with a set up movie as cm2 and then this third as a team up the villian was wellacted but needed way more depth to her and the plot was almost nonexistant again because of the choppy editing



that said i actually had a blast it was funny witty the dialogue was tight it made me laugh and the action was well choreographed brie was also a delight



id probably give it a 65 or generous 7 out of 10",2023-11-10 21:57:11
i enjoyed it and yes it was fun dammit better than quantumania or thor love and thunder which disappointed me i guess my expectations are low for most marvel movies right now but i wasnt disappointed i honestly loved the bonkers bits of the singing planet and peopleeating kittens which seem to be polarizing for some we really dont get enough fun scifi movies on other planets so marvels offearth movies help scratch that itch for me for my complaints the villain was pretty shallow the editing felt wonky at times and i think the movie couldve been longer i feel like there should be a tv series or something to cover captain marvels offscreen adventures,2023-11-10 23:53:48
i have very mixed feelings about this film the musical planet and cats swallowing everyone was  awesome but man the dialogue was bad brie larson gave one of the worst performances i have ever seen in a blockbuster film,2023-11-10 23:58:18
the staging of binary in the mid credits scene would have made more sense if it was carol instead of maria,2023-11-11 00:55:01
"the writing was incredibly lazy in some parts like monica suddenly knowing how to close the hole with some ridiculous technobabble or how their powers became intertwined for no reason or how they all had powers related to the em spectrum

it was good entertainment though sometimes an ultrapowerful superhero can be kind of boring especially after theyve exorcised their own demons im glad they gave danvers a run for her money

kinda sad spectre has already been banished to the realm where all marvel goes to die",2023-11-11 05:28:35
just saw it and critics were way too harsh on this one imo better than antman3 kamala and her family were great entanglement fight scenes were really fun and creative with the choreography yes the cats eating saber employees was weird wonder how that came about in the writers room lol,2023-11-11 23:00:02
"my only complaints are really only about the villain had a good flash back motivation but then it all kinds of disappeared after that

i would have liked to have seen her work with the heroes for once instead of getting another villain death

also i wanted to find out more about the hammer looked inspired by the infinity stone hammer was hoping they would end up giving some story that it was infused with a portion of the power stones power either before its destruction or gathering some of it afterwards somehow but no it was just the universal weapon and that was it",2023-11-11 23:06:53
hala sun is a meatball change my mind,2023-11-11 23:16:01
"marvel needs to drop all these boring people and focus on people that are  fun to hang out with

kamala khan was a blast to be with blew brie larson out of the water 

i am so excited to have someone who reminds me of the fun and smiles that rdjevansheimsworth brought me

less wandasstrangeshawkeyes more kamala",2023-11-12 01:36:56
"it was a dumb and fun movie but the only thing i felt it lacked was a solid character driven story around the actual marvels 

like there’s even a scene where captain marvel leaves behind skrulls to die and kamala argues with her but then it never gets brought back up 

i wish instead of taking so much screen time going through the motions of the big bad mcu villain they tried to write an interesting plot that’s more reliant on the three of them working together and dealing with these deeper themes how about a heist movie a mystery anything different than the villain with a big laser plot we’ve seen so many times 

carol is clearly a tough loner control freak who is filled with regret over her not being there for rambo and she has a girl who worships her now following her around this should have created an interesting dynamic but the writers did nothing with it i never felt anything deep between them no falling out no coming together for good as a team 

i just don’t understand how every mcu film isn’t treated with as much care as some others 

i had fun with the film if i didn’t think about it too much but i really didn’t feel much beneath the surface in this movie",2023-11-12 01:45:32
"first i liked and was entertained by this movie

second the moment the mcu jumped the shark will specifically be the musical planet scene 

third iman vellani and brie larson chemistry was fantastic these two are going to be done dirty by marvel on this film and it stinks because they were great

fourth as we’ve been seeinghearing this movie will not perform well and it stinks because it did some good things i enjoyed all the scenes with kamala’s parents

fifth kelsey grammar’s beast and binary reveal were awesome we still didn’t get a name for monica rambeau",2023-11-12 02:13:55
"loved the movie some cool concepts like i dont think i have seen the gimmick of 3 characters constantly switching places like that before kinda hoped the viallin was reedemed and had a more happy ending since she was literally trying to save her planet would have liked if the singing planet soldiers continued singing while fighting really liked the final fight hope we get to see more of the new avengers soon also i still wonder why monika couldnt close the hole from the other side

have seen people say the plot was confusing but to me it was quite simple the villain is stealing resources from other planets to rebuild hers after carol blowed the ai monika and carol have tension for reason the 3 are constantly switching and in the background fury and kamalas family had a wacky adventure

wonder what they will do with the ending if it will connect the xmen universe and if this somehow will tie with deadpool 3",2023-11-12 04:20:42
aside from the singing and the villain who i think is currently the worst mcu one that i can recall i enjoyed it a lot,2023-11-12 05:27:16
"iman vellani was the only good thing about this movie and carol had more personality than before some good laughs too however i feel like i saw a different movie than everyone here a forgettable villain who literally gets a single scene of backstory and literally gets walled in that scene captain marvel feels like she got nerfed to serve the plot the fight on song planet took me out of it as i just saw a set with extras on there felt nothing when rambeau got exiled as she felt pretty underdeveloped as a character and they teased her ten minutes later 

similar to the eternals where there is a worldending plot the avengers just dont care",2023-11-12 07:12:41
"the movie was pretty average for me in general
it felt very rushed with the pacing especially at the start i guess that they cut out a lot of scenes to cut down the run time or at least it felt like it 

a few moments that gave me pause 

bardenn just disintegrated before their eyes so they give the same quantum band to ms marvel and then tell her to direct an equivalent amount of energy to monica this seemed weird to me like given the context i would have expected her to have issues or something as she is kind of just human i was thinking at least captain marvel would have to do it as she is more resilient

and then captain marvel just leaves ms marvel to travel home alone on the ship a teenager was reigniting the sun so important she couldn’t spend a little time to actually make sure she doesn’t leave her high and dry she shouldn’t even really know if she actually has the power to do this and it might be dangerous to her surely she kind of does it so nonchalantly and quickly with no zoom in of her even struggling it kind of makes the whole thing weird like “oh i kind of forgot i was this powerful and could help you easily”

and after the quantum bands were floating in space wasn’t there a giant hand that scooped them up weren’t we under the impression that the bangles were generating the hard light that needed some kind of explanation somewhere

where were the quantum bands by the last scene i don’t think i saw both bangles on kamala and i very much doubt they would let her keep both given their power together but it was a central plot point to the movie and they just don’t even make a single scene post credits would be fine where they tell us where the bands are seems really crazy to me that they’d overlook it

i’m not sure i really understood why they needed to evacuate the saber base i thought that it was those flerken eggs somehow damaging things but i guess it wasn’t maybe it was something related to the kree attacking them was a bit confused on the exact cause as they blurred the flerken egg situation in there

think the whole end boss fight ended up a bit meh for me in general people get whacked around like pinballs a little but i think that ms marvel isn’t really at the same level as the other two like anyone toe to toeing with captain marvel a stray shot should be completely pancaking ms marvel as she’s just a human if she doesn’t directly block a shot with her hard light projection and bardenn taking all these attacks then getting pinned down by rubble just seemed a bit anticlimactic too either they’re tough or they’re not really seems a bit offputting to have it both ways like that just for plot purposes

even nearer to the start of the movie did we seriously see captain marvel fly off and then somehow did we hear ms marvel scream as they swapped and then somehow they heard that at the ground and monica had enough time to fly up and try to rescue her i don’t think sound travels anywhere near that fast… and tbh the whole switching thing if it was actually happening then wouldn’t captain marvel be intelligent enough to maybe not go into space and risk killing off ms marvel who can’t actually breathe in space tbh the scene where ms marvel was in space with the space suit felt a bit dodgy in general as the suit should have really traveled with monica too it’s not like they change clothes every time they switch… and monica can survive in space apparently as she closed the rip so i don’t even know why she was really in the clunky space suit to begin with…

beyond all that there were some funny jokes the fight scene at kamala’s house was fun the general premise if you ignore plotholes wasn’t too bad… i’d put the whole thing on the lower end of average marvel movies do require you to suspend your disbelief a little but i think this one did it more than i expected to where i just thought it was poorly planned and executed",2023-11-12 08:29:12
"i liked it but it is a mess it’s not complete  like ant man 3 by failing as drama and comedy this is fluffy but fun sometimes it’s a little annoying i think iman vellani’s character is supremely endearing but may need allergy meds lol very nasally

still like that xmen is coming but this must’ve been a quick reshoot given how shoddy beast looks",2023-11-12 14:32:33
"does  the events of secret invasion take place after the film the marvels 

it would make more sense if events of the secret invasion happen after the marvels  the lost of their colony tarnax make the skrull more radical on earth ",2023-11-13 02:55:20
"i’m a bit confused about the swapping places they are swapping between 3 people so if ms marvel uses her power how is it decided if captain marvel or monica takes her spot is it just completely random 

idk i just feel like this whole gimmick wasn’t explained well and was inconsistent and not used that creatively",2023-11-13 03:33:42
"i liked some of the ideas and i liked some of the scenes and i liked some of the performances but the movie felt thin and it could’ve used another script pass from the writers 

also samuel l jackson looks old age has caught up to him secret invasion was so bad it affected this movie ms marvel was so bad it affected this movie although vellani is not the problem",2023-11-13 04:30:45
in case people need something to laugh about hideo kojima reviews this week’s two major film releases,2023-11-13 11:51:06
"i was waiting for the boogie woogie moment where they all fall in sync and beat the tar out of the villain by taking full advantage of their swapping capability but it never came

010

but really it was a decent enough movie fun time better seen streaming than spending theater money on it",2023-11-13 15:47:08
based on everyones opinions youre just gonna have to watch it and decide for yourself im personally burnt out on super hero movies so theres a lot of other things out there,2023-11-14 13:40:49
"the movie was pretty fun i enjoyed most of the interactions between the marvels flerken usage was nice and there were some nice skits dont care much about the postcredit but the last scene was cool

but man the story was bad i spent the whole time wondering why they didnt just go the hala since they knew it was about the kree instead of failing at 2 rescues chasing after the vilain i hope the prince divorce carol btw its also weird that they try to have an emotional moment about rambeau closing the gate when she clearly announced she would do it its like in interstellar when theyre surprised that time goes slow in the planet where time goes slow

also they need to stop relying so much on physical confrontation when they have strong characters it shouldnt take them 5min to take down 2 krees and the villain should at least have some bruises after being triplepunch a couple times keep the brawls and luchador wrestling for nonpowered heroes",2023-11-14 20:39:50
"a lot better than i thought m the best thing in the film was carol and khamala monica was decent my main complaint is the villain she kinda just  and i don’t think there were enough scenes between her and carol and of course the cgi it was horrid but it wasn’t great either everything else ranges from a nitpick to decent  

i’d give this like a 6 or 710",2023-11-14 21:24:48
"this is the weirdest film ive had to think about it certainly was undercooked but had a bunch of good moments throughout

for starters i loved the weird sense of humor marvel basically remade the cats movie but did it better and the action did seem serviceable for the most part iman was also terrific

but the movie is severly underwritten the catharsis moments go by so quickly hey i think was responsible for wiping out the kree its ok were family so i guess were in a fast movie now and there is just way too much exposition and telling the audience not showing im not really sure why people think this is an editing problem when its clearly the script

i also think that the villain was not utilized well her underlying motivation is certainly sympathetic as an aside i think that jeremy jahms completely whiffed on his review of the movie since it was hard to follow a lot of the time what exactly he disliked this was probably the biggest thing i disagreed with him about i think theres a bit more depth to the antagonist than female ronan the accuser but i dont think that her grudge with captain marvel is leveraged well

overall not the worst of the mcu movies unlike this movie antman 3 was unredeemable and probably needed some more time in the oven putting more character moments and more weirdness would have definitely made this a good movie",2023-11-15 03:37:03
"ive seen every marvel film after endgame and this is the only one i liked from starttofinish not amazing but just a simple fun film i havent seen any of the shows and seemed to  understand it ok overall

its a shame its doing poorly i didnt even know it came out last week

i think marvel fumbled this one bad churning out so many mediocre films has caused mcu fatigue for the audience this movie is feeling the consequences of it and has to suffer",2023-11-19 04:41:01
"the movie was as long as a light french comedy you watch on a sunday afternoon i feel like a good 3050 minutes were lost in editing room

the villain is another generic villain you will forget at the end of the credits they tried to raise the stakes by having the villain try to steal our sun i never felt a threat there was barely a solar flarelike shown on screen for 2 seconds to evidence the process had started then poof she dead

i dont understand why monica had to be on the other side to close the gate well of course its a cheap shortcut to get her into the xmen universe lazy writing and her mum being an xmen  the exact person she wakes up to so we have a fake cliffhanger  and how did she went from space to the xmen compound 

also where was jude law character 

and kamala rushing alone and on her own  to kate bishop in order to form young avengers cringy 

i never miss marvel content because i consider series and movies the perfect pop corn content but many disappointments since endgame the marvels is one of them butchered in the editing room i guess",2024-01-17 02:59:31
better than ant man or thor for sure i enjoyed it but its not gonna blow anyones socks off,2023-11-10 03:20:01
"okay so if the film has three male leads its business as usual but if it has three female leads its pandering

i think there is an issue here and it is not with the movie",2023-11-10 22:52:27
fun beautiful visuals and so well made the entangled powers switching action scenes were amazing could it have been better yes but thats fine its fun and starting to tie in what weve been waiting for,2023-11-10 04:38:19
"i was never a fan of the mcu universe and although i acknowledge that the marvels doesnt appeal to me im not part of the target audience its kinda sad that there are so many people cheering because it flopped like wanting it to happen so they can have content to trash the movie on their youtube channels 

and it might be true that the movie failed in so many ways to be a decent product but still why do people have such joy in watching this movie amongst others fail and why cannot be criticized in a creative and constructive way instead of doing it for the sake of meanness",2023-11-13 18:14:40
"it was fun  thats all i need

edit  ill rate it as high as possible to balance out the losers who review bomb",2023-11-10 07:11:10
"our family saw this and loved it i dont get the hate i mean i do but its not even closely warranted the flerken memory montage was amazing and probably one of my favorites now a buttload of flerkens are on earth i fully expect to see a lot of callbacks to this in future marvel films

one thing i dont get is why kamala only went back to earth with one bangle and not both she demonstrated she can withstand the power of both so why not let her keep them",2023-11-13 15:23:28
"i loved goose and all of the itty bitty furbabies   
its the best marvel film 1010  
it beats thor love and thunder for sure",2023-11-11 17:48:05
"i dont know that i understand anymore were firmly in the phase of the hot thing is to hate on marvel movies and shows i think the critics feed on this and proactively incorporate that narrative into their reviews fatigue too much bad cgi blah blah blah

i really liked this movie it was funny it was colorful it had great soundtrack choices it had a plot that i havent seen in the comics and it had really inventive material the swapping places fight choreography the singing planet the escape from saber the way the climax gives a plausible and the most overt setup for the multiverse saga to date the setup of kamala taking the nick fury role for championsyoung avengers etc
yes the villain is throwaway thats intentional you cant have thanos or kang in every movie yes it seems to ignore secret invasion which seems wise at this point

but this is an enjoyable movie with great hero characters that was well executed i dont get why so many people wont accept that opinion particularly those that seemingly havent seen it i often click off of reddit wondering about how awful it must be to need to dislike everything all the time",2023-11-11 21:00:55
excluding gotg3 which is in class of its own best mcu movie since the last spiderman for me,2023-11-12 03:11:23
it was alright the kids enjoyed it,2023-11-13 08:59:24
captain marvel was so  likable this movie it was delightful,2023-11-16 06:52:48
never understood the hate with brie larson she is a perfect captain marvel this was a fun and enjoyable film to watch the villain was pretty meh but honestly watching the dynamics between the trio was delightful i hope we could see another film with them together again loved it,2023-11-22 04:22:49
"let me preface this by saying im one of those people that didnt really like captain marvel  both the movie and the actress playing her ive been seeing people  on this movie ahead of time for months now and was prepared as i walked in to do the same i hoped i would be proven wrong though  
  
well it turns out that i was from start to finish i thoroughly enjoyed this movie while the majority of it took place in space carol danvers seemed much more humanized here kamala was a lot of fun too reminded me a bit of “silly barry” in the flash from earlier this year captain marvel had an opponent that could actually take on her on even footing too — it took three marvels to take her down there was no shoehorned scene of carol emasculating some hillbilly guy or anything to that effect it was just three great superheroes and maybe a cat or two doing their thing   

in addition to what i felt was a good standalone story we also got good backstory on monica rambeau and even more on carol and let me also say that i’m not someone that’s watched any of the disney plus stuff but i still mostly followed along and enjoyed myself   

this all tells me that disney’s marketing for this film has been atrocious i never would have thought this movie would come together the way it did and leave me saying “wow this was one of the better superhero films of the whole year” from any promotional material behind it between antman and guardians 3 from this year from marvel i place this in between only because gotg3 had a certain finality of a whole trilogy to it with all of its characters and handled that part so well otherwise though this is up there with it  

all in all it was a lot of fun to me some silly parts sure but that’s all part of the fun of it i actually thought the musical planet was a fun distraction and a good way to showcase another side of carol and the catthing was silly but also was a nice payoff to an ongoing bplot as well 

all in all i quite enjoyed this even though i most certainly did not expect to do so",2023-11-10 04:16:33
"i liked it not the best marvel movie but far from the worst ms marvel is definitely the highlight

i honestly dont understand all of the negative buzz i think the most basic problems are that its not called captain marvel 2  a lot of people were turned off after two unknown characters were featured so heavily in the trailers the disney shows feel like homework to so many casual fans  if you want them to pay to see a movie this isnt the way to do it",2023-11-10 06:43:11
"some of the placement swapping editing was terrible especially in that first fight 

i think the movie needed about ten or so more minutes add some quick shots to smooth out the teleportation and make it followable and maybe some quick lines of dialog to build up danvers and the villians animosity and that danvers hates and is ashamed of the annihilator title

this movie isnt perfect but deserves more credit than the early reviews scores

way better than i thought itd be one of the stronger mcu film entries since endgame and ive liked most of them it doesnt take itself too seriously so might not be for everyone,2023-11-10 11:44:06
they should just ditch kang movie for now and just make kamala geeking out with other super heroes while recruiting new members for her notsoyoungavengersintheir20s team i’d watched it on opening day,2023-11-10 22:04:22
"that post credits scene has got to be the most hype since the first introduction of thanos in the avengers

i really hope they use secret wars as an mcu reboot to lead towards an xmen vs avengers movie eventually in the same vein as civil war",2023-11-10 22:17:23

 not the worst marvel movie i’ve seen in theaters i’d go so far as to say it was enjoyable,2023-11-12 22:30:40
"this movie was wild and caught me offguard a few times especially planet bollywood which was thankfully a gag shortened so it didnt overstay its welcome

is it some brilliant piece of cinema oh lordy no 

but it was fun and got a few really good laughs out of me loved the marvels themselves but i will say i felt nothing for the villain she had no real buildup or character to make me care about her or her motives climax felt a bit rushed

but it was a really fun movie and worth seeing on the big screen and overpayin for food and goofing off with my buddy plus the midcredits scenehooooooooo boy",2023-11-15 04:59:49
"yea  thing was review bombed movie was fantastic mostly people are pretending they’ve seen it by mentioning the end credits and some other spoiler they heard on the intarwebs had someone try to tell me there was a hunt for kamal because of the bracersand there is not

then there is this review from rotten tomatoes that i suspect is the majority of that nonsense 

“ i was ready to love the marvels but it was like ordering filet mignon and getting some dinner rolls and a plate of overcooked mixed veggies instead i love good dinner rolls but they aren’t a main course”

reviews got clowned",2023-11-10 12:04:26

"i think the plot was almost incomprehensible theres a moment where they go oh shes stealing resources from planets and targeting the worlds that are dear to me but we dont know which planets are dear to captain marvel because we know nothing about her life in space i guess we know shes friends with the green painted aliens because of the first movie but weve never seen her visit their new planet i feel like they get shafted in this movie like oh yeah sorry we couldnt save 90 of your population go with valkyrie

the movie felt underwritten like they were just checking boxes to make another marvel movie it was kamalas first time in space and theres not any moment where she marvels at the sights i thought it was lazy how they used the thought exploration headset to show us captain marvels inner conflicts i do like that they gave carol more development but i still think they could have done more with her it even felt cheap for a 200 million movie like the training montage was just them standing in the ship it would have been cool to see them playing baseball",2023-11-11 09:47:49

"i think it would have gone a long way to cut out beating the flerkin joke to death scenes and replaced that time with other scenes being better paced
i thought they were going to go somewhere with carol leaving people to die and kamalas image of her being shattered but no they gave up on that immediately
but its a comic book movie they made some quips had a couple fights that had some cool parts the chemistry between the three leads was pretty solid
another fun popcorn flick that couldve been better",2023-11-10 04:00:32
not as bad as i was expecting it was overall a pretty fun movie kamala was amazing just turn your brain off and youll enjoy it so fun dont listen to the incels they hate women and fun best marvel movie since gg3,2023-11-10 17:39:10
"it’s one thing to be getting tired of the mcu house style which i admittedly am but it’s another entirely for that house style to be looking cheaper and cheaper as the series goes on

i’m well aware how brutal these projects are for effects teams which isn’t helping anything but that’s not the only factor behind why they feel poorly made the editing is weird and choppy the music stinks the action feels like they had half a day to rehearse all dialogue scenes are shot exactly the same way so much with people standing around with fake backgrounds that are barely better than the most egregious exposition dialogue scenes from the star wars prequels

i like these characters i want these movies to be good james gunn managed to make a great one amid all this and raimi got a few of his own touches in but i’m reaching a breaking point with how poor the production look and feel is it wasn’t tolerable with the dc projects and it’s getting really old here even if the scripts and performances were note perfect and they aren’t they can’t save these projects from the fastfood assembly line feel",2023-11-10 17:43:50
"i rate it 2 12 stars which is pretty good for a superhero flick  
i saw it last night fun cosmic action in typical nia dacosta fashion it feels like there was far more story planned than what we get  
its a deeply unserious movie but it never goes as far into being a cartoon as love and thunder did it maintains a solid superhero ethos throughout and doesnt veer into sitcom  
i personally love a cosmic hero so im biased here  but there was a moment when captain marvels energy blasts sounded like a choir of angels singing 

some very trippy visuals which i particularly enjoyed

if youre watching these movies for a deep plot this will be a miss for you if you want a solid light superhero flick with some excellent characters marvels is your flick  
people in the theater gasped at the hirsute character cameo at the end",2023-11-10 19:32:53

the sheer amount of youtube movie reactors with them pouting as a thumbnail about this movie is hilarious,2023-11-10 21:51:08
i dunno why this movie is getting the backlash it is i was smiling the entire time fun time not top tier marvel but no where near bottom tier the three actresses killed it and it’s a shame this movie’s performance is likely gonna affect our future with them,2023-11-11 15:37:52
so lots of hate for this movie even from critics i kind of respected i simply just dont see it this movie is fine and an awesome no but most marvel movies are not  most movies are not but the idea that this is a disaster is just wrongheaded i also think a lot will be blamed about weakness and black people and this and that but the reality is disney did not promote this movie at all they should have pushed it until the strike was over and they could have done a real marketing campaign,2023-11-11 18:18:35
"710 

super messy ending but a good mid to low tier mcu movie not much competition in phase 5 so a second place behind gotg3

i loved the team up and their training montage its a shame they didnt actually learn to fight the villain using those powers good chemistry although a bit less fangirling would have been ok too 

cool planets although they felt smaller than usual

fury and the khans had no point lol 

really happy captain marvel finally gets to be likeable and honest honestly wish shed show up more often now but she is too powerful 

movie was quite short too",2023-11-11 21:58:02
"this is a perfect airplane movie bit amazing but not absolutely garbage compared to recent mcu duds this was fine

but its clear to see so much was lost in editting im disappointed thheg really glossed over the fact carol was responsible for the death of a planet and civilisation like how kamala would see not everything a hero does is good and add some more conflict to that revelation",2023-11-12 04:50:45
went into the movie knowing nothing about what i would see…it reminded me of a marvel universe meshed with a fan girl bollywood theme that added a dash of a game of thrones vigilante with cats that saved space there were definitely some good components but the emotions needed to be tamed as well as the multiple universes,2023-11-12 23:56:07
"this pretty much sums it up for the marvels  
",2023-11-13 13:50:48
i had fun its not a great movie the villain lacks impact and nothing ever felt in danger but it was fun i enjoyed this more than some of the recent marvel movies like love and thunder or black widow,2023-11-14 22:50:29
this movie is a 10 out of 10 the switch fighting scenes were awesome f what haters say,2023-11-11 16:07:40
marvel movies are for airplane rides now this one won’t even get that much of a notice call me when galactus shows up,2023-11-10 20:18:47
this movie i think is more for women and girlsi did find the singing culture scene freakin hilarious for some reason takes all kinds,2023-11-10 03:07:56
"i  dont get the intense backlash  
i think this is a really good movie for general audiences   
those who arent film buffs or mcu followers instead if you just want a fun random scifi space adventure that you can take the kids to this is the one   


and i stress its fun 

i had so much fun with this waaay more than quantumania or love and thunder   
and i dont even like captain marvel as much

  
for the negatives its the obvious the plot is decent the cgi is meh the characters are verrry disconnect fury is nothing like his character in secret invasion the actors are all right brie larson has just one emotion throughout

x200b

but what saves the movie for me is iman vellanis ms marvel  and her whole family the post credits scenes and just the sheerlightheartedness of it all   


i think this is just you very average marvel film and i mean that in a good way if you dont think too much about the plot or the nitpicks and just let yourself enjoy it you really will have a good time the hijinks and comedy were sooo welcomed 

x200b

its a weird movie but it may just be your kinda weird",2023-11-10 06:29:07
godawful  like the rest of the marvel slop,2023-11-10 04:49:30

"why’s no one talking about how dope the fight scenes were this movie was next to shang chi in that the choreography felt so crucial to telling this story correctly due to the powerswapping shenanigans 

every fight felt rewatchable to me because there were constant blocks parries combo alleyoop moments and people getting knocked into various objects the house fight scene in particular was making use of every object in the room which i love to see i really think the attention to detail here is what elevated the movie for me",2023-11-12 13:59:16
"alright so we can all agree this was easily the weakest movie marvel villain like ol girl was the most forgettable antagonist i’ve seen tbh so boring and a weak motivation this was really just an excuse to get carole monica and kamala together and honestly i’m ok with that i loved the movie  all the negative pre screening ratings and the tweets etc etc made this out to be the worst thing ever

it’s a pretty weak story but the story is basically a conduit through which carole and monica rekindle their relationship and kamala comes into her own she honestly carried the movie her actress is so good and i loved her family in this one felt like a direct continuation of the disney  series which was nice

but speaking of disney  series i feel like this made secret invasion pointless lol like did fury feel no shame for basically causing all of this not even a mention of what had happened before with the skrulls

i loved the comedy in this one too brie larson seems to have got much more comfortable in this role and captain marvel really feels an actual person for once samuel is being allowed to be more of himself in his role as fury and i’m loving it we saw that in secret invasion and it’s continued into this

now one question i have with the movie is kamala using both bangles they didn’t explain this but i’m assuming she can use both because she’s a mutant as well or because her grandmother’s people are from another dimension which also raises the question of how they got split in multiple dimensions

that post credits scene man i love going to the cinema with other comic fans the collective gasp everyone let out at seeing beast at the end was so  cool i kinda hate that he’s cgi but hopefully by the time secret wars comes around they’ll have fixed that it’s so cool to see him in the mcu  this’ll set up the xmen in secret wars and it’s fitting it happens in a movie with msmarvel since she’s our first confirmed mutanttechnically scarlet witch and quicksilver were but that’s another story

it satisfied my mcu craving but man this movie definitely shouldn’t have been delayed,2023-11-10 06:31:54
"i thought it was really good 

well paced the comedic moments worked well and never went on so long as to get old like could’ve easily happened with the singing planet and the serious moments were allowed to play out without being undercut by dumb jokes 

i was fine with the villain being a bit simple not every villain has to be super complex i’m fine with them being over the top comic book evil some of the time reminded me of zod but not as good but that’s more on michael shannon being great 

didn’t like a couple things the flerken kitten eating scene was fun but i would’ve rather had more about the aftermath of the water being taken from the singing planet i also thought carol reigniting hala’s sun at the end should’ve seemed a bit more difficult 

i’d give it a b",2023-11-11 00:04:23

"saw the movie last night  overall pretty enjoyable and like many having said very charming   
 a bit silly here and there often intentional sometimes not but also works hard to humanize carol and plausibly explain why she was absent from earth for such a long stretch  

pacing was definitely a bit rushed in order to keep the runtime down but the entire theatre seemed to be having a good time especially during the cats scene  the movie isnt perfect but deserves zero hate for anything",2023-11-12 13:54:10
i genuinely thought the movie was really fun  was it perfect nope the villain   but this is probably the 4th mcu movie i liked watching since endgame  the humor was top notch and iman vellani was great,2023-11-16 06:05:23

 lots of fun not too long
 iman vellani is an absolute treasure kamalas family are a lot of fun too
 brie teyonah and iman have great chemistry
 hope we get to see more lashana lynch after that postcredit scene cos shes awesome
 kelsey grammer

cons

 typically poor mcu villain
 editing is haphazard maybe some exposition got cut because it does seem to lurch from one action scene to the next without a great deal of explanation might do better on a rewatch 
 not a huge fan of the score i really liked the electronic themes from the first captain marvel so perhaps should have brought pinar toprak back for that",2023-11-10 17:43:02

having watched all the mcu movies but none of the shows i wasnt necessarily confused about any plot points it seemed like a pretty basic story but i definitely had to just go with the flow and not over analyse why certain things werent explained one has already been mentioned by another user kamalas powers without the band",2023-11-10 22:57:30
"i was entertained i do think marvels formula has some major issues and this movie couldnt escape all those issues but i found it all to be pretty inoffensive

 this is carols best appearance 
 kamala and here family were all great 
 i wish monica made a stronger impression on me but she was fine
 i enjoyed the villain not much depth but i thought her motives were good and realistic and the actress portrayed her in a realistic way too
 loved the flerken sequence and how it was shot like a horror movie that was amazing i dont care what anyone says",2023-11-11 04:53:34

"personally i understand all the hate that movie gets but i think people overhate the movie abit

yes the movie isnt well done technically the story is badwhich marvel story was good i might ask and the overall tone is aimed at 10year old girls

i was in that movie with my daughter and she had a blast it was really the best time i had all year just because he kept laughing and cheeringfor tony our rl cat not the marvels btw ofc i would have hated the movie too i am a 40year old nerd but the target audience loved it
and there are even a few fighting bites in the beginning which were legit good


the question ofc is why marvel tries to make movies for nonmarvelfans while they are in so much debt to all of you guys but for my little girl this was great she loved it",2023-11-11 20:50:26

one thing didnt didnt work much for me was dar ben wth kinda villain name is that furthermore the villain being like a wannabe ronan i get it kree empire and what not but she was kinda lame for a super villain lame only because it seems as a ronan rehash

another annoyance is dar ben is doing some pretty catastrophic stuff siphoning atmosphere and then a sea singing planet is gone now

isnt that when we need a crossover guardians of the galaxy that little girl who seems to have marvel abilities thor or valkerie coming to help i mean dar ben was going to syphon the sun

then with the fabric rip at least bring in doctor strange he dealt with it twice already significantly

i actually thought they was gonna cameo america chavez doctor strange wong and chavez popping in post credit or somethinf we may be able to help you get monica

there were things i absolutely loved

i especially liked kamala’s reaction when she found out monica’s mom passed while monica was blipped she just immediately walks over and gives monica a hug then prompts carol to do the same she is just such a sweetheart and was one of my favorite ten seconds of any mcu movie so far make fun of me all you want… i stand on that",2024-02-11 01:12:08

brie larson is insufferable hated by the right and left and everyone inbetween she has a  personality and she allegedly wants to quit because she cant handle the backlash rolls eyes i dont give a  what anyones beliefs are i know what my beliefs are and i live my real life that way im just here to watch a good movie when i say movie i mean movie left right middle i dont care as long as its not some political advertisement so when it comes to movies i think brie larson is a great actress i like her style as an actress and is very pleasing to the eye but her  personally does show up all over her face

in saying all of this i thought this movie was very good iman vellani is as cute as can be you cant not love her and her family teyonah parris is a very strong actress very dimensional and very likeable brie larson was surprisingly cute charming and funny i dont know if they purposely made her that way or if its her or a combination of both but it worked

let me explain

so i’ve just watched the absolute masterpiece that is loki’s season 2 finale i’ve just came back from a 3 hours road and earlier tonight i’ve watched the marvels for a second time this time on imax 2d and more ready to digest the film it’s something i always have done to mcu films a second watch to have a better grasp of it and then something dawned and i really need to talk about this because i think people are missing a massive point from the marvels

darbenn isn’t this film’s actual villain the villain in the marvels is no one other but carol danvers prodigal child of the milky way captain marvel and… the annihilator  that’s the plot twist allow me to explain before the carol corps come after me one of the things most often criticized about the marvels is that the villain is forgettable here is the thing darbenn was just a cypher in the comics just like she is just a cypher in this film she isn’t the actual villain of the film she is the antagonist there to make the superheroines look cool with their entangled powers yes but she is there much more to represent what carol danvers did after the captain marvel film and how ashamed she is of it than anything else 

without diving too much deep in the real world allegories of the first captain marvel film it’s clear that underneath the personal stakes for carol danvers there is a not so thinly veiled story about oppressors kree and oppressed skrulls that film ends with carol danvers sending yonrogg jude law back to hala the home world of the kree’s empire with a very clear and sound message tell the supreme intelligence that i’m coming to end it the war the lies all of it and she did put an end to the supreme intelligence like it was shown on the marvels but that resulted in a kree civil war and without the supreme intelligence to rule over the kree hala was perishing hala was becoming uninhabitable and darbenn’s true purpose in the film as the supremor leader of the now fractured hala’s empire was to represent captain marvel’s shame punching her way out a complex conflict didn’t help and while one could say that darbenn is a zealot that would cross the skrulls anyway the film goes out of its way to show that darbenn did reach out to the skrull’s refugee leader trying to arrange a peace treaty between the two people

the marvels is at a personal level about captain marvel learning to allow people to get close to her yes a girl that she helped raise that idolized her that ended up becoming her woman by her own tragic life trials  monica rambeau  and a new girl that completely idolized her and thought she could absolutely do no wrong  kamala khan but it is at a macro level about white savior syndrome and how ashamed carol was that in fact she couldn’t alone bring peace to the kreeskull conflict after all in fact even if with good intentions even if it was trying to free galaxies from the kree empire’s ruthless domain the home world of the kree empire was dying monica is the one realizing that what darbenn was asking for is fair captain marvel has the power to reignite the sun and that’s the core of the marvels that’s the moment that captain marvel starts to redeem herself

i think one big massive mistake that fans of the superhero genre have is that they are used to easy black and white solutions yes the kree empire was an evil force in the galaxy yes captain marvel had to do something about their rule but what this film shows  similar like zemo showed in captain america civil war  is that underneath the legend of the captain marvel the legendary superhero of earth that monica calls aunt carol kamala idolizes or the kree from hala call the anihilator there is an woman trying to do the best she can with the insane amount of power she has but she doesn’t  need to fight her battles alone  and wars between two different civilizations or people can’t be ended by simply punching hard 

darbenn could have been literally any other kree that’s her point in this particular story she isn’t there to be a memorable villain she is the consequence of captain marvel trying to end with the war and the lies like she promised by the end of the first film could this film being betteri think so i don’t think it’s a perfect film by any means i think it’s flawed but i think marvel’s actual secret sauce is how human this larger than life stories are how flawed the very best most powerful and arguably some of the most inspiring of them can be i came out from the film yesterday after my first watch thinking the marvels didn’t surpass the captain marvel film but the more i think about it more i think that nia dacosta and the screenwriters actually told a very bold marvel story you don’t win an war by radicalizing more people and i think both captain marvel and the marvels use the rich marvel comics mythology to tell a story that seems kinda needed these days wars aren’t ended by radicalizing more and more people and while my head is beaming with what the marvels means to the mcu’s future — 1 give me the young avengers right now 2 did parallel earth binary lost her memories to rogue like the comics and that’s why beast and xavier were the ones she was hanging out 3 what are the consequences of captain marvel’s redemption reigniting hala’s sun if any sure she is next to wanda and thor the most powerful avenger but there is a lot of radiation in the sun doesn’ please tell me they aren’t going there and don’t even start with what loki sets up with that glorious season finale — but i love when marvel tackles the morality of their superhero stories it might fly under the radar a lot but i think there is a lot of subtext there worthy to explore and talk about beyond talking about ‘superheroes defeat big bad’",2023-11-10 09:21:46
what’s up with these post credit cameos having the worst cgi ever,2023-11-10 09:16:33
i did like how to the point it was the middle conflict was refreshing on that field planet  they talked apologized and got back to it  nice,2023-11-10 09:32:50
"i didnt love it but it wasnt nearly as bad as i thought it would be rambeau should get her own film i really like the actress the rest of the cast was good too 

that said the movie was absolutely bonkers i mean it was out there sometimes the craziness worked sometimes it didnt

there was a really great movie somewhere in there i think and i wish it would have really nailed it",2023-11-10 13:24:31
attention crew members just allow  the kittens to eat you,2023-11-10 13:34:20
5510 for me the villain was very bad she had good motivation for her actions but everything else about her stunk enjoyed the leads thought they had good chemistry wouldnt mind seeing them team up again in a future project,2023-11-10 13:40:42
"so i went to the bathroom at one point and i swear it only took 2 minutes but apparently i missed valkyrie showing up

what was that scene",2023-11-10 13:50:00
monica gets stranded in another universe just give america chavez a call,2023-11-10 14:52:51
better than the original but quite messy movie definitely got cut up a bit,2023-11-10 15:10:08
iman vellanis kamala is the best part of the movie her charm and presence is great but i stand by that she had absolutely no reason to be in the movie sadly the entanglement mechanics they made is the only reason to include her and the only reason the movie is as long as it is considering just how weak the villain is both powersetwise and also motivationwise the chemistry they had on the ship really is great though and the entangled fights are also pretty great also theres already a glimmer of great in brie larsons carol danvers sadly the movie got bogged down by everything else i would love for this movie to be solely focused on carols action on hala and the consequences it brings to create someone like darbenn and her connection to monica that in this movie felt rashly resolved the khan family was charming and great on the house scene they dont need to be on the spaceship the flerken storyline couldve been used for other more indepth development of carol this nick fury might as well be from another universe because holy  did they not at least watch secret invasion how jarring the end scene and the midcredit scene are pretty great but theyre not worth going to the cinema for all in all the runtimes too short the editing is a mess the character arcs and development got cut short for unnecessary subplots and the villain is an alltimer bottomtier mcu villain iman vellani is a great addition the three main characters dynamic is pretty good and the switching places action sequences are great 610 wait for disney,2023-11-10 15:19:56
"i thought there were some interesting ideas that they introduced but then didnt do much with them

1 monicas feeling of abandonment by carol when she was the only family that monica had left
2 a never meet your heroes type of thing with kamala where she realizes that carol isnt the person from her fantasies kamala is a young girl who idolizes carol so it couldve even been an interesting parallel to monica another young girl who idolized carol but was failed by her couldve had overall celebrity worshipparasocial relationship commentary as well 
3 carols feelings of isolation since it seems like her job was basically just to hang around in deep space by herself waiting for people who need her help on whatever random planet and the antisocial behavior that comes with it which would further her issues with monica and kamala
4 all of those things would set carol up as a very flawed hero which wouldve been interesting since they intended her to be one of the big new faces of the franchise postiron mancaptain americathor

i know that this is a superhero movie and an mcu one at that so maybe they cant go super deep into the character drama stuff at risk of turning off the people who want to see action but if they explored those things a lot further it couldve even made a weak villain not be that big of an issue

but since they just kind of touched on those things and didnt really explore them at all they had the weakest villain in mcu history the pacing was really weird and it seemed like three different movies they spliced together overall it was just pretty bad",2023-11-10 16:51:35
"i have watched seven marvel films

 iron man the last half of it it was okay

 guardians of the galaxy very good

 doctor strange not terrible

 guardians of the galaxy 2 not great

 spiderman homecoming pretty good but felt like something was lacking

 shangchi and the legend of the ten rings bad

 captain marvel slightly above average

i am considering watching another based on my tastes would i enjoy the marvels",2023-11-10 17:15:34
can i call the villian skroob,2023-11-10 17:18:31
ive never related more to a marvel character than monica rambeau holding a drink in each hand and just vibing to the music,2023-11-10 17:51:42
i was so happy when they didnt even try to save anyone from the bollywooddisney world,2023-11-10 17:54:00
it was a fun i guess costumes looked pretty cheap though  i really hope there is more effort on these screenplays though because there was a lot of possibility for conflict and character development that just wasn’t there or earned,2023-11-10 17:54:25
i noticed that kamala only had one bangle again at the end of the movie i wonder what they did with the other one,2023-11-10 17:54:34
i heard there was too be a sound at the end of the credits however my theater cut the audio after the final scene can anyone confirm whether or not there was anything at the very end,2023-11-10 19:03:08
"wasn’t bad wasn’t great  had some good funny moments  

that cgi at the post credits there could have used some more baking time",2023-11-11 01:14:55
 the castle on the singing planet is shaped like a pipe  and i think thats really cool world design,2023-11-11 02:04:51
"i thought it was okay about typical of the mcu lately iman vellani was the best part the plot nothing and villain was forgettable 

i hope marvel studios uses 2024 to really come up plan for the future of the mcu",2023-11-11 05:16:38
"anyone else thought the whole sequence with the skrulls hit wayyy too close to what’s happening in the world these days i mean you have

 the kree forcing the skrulls to accept a “peace deal”

 the kree gets attacked by captain marvel and they blame the entire skrulls colony for it and blame them for breaking the “peace deal”

 the kree then launches a doomsday weapon against the skrulls giving them only a few minutes to evacuate hundreds of thousands of skrulls 

 the skrulls when told by captain marvel to evacuate tell her “we have no where else to go”

 a whole load of skrulls children die in the aftermath and all captain marvel can do is say “we can only save who we can save” and leave everybody else",2023-11-11 15:42:59
"i have seen all the mcu movies loki season 1 is the only disney marvel series i have seen it finally showed

good thing i do follow tvmovies news and knew who was kamala khan to get some pointers even though i dont quite know her abilities and psychology and they made it clear enough that monica rambeau was carol danverss friend little daughter from the first movie however she now is working in space with nick fury and has powers how why what  who cares and earthlings have upgraded from helicarriers to space spation at some point

and the skreekrulls  you better remember some parts of the quite forgettable first captain marvel movies to know who are those aliens why they dont like each other what they are capable to do and dont wonder why the kree skrulls  a bit of interchangeable names there are very different morphotypes

really seem like this is the most reliant on series dump info we got in the whole mcu



apart that  well it was entertaining enough for the 100 minutes i was there then quite forgettable in the foreseeable future brie larson was good iman vellani was endearing the khan family was the comic relief nick fury was there the villain lady will go right into the forgot what was that mcu villain",2023-11-11 20:39:16
"as a huge marvel fan i wasnt too big of a fan of this movie i think there are some character moments and concepts that start to come in and then stop to move the plot forward fast because of that it seemed like it went all over the place even with its tone there were a lot of jokes that didnt land for me that well although i thought the flerken scene and the khans were hilarious and the villain while the concept of her backstory was interesting didnt develop enough

that being said i still loved the chemistry of the three main characters all them were great i liked brie larsons carol danvers more here than the previous movies she was charming teyonah paris did great and i liked her arc with brie although i wish it was resolved a little better and iman vellani really carried this movie for me for sure shes the heart and soul of this thing",2023-11-11 21:57:36
in my limited scrolling i didnt see anybody mention it did anybody else notice that in the flashback to carol with maria carol said monica was blipped before the snapped people came back it wasnt called the blip until the return and maria died before the return,2023-11-11 23:09:03
"watched jeremy jahns tear this movie apart beforehand and went in with low expectations  honestly not that bad 6510

felt like a phase 2 mcu movie like not in a bad way a relatively organic continuation of the story well stories in this case that was both selfcontained and had massive implications at the same time 

the first act was really entertaining 2nd started to fade a bit third was choppy and fell kinda flat for me 

however not once was i bored a la eternals annoyed at the jokes a la thor 4 or confused as to whats going on a la quantumania 

struggling to call the villain mcus worst because absolutely nobody will remember her at all her motivation and plan was pretty strong though dont get the criticism of its literally spaceballs

im a little disappointed in nick fury being reduced to quippy bossman these last few movies he used to be a strong presence now not so much

anyway man oh man is this one gonna flop hard there were 15 people on a saturday during opening weekend here",2023-11-12 00:31:09
"1 why exactly did the saber space station start malfunctioning main villain lady didn’t open a portal to earth’s sun til the last bit was it just because of goose and the eggs

2 was initially confused at the urgencypanic surrounding monica closing the portal and being “trapped” on the other side—figured that meant they’d just have to fly to hala and grab her especially since breathing in space isn’t a problem for anyone anymore it’s like i’m watching jimmy neutron once they showed monica was whisked away to the kelsey grammar universe i got it but it’s not like anyone in the movie knew that was going to happen",2023-11-12 00:55:08
i cant believe they did a ricky oh ending,2023-11-15 00:25:06
i kept on telling my wife that if they wanted the bangle from dar benn they could’ve gone all “lord of the rings” and just chopped her arm off,2023-11-15 08:56:25
"so there’s a probability that monica could end up in the plot of deadpool 3 provided that this version of wolverine is from what universe she’s in

i was definitely expecting kate bishop but the talk of dimension tearing and quantum physics made me think that kamala would want to talk to cassie lang and america chavez first i suppose kate is just across the river from jersey city of course",2023-11-29 05:20:45
"nia dicosta did a great job bringing all
these characters into the same story together i hope she will be able to direct the young avengers’ official debut",2023-11-29 05:22:00
this movie is nowhere close to how bad ppl say it is it is a feelgood movie and it does its job pretty well the comedy wasnt like thor lat which i think is overhated but still also too much comedy you will actually laugh when watching this movie and not in a bad way the reputation of the movie got ruined by misogynists and sexists who hated on the film before it even released im thinking the same will happen with madame webb the only problem i have with this movie is how the villain died like wth was that also nick becoming a bit goofy but ill forgive it because it worked,2023-12-05 07:12:11
"just saw it im a genx italianirish american i think im in the demographic thats supposed to be angry at this movie or something by what ive seen on youtube my feed with thumbnail after thumbnail of angry dudes telling me its another marvel abomination

i enjoyed the  out of the marvels

it was a rare marvel film going in i didnt have a strong notion what to expect as far overall tone aside from what previews suggested black panther 2 was understandably similar in that regard i think a rough assessment of the feel of the marvels would be like some ms marvel series germinated with thor ragnarok with essence of spiderman  guardians of the galaxy mixed in

i think marvel struck gold with the kid playing kamala khan and the character translated to film better then id guessed  the way shes portrayed is hilarious and fun with similar energy to spiderman but kks distinct personality shining really bright the action scenes with her were solid too 


idk its weird its maybe the 3rd or 4th marvel film ive really enjoyed over the last couple of years that was dragged and vilified and marvel roasted over by this new cottage industry of marvel hating nerd reviewers who weirdly treat each marvel release like a superbowl or something because their channels are finally going to get some views when the upload their oddly celebratory scathing takedowns of the new worst marvel film ever  like celebrating box office results thats seems kind of a new  strange thing yes people have always loved a good dumpster fire to point  laugh at but this new bred of critic seem to be trying spark the fires themselves with illwill


with thor 4 doctor strange 2 and ant man 3 i think i got something close to what i was expecting like i ordered a pepperoni pizza  got a pepperoni pizza i enjoyed them about as equally as their franchises predecessors black panther 2 was something different but had its own merits  problems i dont see some big quality shift in the films spiderman 3 to me was pretty much of the same ilk as the above but the haters didnt stew on that one so much too much box office i guess  guardians 3 was one id rank higher because gunn controlling each film to a greater degree let him put some signature funk on his trilogy closer

i think that the turns of these former marvel fans to people who now really dislike marvel has to be more about whats going on inside the viewer rather than much anything marvel has done i really dont think that the films have changed drastically",2023-12-14 08:16:23
hey does anyone know how to watch it now that its out of theaters do i need to wait until a digital release next year on disney plus,2023-12-22 01:02:06
"theres many issues with this movie but i think it actually outright cant exist and be coherent with the mcu like how does it remotely work with the universe established in guardians 1 how were the kree able to be at war with xandar or anything else if they were utterly broken as a society after a civil war their supreme intelligence destroyed for decades their sun extinguished home world uninhabitable etc ronan got the power stone and was worried about xandar instead ofgoing after captain marvel marvel really has let itself go in terms of trying to be consistent within its own universe

the movie wasnt great it might have been better than the first captain marvel but it doesnt feel like they managed to rise much above it

kind of fitting having kamala going around doing the nick fury thing in the post creditsince nick hasnt felt like nick fury in years they really dont know what to do with that guy anymore

its all good if people had a good time with this the only thing i hope from people is avoiding the lazy argument that people didnt get it people can absolutely get something you likeand simply not enjoy it",2023-12-26 17:21:53
"i think this film was middling

some interesting fight sequences using the gimmick of switching each character midfight the interactions between the main characters worked for me for the most part and i dont think there was an oversaturation of quipping during fights

unfortunately the villain whilst having some valid motivation was utterly forgettable the film had some really strange pacing at times not sure if big chunks got cut out the weird break in pace for a musical number seemed unnecessary also mcu films are starting to look really  i dunno if its unfinished cgi or the lack of practical sets but its not good 

i think the films biggest crime is being yet another completely forgettable entry into the mcu but on its own it isnt a bad film a pretty standard superhero flick that you might have seen in earlier phases

im glad were only getting deadpool 3 next year which is a naturally different style of film",2024-01-16 15:57:48
this felt like a very generic tv episode they just stopped trying to write decent movies,2024-01-28 01:00:04
just saw it absolute chore ti get through i guess this is what people think when the marvel slop is used,2024-01-29 03:07:08
"i actually liked this a lot lol 

it was a tad too ant man quantumania than thor ragnarok but overall still fun not incredibly long and some solid visuals",2024-02-10 03:52:32
it’s so  bad i could not believe it just an awful awful movie across the board,2024-02-11 23:28:01

kamala and her family are good though",2024-02-21 23:13:48
just absolute trash beginning to end,2024-02-26 13:57:19
what a garbage movie also watching brie larson try to cry was cringey as all  she is just not a good actor,2024-02-28 09:50:02
i couldnt finish itjust awful,2024-03-04 18:38:47
this movie makes secret invasion even more useless and dumb,2023-11-10 18:44:09
pretty sure they were only given like 2 or 3 sentences of outlines for universe connection while shooting both marvels and secret invasion at least the writers and director knew what actually happened on wanda vision though,2023-11-10 22:00:46

pretty sure that was going to happen even if fury wasnt there",2023-11-11 00:05:27
"i actually think this takes place before secret invasion otherwise the skrulls wouldnt likely be welcome on new asgard

my thought are that loki season 1 and 2 takes place from no way home to marvels whereas marvels and multiverse of madness are happening at the same time i think roughly with the incursions in mom being a reaction of what happened between here and loki",2023-11-18 02:25:55

slj is so bad in this role the last few years,2023-11-12 17:55:50
thats one of the most blatant asspulls in this movie in order to make it multiverserelevant the entire premise of the jump points was laid out as a form of hyper speed travel between different locations no where was it stated it could be a doorway to another alternate universe that i can recall then suddenly it is because we needed that to introduce the xmen in the most lazy way possible,2023-11-13 03:51:54
no part of the plot holds even a drop of water it was fun but it didnt line up or make sense,2023-11-16 05:08:20

"there was not a lot of logic even for a movie with magic

why are they switching places because the bracelet opened a rip in the spacetime continuum and therefore hum that makes people with lightbased powers switch places because you know the fabric of the universe between the dimensions theres light light travels in the universe its science

and how gotgesque it would have been if dar benn would have had to sing her intentions 

so much of this movie to me felt too neutered it was short but it felt crammed and with some wasted opportunity imo",2023-11-15 08:44:55
i was reading that they filmed more musical planet scenes but they got cut,2023-11-10 07:06:30
the real miss here is not having song planet be their training montage they all need to use their powers to fight but never at the same time throw some electrowaltz on piped to the ear pieces every marvel gets a beat on which she allowed to use a power and voila automatic desynchronization  memorable fight scene,2023-11-20 03:37:08
i didnt mind musical planet they were just trying to make a weird alien planet i feel like they didnt want to give musical planet more music so they ended the joke after the hes bilingual line after reading the comments here ie people who didnt go to theater camp and also hate fun they were probably right to keep it short,2023-11-11 04:10:09

before monica reassured her she could do it carol didn’t know that was an option she might not have known she had enough power to reignite a sun or she might have been worried that she’d just blow the whole thing up and wipe out the planet also even if she did fix the sun her powers wouldn’t have helped with the air and water,2023-11-12 07:23:11

its honestly insane how talented she is ms marvel was her firstever acting job she didnt even want to be an actor she made arty short films on vimeo and was going to go to art school to study integrated media they completely hit the jackpot finding her,2023-11-12 19:46:25

"i get it the musical planet was weird and kind of annoying if you dont like the idea but its less than 5 mins of the film they wanted to show a weird alien planet in a film series full of weird planets this was as good an idea as any

in this phase we have had so many teasers for moments that arent even showing up on marvels 5 year projected pipeline so you have no idea when or if they will ever get resolved",2023-11-14 17:55:50

" nick fury felt like a totally different character from secret invasion just a quip factory

i had mixed feelings about this one because while hes definitely never been completely joyless he is definitely weirdly jokey here i definitely dont want them to just turn him into this all the time but at the same time i actually got a solid chuckle out of his quips in this",2023-11-12 02:57:00
"i felt like monica had plenty of lines and emotional weight i don’t understand the plot complaints carol destroyed the supreme intelligence which led to civil war on hala that wrecked the planet and left it devoid of resources dar benn was siphoning resources from places that carol cared about as pay back

how would they communicate to you what a quantum band is without explaining it it’s an object that one of the heroines has and the villain wants so how wouldn’ come up in dialogue exposition is not a bad thing seems like people get annoyed anytime anything gets explained in a movie",2023-11-12 14:07:42
"  the plot is just completely paperthin and close to being actual nonsense and to make it worse its powered by so much boring expository dialogue i was just mentally checked out as soon as they started waffling about jump points quantum bands etc

"just saw this movie and your thoughts pretty much directly mirror my own given that id call it more like a 310 the main things that make a film a film  namely a compelling story and characters  are just flat out missing 

this might have had the worst villain i have ever seen in a film if it wasnt for ms marvel her family and the cat this movie would be a 210 solely because that big of a budget always means some cool cgi in space",2024-01-08 01:40:04
the great concept vs poor execution of the villain was the biggest flaw for me carol was basically tom bakers doctor who from the invisible enemy that is she came in thought she saved their planet then  off leaving it in shambles it was a great chance to have a hero face a villain she created and who was in the right ot was a great chance to do an analogy too about countries like the usa acting like world police and thinking they are saviours only to leave places in a mess after they interfere,2024-01-16 20:25:30

it definitely feels like they were really desperate to make this as short as they could there were so many scenes that felt like they ended about 3 seconds before they were supposed to like they ended the exact frame after someone delivered a line without giving you a moment to process what just happened,2023-11-12 03:20:27

"honestly i feel like the movie needed to lean into the more bonkers elements the flerken scene the musical planet etc all incredible 

this feels like someone higher up at marvel saw the movie and made two changes

 it cant be this goofy the whole way it needs to conform to the generic marvel tone ironically this movie would have been perfect for taika going off the plot vs how he does movies
 it has to be a multiverse story

change two things about this and its way better

 the portals arent causing an incursion its just destabilising the jump network and if they dont stop her this will cripple countless spaceage civilizations because theyre no longer able to communicate or do logistics etc

 darbenn takes the offer to fix halas sun because killing the last leader is what  up hala last time by causing the war they close the hole via monicas powers and then we get a scene above hala after carol fixes the sun where on carols ship darbenn meets with the leader of the two planets she messed up and agrees to work on fixing things as reparations for doing what she was mad at carol for

yes this means monica doesnt get dimensionhopped and we dont get a weird cgi beast cameo but i dont care  its the laziest possible way to give us xmen and is just there to make people go i know that person",2023-11-10 20:28:40

after the three characters returned to their spaceship from the skrull refuge i continued to think the films editing was odd there should have been some dialogue scene between kamala and carol argument misunderstanding before monica follows carol down the stairs but i suspect that was cut in the editing room,2023-11-10 10:14:24
kamala is a mutant and half djinn from another dimension and the bangle unlocked her innate but dormant powers and if you liked this film i strongly recommend the show her family are just great and the show is pretty good,2023-11-10 03:30:16

secret invasion never happened it was just a nightmare fury had,2023-11-10 14:36:46
technically this movie happens before secret invasion but it was delayed so much that it came out afterwards,2023-11-10 21:22:21
i believe the idea was that photon and captain marvel touched the unstable gateway creating the connection between them and ms marvel who has similar powers and who uses a bangle that can create these gateways,2023-11-10 20:16:24
im glad im not the only one that thought she looked like emilia clarke its uncanny how similar they look,2023-11-12 03:56:54
uh yeah let’s just forget that happened okay thanks,2023-11-11 00:16:25
because the reason rambeu and carol are the ones who actually got their powers entangled by touching the portal at the sametime kamala got dragged in because of the bangle,2023-11-11 01:09:05
or why are there only 3 people in the universe with these powers who all happen to be from earth despite getting their powers from 3 unrelated sources,2023-11-10 14:16:32
yesss it looked like a really well done cw show,2024-03-07 18:54:38
remembering  is the hardest part had no idea who rambeu was and i’ve watched wandavision and captain marvel those flashback reminders were pure  too,2023-12-11 05:58:07
it’s not hard to remember this lol try giving the comics a chance and you’ll be glad the movies and shows are easier to work with,2024-02-13 00:38:58
i went to an 11 pm show and i was the only one in the theater,2023-11-10 10:14:57
ive gone to every opening night premier since antman this is the first opening night ive been to where the theater wasnt full hardly 30 of the seats were filled,2023-11-10 08:00:31
i went to the first showing at my local theater which was at 3pm i thought it would be at least semi full but it was 90 empty only about 10 people,2023-11-10 04:09:41
only two people bought tickets beforehand but it ended up closer to 20 full during a workday at like 4pm surprised by such a high number but maybe i shouldnt be since that was the only 3d showing today in imax,2023-11-10 05:27:08
i went to regal rpx tonight which is one of only a handful of “premium formats” in my city and there were maybe 15 people total,2023-11-10 03:38:14
my theater was about 70 full but i’m in a metropolitan area so it’s usually busier may not be a good example of other showings,2023-11-10 08:16:19
less than 10 people at mine lol granted it was 3pm on a friday,2023-11-10 14:48:03
11am 95 full,2023-11-10 19:26:10
7pm showing was just me my wife and one other person but thats not always a great predictor since its a small theater in a smallish town gotg3 early showing here was also just my wife and i,2023-11-10 03:49:29
"7 pm show id say 85  full   
most of the theatre seemed to have fun we laughed a lot",2023-11-10 06:39:19
mine was 90 free seats nobody cares about these characters outside of fanboys that will eat up anything,2023-11-10 11:00:44
mine was empty just me,2023-11-11 16:39:22
mine was about 90 full at 11am on a saturday in manhattan,2023-11-11 19:25:42
mine was 80 percent full or more,2023-11-10 05:26:49
its also a thursday unless its a huge release with a giant amount of hype or buzz its pretty rare to fill up a theatre midishweek tomorrow will say more about how well it will do,2023-11-10 04:25:38
i go to a very small rundown theater and other than oppenheimer and spiderverse this is the most full its been all year,2023-11-11 06:34:29
i was in imax and it was about a third full i had empty seats beside me so it was perfect i didnt have to fight someone over an armrest the whole movie,2023-11-10 18:12:50
4pm screening in brazil subbed about 90 empty seats,2023-11-10 22:56:31
50 but it was a 430 showing probably the smallest marvel opening weekend crowd i’ve experienced,2023-11-11 00:12:01
"went to a 425 showing counting me there was maybe 7 people

i havent been in that empty of a theater for a mcu movie on opening weekend since thor the dark world when there was roughly 10 people",2023-11-11 01:49:57
i just got back probably 10 people in my showing,2023-11-11 04:30:54
50 for me,2023-11-11 05:45:35
about a quarter full but this was a friday afternoon non premium seating,2023-11-11 06:19:53
i think we had way more people at my screening with a 30 year old dario argento film which was almost full versus the advance screening of the marvels at another screening in the same cinema the fact it wasnt even in the main cinema was rather telling,2023-11-11 06:56:53
i thought no one would show up considering the fact that ko one showed up for barbie in my town i know shocker but it was crowded and i never saw so many women in a marvel movie either,2023-11-11 08:13:35
saw it on friday at 7pm   i would say 70 full,2023-11-11 14:03:24
i went at 7 pm on thursday my theatre was 80 or 90 percent full in imax,2023-11-11 14:46:44
we went to the afternoon show on thursday we were literally the only people in the theater,2023-11-11 16:50:47
"mine was mostly empty 845pm showing friday night and counting me there was a total of 11 people 

its a little hard for me to compare because i recently moved to a new city and this was the first time ive been to the cinema postmove so maybe that location isnt the most popular at the best of times i can think of theaters back where i moved from that were less popular than others 

but yeah its definitely still very low turnout which tracks with the box office projections",2023-11-11 21:00:33
12 30 pm show and we were maybe 10 crazy low i dont know anyone planning on watching it,2023-11-11 21:48:42
mine was not full at all and it was depressing because this was such a great movie,2023-11-12 02:16:31
walked out a couple of hours ago about 70 full,2023-11-12 02:59:54
id say about 60 full at my showing saturday night,2023-11-12 03:45:30
went to an 830pm showing there was only one other person in theater and they left halfway through the movie and didnt come back ,2023-11-12 06:52:02
went to a 9pm showing on a saturday and only about 8 other people showed up,2023-11-12 11:07:00
went at 7pm on saturday maybe 25 seats taken,2023-11-12 16:03:09
my theater was 90 full on a sunday afternoon unfortunately there were at least a dozen 12 year olds who talked literally through the entire movie,2023-11-13 02:29:05
75 percent full…i live in new york,2023-11-13 02:45:13
80 full on a sunday afternoon in the philly suburbs,2023-11-13 03:27:12
went to the 6pm showing last night barely anyone in,2023-11-13 11:15:40
same on the first night,2023-11-13 15:11:03
i went last night at 740 pm and my group were the only 3 people in the theater  we all enjoyed it though,2023-11-14 17:48:25
alternatively my theater added extra showtime because the first ones filled up i grabbed from those second showings and it was at least 80 full ,2023-11-15 06:33:13
" i’ve seen all the shows aside from secret invasion hope that skrull emperor didn’t have a whole lot of backstory in that that i missed

the emperor wasnt in the show at all it was focused on another faction and quite frankly you didnt miss anything it was really really bad the film was supposed to come out before the show but at this point its best just ignored all together",2023-11-10 04:21:46
don’t watch secret invasion,2023-11-12 14:02:28
imo theres enough setup already for the other 2 main characters even without seeing their shows you dont always have to know the back story of every character in the movie even america chavez doesnt have any and just blasted through it in mom,2023-11-10 14:02:31
it wasn’t great but it doesn’t even rank as the worst mcu postcredits character reveal in the past couple years are we forgetting patton oswalt gnome guy,2023-11-10 03:40:36
maybe they didnt want to put kesley through six hours of make up for a 30 second scene,2023-11-10 03:33:59
i just got out of the film and it looked pretty much fine didnt seem out of place i mean it was a 30 second scene so not much time to really look at it anyway lol remember when they shot one of the post credits scenes in native stereoscopic 3d they often do things differently with them,2023-11-10 04:22:43
people are so  picky over cgi nowadays  he looked fine,2023-11-13 02:20:51
have you ever actually seen an asylum film surely you gotta realise that this is an absurd comparison,2023-11-10 11:17:07
"i didnt think it was that bad it is definitely a cgiheavy character like thanos  hulk but the specific design choice really helped it work

they even gave him the cute little teefs like in the 90s show",2023-11-10 03:57:51
it really wasn’t that bad calling it “asylum” level is embarrassing,2023-11-10 03:50:37
it was pretty bad but the theater was psyched to see him nonetheless,2023-11-12 04:18:23
"cmon man are you really going to complain about a 30 second teaser scene 

whats the  obsession with perfect graphics with people he looked fine",2023-11-10 05:12:48

"brie larson was so checked out though

idk i found her charming felt like she got to have more fun with the character here than in the last few movies",2023-11-10 13:05:35
"i was confuse how the villain had all her powers

she took on three superheroes at once even without her hammer thing howd she do that just the bracelet kamala had one too so that wouldnt seem to explain much",2023-11-13 06:27:40
she was checked out this was her best mcu performance by far ,2023-11-21 19:44:58
"yah watched this to de stress l love watching movies in an empty or near enpty theatre it was eh alright like most marvel movies formula works again bit messy though 

however kamala was indeed awesome she had a genuine spark and energy i enjoyed her more in this movie than her show and she played off the cast fantastically iam bit a bit miffed for the actress but iam sure they will give her another shot somewhere",2023-11-13 09:51:30
worse villain than thor 2,2023-12-11 03:07:56
" vellani puts this movie on her back and carries it 

agree entirely iman vellani was awesome her portrayal of the fangirl hero character is put in the spotlight and she stole the show brie larsons work on the first film was a bit better than in this sequel imo",2023-11-10 04:25:18
"the most generic villain

i still liked her plan though   


using those wormholes to steal resources from other planets so that she can save her planet   
thats a very creative motive for a scifi antagonist 

x200b

she had no personality but a solid plan",2023-11-10 06:38:42

"its fine its whatever has been the mcus tagline for a minute 

if they had balls they would hard reset and say the endgame saga was one story restart a whole new story with xmen or whoever but tell an overarching story repeat

"bro its a film where the three leads are a pakistani muslim a black woman and brie larson the villain is a biracial woman the supporting characters are pakistani muslims the main male characters are a korean man and a black man there was no heroic square jawed white man in sight 

a certain subsection of people were not going to enjoy this no matter what 

its funny because the film is political in entirely different ways a united states military officer intervenes in a foreign culture toppling their government and throwing that society into chaos for 30 years that society produces an insurgent who wants revenge against the foreign invaders who destroyed her homeland somehow the same dudes because its only ever dudes complaining about how political and pandering it is never seem to have picked up on this if youre looking for a political message in this film theres a much bigger one to be found than the gender or race of the characters it goes to show that a lot of peoples media literacy begins and ends at why are there womennonwhite people onscreen",2023-11-10 19:47:13
" secret invasion really did a number on this film too who would be excited to see nick fury again after that pointless nothing of a show

i feel really bad the marvels isnt doing better to me this is one of the better recent entries in the mcu it felt like a comic book come to life",2023-11-11 19:44:14
"nick fury shouts black girl magic at monica in an attempt to encourage her trying to fly but thats about it 

fury was so fun here im glad secret invasion wasnt his swan song",2023-11-11 21:59:40
its pandering because it acknowledges the existence of women,2023-11-10 03:53:09
"the hate was overblown

couldnt agree more   
this is so much better than i thought   
with love and thunder and quantumania i was soo disappointed and wanted the movies to to end   


with this one i laughed way more like genuinely laughed 

it was fun and i would 100 rewatch this over lt or quantumania and even dr starange in the mom",2023-11-10 06:31:15
"im going to be honest with everyone here im one of the people that wholeheartedly expected said pandering it just seems to have become commonplace and even the original had a scene of carol emasculating some guy to help establish her badassery  
  
so i went in to this thinking oh boy this  going to be fin awful  
  
i loved it like you said none of that  was in it just three awesome heroes and a cat or two doing some really cool  i enjoyed the gradual bonding between them the tension explored between monicacarol and the backstories of why each was motivated in the film as well fwiw i found carol much more humanized in this film over its predecessor as well  
  
if i see people rip on this movie as some kind of woke girl power extravaganza ill know right away that they didnt actually watch the thing",2023-11-10 04:24:26
you have three female stars against a female villain that’s where they see the pandering,2023-11-10 15:51:31
"they never mention they are women once in the film no girl power scenesnothing

nick fury literally said black girl magic but otherwise youre right as far as i remember",2023-11-11 19:33:09
yeah i can’t wait to hear about all the “putting men down” scenes that didn’t happen,2023-11-10 03:53:55
literally the 3 heros could be men and it wouldnt have changed a thing not all pandering is bad sometimes a bit can be good but theres none of it in this movie,2023-11-11 17:51:01
i’ve seen people argue that the musical number or carol dressing as a princess for 3 minutes is “pandering” and beating them over the head with how comic book movies aren’t made for them anymore absolutely ridiculous this movie is what the endgame moment wanted three superheroes with natural connections getting entangled and forced to work together with development for all three of them,2023-11-10 14:14:49
just got out couldnt agree more other than gotg3 this is the best overall package since no way home imo could use some changes but its fine better than some phase 1 and 2 stuff easily,2023-11-12 19:20:52
which reviews claimed pandering female representation,2023-11-10 11:43:02
"the closest it gets is black girl magic and that lines said by fury of all people

its almost like the people making those complaints didnt watch the movie or something  odd",2023-11-11 02:50:13
"yeah i didn’t get that the “girl power” vibe from this at all isn’t this what people who complain about that want just characters who happen to be women but don’t keep making it a point in everything 

honestly i feel like there’s a portion of the audience who will never be happy because they just don’t want to see women in these roles",2023-11-10 07:54:07
"it was really decent overall if you dont expect too much pretty standard marvel stuff

although the singing planet was  weird but its space so i guess theres weird stuff going on",2023-11-13 06:19:37
" honestly they should delete secret invasion because not only is it godawful  worthless but fury from the show and this fury are like two different people

i feel very glad i didnt watch secret invasion because to me this fury quite literally is the same depiction from cm1",2023-11-14 13:56:49
"one of my issues with the movie was the inconsistent writing of fury like he seems to be an entirely different character from secret invasion i think marvel needs better communication between writers and directors it feels like every movie introduces a set of new main characters that just so happen to have the same name and look the same as characters from previous movies i can overlook how they changed captain marvel just because i felt she was a much more likeable character in this movie compared to her last movie and endgame but it feels almost every piece of marvel content nowadays has inconsistent characters

about your last point with female representation i think marvel did such a good job in this film of not making it feel diverse to meet a quota or to show to the world how inclusive marvel is for the sake of being inclusive but rather it just had a cast that happened to be comprised of primarily women",2023-12-03 01:46:45
its weird how its only ever rmovies who have these super positive contrarian posts  that mention the culture war while every other sub reviewer and even fan sub are giving more accurate review that point out its sever flaws  really makes you think,2023-11-10 23:57:11
" the hate was overblown

that was pretty much a guarantee the moment the movie was announced brie larson is the utter  devil to some people and then you put her in a movie where i dont think theres a single named white male character and youve got a recipe for  hate bombing",2023-11-11 02:20:19
"also i dont get the reviews claiming this film has pandering female representation

i think overt and clumsy social politics in a movie sucks but there was none of that here also while you can use it as a critique when it actually applies these recent mcu projects have far greater underlying issues that need to be talked more about dont focus so much on woke stuff otherwise actual criticism gets lumped in as incel fanboy complaints",2023-11-10 16:07:51
i know a lot of people are hating on the pacing but as someone who grew up in the 80s this movie is paced like an 80s movie and i dont really see anything wrong with that,2023-11-11 18:36:34
"theres plenty of flaws with this movie even if i loved it anyway but yeah pandering isnt one of them

the antiwoke crowd are gonna fixate on how woke ruined this movie and as always it poisons the discourse because the convo becomes do you hate women and minorities instead of talking about editing pacing etc

theyre also going to lose their minds about the ambiguous implication that carol dated valkyrie at some point during the blip  even though thats just a way to read it and not remotely textual",2023-11-10 21:01:03
" the hate was overblown

the hate started months before anyone had seen it why would you think it was actually justified",2023-11-12 19:20:52
i haven’t seen the marvels yet but i was watching captain marvel the other day and it is legitimately a good movie i found it very entertaining and funny the constant teasing about how nick fury “loses an eye” is hilarious i also just like brie larson’s delivery as captain marvel especially when she first meets fury and their interactions after that,2023-11-10 08:21:05
" they never mention they are women once in the film no girl power scenesnothing

it doesnt have to have a girl power scene when the whole movie is a girl power scene ayyyyyyyyyyyy",2023-11-10 06:47:27

if they really wanted to pander to my sister they should have made the itaewon class guy scenes longer its just a fun movie trying to be fun its not trying to be hidden figures and thats ok,2023-11-10 09:31:12
"i think a lot of those comments are the reverse  its an excuse to blame men for the bad reviews because its about a bunch of women

there are articles like that blaming the bad reviews because of men and not taking responsibilities its just not a great movie its just ok",2023-11-12 20:27:37
the copium in your edit ,2023-11-11 00:41:42
youre getting the same treatment that people legitimately complaining about bad movies did for years not just bad movies but properties like star wars totally ruined in the name of girls rule boys drool  those people were told they were minority astroturfing biggoted 10 years later and were now actually allowed to be critical again it must be so hard to have your opinion shut down like that poor thing,2023-11-11 07:34:41
"as someone who doesnt care about this movie i doubt you are getting astroturfed yes this is the word they use because some people liked the movie i imagine it was because you spent 99 of your post attacking others

but you got the upvotes you wanted in the end",2023-11-11 15:24:53

" it is far from being the 3rd worst mcu film

what a praise lol",2023-11-15 03:11:23
the hate is not overblown it is perfectly accurate the movie is pure diarrhea it adds writing so bad that it is most likely written by ai and the cgi is pure garbage,2023-11-10 10:43:54
its almost like sometimes people are women,2023-11-10 13:10:17
"thats a good take it didnt hit me that this was a female superhero movie until the princess scene and then it really got me when the villain was also a woman

it should be okay to not have male leads in hero movies",2023-11-11 03:18:54
keep in mind that this movie was delayed an entire year to be worked on after the antimsheu backlash started to really hit home its likely a completely different film from the original,2023-11-10 12:57:00
"the pander complaints come from people already predisposed to look for it and hate it i remember when captain marvel first came out and the typical complaints about it hammering you with feminist propaganda one being she blasts a cardboard cutout of arnold and complaints saying shes destroying the patriarchy
when i saw that scene the first time my response was ha true lies",2023-11-12 00:18:17

only thing i saw was black girl magic but obviously specific to one of the three lol,2024-02-08 03:24:24

"amen it feels like a joke fest the music planet felt like an la casting apple flash mob commercial and marvel just feels like the most  pandering glossy commercial 

how dare they disgrace beastie boys by using them in a scene of them “training” 

i don’t know if cameras are just getting too good they don’t add film grain or they just don’t know how to light a scene or something but so many of the sets feel like sets it feels like actors playing with toys i’m totally not lost in the world like i should be",2024-01-27 07:41:55

"ive thought that every superhero movie of this year was garbage except this one yep even that one that you love

i didnt think this one was high art or particularly great but i liked it enough

reddit always thinks theres some grand conspiracy because people might have fun in a marvel movie  it would be funnier if was predictable and sad,2023-11-10 06:33:31
i just hate the wording of these defenses so many people saying i went in without high expectations its not that bad getting too much hate theres no defenses of the movies actual story dialogue directing pacing visuals etc its just people saying their expectations were low and the movie cleared the low bar,2023-11-10 13:30:13

and the problem is honestly i dont understand the need to trash a movie unless you feel it affects you in a certain way like agenda obsessed conservatives you didnt like it fine its a matter of taste but how hard is it to believe people like these things its a lighthearted fun visually rich action movie that groups together three great characters,2023-11-11 18:09:48
"i went and watched it because i wanted to see the dumpster fire i was very disappointed that i did not get a dumpster fire i really really wanted a dumpster fire its a solid movie the villain was bad which is lame the plot was generic that was lame there were 1001 ways the movie could have ended but it ended lame 

everything else for the most part was just fun 

this is definitely a movie marketed at women",2023-11-11 16:30:59
"“it’s not perfect but it’s fun”

i really dont think this is a common sentiment   


people are liking this waaay better than quantumania thor 4 and dr strange 2

those movies are trying too hard to be fun but this one feels like its effortlessly fun 

x200b

also i dont think the marvel fanboys like this they seem to be the ones against it because it has a lot of plot holes and character assasinations   
but general audiences are having the positive reviews becuase if you dont think about the multiverse stuff and the larger universe this is a fun selfcontained movie",2023-11-10 06:44:44

"i liked the villain and her motivations it made sense and built off the last movie i even think it was a decent explanation for why carol didn’t come back right away 

i been trying to think why this kind of “world ending threat” worked for me more than quantummania and i realized it’s because it’s a logical level of danger for the marvels they’re excluding kamala but she works well here cosmic heroes so aliens and stealing suns fits them antman going up against kang feels awkward",2023-11-10 07:43:37
"i mean we’ve heard some about how planning for this phase has been less than thorough but i wonder if she was originally meant to be the one bringing them together or if that was just in response to the feedback  ie that some of the shows were getting blowback or even cut so some of the characters seemed uncertain futures but hers seemed to go well don’t know how the show actually performed but it seems her performance and the character portrayal was consistently praised for the show too 

i would’ve originally assumed spiderman taking more of a role as what had been discussed as him being one of the transition members but i think holland’s been pretty openly lately that while he’s not necessarily done he doesn’t want to be spiderman forever",2023-11-13 06:07:06

theres also fury and the kahn family in the background having wacky misadventures but thats only because its fun

maybe its because i didnt watch ms marvel but i have no idea what a bangle is    i dont even really remember why they kept switching places

and where did those eggs full of alien cats come from      i think it was supposed to be goose laying them but im not really sure

and i have no idea how photons powers work but i really didnt in wandavision either",2023-11-11 02:48:15
late to this but i agree i get it you have to give me some sciency mumbo jumbo for bangles and place switching to work but the movie kept talking about quantum portals or universe rifts and jumping spaces that i was just like this is word salad,2024-02-10 19:14:54

it was quite fun and i do really like brie larson i didnt watch ms marvel but i might now because iman vellani was positively adorable photon was okay i suppose she didnt stand out much except in the musical planet

reviewers were too harsh i would 100 see this again unlike quantumania or love  thunder the tone felt coherent pacing felt fine

captain marvels second half costume  tho the first half was superb imo",2023-11-10 04:47:05
"im glad the 3rd act wasnt another cgi battle

while true i thought the climactic final boss battle was very lackluster maybe because it was like 4 seriously overpowered individuals but i wouldve liked to see more drama interspersed with the fighting

arguing back and forth while battling is one of my favorite tropes when done well it makes for a better fight than just action figures pewpewing each other

enjoyed the movie overall but the last fight just like the villain was forgettable 5 minutes after it ended",2023-11-12 00:05:53
what part would you describe as the third act,2023-11-12 06:20:28
instead it was a cgi fight,2023-11-21 08:12:06
yeah you’re right they put one in the first and second acts instead lol,2023-11-15 03:40:03
i was so relieved when it was resolved so quickly,2023-11-10 04:50:17

"an ai would do a better job i thought to myself that all the critics  must be exaggerating how bad it is but after seeing it they were right it is terrible just a mushy mess of random ideas thrown at a the screen 

youre right about the terrible jokes and lack of any real drama brie larson cant act she sounds permanently uptight with an annoying verbal fry i didnt find iman vellani charming but annoying i dont blame her this must be how the production executives told her to act this would be their idea of what a high school girl is like

the worst thing is that this movie apparently cost 300 million dollars",2023-11-13 09:32:17
dont they literally say that if they werent switching places that captain marvel would have immediately won,2023-11-10 19:40:37

"in the previous movie carol was dealing with memory loss and brainwashing so she didnt get much of a personality and when she shows up since then its usually to punch and dip

marvels treatment of carol has been baffling she spent her whole solo movie brainwashed and confused got 5 minutes of screentime in endgame and now she spends this whole movie playing second fiddle to kamala i would like to see her get one movie to herself because im having a hard time getting a read on her character or why im supposed to like her and care about her",2023-11-10 03:10:05
my main takeaway is that they could put together an insanely charismatic young avengers led by iman hailee steinbecks and xochitl gomez i think it would make a ton of sense as a tv show but well see,2023-11-10 03:41:22

"i agree with everything 100  saved me the trouble of writing it cuz i woulda said the exsct same things   after seeing this this movie did nothing to make me want to see future adventures of any of these characters  not a single one   ms marvels powers are lame  she spends half the time just making light steps to move around  


not to mention in the ms marvel show remember when everyone was intrigued by the backstory on the bangles  it wound up being nothing interesting  darbenn just finds the other one in the dirt  i dont wanna find out shangchis rings are the product of some random alien   


 and with secret invasion and the marvels back to back i think it might be time to retire nick fury  hes outserved his usefulness  and slj at 75 moves like it  i no longer see badass director of shield nick fury  and since slj will say yes to anything they know they can insert him into any project as familiar connective tissue  but its diminishing returns  its not special anymore",2024-02-19 14:08:41

it seems easier to write them out of the story thor and hulk before civil war brainwash them and have other heroes fight them superman in justice league hulk in age of ultron or find something for weaker characters to do while the heavyweights handle the fighting batman in justice league bvs doomsday fight",2023-11-11 20:15:06

im ok with bland villains provided i can understand what a waste of time it can be trying to fully flesh out and develop a villain just to  them off in the same movie and while good villains can really add to the story if the story is meant to focus on developing new characters im all for focusing the writing on that over some throw away villain,2023-11-12 04:05:47

i hate it when people use fun to describe movies people used it to death with the flash and blue beetle and those were awful the marvels was more than fun for me and i went in thinking itd be another antman situation i loved the humor kamala and captain marvel being both a struggling hero and a role model editing and cgi could have been better yes but it was nowhere near as bad as flash this movie deserves more,2023-11-10 12:42:02

"agreed just watched this and would also say it’s a 775 which puts it about the same as most marvel movies  i think the movie was a victim of a few factors inability to market it due to the strikes general audience burnout on superhero movies and the budget remaining so high for the filmwhether due to hubris or the difficulty of changing course with such a huge ship doesn’t really matter

shame really  this is one of the fun ones  character interactions are great  fun sequences and set pieces  i didn’t really feel any pacing issues personally

secret invasion doesn’t tie to this at all  that show should just be declared an alt universe along with eternals aos and inhumans at this point ",2024-01-20 04:31:18
i agree it could have been fun to have thor at least theres some type of banter between him and captain marvel putting in valkyrie very much felt like this is the dollar store version of thor and it made me wonder if i missed a bit because i didnt remember them being friends,2023-11-11 09:27:27

1 the villain was going to siphon the sun every place she hit got devastated though i wish there were at least some aftermath shots of the singing planet 

2 with the exception of winter soldier i think fury has the same amount of screen time as any other movie hes in though yes dude is regulated to comedic relief i wish he had a bigger handle on the issues like he used to 

3 yeah this one was out of left field though im willing to suspend some disbelief for this 

4 she is so much better in this than the first movie and i agree her character kinda goes against her strengths as an actress in this one larson shines when she gets to be sarcastic with characters that can bounce along with her wit this is kinda toned down a lot by having carol be a role model figure for kamala thus cutting down on the sarcasm",2023-11-11 09:24:18

i 100 agree that its insane that some of the p13 projects got higher ratings then some of the post endgame projects the standards are just way too high after the infinity saga and some early projects would not be as highly rated if they had released today this film did a ton of things that fans asked for like connecting multiple projects and bringing in two massive new directions for the storytelling im honestly over the negativity if you dont like it great maybe its not for you anymore but please stop bashing every new project like they are personally offending you because steve rogers isnt around anymore,2023-11-11 22:21:58

this review hits the nail on the head the movie knew what it was and had the courage to take some big swings with the musical planet and the catskittens montage that’s more than can be said about ant man 3 and unlike thor 4 it knew not to overplay their hand with a particular joke the editing left something to be desired but it was a great time overall,2023-11-13 10:29:51
ok yes this is the same for me i knew like dr strange 2 had a d backstory but you could easily figure it out this movie felt like 3 d shows that all connected to this one movie and since i hadn’t seen any d in a long time and hearing a lot of the back story never actually had a d subplot it did leave me confused on the story,2023-11-12 02:42:30

the whole reasoning for her having to close it at all was covered in like two sentences there was no reason for anything,2023-11-12 00:48:31
it was obviously more for future movie plans but in universe i think it was because darbenns energy blasts pushed the gate structure away from her into the tear monica had to do the same from the other side ie push them back closed you could see they were bent inward to the incursion side when she was doing it,2023-11-12 04:15:01

the movie is fun there are some legitimately gorgeous shots in the beginning captain marvel floating towards the planet upside down and the first fight scene with them swaping spots was a blast i actually thought  this is shot well while watching it up through the musical planet the movie seemed fine the bonding between the three heroes was good and captain marvel yelling to kamala we save who we can hit right

the convo on the planet felt weird any fight scene that wasnt in a confined space kinda fizzled for me and i really kinda hate the ill stay behind in this other world trope i do not know what it is about marvel act iiis but they just can not seem to stick the landing for my tastes that said its still a fun movie and worth a watch but maybe wait for disney",2023-11-13 16:14:25

i also really liked it my biggest issue is how close they were to having a great movie its fairly clear the final product was a lot of spliced together scenes to get somewhat of a coherent storyline if we had they had this storyline from the start and had writers fix the issues like clarifying where the villain came from where she got powers how killing the singularity resulted in the planet losing its air water and sun etc it could have been great,2023-11-10 04:08:35

perhaps more jaded folks are finally just skipping it because the reviews looked quite mixed and maybe others have such low expectations that it exceeded it and made it ok for them or they’re just the type to buy disney yearly passes nothing below a 6 for them

and i think a lot more ppl viewing this film just want that disney family channel vibes the relatively “low” stakes this time around even with all the portals and such it didn’t feel really “world ending” at all to me and more like the villain of the week for the girl gang this movie probably vibed with such folks that have this sorta simple taste",2023-11-10 08:51:01

i agree with you i actually like the socially awkward carol who struggles with controlling her anger traits she apparently got from the brainwash i would have liked this movie to be about her life as a space barbie i would have started the movie with carol flying to hala and destroying the supreme intelligence in an impressive display of angry power then show the fallout from that and how she starts feeling guilty and cant return to earth so she starts a solitary life in space helping people who need her trying to atone for what shes done she would be kind of like a lone samurai at this point with a western vibe it would have been so good if this movie actually had spaghetti western vibes then she meets and falls in love with her kpop planet prince but then darben comes for revenge since the krees have been rising to fight her and they finally found a weapon that can nerf her the bangles that absorb her power so she has to find a way to fight an enemy against whom she cant use her powers and at the end she makes a sacrifice to restore halas sun like maybe she gives up her powers to power halas sun then she drives her ship to earth and she can reconnect with monica and monica can trace the second bangle to kamala,2023-11-13 11:19:38

"problem 2 monicas power set is poorly defined she lacks strong character development with kamala and carol and her sacrifice at the end of the film is not given enough setup weight and space to breathe



intended arc 2

a monica feeling abandoned by carol and guilty about missing the death of her mother has thrown herself into her work as a scientist working for sword in space  undervaluing her own life and safety she once again investigates a strange energy barrier and becomes entangled with kamala and carol

b monica meets carol again and is initially angry hurt and distant due to feelings of abandonment and guilt  she refuses to open up to carol

c  the kree attack in kamalas housethe moonplanet where the second bangle was foundand the sword space station   monica tries to fight on her own despite the switching and it is a chaotic mess

d monica meets kamala and her family and is reminded of happier times with her own mom and aunt carol

e she hypothesizes the reason for the switching saves kamalas life and suggests that they remain together until they can solve the problem and carol agrees

f  monica begins to interact with kamala and they discuss the spcific abilities and limitations of their lightbased powers  kamala talks about how she is annoyed by but also understand and loves her family members  carol listens but refuses to join in

g after spending some time on carols ship monica notices that carol lacks some  technical expertise and helps her repair the ship she begins to understand that carol has also been lonely and asks some questions about the abilities of goose and of flerken in general

h all three fight darbenn again and are beaten

i during the kree mindmeld monica is angry when they all share memories of her as a young child her dustingreturn and her mothers decline and death  monica and carol share a heart to heart about maria  monica admits she feels guilt for not being present at her moms death and anger about carol not returning  carol explains her own feelings of guilt abut hala and then tells monica about marias final days and how she would be proud of her daughter  carol says that she is proud of monica  group hug

j  training montage

kthey fight darbenn again after having mastered the switching and are victorious by using innovative switching techniques that monica suggested during the training montage

l  darbenn betrays them steals both bangles and rips open a dimensional rift destroying herself and leaving the bangles  carol retrieves the bangles gives both to kamala  when she puts them both on there is a lengthy powerup scene a la hulk putting on thanos glove and the resulting wave of energy undoes the switching

m  monica realizes that she alone has the power to seal the rift  she does so but it refuses to seal and begins to open again  she realizes that it must be sealed from the other side  carol and kamala are concerned but do not realize her sacrifice until it is too late

n  monica wakes up to see her mom alive releases all of her sorrow guilt and joy then realizes it is binary from another universe



possible solutions 2

monica is the donatello of the group carol is leo kamala is mikey darbenn had she been developed would be raphshredder and the straight woman comedically speaking  her personality is meant to ground the high spirits of kamala and the personal loss of her mother is meant to humanize the grand unrelatable stakes of entire planets dying  as the science expert most of the infodumping duty falls on her shoulders  all of this is a bit generic especially in light of the fact that the mcu already has shuri and riri as stem nerds  it would be helpful to differentiate monica as much as possible to increase variety

the main problem with monicas arc is that her ultimate act at the end of the movie has no impact because it is not clear to the audience what shes leaving behind by making the sacrifice  she has no family left we dont see her develop any serious relationships with sword staff kamala or even carol  in order to make the audience care about her final act this needs to be addressed

we can solve both of these issues by giving monica a love interest  in order to pass the bechtel test an admirable goal many films aimed at young women have gone to the extreme and made all of their female action heroes asexual a problem that all marvel characters male and female have to an extent  if you want to attract more female viewers as this film clearly does it will be necessary to show romantic human relationships without making them the center of the plot  if monica had a boyfriend or even a potential boyfriend coworker in sword it would potentially accomplish four goals simultaneously

first it would immediately differentiate monica from shuri and riri by establishing monica as the adult and the romantic scenes would provide some fan service light mcu level of course  for both men and women  second it would give monica another important thing to lose when she traps herself on the other side of the rift  third it would provide a topic boyfriends for kamala to joke about and discuss with monica bringing them closer together before they discuss more serious issues relating to their mission and powers  and finally fourth it would give the potential destruction of the sword station higher stakes instead of treating the crisis as nothing but a tribbleinspired joke

now there is nothing inherently wrong with including a tribbleinspired jokey flerken solution to the evacuation but by adding the conversation and questions in g we can foreshadow this silliness a bit so it is not as out of nowhere for members of the audience who are less tolerant of random goofiness  its also a chance for carol to open up emotionally about her affection for goose weakening monicas emotional guard so that when we spend more time developing and building up to ithe group hug isnt as abrupt and feels earned and satisfying

another huge problem is that monicas power set is vague and undefined so her act at the end of the film comes out of nowhere  the audience just has to accept that closing dimensional rifts is something that she can do now and apparently could always do question mark

this could be solved by adding f which is completely missing from the film  it would be a great bonding moment for monica and kamala to discuss their powers and a perfect opportunity to foreshadow her sacrifice by including information about the ability to manipulate or close gates  this could also be foreshadowed more strongly  in the first space scene when she approaches the barrier  perhaps something from fury along the lines of is the tear small enough for you to close with your powers monica

the fight at k is weak as was addressed above in the carol section  by adding some interesting moves utilizing switching that monica suggests during the montage it would reinforce her role in the team as the strategist and thinker

l and m are way too rushed and a bit cheaplooking  this is the resolution of the film and the place to slow down and spend that effects budget  by adding her failing initially to seal the rift from our side in m it is made more clear to the audience what exactly she is planning when her sacrifice is made

and finally n starts out as emotional then undercuts monicas sorrow by immeditaely throwing in a silly joke exclamation  let the sorrow sit for just a smidge longer so the audience can see how much grief and guilt  monica was holding in that led to her final act



monicas arc is handled better than carols but the lack of any connection to the people of this universe makes her final act less effective at moving the audience  by giving her a stronger personal connection to carol kamala and a new love interest the audience understands that she will lose important things by leaving this universe behind and by including more information about her powers foreshadowing the closing of the rift and letting her experience the sorrow of loss after she is trapped on the other side the audience is mentally prepared and informed enough to anticipate her sacrificial act and has time to care about its consequences

well thats more than enough monday morning quarterbacking for today  in a later reply ill address the very teensie tiny issues with kamalas arc which is by far the best part of the movie and eventually discuss possible solutions to the worst and most neglected part of the film darbenn",2023-11-14 00:14:03

i hope somewhere a crowd was screaming that during the movie lol,2023-11-14 23:33:28
"wasnt that just to show the relationship between monica and captain marvel which tied into the villians motive also helped people that didnt see wandavision 

plus a lot of captain marvels memories were new",2023-11-10 12:55:30
theyve gone to plaid,2023-11-10 18:00:20
i liked monica looking at kamala like she was an insane person when she said that,2023-11-10 12:32:42
i freaking love how much of an obsessed fan girl kamala was,2023-11-10 05:41:24
o captain my captain was the funniest line of the movie for me,2023-11-10 12:19:11
"honestly if it wasn’t sooooo stylistically bland i’d be inclined to say it was one of the better marvel movies in recent years

the script was a little dumb but it was a fun premise and the leads had good chemistry which is all you really need to make a worthwhile superhero flick imo it’s just a little disappointing how aggressively “paint by numbers” the filmmaking felt",2023-11-12 17:13:40
it was fantastic,2023-11-12 05:02:06
i loved that she was saying something goofy like that while captain marvel was murdering guys flying around,2024-02-09 06:08:09
im not gonna lie im a huge fan of the musical cats not the movie obviously and i recognized the song like 2 beats in i absolutely lost it to be honest i havent laughed that hard in a theater in a while i dont know why it just clicked,2023-11-10 04:02:22
as weird as this comment will be i swear i saw at least 1  on a flerken as they were walking away,2023-11-10 06:25:37
i’m with you i still don’t get why anyone would run they’re adults you can hear fury yell all over the station without a mike they have zero reason to beyond jging a scene,2023-11-15 13:07:27
four years of transition is no longer a transition endgame was last decade,2023-11-10 11:38:14
also covid messed with timelines more than people probably appreciate,2023-11-11 18:52:31
"spot on

i keep going back to shang chi in my head that was my first trip back to the movies in more than a year super excited to get a taste of normalcy again movie was well received had a breakout character and connections to lots of the old movies did well for the covid era too 

the teaser with wong suggested big implications for the rings since then nothing nada the movie could be erased and i don’t think it’d affect our “storyline”

what happened marvel you wrote the book on this shared universe thing",2023-11-14 18:06:14
it feels like the plot line for the rings ended up as the bangles,2023-11-14 01:20:06
"shang chi was a breakout star and no sequel is on the books years later let alone a return appearance didn’t wong say the rings were super special and alien did that plot merge into the ms marvel bangles did anyone notice

eternals had a world changing event and it was never followed up on has anyone seen an eternal since 

vision is back he flew away anyone gonna follow him it’s been three years and like 15 projects 

notice how none of these plots even attempt to intersect has nothing to do with the multiverse either 

this is all going nowhere and it shows",2023-11-11 01:30:52
 i knew it im surrounded by assholes,2023-11-10 05:26:49
dont you dare compare that f comedic masterpiece to this corporate garbage  spaseballs had more effort put into it than this movie did,2023-11-10 10:49:08
its mega maid she went from  to blow,2023-11-10 05:04:37
its a decent motive but the villain herself desperately needed some kind of personality to go with it,2023-11-10 04:25:12
but although she claims she wanted to save her planet she tries to steal stuff from where it can be protectedinterrupted and risking it for supposed revenge like you can take revenge later even easier probably save the planet first,2023-11-10 05:34:42
shang chi in shambles,2023-11-11 03:52:37
entire cast of the eternals be like,2023-11-11 15:29:26
same bro,2023-11-10 06:54:35
they are just now setting up young avengers when they need to be filming young avengers  the young avengers will be older than half of the old avengers by the time it launches,2023-11-12 06:16:35
cries in shang chi,2023-11-11 14:43:02
unfortunately well likely see neither of those characters again i think its safe to say every person attached to this movie is fired by monday since it underperformed the  flash movie,2023-11-11 22:07:58
dont forget ironman still has a daughter,2023-11-11 16:02:39
the actress has been cast in deadpool 3 but interestingly her character has not been confirmed — to say she may be back there as kate but also might not to say she’d play a different character,2023-11-10 12:05:52
i love that this scene was a double reference obvious one is the nick fury “i’m putting together a team” one but it’s also a callback to a great scene in hawkeye when yelena breaks into kate’s house and refers to her by her full name exactly what kamala does here,2023-11-12 14:10:07
i read that it originally was but it was moved to the end of the movie,2024-02-22 13:11:54

“oh it’s just carol” got a big laugh out of me,2023-11-13 00:45:06
exposition is fine it just needs to be interesting and sound organic not like robotic wordvomit,2023-11-12 14:48:07
thank you could tell the screenwriters did not care or respect the audience at all and just threw out a bunch of words peoples standards are so low that as long as it’s mildly “fun” they’ll be happy to cough up the money for a ticket,2023-11-15 17:37:46
i’m a dude but i’m not sure what’s girly about this movie except that the three leads are girls is that it everything else was stock standard marvel stuff,2023-11-23 08:09:32
"absolutely i liked the short run time here but it did feel like a sequel to a movie that doesn’t exist  

and that’s always kinda been the frustrating aspect of captain marvel her disappearing from her solo movie until endgame",2023-11-10 21:49:30
"we probably would have got that if a very loud group of people didn’t make it their life mission and entire identity to trash talk the first movie 

we haven’t even gotten a second shang chi and that was overwhelming positively received i feel like after endgame they were never going to make captain marvel 2 until they could deflect some of that negativity with the other characters if anything i’m glad iman vellani in the ms marvel show got a warm reception because that basically guaranteed this movie happening without even more retooling",2023-11-10 05:46:13
"honestly i think they should have done a whole movie about how captain marvel becomes the annihilator as cm2 then had this been the third would have made this one make so much more sense

i said this too my friend after the movie cm2 wouldve been her defeating the supreme intelligence and then promising to help some refugees get to safety at the end with the implication it would only be a slight detour before carol would go back to earth then we find out in the marvels the the reason she never returned was because the collapse of the kree empire just kept causing problems as the power vacuum was filled with petty warlords and other ethically questionable people and it just became a never ending quest for carol trying to clean up the mess she made when she collapsed the primary source of law and order for around 25 of the galaxy",2023-11-15 13:22:30
thats kind of a rough path though to have an intro movie a dark and dramatic movie followed by a lighthearted funny teamup movie thats kind of the route thor took and thor 2 is generally considered in the bottom of the ranking,2023-11-11 20:44:49
"yep this would have stood so much better as a film if wed had a cm2 in the middle then this was a culmination of two cm movies  ms marvel 

it also completely wastes all the setup from the first movie 

we were robbed",2023-11-15 08:46:57
"i think they should have done a whole movie about how captain marvel becomes the annihilator as cm2

you want a whole movie where all she does is fly to the kree homeworld and blow up the supreme intelligence",2023-11-12 15:42:30
ok sorry i never saw captain marvel is her destroying the ai not a flashback to her first film because ,2023-11-15 16:40:38
i kept thinking that was some d thing or something absolutely agree it should have been the second movie,2023-11-11 20:57:16
the events that led her to being called the annihilator happened in cm1 do we really need a 2nd movie just to go over what happened in the first movie again,2023-11-11 14:32:44
did her being annihilator happen in another movie or tv series or is what we saw in this all there is to it,2023-11-25 12:35:48
gotg 3 was pretty long i think i’m fine with the shorter runtimes though runtimes in these movies is like a freeway sure it gets congested but adding more lanes runtime never resolves the problem since it just fills up with more  rather than being put to good use,2023-11-10 19:57:23
shes currently got a show running on appletv set in the 60s and was in fast x i dont think her being captain marvel is stopping her doing other things,2023-11-11 17:23:59
i had the same thought and i’m thankful they decided to do that,2023-11-10 04:22:15
a few leaks from a few months ago did have that as the case the final scene was actually the postcredits seems they moved it up to give the film more of an ending,2023-11-10 06:12:39
the original cut i saw started off with kamala narrating to someone who you find out in the end is kate bishop so it made more sense than the way it played out here which did feel like more of post credit scene and not as much of an ending,2023-11-10 13:02:41
i feel comfortable enough to say it was as good as am1 or 2 at least,2023-11-11 04:25:10
" i hope word of mouth helps propel this movie past its expected forecast it deserves it

agreed i hope it pulls an elemental where it overcomes the poor marketing",2023-11-10 05:23:47
nope the reviews already in the 99 of the people are saying the movie is absolutely  as they should because well the movie was pure f garbage i could get my money back,2023-11-10 10:52:45
no we no it doesnt deserve it its a horribly written movie like all of the big reviewers are trashing this movie and hopefully it does bomb because thats entirely what a low effort garbage pile deserves,2023-11-11 01:32:18
" it deserves it

does it though the bar was in  after antman but this one was still a bottom 5 mcu movie for me",2023-11-10 20:44:54

so are those genes also the reason why she can use both bangles without exploding,2023-11-10 14:43:37
why did she need to be wearing it then wouldn’ have been safer on earth while they fought,2023-11-11 00:24:34
where does the film explain this or do we have to get this information somewhere else,2023-12-23 18:24:08
the band,2023-11-10 06:05:17
"hate to say it but i dont know if i trust taika waititi after the major tonal mistakes in thor love and thunder but like you i agree that the crazier parts are highlights here i wouldnt undersell the creativity and bonkers nature of them switching places while fighting kree which was also awesome and the team training montage

i dont really agree with your two changes either they both seem to be about making the villain less of a villain darbenn is a minor comic book footnote that is meant to be thrown away while predictable she is here basically as a religious imperialist that is angry at her  being killed shes single minded and noncompromising shes there to bring this team together further the multiverse saga and get tossed away which i think is ok common complaint of mcu villains but save the depth for the important ones thanos loki kang doom",2023-11-11 20:14:42
"darbenn takes the offer to fix halas sun because killing the last leader is what  up hala last time by causing the war they close the hole via monicas powers and then we get a scene above hala after carol fixes the sun where on carols ship darbenn meets with the leader of the two planets she messed up and agrees to work on fixing things as reparations for doing what she was mad at carol for

i really thought this is what was going to happen not to sound like a cranky man or anything but it was clear to me at some point that this movie featuring three female heroes and one female villain a whole side plot featuring cats and a musical planet where the prince is a beautiful kpop man that this movie was targeted at a female audience 

it was around then that i started thinking they would actually talk to the villain and achieve some kind of resolution rather than just killing her like they normally do and how refreshing that would be",2023-11-12 17:05:28
"it cant be this goofy the whole way it needs to conform to the generic marvel tone

definitely felt this i really wish in particular that they fully committed to the singing planet bit i was so disappointed at how it was just dropped so suddenly although hes bilingual is a great line the battle scene on that planet could have been such a blast if they had the defenders singing the whole time",2023-11-29 05:37:33
honestly agree overall i think you could honestly even still have darbenn fake out accepting the deal and then  herself overloading the jump network but have somebody or something set up in the wings like maybe establish that the beardy kree guy is clearly her no2 and not just a random advisor or something because right now its definitely feelgood in the moment that they get their sun back and i guess we just have to overlook that their atmosphere and their water were stolen from other worlds that they  over but the more you think about it if the last power vacuum triggered a civil war destroyed the planet whats to stop it from happening again now there definitely needed to be something there to show some stability,2023-11-12 02:26:07
i think youre simplifying the issue fixing the sun doesnt magically undo all of the damage and death carol had already caused the kree darbenn was blinded by vengeance which is also why the kree skrull conflict is still going on,2023-11-12 20:22:58
"my constant thought the whole time was this needed to lean into the silly  more and taika would have been a great fit for this at times it felt like it wanted to be james gunngotg but i think taika was the closer match

the music planet felt straight out of farscape and was the highlight of the movie and it get completely forgotten midway through the battle there

definitely agree a better ending would gave been talking it out actually works villain sees reason and regrets her decisions for once we get a bad guy who steps down and just says yeah i was an  sorry i want ro be better",2024-01-16 19:54:33

or it backfires

carol goes to fix the sun but she overcharges it and the sun goes supernova then hala is fully destroyed and in response darbenn launches a full scale assault on earth",2024-01-16 10:42:13
"yes this means monica doesnt get dimensionhopped

given that whole plot comes out of nowhere with no indication im pretty sure teyona parris either wanted out of the movies or her appearance contract was up and they had to explain her never appearing again",2023-11-12 06:07:32
the musical planet was incredible jesus christ i just vomited,2023-11-13 14:33:37
thank  reddit doesnt write movies your version sounds significantly worse you wanted to increase the cringey singing planet and decrease the multiversal part where monica gets stuck which is what made it stand out from the generic yay we saved the day everyone is happy now cliche ending that these movies always have,2023-11-12 04:09:03

"the singing planet is where i checked out the rest of the movie was ok the whole space station thing got edited to  for sure movie was going to great lengths to keep fury and the family somehow in the action 

still wondering if that singing planet lost all of its water plus they all speak english everywhere",2023-11-10 13:49:51
true i enjoyed the jokes,2023-11-12 19:47:42
movie has 85 audiance score on rotten tomato whats up with that,2023-11-12 03:25:38
agreed  it felt like some beats were missing i thought it was weird how casually carol reignited the sun in the end after it was briefly set up as being a potential challenge for her  plus we didn’t actually see brie in the reigniting sequence smacked of being inserted and  or edited late on also did kamala change outfits in the middle of the first fight,2023-11-12 22:38:17
its the best disney marvel show no one watched equally flawed to the marvels in some story beats but the warmth charm and family dynamic of the khans was a big highlight of both for me,2023-11-10 23:02:03
thank you been meaning to get around to it really enjoyed her rapport with her family in this,2023-11-10 04:29:45
"the show is great  i didnt expect to learn about indianpakistani history but i had no idea what partition was and i live in one of the biggest indianpakistani areas in the us

im still absolutely infuriated they messed with kamalas power set because 1 disney hates body horror and 2 they had to protect reed

you literally have multiple super soldiers in the ip canon but you cant have two stretchy people",2023-11-12 20:28:43
the show does some of the most creative ways of showing a text message conversation i ever saw as well definitely my favorite thing marvel done in a long time,2023-11-11 01:42:03
her family and friends were the best part of the show,2023-11-10 15:38:27
what does the bangle do for kamala it did something for the villain,2023-11-10 08:27:33

wouldnt she be a quarter djinn i thought it was just her grandma,2023-11-10 18:53:19
i always figured djinn were all mutants but they just took on a different name and hid in another dimension because of their powers,2023-11-10 04:23:56
more like 18th djinn her grandma would be half her mom is a quarter,2023-11-10 13:57:47
i was never too interested in the show thought it was too juvenile for my taste but after watching the movie and seeing how much charm iman has it may have changed my mind might just give ms marvel a go,2023-11-13 06:15:04
i tried the show and didnt like it at all and because of that i have no interest in the movie,2023-11-10 15:08:17
seeing her family dynamic in the movie was great loved their portions,2024-02-24 05:12:21
if someone liked quantummania i know im terrible does that mean well love this movie,2023-11-10 03:39:20
i liked it a lot more than quantummania the trio was charming and the villain and the stakes felt personal i think brie larson also got to show a lot more personality this time she’s pretty likable when she’s allowed to show some emotion,2023-11-10 07:23:03
"it reallybis like a movie straight out of phase 2 if you arent a marvel fan its a fine movie with some cool fight scenes and a couple eye rolls but if you are ia fan your enjoyment brings it up to an 8

i can confidently say it was my most enjoyable marvel movie since shangchi",2023-11-11 00:00:22
definitely had more heart than quantumania imo,2023-11-10 04:37:52
its not the worst but its one of the worst,2023-11-10 10:42:05
"quantummania was badbut this one managed to be worsesame convoluted nonengaging story and random character story arc with no pay off

so weirdhow do they decide to make this kind of movie  any amateurs would know the script and story  big time",2023-11-10 04:50:39

id rather accept a high quality film every three years than a bunch of duds every year",2023-11-12 11:43:55
i liked quantumania but i didnt like this,2023-11-12 14:50:48
quantum mania was nowhere near a dud hate to break it to you,2023-11-15 05:35:15
its in the same ball park,2023-11-15 17:56:15
even that movie made almost 3 times what this made so yeah it was a bad movie,2023-12-09 01:31:34

"its funny because the film is political in entirely different ways a united states military officer intervenes in a foreign culture toppling their government and throwing that society into chaos for 30 years that society produces an insurgent who wants revenge against the foreign invaders who destroyed her homeland somehow the same dudes because its only ever dudes complaining about how political and pandering it is never seem to have picked up on this if youre looking for a political message in this film theres a much bigger one to be found than the gender or race of the characters it goes to show that a lot of peoples media literacy begins and ends at why are there womennonwhite people onscreen

my read was different from yours the kree are established as a empire and they could be quite brutal from what i know carol basically crippled their empire when she destroyed the supreme intelligence that guided them that seems to have been ok from the pov of most of their subjects from what weve seen but it was obviously bad for the people on hala the empires capital 

to me a better real world analogy would be someone crippling the usa and ending its status as the dominant power on earth but the price is poverty and civil war for every remaining us citizen youre left asking if that price paid after the fact was worth ending their dominance 

i wish the movie had spent more time exploring that idea was destroying the supreme intelligence and crippling the kree empire justifiable in the grand scheme of things even though it lead to great suffering for the people of hala",2023-11-15 12:52:10

another thing i liked is the conversation kamala and carol have after their first meeting when carol apologises for how she spoke to kamala theres no excuses grandstanding or posturing just hey i messed up and im going to do better

"the us military interference analogy was what stood out for me in this i wish they leaned harder into that aspect with carol thinking she was a universal saviour especially with the ms marvel fangirling and fawning when the people of hella hate her for destroying their world other worlds think of her as a huge bully and the villain is a terrorist she created who is arguably in the right

do it as a deconstruction of the superman type hero who imposes their will in the name of ii am here to save you and let carol discover that being the big hero to fury also means being the villain to other societies",2024-01-16 20:02:28

besides a few places they could have transitioned better to the next scene i thought overall was a solid b tier mcu film",2023-11-11 04:06:03
i didnt even want the marvels to end that early lol it was a little short there could be 5  10min more some for carol to show off more of her emotion about how she was ashamed to monica and some to show more how darbeen became who she became and of course more screen times for the cats,2023-11-11 15:56:56
"definitely better than ds2 thor 4 and antman 3 i enjoyed it but its completely forgettable like those other 3 loved kamala they actually wrote her amazing dialogue and was incredibly acted but overall it didn make sense in the mcu 

the main issue i had was how darbenn was so powerful it was inconsistent with every other marvel film how was she able to take on captain marvel in a physical fight when thanos couldnt thanos was punching cm in endgame and she didnt feel anything darbenn was able to fist fight cm before getting powered up so if darbenn was that strong how was thanos able to rule over the kree and half the universe darbenn wouldve stopped him instantly",2024-02-11 09:05:34

the singing planet was a bit odd but it was like 5 minutes so ill let that slide the action sequences were fun and well done and it advanced all 3 stars of the movie in a positive way which many movies do not do

it also setup the xmen fantasticaly and the post credit scene was great",2023-11-10 13:02:10

"its a culmination of a lot of things i think  

first off the political climate  there has been some pandering from marveldisney  shehulk writers openly alienated the core fans of comic books males 1845 so some of those fans have kneejerk reactions and judge before knowing the whole picture

the hate on the marvels wasnt deserved there

on alison brie  shes not an alister and is expected to carry the marvel banner  thats a heavy  load and she hasnt built enough star equity to be able to easily do it  thats a tough  job

also some fans just dont like her because of things shes said in the past  someone asked for her number then she posted to live like a woman is to live in defense because someone was interested in her  

another time shes said i dont need another 40year old white man to tell me what he thinks about a wrinkle in time the movie wasnt made for him

hey its cool to want opinions of others but straight up how can people not take it as if she feels a certain type of way about them  imagine if rdj read some reviews from teen girls about ironman then says i dont need another 15 year old girl to tell me what she thinks about iron man it wasnt made for her lol",2023-11-11 23:50:34

here to see if its worth spending my money to see it now or waiting till its on disney plus,2023-11-12 09:08:02
yeah theres very little need for marvel to astroturf when they have so many fans on reddit that will watch whatever they put out on day 1 and like it sure the general public probably wont like it but they arent going to pay to watch in the first place and most people arent going to pretend to have seen something they havent,2023-11-10 09:57:55

the marvels though i mean its mid but it was entertaining i had a good time im so sad for the cast that this isnt getting better reception cos they just all seemed like they were having fun together and it was such a lighthearted romp felt like a throwback to when superhero movies were just silly fun sometimes",2023-11-11 20:07:05

my expectation is exactly what you described im gonna go in have some cheap laughs have a heartfelt moment or two spoonfed to me like im a baby and then get some easter eggs to future mcu movies 

but thats where the bar is set for mcu films these days at least for me disney is honestly putting out so much  these days that im pretty happy if its just fun i doubt theres gonna be much defense to the story other than boom boom punch punch and im ok with it",2023-11-10 15:45:54
" theres no defenses of the movies actual story dialogue directing pacing visuals etc

"story had strong potential with the aftermath of destroying the supreme intelligence and a villain with a sympathetic motivation dialogue and cast chemistry was fantastic 

carol and monica both had a lot more emotional range than in previous outings which was a relief  direction and pacing i think were likely linked pacing was my biggest complaint15 more minutes to let some sequences breathe a little more would have made it feel a little less choppy 

visuals are solid and there was some really great cinematography and interesting composition music was really great as well 

overall id say it was a breath of fresh air and id put it alongside guardians 2 age of ultron and iron man 3",2023-11-15 03:15:07

it’s probably in part that it satisfies exactly what people who want to see this movies want  the ones i’ve seen in the past few years are formulaic here’s a zany one liner so people who already like the formula and are seeing it opening day are probably going to enjoy it,2023-11-10 13:18:24

original cut of the first movie leaned in heavily to danvers queerness as was basically a big coming out metaphor disney execs 86ed it because china but there still some artifacts leftover in the theatrical release which is why the first movies kinda a mess 

larson was not particularly happy about this decision a big part of why she signed on to play carol danvers was the queernesslgbtqi representation led to a lot of behind the scenes back and forths between her and disney high ups which led to her role in infinity war being trimmed way down

because of you dont shell keep showing up in fiction  people didnt like her in the last few iterations in comics  and thats not acceptable  you have to like the characters that are given to you  and youll keep on getting her in movies comics and video games until people start liking her",2023-11-10 03:28:51

i feel like most people just have a natural contrarian streak the movie is getting terrible reviews so people feel the need to defend it but it doesnt seem like genuine enthusiasm where people will bring up how much they like it years from now the marvels will probably go down as a below average mcu film at best and bottom 3 at worst,2023-11-10 13:25:24

that’s a pretty odd reason to me like they all saw this happen to someone who was tough enough to toe to toe with them so are they really ok with risking kamala’s life like that she is pretty much physically the weakest of the three characters i would 100 expect her to be sacrificing her life if the bigbad couldn’t even do it especially when monica was telling them to hit her with pretty much the equivalent amount of energy as what caused the rift in the first place i mean also kinda iffy that monica could even channel the resulting energy herself as she wasn’t exactly kicking darbenn’s  in the fights… like in a world where the writers aren’t using deus ex machina then either she or ms marvel should have pretty much lost their life with this idea,2023-11-12 11:23:27

i want a full on mcu musical lol,2023-11-10 03:42:06
a planet where everyone sings all the time sounds like my own personal  i think they did a good job letting us have some fun with it and moving on before it got irritating,2023-11-10 03:15:15
yeah i feel like it would have been slightly better id there was one more scene for teenage girls still it is not as bad as the neckbeards want it to be,2023-11-10 03:51:30
i was annoyed by it as is can’t imagine it if went on even longer,2023-11-10 03:21:25
"missed opportunity for the main villain too giving her a quick disney villainlike song moment as she threatensattacks the aliens

or maybe ive just played too much baldurs gate 3 and feel like the fight scene couldve used a singing villain",2023-11-10 04:53:36
it didn’t really impact my viewing experience but she is noticeably the weakest part of the film and clearly just there to drive the story forward can’t fault anyone for not liking that,2023-11-12 03:53:00
"many people i’ve seen online are pretty unambiguous with their misogyny and point out the 3 female leads as the reason they think the movie sucks 

i and everyone i personally know who saw it thought it was great the story was tight and cohesive the characters had great chemistry with each other there were laughs and there were high stakes 

people talk about comic book movies now like they’re expecting the godfather the goal of comic book movies is to have fun while telling a story that makes sense this movie achieved that",2023-11-15 13:11:45
yes,2023-11-13 03:42:12
"zonked follow dam abundant  pause absorbed wrench skirt sugar

agreed that was so jarring for me,2023-11-10 11:46:45
secret invasion makes that sound like an awful idea but thank you,2023-11-10 14:36:15
so i missed the hottest scene in the movie ,2023-11-10 14:35:25
no it’s not not even close,2023-11-10 20:18:45
ah ok,2023-11-10 21:03:55
cool thanks,2023-11-11 05:23:15

is it first day estimates are lower than the flash and cinemascore rating is a b same as quantumania eternals and men in black international all huge flops

a 47m opening weekend for a movie like this is downright disastrous,2023-11-12 21:19:15
ohhhh i thought it was a portal from earth’s sun to hala’s sun seeing how villain lady’s plan was to steal earth’s sun,2023-11-12 02:45:35

never finished secret invasion and i thought the villain was emilia clarkes character,2024-01-17 10:02:32
let’s face it their contracts probably ran out,2023-11-14 05:03:18
what a waste of two talented actors utter  everytime i think about it i get angry what a waste,2023-11-20 01:09:32
did they do this in secret invasion what was the plot,2023-11-16 01:20:15
,2023-11-26 13:01:24
sam raimi is the only person involved that got the correct takeaway from wandavision then  that wanda is now a sociopathic villain,2023-11-12 06:18:05
thats the thing i never saw ms marvel and im sure a bunch of ppl didnt as well,2023-11-22 16:39:04
i dont know i have a bachelor degree in physics which granted isnt a graduate degree but nothing monica said sounded like science to me,2023-11-10 16:07:56
kinda killed me we didn’t even get his name or any of their names thrown around half this movie takes place on a space station and there are literally cosmic rays,2023-11-13 23:10:50
"especially considering she found out from the kree mind reading device that carol knew that maria was dying of cancer it would be one thing if she had been off world and found out when she got back but she knew both that maria was dying and that monica would be back when everyone else came back 

monica’s anger was wellfounded",2023-11-13 14:23:33
the speedster powers in it wasnt to bad,2023-11-14 18:25:51
i sang this in my mind a la gaston’s song in beauty  the beast,2023-11-25 01:42:16
i think there’s already plenty of reasons,2024-02-28 09:44:19
the singing is the type of thing they should’ve either been all in for if they’re going to put it in in the first place if a film is going to be weird they should embrace it,2024-02-19 14:50:48
ending felt super rushed and abrupt to me oh she got knocked into a wall which has a knife in it which falls in her sike it doesn’t matter she’s fine sike she disintegrated as soon as she put the bangles on,2023-11-26 06:29:11
yes just watched it on disney plus and im trying to figure out the plot now like monica explicitly has difficulty flying then suddenly shes good at flying,2024-02-24 21:56:37
probably due to strikes limiting their usage,2023-11-13 04:18:23
i dont think it has to do with her being a bad person rather just her being human its a very human reaction,2023-11-11 22:14:32
"she destroyed their way of life

their way of life was imperialism though the kree were conquerors who built their empire and held it together with the barrel of a gun theres a really interesting dilemma there empires can bring stability and trade and even bring people together from many different backgrounds but at the end of the day their subjects often lack the rights that many of us take for granted i doubt carol thought through the potential fallout of destroying the supreme intelligence and because of that she spent the next 30 years trying to pick up the pieces",2023-11-15 14:19:06
it doesn’t make it any less dumb,2024-02-28 09:47:07
"i was thinking this morning that it is wild that 3 movies in i still dont really feel like i know carol 

the biggest issue honestly i had with her was that she absolutely gushed confidence in avengers endgame and i wanted that carol the one who was self assured and maybe a bit cocky but instead she felt closer to how she was in captain marvel uneasy unsure confused and regretful

i understand why in the story she is confused cuz confusing things are happening but it gave little room for us to understand her 

we did at least learn why she was absent for so long she was trying to fix everyone and everything a lesson kamala also had to learn painfully 

still i just want to spend more time with her doing nonsuperhero things so i can get a feel for her as a human being",2023-11-12 12:35:12
"not it’s definitely not the cast i personally hated the story and feel that captain marvel needed more time in the oven with maybe a solo outing

i said to my friend after we got out of the cinema that carol destroying the supreme intelligence feels like the story of the sequel to captain marvel that we didnt get because of covid and that this movie is like the third movie that jumps forward 30 years to show the repercussions of that movie",2023-11-15 13:09:46
eh there’s nothing i dislike more than marvel being serious love and thunder is what they should be doing goofy fun nonsense that’s marvel’s wheelhouse not serious drama,2023-11-23 08:01:36
nah u just finished watching it and i thought it was great,2023-12-16 01:32:56
i bet she gives great helmet,2023-11-12 22:14:15
yeah but i just couldnt help but make the spaceballs comparison,2023-11-10 12:57:36
how many chapters of captain marvel fan fiction is this helping you write was another good one,2023-11-10 06:17:09
i also appreciated how monicas silent annoyance grounded those moments too so that it wasnt too cheesy,2023-11-11 00:03:55
the thing about her that makes me now want to watch miss marvel is that she never felt overly cringe there were some that nearly hit it for one the intro comic book scene almost got a little much but it stopped but she was handled fairly well i think,2023-11-10 05:49:06
oh  when it swelled to toouuuuuccccch meeeee as a white kitten drifts across the camera i lost it,2023-11-10 07:50:35
i was in tears that is 100 the perfect song for that moment such a somber song to have playing for such a chaotic moment and that’s before even mentioning the connection of the song being from cats in a scene about cats whoever came up with that idea needs a big pat on the back because that was brilliant,2023-11-10 04:42:41
aw dude same i heard the first notes and i was gone i was lightheaded i was laughing so hard,2023-11-10 14:27:57
i had that same reaction to matchbox 20 in the barbie movie i get it,2023-11-11 02:49:07
someone behind me was dying  they must have had a similar reaction,2023-11-10 20:12:25
i was cackling and everyone in my theater was laughing hard too it was a great song choice for that scene,2023-11-10 23:16:21
people in my theater were laughing so hard i couldn’t even hear the music,2023-11-12 02:13:01
yeah that got the biggest laugh from the crowd i saw it with myself included,2023-11-12 02:40:11
"and i recognized the song like 2 beats in 

middle of the second measure for me ",2023-11-14 01:53:17
i hated the musical which made the flerkin scene extra funny to me,2023-11-29 02:45:38
i saw cats opening night so the version i saw still had some of the buttholes,2023-11-10 06:28:47

it’s been delayed with covid and the strikes but they’ve confirmed they’re making it",2023-11-11 02:41:51
" shang chi was a breakout stareternals

cant use these those happened during a pandemic obviously the numbers would be low and wouldnt warranty a sequel

ision is back he flew away anyone gonna follow him it’s been three years and like 15 projects

he will get his own series called vision quest 

and you named 3 out over 50 mcu stuffmovies tv and shorts yes some properties will fail and get shelved but most teases dont end of black widow they teased thunderboltsits being made in ms marvel they teased mutants and we just saw beast in far from home they teased fury in space and we just saw that

again i will ask do you think they wont make an xmen filmi wont count deadpool 3 but a new xmen team movie",2023-11-11 06:43:36
keep firing assholes,2023-11-10 08:53:13
the fact that were calling her the villain and not her name says it all,2023-11-10 20:43:33
 but she had those cool gold teeth why who cares,2023-11-11 04:54:45
"she wants to save  the planet she just also wants revenge 

thats kinda the point shes blinded by revenge and so doesnt care what collateral she causes",2023-11-10 21:25:36
 i actually forgot about the existence of shang chi,2023-11-11 04:36:46
shang chi is the best new character introduced after endgame probably the only movie worth watching after endgame besides guardians 3,2023-11-12 00:10:01
shang chi found dead,2023-11-12 03:21:35
i think his… bangles and her bangles are related,2023-11-13 05:41:45
don’t worry shang chi’s friend who is a really good driver because she parks cars will get a spinoff disney  show shang chi will have a cameo,2023-11-13 13:25:04

but for kate bishopuntil this it was just…literally nothing",2023-11-10 07:05:26
yea bro,2023-11-11 01:54:40
i forgot about that deadpool rumor if she’s not kate then hailee is really making the nerd culture rounds between leading a transformers film arcane spiderverse and possibly 2 characters in extended mcu,2023-11-10 16:21:05
if its in a scene where kate bishop turns deadpool into an absolute arrowfilled porcupine man then thats almost worth the price of admission alone,2023-11-10 14:37:00
no she’s not she’s not in deadpool 3,2023-11-11 02:27:12
imagine she plays a villain in that movie,2023-11-10 13:57:22
he’s often screaming with music in the background which counts i guess,2023-11-10 16:08:44
you have an incredibly weak stomach makes sense considering how you regurgitate the same comments,2023-11-14 22:02:29
she even says only technically lolll its pretty well done,2023-11-11 00:29:33
but she never had a man resolve all her problems that unless you count fury helping her in the first movie,2023-11-12 03:54:39
same the do you ever come in here with good news and telling kamalas brother to keep praying then throwing in an amen as theyre in the middle of crashing got me too,2023-11-13 01:16:16
"i’m a dude but i’m not sure what’s girly about this movie except that the three leads are girls

thats enough reason for a lot of people to just tune it out same with birds of prey beyond that kamala has big fangirl energy about her theres a musical planet where we find out that one of the characters is a secret princess plus theres kittens lots and lots of cute wee kittens",2023-11-25 10:41:35
"we probably would have got that if a very loud group of people didn’t make it their life mission and entire identity to trash talk the first movie

" we probably would have got that if a very loud group of people didn’t make it their life mission and entire identity to trash talk the first movie

people still use this excuse",2023-11-13 01:20:10
ya know i figured it was a safe assumption that they could add more to the story,2023-11-12 16:27:17
nope not at all she doesnt even interact with the super intelligence she basically fends off a kree attack against earth that was led by ronan the accuser then sends her exmentor a bad kree guy back to hala to tell the super intelligence to bug off,2023-11-15 17:06:27
what she sent jude laws character back to hala with a warning for the super intelligence thats a lot different than actually blowing it up,2023-11-15 17:08:45
its all just from this movie but its known the movie had a lot of deleted scenes,2024-02-11 20:20:51
it’s like the movie wanted to get you in and out and on with your life,2023-11-10 23:21:22
counter argument i slums rather that have been an after credit scene,2023-11-10 05:10:23
the kate bishop scene was always before the credits started due to the bookended nature of kamala is narrating the entire story to kate kind of like tony stark to bruce banner in im3 only this time it was the actual end of the movie,2023-11-10 13:04:12
how could they do that when the characters are bad captain marvel is a badly written character and miss marvel is from a show that 99 of people didnt even watch,2023-11-10 10:53:57
it wont,2023-11-10 20:36:37
deadpool  well thats just lazy writing,2023-11-14 14:08:17
just using both bangles isnt what caused the exploding i wouldnt think kamala didnt try to use them to rip a hole through the multiverse,2023-11-11 23:30:17
the villain used both bangles after using the hammer staff to overload thats probably got something to do with it she was already drained,2023-11-12 01:35:01
if you look at the villain after she smashes her hammer on the bangle she gets purple veins moving across her hand it’s harming her the more she uses it this is also emphasized in the talk she has in hela were that scientist warns her she will likely die if she continues with her plan without more research to make it safe by the time she uses both it’s to much,2023-11-12 21:10:07
"i dont think she needed to wear it just that she always has

and i think the bangle would have been safer on earth is any other heroes were allowed to cross over and help protect it but since theyre all siloed when not in an obvious avengers movie",2023-11-11 03:04:49
fury asks kamala this and she explains its because they need both to make things right iirc,2023-11-11 21:24:53
from what i understood it seemed because they needed to have both there to reverse whatever the villain had done so yes they could have left it at earth but wouldve needed it eventually they werent sure just how soon they would need it so they took a risk i could argue that captain marvel could have easily traveled to earth and grabbed it considering how fast she traveled to another planet earilier in the movie but eh what do i know the rules seemed inconsistent at times to me so i stopped focusing on them and just watched the movie for what it was,2023-11-11 06:28:49
there was a line about that her mom suggested leaving it at home and kamala said she didnt want darbenn to come and attack her family to get it,2023-11-13 03:52:01
her series,2024-01-20 01:45:17
yes she heard walk like an egyptian and her mutant powers activated,2023-11-10 15:27:04
"my issue with darbenn being the way she is in this is that the movie ends with the kree losing their leader unexpectedly the very thing that caused the problem that snowballed into someone like darbenn becoming leader

the fact she isnt a big deal doesnt mean she should be relegated to never being deeper",2023-11-11 22:31:35
i argue taika showed us he didnt give a  about the mcu with how he handled the destruction of asgard then in love and thunder hes screaming it directly into the camera only hes also swimming in a giant vat of money,2023-11-20 05:35:00
waititi is a  hack marvel shouldnt touch him with a 10 ft pole,2023-11-26 05:41:18
" the battle scene on that planet could have been such a blast if they had the defenders singing the whole time

like kung fu panda 3s village defense man that was such a blast",2023-12-05 09:37:18
"did this movie just hit streaming randomly getting replies to my comments lol

id have to rewatch it to reply properly",2024-01-16 20:53:49
she will probably be back whenever whatever universe that is fox comes back,2023-11-12 22:11:35
"the skrull refugees’ home was destroyed countless skrulls died plenty of people died on the water planet and for all we know their climate is  from the ocean being drained 

but sure everyone is happy now there’s no value in the villain having the brains to see reason and not rip apart reality purely out of spite 

also i didn’t say “increase the singing planet” i said lean into the bonkers aspects of the movie and used the planet as one of multple examples reading comprehension is a learned skill 

but yes i think the multiverse aspect is actively crowbarred in at the end and it’s boring everything is “end of the universe” now",2023-11-12 16:40:17
comic book logic what else do you need,2023-11-10 17:42:51
"carol abandoned her husband and his planet to their doomed

she even helped the kree from hala by powering up the sun but they still had the stolen airatmosphere from the skrull and the water from the singers",2023-11-12 22:02:00
"agree the singing planet would be a perfectly great fun gag in a gotg movie but carols danvers married to a prince and singing and dancing 

i love kamalas family but they didnt need to be in the movie after the marvels left their house 

i still enjoyed the movie overall  but those two things were a huge distraction for me",2023-11-11 06:10:36
it is a fun movie,2023-11-12 22:02:15
because more people vote on rt than come to this sub and comment,2023-11-18 19:04:37
i guess people dont want to watch a family sitcom they want to see action tbh the amount of khan family jokes in this film were enjoyable and barely at the edge of being too much a whole show like that would be intolerable,2023-11-15 16:30:19
her interactions with her family are a core part of the show and s big reason i liked it if you liked her and them in the marvels than you will like the show,2023-11-10 22:57:31
"this comparison may draw me some ire but the show also feels fun in the way some of the friendly neighbourhood spiderman comics do 

not all avengers and massive lore but just a kid working to keep her family and neighbourhood safe",2023-11-13 05:53:13
the show is her origin story and it was very entertaining,2023-11-13 01:34:58
i will say i originally didn’t care for the show after first episode but the show gets way better after each episode watched episode 1 when it first came out and just binge watched the rest of it last week,2023-11-10 12:59:04
the show is such a visual delight when it uses doodles to express,2024-03-07 12:26:28
i knew about the partition but had no idea that bangladesh used to be a part of pakistan,2023-11-18 07:21:47
"she “stretches” but it’s not her body per se  

i learned about it through the film ghandi",2023-11-12 20:44:43
yes it was at its best when it focused on them,2023-11-10 15:48:56
"it’s a powerful object itself but her powers exist now without it 

to be honest they were a bit unclear on the subject",2023-11-10 11:58:36
yes i was just trying to say she was part djinn,2023-11-10 19:19:27
so her mom is going to put the bangle on at some point and activate her powers and become mrs marvel,2023-11-10 17:47:36
if you liked iman in the marvels id very much recommend the show,2023-11-18 19:02:40
i also recommend not watching things you dont like,2023-11-10 15:14:34
"i just… ahh another teenage coming of age story nah 

it looked fine but nah",2023-11-10 15:23:56
i liked quantumania ok it clearly has flaws but i found enough to enjoy the marvels was solid certainly nowhere near the peak of marvel but the team is fun and the humor is pretty decent id say 710,2023-11-10 03:44:33
honestly i dont get the hate for quant,2023-11-10 11:37:42
you know the answer to this its a marvel movie are you in the mood for a marvel movie then youll like the marvel movie,2023-11-10 21:27:16
id also like to know for similar disgusting reasons,2023-11-10 03:43:39
i did i liked quantummania which has a lot of problem and i loved this film which has less but still a lot of problem,2023-11-10 10:16:15
"i liked quantummania and found this movie decent i didnt care much for the singing planet and had never watched any disney shows besides wandavisionfalcon  ws the fighting and gimmicks between the three marvels was entertaining slj was good as usual the cat stuff was funny i still dont get why they changed kamalas powers from the comics especially since one piece showed how rubber powers can be done but she was still fun

the end scene was interesting although i only know kate bishop from the comics and then the xmen postcredit scene was cool though im disappointed by the lack of a second extra credit scene i guess im just an easier audience to please as i liked the dr strange movie as well",2023-11-10 23:09:49
i didn’t get the hate for that film other than the atrocious cgi paul rudd is always great jonathan majors was incredible i also really enjoyed their take on modok as i can’t imagine him working any other way in the mcu without it being so over the top,2023-11-10 09:49:50
imo yes theyre pretty similar in terms of themes humor and dialogue,2023-11-10 06:55:56
maybe do you wanna see ms marvel fangirl cause if you do youll like it,2023-11-10 19:26:13
i can confirm yes since i too am a terrible person who enjoyed quantummania i just like silly comic stuff along with serious so both films were really good to me this was fun dumb and silly,2023-11-11 04:08:52
i watched it today i loved what they did with it marvels i would say my main irk with it was pacing especially at the end i wanted the moviecharacters to have a little more time to express how they felt for what they just went through but yeah fun movie all around i wasnt disappointed,2023-11-11 06:23:19
i thought quantumania was fine but it definitely feels worse after watching this i think the vfx are better here too,2023-11-11 20:25:55
yes i enjoyed both,2023-11-13 01:33:29
"qm takes itself too seriously despite all the weird stuff going on

marvels is silly but doesnt overdo it like say love and thunder did",2023-11-15 05:01:54

"quantumania was fine people are so cynical about movies these days they want something perfect but theyll never be happy because it doesnt exist there are apparently no movies between masterpiece and  one or the other

i thought quantumania was better than the marvels i never thought id say this about a marvel movie but if anything it felt underproduced like it wasnt quite ready lots of scenes felt like they could have done with another take or three",2023-11-11 19:30:35
i liked quantumania as well like that movie i was waiting for this to get bad and that never really happened youll probably like it,2023-11-10 04:09:51
i actually liked quantumania better this movie just didnt seem to gel for me,2023-11-10 06:53:37
"quantumania has higher highs mainly kang but lower lows every random quantum realm character with 3 lines and a funny design

yes i think you will just watched it tonight i really liked it might be a little bias cuz i love brie but i never watched ms marvel and i was impressed how charming iman portrayed the character she definitely made the movie more fun to watch the trio was good,2023-11-13 06:13:20
"its a pretty standard marvel movie nothing amazing decently entertaining if youre not expecting much

i went with no expectations and thought it was ok a few cool sequences  shots a few small laughs mostly not that memorable though

i dont normally like brie larson that much but she was good and looked great actually never saw ms marvel but iman vellani i liked

cant compare it to quantumania cause it was totally forgettable and i dont remember it at all lol",2023-11-13 06:18:32

and kelsey was perfectly okay with the makeup 10 years ago when he played beast he had barely any more screen time there than he apparently does here also i guess in a decade he changed his mind the only other guess i have is that they either didn’t have him for enough time to get him in the makeup chair for that scene or they just wanted to cut corners and didn’t think it was worth doing so they just put him there and went “we’ll fix it in post”,2023-11-10 10:57:48

 at no point did i feel they were making a point of having it female and minority led it all just came across as completely natural

i felt similarly about transformers rise of the beasts the cast simply wasnt white lol

it really goes to show you how political means people who dont look like me onscreen its like people who complain that star wars is too political now when the first film was heavily pulling from the then recent war in vietnam most popcorn flicks are political in some way either by function of them being about a soldier cop cia agent or intentionally the lethal weapon movies are some of the most aggressively politically charged goofy action flicks ever yet that doesnt seem to register either if a film only seems radical to you because of who is in it and not what it is saying then i dont know what to tell these types,2023-11-10 19:59:08

surely having a fun little superhero film featuring women leads is in its own silly little way feminist its not barbie where its spelling out the big talking points of the movement and struggles of women but if feminism is at its core trying to advocate for equality of the genders and women can lead in their own blockbuster popcorn flick then it has succeeded in its that surely,2023-11-11 11:04:16

"thats the word id use to describe 95 of the mcu regardless of phase wouldnt really describe the original ant man captain america or iron man movies as anything more than fun the original appeal to me was just that they were fun goofy action movies with interesting characters and at the time it was still sort of relatively new to see comic book stories adapted for the big screen

a few mcu films went well beyond the fun label and accomplished something more interesting and original and the buildup of the big storyline leading to the thanos movies was really cool 

but describing them as fun feels like nothing new imo most of them have always been that way",2023-11-15 13:47:10

but see its not ragnarok had a consistent tone it was light and funny and even hela as an antagonist wasnt taken as seriously cause we knew thor would defeat her in the end   


love  thunder is very tonally inconsistent   
you have thor goofing around and destroying stuff he destroys new asgard and that city at the start of the movie  
and you have jane and her cancer which tries to be serious and fails   
and then gorr who is verryy serious and in a better movie wouldve been well used

"that sounds like a lot of bs 

first off she wasnt in infinity war that came out before the first cm film came out infinity war june 2018 and captain marvel march 2019 endgame was the one she in and the issue there is endgame was mostly filmed in 2017 concurrently with captain marvel there were reshoots in 2018 so theoretically that is when the role trimming could have occurred and there was a lot of back and forth about how captain marvel was filmed without a clear shooting script so it makes sense some early ideas such as carol being  might have been cut since it didnt really matter to the final plot at all 

could larson and disney execs had a falling out about how the character was written overall sure i buy that but pointing it all on some  aspect that is not even in the final product seems like a massive stretch by someone with an agenda 

i think its more likely the character was just a mess from an overall writing perspective which is on screen and holding back bries natural chemistry which made her upset and the character fall flat for audiences",2023-11-10 19:09:24

that literally is the reason thats where the blame lies",2023-11-10 17:58:14
"yeah blame chaypek for pushing out more content without hiring more staff 

all the youtube critics on here pedantically talking about vfx shots or other criticisms can squarely put all the blame on the drop in quality onto chaypek because that and covid to be fair are the reasons for a drop off in quality 

accept that move on its just popcorn movies not the end of the world",2023-11-10 18:02:30
"marvel is popcorn entertainment not 
 
the  out of here with that kind of snobbery dude",2023-11-10 06:05:03
"you’re emphasizing the fighting portion of it which wasn’t the highlight but rather an afterthought everything that led up to it was an attempt to build an emotional stake and it fell flat because the characters up until that point were snarky sarcastic immature etc the whole movie was intended to lighthearted and “fun” as evidenced by all the other user reviews but to somehow still maintain a serious overtone

the characters fell flat because they were too juvenile kamala khan or they were emotionally masculine female superheroes few people can relate even the old school charlie’s angels has more relatability than this movie",2023-11-15 21:16:08
hey at least you watched it  you get the right to complain   what didnt you like,2023-11-11 22:01:54

i absolutely dont like everything marvel puts out saw it yesterday and liked it what an absurd generalization,2023-11-10 20:12:54
hmm i definitely dont love everything marvel puts out i do love the comics so im still slightly biased phase 1  2 had a lot of mediocre stuff eternals was horrible secret invasion was the most bring show ive forced myself through the marvels was a blast,2023-11-10 21:57:43
"i was extremely disappointed in lt i hated ant man quantumania and i usually love anything paul rudd is in secret invasion basically killed any hope i had of the mcu getting better i thought the first captain marvel film was just ok but i really like captain marvel from the comics and i wanted to see what they were going to do here i had low expectations it was a pleasant surprise not exactly movie of the year and way too much was edited out but it was just a good time imo the chaos really felt like a comic book movie should

edit i mean ant man quantumania loved the first ant man film",2023-11-11 19:53:02
ooh i will saygive 5 a go from then on fast and furious really go bonkers and i now watch it sheerly for the sheer lunacy because it is hilarious it is absolutely unhinged and they really start to lean into the fact that the film is insane where they just progressively just keep doing wilder and wilder  its a pure comedy for my husband and me,2023-11-11 19:57:08
astro turfing is real,2023-11-10 12:57:00
were talking about disney here,2023-11-10 17:19:57
haters going to hate i havent seen one person say that a lot of people have said they had low expectations and liked it and i think thats because reddit has generally acted like it was going to be the worst movie of all time and it was pretty good when your expectations are 0110 and it ends up being closer to a 510 at worst imo then a lot of people are going to say it was fine and exceeded their expectations,2023-11-10 18:19:43

" 85 audience on rt

after day 1 when only said superfans who i used to be one of will have seen it expect that figure to go down heavily when the normies roll in",2023-11-11 15:27:52
it was lower and then all of a sudden it jumped to where it is now in like an hour  if you look at the top critics on rt they all disliked it,2023-11-13 15:37:52
" then he has the audacity to turn to the next person and reveal he hasnt watched any of them

"i find it hilarious once the thread gets a little bigger people start coming in and downvoting our comments because obviously everything marvel now is bad

fam i did not like quantumania i thought love and thunder had potential but they  it up guardians 3 was pretty good the marvels i actually had fun

if you think i got paid man i wish if you think im an mcu fanboy for seeing it early nah i just like watching movies and this is a big movie thats started its showing

if you cant believe that then maybe youre the problem again  forbid we have a different opinion and i actually had a good time",2023-11-10 08:21:23
still haven’t gotten my soros bucks and now apparently i’m being paid by disney too once the money actually shows up i’ll be set,2023-11-11 13:04:07
"you sound defensive

relax if youre a fanboy of marvel or star wars or whatever disney products thats fine you do you",2023-11-10 17:32:09
"people get very sensitive with marvel same with fast and furious movies there are sooooo 
many average movies out there that people enjoy but because they don’t get the popularity or box office of marvel they won’t get talked about as much it’s like people are offended someone could enjoy something lighthearted for 2 hours

marvel has obviously struggled postendgame but your average viewer will probably still find the movies entertaining spiderman will always hit guardians 3 and shangchi were good to me then you get stuff like eternals love and thunder or quantumania which are meh at least to me

even with all the hate and bad reviews this movie will still probably make half a billion box office at least and have its own fandom that just bothers people for some reason",2023-11-10 12:47:10

"lol kids have a such such attention spans now so theyll like whatever you put i nfront of their faces if the thing has flashing lights the movie was a complete dumpster fire to anyone with a fully developed brain kamalas actress was the only one in this movie to put any sort of effort into this movie while the two others felt like theyd rather be somewhere else thats how little effort they put into acting theres too many jokes in the movie i mean 10 minutes after captain marvel fails to protect the planet she likes shes joking like a ton of innocent people didnt just die and then theres the fact that the villain was the worst of villain in marvel history like shes just a complete nothing character

its not even a movie its a disney plus show that they turned into a 2hour movie but then cut about 30 to 40 movies out of to make it less than 2 hours",2023-11-10 13:11:15
he describing what everybody describes every other superhero box office flop which is what this movie is going to do its going to flop hard because its objectively bad they never mentioned the story being good the writing being good the villains being good these people only turn their brain off and go movie had pretty colorful flashing lights so i had fun thats because if they know if they thought about it they would have to admit the movies bad,2023-11-12 14:27:07
" not op but  i really like your question regarding the 10 scale to me the 10 scale is 5 being average

its honestly a real problem on movie reviews and movie discussion sites it personally one of my pet peeves i dont know what scale gets used but lets come up with a universally accepted scale

if they want a school grade then they should say af

the marvels was a mediocre movie for me or maybe even worse better than thor4 at parts but bad in different ways 410

no i think he did not  if 60 of the audience for the marvels are male when 51 of the population are female they are stating that males do not care it is led by women  my  every fan boy in the world loves aliens and it has a female lead  i just do not understand why people say mens fault  in the original cpt marvel my wife and youngest daughter were so bored they left not even half way through it  was that because they are insecure guys or because the movie was boring,2023-11-13 16:46:50

you should definitely watch at least the first two episodes theyre probably the best marvel thing on disney besides the criminally underseen moon girl and devil dinosaur by episode 3 though the main plot starts to kick in and it just isnt quite as much fun after that",2023-11-10 13:11:49

the villain could have been done a bit better but i felt like we got about the right amount of the marvels",2023-11-15 02:18:39

but you are right that it is a lot of backstory that is left to the audiences imagination i just think marvel made the strategic decision to not show the kree civil war get back to some stability and then hopefully flesh out more interesting emperors like dorrek",2023-11-12 00:07:28

"right its whole mass displacementpocket universe thing

the whole point and marketing of kamala is oversized fists  its like an iconic image of her in comic books  the basic idea is that were all weirdly uncoordinated in our teens

paul rudd is always entertaining despite the rest of the movie being pretty pointless,2023-11-10 04:04:24

these are the same incels that watched endgame and wouldn’t stop complaining about how the female fan service scene was too immersion breaking in a movie where every other scene was fan service,2023-11-10 13:43:33
she is at the point in the film where every time she shows an ounce of emotion her handler tells her to knock it off shes been conditioned to be a stoic robot who does what the supreme intelligence says and to never question anything or have a mind of her own,2023-11-10 22:18:17
thats the point at that point in the film shes still breaking out of her conditioning,2023-11-10 21:06:18
she doesnt beat the guy up in the actual cut of the film she only takes his motorcycle taking vehicles for the sake of the mission is something captain america and other heroes do all the time apparently people keep parroting she beat the guy up because there was a deleted scene,2023-11-10 22:19:53
they just dropped it in color recently,2023-11-13 14:48:43

"you replied to the other poster by pointing out people like different things  my reply to that was to point out that with the marvels that logic frequently isnt extended to people who dont like it as they are routinely referred to as misogynistic or hateful if they point out the myriad issues that movie has i was on another platform and i pointed out among other things how obvious the multiple rewrites were as the movie is a narrative shambles and how absolutely awful the cgi looks immediately got tagged with typical basement dwelling male hating on a movie with empowered female leads  this despite the fact i never actually mentioned the  of the leads in my entire critique ive seen this happening over and over people like different things but unless audiences fall into line and declare they like this apparently theyre sexist and toxic so  yeah directly relevant to your comment in that it demonstrates the hypocrisy behind the sentiment in this particular instance

" why would larson sign up because of the queerness of it

assuming its true in the first place the filmmakers probably made the decision to go that route before she even signed on the screenwriters were announced in 2015 and larson wasnt publicly linked with the part in the trades or officially unveiled until 2016 adaptations arent always completely faithful and afaik larson has never indicated that she was a fan of the character beforehand so she probably doesnt have any particular attachment to the source material they could have written a coming out draft that she liked and was the impetus for signing on and then later the studio made them cut that stuff",2023-11-11 21:23:13

"yes and thats what i mean by valid criticism as you point out there are very real factors involved in the mcus quality going down

the movie retained it and i enjoyed how the entire family was sprinkled in throughout the film the mom
and bro are hilarious and stole their respective scenes

the fight scenes here was super fun and very creative with the jump tag teaming  

kamala being that crazed fangirl was cute and her face and  expressions stole entire scenes despite her two costars being in the same scenes she’s a great addition and she looks to be the first of the “young avengers” which is exciting",2023-11-15 18:01:48

"two things can be true 

marvel doesnt spend enough money and time on their full cg character sequences it also makes no sense to put that much effort into a post credits scene only character 

counterpoint i would use is thanos he didnt look great in avengers looked just  okay in guardians of the galaxy but in infinity war and engame looked great 

i think the way marvel produces movie is to blame they shoot a lot and then put the movie together in post production and a lot of the cg scenes change dramatically throughout that process 

movies like dead mans chest had a lot of preproduction work going into their characters an actual shooting script that reflected the final film etc they knew enough they could have specific lighting references and such on set they probably did a ton of testing and reworking for their target result 

cg is a chisel you can plan ahead and iterate on a single work to get a michaelangelo or you can just go ham and make a bunch of  quickly marvel seems much more content with the latter",2023-11-12 12:54:21

he is on another level yes but he is also in that very sweet spot where he could lead a team of younger heroes for 2 reasons 

1 he is of the same generation as them remember he just graduated high school hes a few years older than kamala and possibly younger than kate or shuri
2 he has fought with teh avengers before so he knows how they work he worked with iron man and dr strange already hes also worked with other spidermen so hes pretty capable working in a team and leading it

i have no love for carol danvers and her portrayal in the mcu didnt feel good captain marvel 1 was carried by samuel l jackson imo she appeared in end game at the final fight after not being in the film at all except for the beginning and she seems overly smug and powerful for no real reason i dont know where this confidence and attitude came from someone else said it earlier but it felt like brie larson phoned it in for the marvels it felt like captain marvel was 3 different people in 2 different movies

i also dont care for kamala khan i wanted the mcu to age with its audience but instead they are pulling in kidteen heroes to cater bring in a younger audience maria rambeau was fine i guess shes probably my least hated  this movie i hated the dance musical planet but i hate musicals just in general nick fury didnt tie in his experience from secret invasion at all it makes it so you can delete secret invasion from the mcu all together because it doesnt matter",2023-11-13 19:36:54

 however while some people believe logan takes place in its own continuity especially after it seemed jackman confirmed the rumors by saying the film took place in a slightly different universe shortly before its release logans place in the xmen timeline has been confirmed by mangold according to the director jackmans love letter to wolverine takes place approximately five years after the conclusion of xmen days of future past around the year 2029 while there are small differences between the films respective worlds mangold wanted to keep the established continuity while still having the creative freedom to say a proper goodbye to wolverine thus deciding to end wolverines story within the days of future past timeline

"thats true as well its the reason a lot of episodic television has consistency issues that comes from the challenges of writing something in an serialized format writing with gaps in production and awareness to audience response will shift sometimes without regard to the internal logic of the story being told 

with comic books though having to adjust to these issues doesnt necessarily lower their quality since the focus isnt on those elements its always been about character visuals originality and scope this is why it annoys when people try to apply logic to a genre that has no interest in it",2023-11-10 07:11:34

"except that in this case the drop in quality literally comes down to chaypek increasing the output of marvel while not giving them the staff to adequately manage said output 

you cant just look at singular flops i mean you can but in a case like this especially when the root cause is they dont have enough people making the projects and they werent given enough time

those are institutional failures and shouldnt be dropped at the feet of the creatives working on them 

the only project i personally had a problem with was secret invasion that was horrible everything else was acceptable or just didnt work eternals falcon and the winter soldier in those latter cases thats okay im happy theyre experimenting with different show formats or testing things to see if people would like them i just wish they had the time to get things correct instead of dumping out a bunch of mostlydeveloped ideas 

that was the big failure to me 

covid they cant control that and they had to relearn how to shoot movies during that time so i personally give a big leeway for those projects but i can understand why other people wouldnt do that",2023-11-10 18:31:56

"  id give a 10 to black panther 1 infinity war end game spiderman no way home gotg 1 and maybe more

thats a perfect score i like the mcu but none of them are perfect

and she seems overly smug and powerful for no real reason

because she is she single handle take out a ship and  slaps thanos around pretty sure she is powerful

and she shouldnt have been in endgame much endgame is a swan song for og avengers not a focus on new heroes

i dont know where this confidence and attitude came from 

because she is marvel version of superman why wouldnt she have confidence and attitude im not a fan of op heros but that is the character

someone else said it earlier but it felt like brie larson phoned it in for the marvels

i dont see that she is actually humanized in the film  she gave more of a performance than ever before

i wanted the mcu to age with its audience but instead they are pulling in kidteen heroes to cater bring in a younger audience

this seems odd the franchise isnt allowed to grow it audience the main focus is on a 30ish year old and there is another 30ish year old but a teen isnt good  kamala khan was the best part of this film and im 46

nick fury didnt tie in his experience from secret invasion at all it makes it so you can delete secret invasion from the mcu all together because it doesnt matter

how is that not a good thing secret invasion is they only mcu product i would call out right bad lets forget that as soon as possible

this reads as if you are a mcu fanboythere is nothing wrong with that like what you like the problem there is a normal trait of fanboys is to over praise quality and vastly exaggerate flaws your own score has it 1 point under average thats not close to hate levels",2023-11-13 20:02:27

"ok i said “that’s on them” a few too many times but if someone likes a bad movie they should be able to acknowledge that they like it even if they understand it is not good

let’s take the leprechaun series no one is suggesting that those are “good” movies especially not objectively but they can say they like them and they can even say that they like them more than other movies while knowing they are not good movies ya

think about a movie that is “objectively good” and when you compare that to a movie that is “controversially goodbad” can you really say that the controversial movie is “objectively good”

there will always be people that dislike “objectively good movies” in the same way that people will always like “objectively bad movies” but it’s the people who can be honest about both that will help move us forward

“i like an objectively bad movie”

“i hate an objectively good movie”

classic example is optimus prime took 30 weeks to create his model and 10000 computing hours to render him into the movie 

yeah the rendering takes “longer” but supercomputers designed for this job can speed up that computing time tremendously the advantage of advances in hardware 

but the model design process is done by humans not computers and remains a time consuming and thus expensive process this is why there’s so much pressure for directors to stay “on model” it’s significantly more expensive if their characters change shape than if they change costumes",2023-11-10 19:25:29

the only reason i go to the movies is if its for a superhero movie marveldcsony spiderverseetc

my advice for people who want to see this movie is to wait for streaming thats not a good look for mcu movies in general

not the worst advice

people will forget about this by the time the next mcu movie hits and makes 1 billionand it will

im currently watching the boys and its great

it is very good

i can only imagine what the mcu could do if they had the level of violence graphic content and story that the the boys currently has

well the next film is going r

violence and graphic content dont mean better film marvel just needs to slow down stop with the never ending content just have 2 films a year and 23 disney shows start going quality over quantity

 just to be clear you only go to the theater to see cbms

yup only cbms there was some one offs a few years ago when i was into godzilla but i think its better to watch them on streaming i did watch sonic 2 in theaters because i was following a movie podcast for a while i wanted to watch it asap so i could listen to the podcast episode the podcast is over and done with so i probably wont do something like that again

  nothing like oppenheimer mission impossible or john wick

absolutely not i wouldnt even watch those if they were on free streaming platforms i saw the first john wick and was bored out of my mind i need some kind of hi fantasyscifi in most of the content i consume i watch movies and tv to escape reality i tried to watch the irishman but i had to do it in multiple sittings and ultimately didnt finish it because it was so boring

i do watch other kinds of movies and tv in 2022 my favorite movie i saw was probably prey on hulu i did also watch the menu and eeaao the menu is probably a contender for my top movie of 2022 but its a very different movie than prey so its hard to compare i recently watched the bear and monk for tv shows im not exclusive to comicbook content

 just have 2 films a year and 23 disney shows start going quality over quantity

agree with the films they should have never done the tv shows its too much and tv is always of lower production quality than movies sure maybe some heroes need a multiepisode series to tell their story but i havent been happy with any of the tv show yet plus i dont want to pay for disney 

 but a blade film will be r but that doesnt mean they also cant have a young avengers series on disney

but thats not making it think of it like this if you hired a design company for a logo they make it but you would have final say but you didnt actually make it someone else did marvel made the film sony just gave them a thumbs up every once in a while",2023-11-13 06:39:54

"how does it not  if men and men over 25 is the majority of the audience does it not prove that men will see a movie led by women  why are women not going to see this movie  why is that  is it because it is led by women or the movie did not look good to them  that last line is why we are not going plus the whole them leaving the first one  i thought the wife might want to since we liked ms marvel her mostly the show itself was only so so

it is like you expect everyone to go see this movie regardless of whether it looks good to them or not  i am a huge flash fan so i went to see it  it was bad and i was not surprised or  about people  the movie was not great it had spots and believe it or not the wife and kids liked it  i thought for sure she would leave",2023-11-14 20:16:05

ok we are talking past each other  i went and saw the flash and it was not a good movie  not because of superwoman she was fine or batman he was awesome  it was bad special effects and the story was only soso  people have a right to not like a movie,2023-11-14 21:08:37

"both

the difference is the people they hire are working for them not sony lets say the costume designer  is a marvel studio employee so a marvel employee is doing it

again sonys top boss clearly said they were using marvel prosses why are you questioning this",2023-11-13 18:45:23

"marvel doesnt have a costume designer they hire someone for that for spiderman sony hired someone for that with input from marvel thats just how it worked why are you questioning this

looking at the costume designer specificslly for spiderman homecoming he worked on a few marvek movies and a few sony movies both before and after being hired",2023-11-13 18:49:10
" marvel doesnt have a costume designer they hire someone for that

yes and when they hire them they are working for marvel

for spiderman sony hired someone for that with input from marvel

no marvel did that marvel was the production company for the spidey mcu films not sony

read this specifically the devlopment part 

key parts  emails between sony pictures entertainment cochairman amy pascal and president doug belgrad were released stating that sony wanted marvel studios to produce a new trilogy of spiderman films while sony retained creative control marketing and distributionthats marvel making itproduce and sony distribute it 

and marvel studios would explore opportunities to integrate mcu characters into future spiderman films which sony pictures would continue to finance distribute and have final creative control over again nothing about sony actually producing the film

why are you questioning this

because marvel made the film for sony",2023-11-13 19:09:58
